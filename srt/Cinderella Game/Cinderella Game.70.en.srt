1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,710
(Episode 70)

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,290
You're the very person...

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:17,490
who killed my parents
and destroyed my family's happiness.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,590
Ms. Goo, you are
rather harsh and cold-hearted.

8
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,660
You pretended that you thought
of Eun Chong as your own,

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,530
like you'd do anything for him,

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,270
but you turned away from him
right before his eyes.

11
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,270
He's in grave condition
because of you.

12
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,410
Because of me?

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,080
He left home
because you refused to meet him.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,310
Even now, he almost got into
an accident trying to follow you.

15
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,450
How will you take responsibility?

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,720
Not only do you frame me
for the fake daughter scheme,

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,060
but you also blame me
for Eun Chong leaving home...

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,860
and following me.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,460
Are you not at fault in any way?

20
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,670
You stopped him from seeing me...

21
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,570
when he came to my place.

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,900
And you turned me away every time...

23
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,440
when I went over to meet him.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,740
I gave you what you wanted.
Do you not like it?

25
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,450
Is this your revenge or something?

26
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,220
You don't know
what real revenge looks like.

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,150
You'll find out soon,
so look forward to it.

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,590
You'll regret this.

29
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,490
No, you'll regret this.

30
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,300
Do you have to do this to Eun Chong
only because of the mental hospital?

31
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,000
- "Only because?"
- I could've gotten rid of you...

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,600
a long time ago.

33
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,530
What's the big deal
about a mental institution?

34
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,270
So, you must even kill people.

35
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,740
Shut up. How dare you slander me?

36
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:46,080
Slander? You killed my parents.

37
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,850
Do you think you're something
just because Eun Chong wants you?

38
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,950
How long do you think
he'll want you?

39
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,280
He thinks of you as his mom now,

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,220
but once he grows up,
he'll forget all about you.

41
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,590
Are you anxious
because I may really become his mother?

42
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,030
What is this nonsense?

43
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,070
That place is not for anyone.

44
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,100
You can't be his mother,
not even in your next life.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,210
Did you say the biggest misfortune
of your life was...

46
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,480
meeting Du Na and raising Eun Chong?

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,680
I'll make that come true.

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:25,520
You'll end up groveling before me.

49
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,890
You're someone who cannot be...

50
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,360
Eun Chong's grandmother.

51
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,390
There may be a way...

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,860
for you to take advantage of him
in a way only you can.

53
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,930
Fine. I'll take advantage of Eun Chong...

54
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,600
in a way only I can.

55
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,140
The one thing that'll hurt you the most.

56
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,670
The one thing you'll mourn over the most
when you lose it.

57
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,310
I'll take that from you.

58
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,520
Eun Chong, take your shoes off
before you come inside.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,990
Goodness, Eun Chong.
Did you meet Auntie Ha Na?

60
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,760
My gosh.

61
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,660
Eun Chong!

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,500
You should go.

63
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,300
Eun Chong.

64
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,340
Did he not meet Goo Ha Na?

65
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,810
She refused to meet him. It's over.

66
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,650
She loved him so dearly.
Why has she suddenly changed?

67
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,520
Eun Chong went back into the closet.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,650
What should we do now?

69
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,590
He'll start school soon, too.

70
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,770
My gosh. What's this sound?

71
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,940
Eun Chong, stop that.

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,710
Stop it. Okay?

73
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,270
It's all your fault, Grandma.

74
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,480
Why won't you let me meet
Auntie Ha Na?

75
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,610
- I hate you, Grandma.
- Eun Chong.

76
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,220
You can't do this, Eun Chong.

77
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:10,150
- Eun Chong. Eun Chong?
- My gosh.

78
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,830
Eun Chong.

79
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,930
- Eun Chong.
- Eun Chong.

80
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,760
Eun Chong, stop that.

81
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,600
Grab him.

82
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:24,370
- My gosh.
- Eun Chong, my goodness.

83
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,340
Goodness, Eun Chong.

84
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,440
Eun Chong.

85
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:32,310
Eun Chong.

86
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:35,250
You'll take advantage
of Eun Chong? How?

87
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,750
I'll use his depression
as an excuse...

88
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,450
and make an offer
to be his live-in babysitter.

89
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,090
You're going back
to Chairwoman Shin's place?

90
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,090
Ha Na, she was someone who tried
to lock you up in a mental hospital.

91
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,460
You don't know
what she'll do under the same roof.

92
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,130
No, it's dangerous.

93
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
I'm not the same Ha Na as before.

94
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,240
I won't let her get me that easily.

95
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll get the revenge.

96
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,840
You stay out of this.

97
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,880
You said you'd let me join you
if I could use Eun Chong in this.

98
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,410
No.

99
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,280
He's Chairwoman Shin's weakness.

100
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,350
We need to take advantage of him.

101
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:14,890
What's your plan
once you get in there?

102
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,720
Eun Chong is the most precious one
to Chairwoman Shin,

103
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,160
so I'll take him from her
in a way only I can.

104
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,660
Goo Ha Na refused to see Eun Chong.

105
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,200
It looks like
the two are completely over.

106
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,300
- Really?
- Yes.

107
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,700
She gave up on her own.

108
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,340
Anyway, what if
Eun Chong's condition worsens?

109
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,540
I don't think
I can take good care of him.

110
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,480
Just pretend to do it.

111
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,710
We'll hire an expert
to look after him.

112
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,980
If we are going to find someone,
do it quickly.

113
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,350
Why don't you
register your marriage first?

114
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,590
You can start the adoption process
only after you do that.

115
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,830
Jin Goo wouldn't do that.

116
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,400
He's marrying me reluctantly
after trying to call it off.

117
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,230
That's true.

118
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:03,270
He's marrying you to let Ha Na
and Eun Chong meet once a week,

119
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,340
but he can't call it off
even if they refuse to meet.

120
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,270
He must feel devastated. Let him be.

121
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,980
He's getting punished.

122
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,350
Once I adopt Eun Chong,

123
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:16,680
I'll take custody...

124
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:18,250
even if we divorce.

125
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,020
Are you going to start a war
over his custody?

126
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:24,120
To Chairwoman Shin,
Eun Chong is her blood,

127
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,490
but to Se Young and her mom,
he's the only key to take Hyesung.

128
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,660
I'll make them anxious by showing
that I can always take him away.

129
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,530
Then, they'll crash down
on their own.

130
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,400
You'll use Eun Chong...

131
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,400
as a means to break up that family?

132
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,740
Yes.

133
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:46,080
But will Chairwoman Shin
accept you gladly?

134
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,150
She'll have to say yes
to save her grandson.

135
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,020
Ha Na.

136
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,490
If you take his custody,

137
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,160
you'll end up
raising our enemy's blood.

138
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,190
And we'll take Hyesung, too.

139
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll consider Eun Chong later.

140
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,900
I'll focus on the revenge for now.

141
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,230
Are you sure?

142
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,500
This is the only way
I can get revenge.

143
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,210
When will you begin?

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,010
Eun Chong's first day of school is
coming up in a few days.

145
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,610
I'll go on that day
and seal the deal.

146
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,050
There was something
I once said to Chairwoman Shin.

147
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,760
That she'll lose everything...

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,030
that is the most precious to her.

149
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,330
- Let's make that happen.
- Okay.

150
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,930
I'll take charge
of intel from Yoon Se Young.

151
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,730
Let's share the information.

152
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:45,770
Okay.

153
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,610
Don't smile. It's a rough journey
until we get our revenge.

154
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,880
No rain, no flowers.

155
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,020
No rain, no flowers.

156
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,890
I don't want to go to school.

157
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,830
Then, what else are you going to do?

158
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,030
I'm going to go to Auntie Ha Na!

159
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,230
She went abroad.

160
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,940
Eun Chong, today is
the first day of school.

161
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,470
No, I don't want any friends.

162
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,240
You'll have fun
when you meet new friends there.

163
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,110
Yes, Eun Chong. Let's go to school
in this awesome uniform.

164
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,220
Who is it?

165
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,390
Ms. Goo Ha Na.

166
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,460
Auntie Ha Na?

167
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,470
Open the door.

168
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,300
Are you really Auntie Ha Na?

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,600
Yes, it's me.

170
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,170
Auntie Ha Na!

171
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,440
He's the blood of your enemy!

172
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,440
What brings you here?

173
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,050
Today is his first day of school.

174
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,120
- Let's go to school, Eun Chong.
- Okay.

175
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

176
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,540
I need to use you
until I finish my revenge.

177
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,170
Auntie Ha Na,
did you return from abroad?

178
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,380
No, I missed you too much,
so I didn't go.

179
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,510
You must've been sad.

180
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,680
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,220
So, can we meet now?

182
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,990
Yes, we can meet...

183
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,420
whenever we want to.

184
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,660
You didn't abandon me, did you?

185
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,000
Of course not.

186
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,570
Now, shall we go and have fun
at the entrance ceremony?

187
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,630
Okay!

188
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,740
You look great.

189
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,810
It looks like
she's planning to see him again.

190
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,270
Which tune
were we supposed to dance to?

191
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,310
But she'll help
with Eun Chong's depression.

192
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,180
It's like playing cat and mouse,

193
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,320
but it'll be a good thing
if Eun Chong gets better.

194
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,060
Eun Chong, you look wonderful
in your uniform.

195
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,660
You look like a young gentleman.

196
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,760
I'll drop him off at the school.

197
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,100
We can discuss the details later.

198
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,300
Jin Goo and Se Young will be there
as his parents, so go with them.

199
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,710
I'm going with Auntie Ha Na.

200
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,110
She'll go with you.

201
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:14,580
I want to go with just Auntie Ha Na.

202
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,250
Eun Chong, Mr. Hwang and I are
your future parents,

203
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,350
so we have to go with you.

204
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,690
No.

205
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:24,820
Eun Chong, all your friends
will come with their mom and dad.

206
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,890
What if you're the only one
who has no parents?

207
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,660
I just need Auntie Ha Na.

208
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,690
So?

209
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,900
You two can go.

210
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,270
Please drive us, Ms. Jang.

211
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:43,010
- Do that.
- Yes, ma'am.

212
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,480
Let's go.

213
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,950
Are you sure you can
let him go alone with Goo Ha Na?

214
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,990
Ms. Jang is going with them.

215
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,090
Should we follow them in secret?

216
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,290
You two can go to work.

217
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,590
(We invite you to Hwang Jin Goo
and Yoon Se Young's wedding.)

218
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,300
Are they marrying in just a month?

219
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,830
That's a month earlier
than the initial date.

220
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,940
Ms. Yoon is having
a shotgun wedding.

221
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,570
Whoa!

222
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,270
- It's a shotgun wedding?
- Yes.

223
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,780
Goodness.

224
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,410
Congratulations on your wedding,
you two.

225
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,580
We received the invitation.

226
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,280
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

227
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,090
Thanks.

228
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:38,600
Why is Ha Na going to the ceremony
even though we're his parents?

229
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,230
And what was that red suit?

230
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,170
Does she think she's Wonder Woman?

231
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,970
She was Wonder Woman today.

232
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,800
She did something no one could do.

233
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,540
Taking Eun Chong
to the first day of school?

234
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,640
Why did she come today of all days
to play Eun Chong's mom?

235
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,210
- It's like she's declaring a war.
- We'll find out soon enough.

236
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,180
We heard there were people
who slandered the chairwoman...

237
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,990
during Mr. Goo's inauguration...

238
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,590
and when she received
the death portrait frame.

239
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,830
- Yes.
- Have you heard anything else?

240
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,560
No.

241
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
- Why do you suddenly ask?
- It's nothing.

242
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,000
I couldn't stop Ha Na.

243
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,670
She'll move into
Chairwoman Shin's house.

244
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:24,640
You did the right thing.
You should give her your trust.

245
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,980
I will.

246
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,580
I found the doctor who wrote
her schizophrenia diagnosis.

247
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,290
The doctor disappeared
after quitting that hospital.

248
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,120
Chairwoman Shin
must've taken a measure.

249
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,820
- Keep tracking this.
- Yes.

250
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,260
And as expected,
Chairwoman Shin's side...

251
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,790
heightened the security
with the server.

252
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:46,600
Let's wait for Se Young
to bring us the master key.

253
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,710
Goo Ha Na took Eun Chong
to his first day of school.

254
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,910
Someone may see her
and think she's his mom.

255
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,720
I heard he suffered
from serious depression.

256
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,250
Isn't it a good thing
for her to meet him?

257
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,220
What's Goo Ha Na's plan?

258
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,360
- Do you know anything?
- Why?

259
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,430
Are you afraid
she'll take Eun Chong?

260
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,730
How is she going to do that?

261
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,230
- Aunt Yeo Jin is his grandmother.
- Exactly.

262
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,040
You should pay more attention to your baby
instead of Eun Chong.

263
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,810
Do you not have morning sickness?

264
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,440
I feel a bit better at work.

265
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,310
It's killing me at home.

266
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,480
Once you give birth,
run a parentage test just in case.

267
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,420
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

268
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,590
What about the security server?

269
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,320
I'll talk to Director Choi
when he returns from his business trip.

270
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,560
Don't mess with me.

271
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,160
I may refuse to cooperate with the server
and everything else.

272
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,800
Please help me out.

273
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,470
You want to be a live-in babysitter?

274
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,970
Eun Chong seemed to be
in dire need of depression treatment.

275
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,240
I want to look after him
as a live-in babysitter...

276
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,640
until he gets better.

277
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,880
You coldly refused to even see him.
Why did you change your mind?

278
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,350
I spent six years as his mother.

279
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,750
You were cruel to me,

280
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,320
but it's not so easy for me
to turn a blind eye to his condition.

281
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,760
Even if I left, I thought I'd be at peace
only after I did my best...

282
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,790
as his foster mother.

283
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,560
Thank you for considering this.

284
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,670
I'll treat him for depression
within a month.

285
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,000
What are your terms?

286
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,670
You can pay me
however much you want to.

287
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,810
But I need you
to hold strictly to this clause.

288
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,950
"Goo Ha Na holds..."

289
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,350
"all authority over Eun Chong
while she's the live-in babysitter."

290
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,690
"Even the chairwoman
is not allowed to interfere."

291
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,920
I can't do this.

292
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,090
I'm his grandmother,
so don't tell me not to interfere.

293
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,990
You can be patient for a month,
for Eun Chong's sake.

294
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,500
I'll provide intensive care
for his depression over a month...

295
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,300
and make sure he stays stable
even after I leave.

296
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,570
If you don't want that,
I can just leave.

297
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,710
Add in a clause saying you will discuss
all decisions with me.

298
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,750
My term is that
you do not interfere...

299
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,220
with any rights over Eun Chong
while he's under my care.

300
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,490
Go outside and wait.

301
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,930
Tell Ms. Jang to come in.

302
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,880
Goo Ha Na offered to be
Eun Chong's live-in babysitter.

303
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,520
What's her term?

304
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,590
That's what I don't like.

305
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,290
I'll soon be here
as Eun Chong's live-in babysitter.

306
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,590
"Live-in babysitter?"

307
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,130
Are you saying you'll live here?

308
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,830
Yes.

309
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,340
Auntie Ha Na,
are you going to live here with me?

310
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,240
Yes.

311
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,270
All right!

312
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,680
- Was it the chairwoman's offer?
- It was me.

313
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,580
I thought I should
take care of him by his side.

314
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,120
Please come in.

315
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,930
Then, I have to live
with Goo Ha Na again?

316
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,270
You need to stay
on top of your game once again...

317
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,540
if you don't want everything
to come to nothing.

318
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,270
What are you saying?

319
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,610
Are you saying
Ha Na will try to take Eun Chong?

320
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,940
If she's moving in
with that plan on her mind,

321
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,950
I'll talk to your aunt
and kick her out.

322
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,880
Should I register my marriage first,
just as you suggested?

323
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,560
- What are you up to?
- Hey, Jin Goo.

324
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,560
Bye, Mom.

325
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,700
Goo Ha Na offered to be
Eun Chong's live-in babysitter.

326
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,460
"Live-in babysitter?"

327
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,230
I got her to sign this
with the term I wanted.

328
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,840
That was faster than I expected.

329
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
She must've been in a hurry.

330
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,250
Eun Chong's condition
must've been that serious.

331
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,450
She'll have the advantage
when you fight her for his custody.

332
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,090
Do you have a plan?

333
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,260
What I believe is
that Eun Chong will want me.

334
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:46,230
So, why don't we look
for his grandfather?

335
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,930
I think we'll need his help
from now on.

336
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,900
It had been almost 20 years
since he reached out...

337
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,100
ever since he left
to find his daughter.

338
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,310
It looks like he's in Korea,

339
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,980
but I can't find any traces of him.

340
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:03,010
First, find out
if he entered the country.

341
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,450
Yes, sir.

342
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,190
See if Chairwoman Shin's husband
entered the country.

343
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,560
Yes, sir. Mr. Hwang is here.

344
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,100
- Let him in.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,040
(Head Director's Office)

346
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,110
I want to ask you something.

347
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,880
When you sold off Hyesung Tour,

348
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,020
there was a rumor that you held
a weakness against the chairwoman.

349
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,560
Why are you asking me this now?

350
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,030
It seems like you know her
better than I do,

351
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,790
so share the information.

352
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,830
You're not even trying hard.

353
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,900
But I do want to give you a hint
to commend your courage...

354
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,570
for coming to see me.

355
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:06,180
You know some people
wish to slander her, right?

356
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,210
There was an incident
during my appointment ceremony.

357
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,880
Then, are you saying
it may not be malicious slander?

358
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,220
You can find out for yourself.

359
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,790
It won't be that hard, anyway.

360
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,590
Why do you suddenly want to be
a live-in babysitter?

361
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,090
You can always commute.

362
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,600
There's no reason
to move back into that place.

363
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,170
I'm all for this.
He'll get better in just one day...

364
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,200
if you stay by his side.

365
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,710
Why did you treat him harshly...

366
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,610
if you were going to do this?

367
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,180
Were you purified
after getting contaminated by Ji Seok?

368
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,380
- Does Ji Seok know?
- Yes.

369
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:47,720
My siblings, show me your support
for my safe return.

370
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,820
You aren't going there to die.

371
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,090
Hey. You can do this, Ha Na!

372
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,660
She said she'd treat him fully in a month,
so I decided to trust her.

373
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,030
She said
she'd let him remain stable...

374
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,700
even after she moved out.

375
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,900
We should accept her
if she could treat his depression.

376
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,270
What were her terms?

377
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,340
She wants full authority
over Eun Chong's care,

378
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,610
so we cannot interfere.

379
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,780
This doesn't feel right.

380
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:19,320
It's like we're handing him over
to Goo Ha Na.

381
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,490
It's only for a month.

382
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,460
She might be concerned
only for Eun Chong's safety.

383
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,790
What if she's making a move
to take him with her?

384
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,690
Who knows what she'll do
in that month?

385
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,560
She has no way of taking him.

386
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,830
If need be...

387
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,730
I'll send her away
to a mental institution or wherever.

388
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,300
"If need be?"

389
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,770
I'll prepare safety measures.

390
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,910
Yes, in that aspect,

391
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,010
why don't we let these two
register their marriage first?

392
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:54,420
We can start the adoption process
after registering their marriage.

393
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:58,060
- What do you think, Jin Goo?
- I'll do it after the wedding.

394
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,090
It'd be great
to adopt him as soon as possible...

395
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,190
and get used
to living our lives as parents.

396
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,390
It's coming up in just a month.

397
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,200
Were you at the chairwoman's place?

398
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,940
Yes, Ha Na is
moving in for a month...

399
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,340
to look after Eun Chong.

400
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,510
That's great news.

401
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,040
His depression will get better
if he has his auntie there.

402
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,820
Eun Chong will be like my grandson
once you get married,

403
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,320
so I'll stop by one of these days.

404
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,050
He'll be happy to see you.

405
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,390
He looks so down.

406
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,290
Is it because
he's forced to marry her?

407
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,330
You should get changed and come out.

408
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,060
Okay.

409
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,540
I hope she doesn't mean...

410
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,240
sending her to a mental institution
by safety measures.

411
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,080
You can use this for work.

412
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,320
Is this my work phone?

413
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,790
I installed
a location-tracking app...

414
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,490
- just in case.
- Thank you.

415
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:08,060
It's so reassuring
to have you behind me.

416
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,330
Tomorrow is finally the D-day.

417
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,830
Yes.

418
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,830
I'll think of the phrase...

419
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,970
"the enemy's blood"
whenever I see Eun Chong.

420
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:22,710
But at the same time,
you'll find him endearing...

421
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,240
and lovable like he's your son.

422
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,050
He was always just endearing to me,

423
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:34,520
but I might begin to look
for my enemy's trace on his face.

424
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,590
If something doesn't feel right,
leave immediately.

425
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,090
There are other ways to get revenge.

426
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,760
- Okay.
- I feel heavy...

427
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,860
for sending you alone
to the enemy's home.

428
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,300
Make sure you pick up my calls.

429
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,070
Okay.

430
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,770
The chairwoman had been
raiding corporations?

431
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,510
Do you have specific evidence?

432
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,440
My family and I are the victims.

433
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,810
What more evidence do you need?

434
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,880
Go tell Shin Yeo Jin...

435
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:11,520
to provide the overdue apology
and compensation to the victims.

436
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,760
The victims
and their families are...

437
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,000
still living in utter misery.

438
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,940
You're at work on a holiday.

439
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,980
It seemed like
her corporate raids were true.

440
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,050
Share what you know with me.

441
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,790
Even if I gave you
such precious information,

442
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,690
you'd never be able to leave her
as her faithful dog.

443
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,560
Why should I?

444
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,430
You can wait and see
if I'll leave her shadow...

445
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,200
or not.

446
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,750
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Hey.

447
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,180
Let's sit.

448
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,590
Take good care of Eun Chong.

449
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,530
I ask for your cooperation, too.

450
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,790
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

451
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,560
- Hello.
- Leave those upstairs and come.

452
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,700
Let's eat.

453
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,570
- I have to do something first.
- What?

454
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,010
Yes, come in.

455
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,610
Is someone coming?

456
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:43,380
- Please take those upstairs.
- Sure.

457
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,050
What are those?

458
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,590
I'm going to make a room
for Eun Chong to study and play in.

459
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:50,550
There's no room upstairs.

460
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,820
Your room.

461
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,360
- My room?
- Yes.

462
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,990
I need you to move out.

463
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,590
Why should I move out?

464
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:00,300
What is this nonsense?

465
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,000
Who's more important here?
You or Eun Chong?

466
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,870
- What?
- Who's the lowest in the hierarchy?

467
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,240
Who do you think you are
to tell her to move out...

468
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,740
and bring up the hierarchy?

469
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,540
I made this decision
as Eun Chong's babysitter.

470
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,450
If you're a babysitter,
just act like a babysitter.

471
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,150
You're crossing the line
to demand her to move out.

472
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,650
I'm sticking to the contract.

473
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:21,920
"The contract?"

474
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,890
What did it say...

475
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,020
Yeo Jin, she's asking Se Young
to leave her room...

476
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,190
to make a room for Eun Chong
to study and play in.

477
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,590
This is ridiculous.

478
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,360
Where am I going to live
once I leave my room?

479
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,070
You can sleep with your mom.

480
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,800
- What?
- You!

481
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,600
Don't give me that tone.

482
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:46,910
Do as you wish.

483
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,110
- Yeo Jin.
- Aunt Yeo Jin!

484
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:53,050
She's making a room for Eun Chong
to study and play in.

485
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,850
I should've thought about it...

486
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,590
and done that long ago.

487
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,460
I can't do that.

488
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,020
Se Young...

489
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,840
You can't come into this room.

490
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,400
I will report you to the police
if you touch my body or things!

491
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,510
Please wait downstairs.

492
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,610
- Sure.
- Okay.

493
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:27,580
I'm going to set the environment
of this house around Eun Chong.

494
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,420
Eun Chong needs urgent treatment
for his depression, so cooperate.

495
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,160
That's why
I'm decorating that room...

496
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,930
for him to study
and receive play therapy.

497
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,530
What's the problem?

498
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,060
Why does it have to be my room?

499
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,200
You're the most insignificant
in this family.

500
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,470
Don't you know your place yet?

501
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,100
The bottom of the totem pole.

502
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,370
What?

503
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,610
Se Young, you need to give way.

504
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:52,040
It'll last for a month,
so you don't have to make a scene.

505
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,250
If you find this uncomfortable,
you can go to your newlywed home.

506
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,180
Yeo Jin, are you telling her
to move out?

507
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,850
She'll be Eun Chong's mom soon,

508
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,020
so she needs to be by his side.

509
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,260
Goodness, Se Young. What's wrong?

510
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,560
My stomach hurts.

511
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:13,000
Your stomach? How does it hurt?

512
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,770
- Can you call Jin Goo?
- Okay.

513
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,670
The baby? Is it the baby?

514
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,970
I need to see the doctor.

515
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,640
You know some people
wish to slander her, right?

516
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,280
There was an incident
during my appointment ceremony.

517
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,650
Shin Yeo Jin!
How can you call yourself human?

518
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,250
Bring my business
and my family back!

519
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,350
Go tell Shin Yeo Jin...

520
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,060
to provide the overdue apology
and compensation to the victims.

521
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,870
Yes, Mother.

522
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,000
What about Se Young?

523
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,770
I'll be there now.

524
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,310
Ha Na must be here
with a plan, right?

525
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,480
I think she's getting revenge on us
by using Eun Chong.

526
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,560
Did Yeo Jin know what she was thinking
when she let that brat in?

527
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,060
Aunt Yeo Jin is awful, too.

528
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:16,090
How can she ask me
to move out of my room?

529
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,360
She must've been happy to hear
her grandson will get a room.

530
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,200
But how can she take her side
on day one?

531
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,400
I'm going to go to my newlywed home.

532
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,610
You have to stay with Eun Chong.

533
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,210
Just hang in there for a month.

534
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,010
How am I going to do that
without a room?

535
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,210
You can share it with me.

536
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,780
Let's wait and see...

537
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,950
- what Goo Ha Na is up to. Okay?
- Gosh.

538
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,520
Where's Jin Goo?

539
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,320
Come in.

540
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,590
Do you feel okay?

541
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,400
How can she be okay?

542
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,130
Are you playing cat and mouse?

543
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:58,070
Stop teasing her.

544
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,310
Restore my room now.

545
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,910
You'll move out
when you marry anyway.

546
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,020
Then, do it after I move out.

547
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,780
I don't have much time, either.

548
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,850
I have to finish everything
in a month.

549
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,260
- Finish what?
- Looking after Eun Chong.

550
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,190
No, it's your plan to steal him.

551
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,400
She took Se Young's room...

552
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,300
and made a playroom for Eun Chong
as soon as she came.

553
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,900
She must be
using Eun Chong as an excuse.

554
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,440
It looks like
she has another intention.

555
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,640
Is she trying to take him?

556
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,880
I'm here.

557
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,320
I heard Se Young had a stomachache.
What's going on?

558
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,820
Goo Ha Na came today.

559
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,690
- Go upstairs.
- Yes, ma'am.

560
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,500
Will you take responsibility
if something happens to my baby...

561
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,900
because of the stress
you're causing?

562
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,000
But your baby fell.

563
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,300
What?

564
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,210
Her baby fell?

565
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:12,910
I saw Auntie Se Young
and Little Grandma...

566
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,080
- when the baby...
- What are you talking about?

567
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,650
Eun Chong, have you been dreaming?

568
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,850
My baby is right here.

569
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,790
My baby, Mommy will keep you safe.

570
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,230
Jeez.

571
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,590
(Cinderella Game)

572
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,860
What's your real intention?

573
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,560
What do you think it is?

574
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,230
Goo Ha Na moved in
to steal Eun Chong, didn't she?

575
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,530
He's the chairwoman's grandson.
How is she going to do that?

576
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,000
- Guys, I'm Eun Chong's mom.
- I'm Eun Chong's mom.

577
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,700
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Auntie Ha Na!

578
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,670
- Auntie Ha Na!
- How did you come to this decision?

579
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:51,070
Auntie Se Young's stomach
dropped on the floor.

580
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,180
What is this saying?

581
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,640
Se Young is cheating on him?

582
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,910
It has already begun.

583
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,610
I've already become a liar.

584
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:58,180
I only need you, Auntie Ha Na.

585
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,520
Yesterday was the last day
you slept peacefully...

586
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,720
with your grandson.
