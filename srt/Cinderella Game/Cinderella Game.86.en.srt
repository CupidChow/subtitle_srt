1
00:00:01,672 --> 00:00:04,212
Yeo Jin. I'm so sorry.

2
00:00:04,942 --> 00:00:07,912
I can explain everything.

3
00:00:09,882 --> 00:00:13,152
Yeo Jin, please just...

4
00:00:13,252 --> 00:00:14,982
spare Se Young.

5
00:00:15,952 --> 00:00:18,222
Please forgive me just this once.

6
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:21,162
My daughter deserves to die, but yours doesn't?

7
00:00:21,892 --> 00:00:24,332
I'll kill Se Young, then I'll kill you, too!

8
00:00:26,702 --> 00:00:27,832
Yeo Jin.

9
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:39,372
Give me that.

10
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:42,912
Give it back.

11
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:46,451
- Let go of me! - Give it back!

12
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:48,721
Why did you steal my notebook?

13
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,851
You caused Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident...

14
00:00:50,852 --> 00:00:53,052
and killed her! Everything is in here!

15
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,462
You're over.

16
00:01:06,572 --> 00:01:07,942
Don't you dare harm my daughter.

17
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:13,712
I won't go down as you wish, Yeo Jin.

18
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:22,182
Yeo Jin.

19
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:25,992
Yeo Jin.

20
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:31,262
She's still breathing.

21
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:41,142
Should I just leave her to die?

22
00:01:47,682 --> 00:01:51,012
Yeo Jin, wake up.

23
00:01:51,952 --> 00:01:53,212
What happened to Aunt Yeo Jin?

24
00:01:53,422 --> 00:01:54,422
I have no idea.

25
00:01:54,423 --> 00:01:55,821
She was on the floor when I came here.

26
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:58,392
- Call 911. - Okay.

27
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:02,162
Wake up, Yeo Jin.

28
00:02:02,262 --> 00:02:04,392
What are we going to do?

29
00:02:04,892 --> 00:02:07,302
I couldn't reach Yeo Jin.

30
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,901
(Episode 86)

31
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:12,532
I couldn't reach her, either, so I came to her place.

32
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:17,142
I don't think she's here.

33
00:02:18,072 --> 00:02:19,371
I'll look for her.

34
00:02:19,372 --> 00:02:21,112
All right. Please let me know.

35
00:02:23,812 --> 00:02:24,882
Come in.

36
00:02:27,182 --> 00:02:28,282
Hey.

37
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:31,052
What are you up to?

38
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,292
My siblings wanted to have a party at the snack bar later.

39
00:02:34,462 --> 00:02:36,862
You should join us.

40
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,462
- Even me? - We got here thanks to you.

41
00:02:40,602 --> 00:02:41,932
You have to come.

42
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:45,772
I just gave you my support. It was all you.

43
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,972
I feel bad for Eun Chong.

44
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:53,172
- Your siblings need time, right? - Yes.

45
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:57,352
I was going to introduce you to my family after I got my revenge,

46
00:02:57,682 --> 00:02:59,082
but you already know everyone.

47
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:03,852
Please continue to stay with me like a father figure.

48
00:03:05,022 --> 00:03:06,122
Sure.

49
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:10,732
Right. When will you introduce me to your family?

50
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:12,062
I'd like to meet them.

51
00:03:12,632 --> 00:03:15,462
If they're your family, they're my family, too.

52
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,802
You'll probably meet them soon.

53
00:03:34,752 --> 00:03:35,752
(Secretary Jang)

54
00:03:35,753 --> 00:03:37,452
Where did she go without her phone?

55
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,862
(Ms. Choi)

56
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,732
Hello? I couldn't reach the chairwoman.

57
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:52,532
The hospital?

58
00:03:56,042 --> 00:03:58,472
I hope Yeo Jin never wakes up.

59
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:00,441
If she does,

60
00:04:00,442 --> 00:04:03,112
everyone will know I was behind the hit-and-run accident.

61
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,722
What happened?

62
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,492
I came home after going out...

63
00:04:11,022 --> 00:04:12,552
and found her on the stairs like that.

64
00:04:12,992 --> 00:04:14,892
I called 911 immediately and brought her here.

65
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,832
- Who's Shin Yeo Jin's guardian? - Yes?

66
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:20,801
She has a serious case of cerebral hemorrhage,

67
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,772
so it may be unlikely for her to regain consciousness.

68
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,272
What are you talking about?

69
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:31,442
Are you saying she's in a coma?

70
00:04:31,712 --> 00:04:32,772
Yes.

71
00:04:33,812 --> 00:04:34,912
Mom.

72
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:38,382
I feel so bad for Yeo Jin.

73
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:43,952
Doctor, Yeo Jin can wake up, right?

74
00:04:44,592 --> 00:04:46,422
Please save her.

75
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,092
Let's move her to special care and keep an eye on her.

76
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:57,732
Fate is on my side.

77
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,972
Do not wake up, Yeo Jin.

78
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,172
Have you reached her?

79
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,642
The hospital?

80
00:05:10,382 --> 00:05:11,582
She's unconscious?

81
00:05:12,482 --> 00:05:13,582
What do you mean?

82
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:19,822
Okay. I'll be there now.

83
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:25,292
Mr. Han.

84
00:05:27,532 --> 00:05:29,302
Is he not coming with us?

85
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,802
He left in a frenzy.

86
00:05:32,872 --> 00:05:34,102
Is something going on?

87
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:39,471
Take a taxi instead of driving.

88
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,881
Okay. Don't tell Eun Chong about it.

89
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:44,381
- I won't. Go, now. - Okay.

90
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:45,952
Be careful. Bye.

91
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:52,492
Ms. Bang Ul. Yali is asleep.

92
00:05:52,922 --> 00:05:54,192
Is that so?

93
00:05:54,322 --> 00:05:58,292
Goodness, you poor thing.

94
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,531
Are you crying?

95
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:03,672
No, why would I cry? Goodness.

96
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,502
What do we do now? Yeo Jin...

97
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:10,342
How did she fall down?

98
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:13,472
I should've stayed home.

99
00:06:17,052 --> 00:06:18,152
Yeo Jin.

100
00:06:19,782 --> 00:06:21,082
Sung Ho.

101
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:24,192
Yeo Jin.

102
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,861
What happened? Why are you like this?

103
00:06:27,862 --> 00:06:30,392
Yeo Jin, Sung Ho is here.

104
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:33,662
Yeo Jin, you poor woman.

105
00:06:35,402 --> 00:06:36,602
Yeo Jin...

106
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,131
You never bothered to show up for 20 years.

107
00:06:40,132 --> 00:06:41,642
What took you so long?

108
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:44,642
Is he here to take her assets once she dies?

109
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:47,482
Congratulations, Chairman Goo.

110
00:06:48,682 --> 00:06:49,942
Congratulations, Ji Seok.

111
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:54,282
Here. I'm the flower I prepared.

112
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,152
- Thanks a lot. - You do look like a flower.

113
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,652
A granny flower.

114
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,562
Your eyes are wrong.

115
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,791
Why isn't Mr. Han here?

116
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,331
He's the supporter of the four avengers.

117
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:09,132
Something must be going on. He left in a frenzy.

118
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,672
Yes, he won't pick up his phone, either.

119
00:07:12,602 --> 00:07:14,741
- It must be a woman. - He's not dating anyone.

120
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,772
Come on. Who knows?

121
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,871
Right, so what will happen to the chairwoman from now on?

122
00:07:19,872 --> 00:07:21,042
She'll be put on trial.

123
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:23,611
It'll take a while until the ruling comes out.

124
00:07:23,612 --> 00:07:26,011
The compensation will be made after the court rules.

125
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:29,282
Then, are we getting 100 million dollars after the trial?

126
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:33,222
Are you stupid? That money isn't just ours.

127
00:07:33,292 --> 00:07:35,161
There are over 100 victims.

128
00:07:35,162 --> 00:07:38,631
And why do you want to use our enemy's money?

129
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:39,991
We have a good reason to.

130
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:43,332
She made all that money with our parents' hard work.

131
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:47,302
I still won't take a penny from my enemy.

132
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,772
I'll make money all on my own to open the second store.

133
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,242
Is that why you're working as a deliveryman in the morning?

134
00:07:53,942 --> 00:07:55,482
I can do this once I set my mind to it.

135
00:07:56,382 --> 00:07:57,682
I'm sorry for running late.

136
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:02,882
Gosh, Danny. I've been waiting for you.

137
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:05,122
I'm happy to see you.

138
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:08,322
- Where's Mr. Han? - Something urgent must've come up.

139
00:08:17,002 --> 00:08:20,272
Yeo Jin will wake up.

140
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,872
She's a strong woman.

141
00:08:37,322 --> 00:08:38,391
Ms. Chairwoman.

142
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,662
How can this happen?

143
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,762
I still can't believe what I'm seeing.

144
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,362
You should go home, Ms. Choi.

145
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,172
Why would I leave?

146
00:08:51,302 --> 00:08:53,031
I'll stay by Yeo Jin's side.

147
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,172
You should go.

148
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:56,642
I'll stay here tonight.

149
00:08:56,972 --> 00:08:59,442
You should do that. I'll stay here, too.

150
00:09:04,552 --> 00:09:06,182
Mom, let's go.

151
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,992
Choi Myung Ji said she saw the chairwoman on the floor...

152
00:09:12,222 --> 00:09:13,692
when she returned home.

153
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,562
That's when she said she called 911.

154
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,262
You can't believe a word she says.

155
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:22,161
- I heard she drugged Eun Chong. - Yes.

156
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,172
I heard she gave him drugs, put him to sleep, and went out.

157
00:09:25,902 --> 00:09:27,942
The chairwoman said she kicked her out for that reason.

158
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:29,372
I heard that, too.

159
00:09:30,672 --> 00:09:34,042
She wouldn't have let her in easily after kicking her out.

160
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:36,982
No, it doesn't seem right that she returned after a day.

161
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,712
She couldn't have opened the door if she had already collapsed.

162
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,182
Did Choi Myung Ji pick the lock?

163
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:44,152
She could've collapsed after Myung Ji came in.

164
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:47,162
What if she collapsed after they had a fight?

165
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:49,762
There's a possibility that they fought over Eun Chong's matter.

166
00:09:49,862 --> 00:09:52,492
Also, I just received a call...

167
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:55,702
about the whereabouts of the disappeared Detective Cho.

168
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,271
Where is he?

169
00:09:58,272 --> 00:09:59,772
I thought he had fled overseas,

170
00:10:00,302 --> 00:10:03,812
but there was a tip-off from someone who saw him in a casino in Gangwon.

171
00:10:04,172 --> 00:10:05,742
Let's send someone right away.

172
00:10:05,812 --> 00:10:07,742
I already sent men there.

173
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:12,752
Detective Cho and Myung Ji are probably still in contact.

174
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,122
What happened? Was there a thief?

175
00:10:22,362 --> 00:10:25,391
Your aunt made this mess all by herself...

176
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:27,032
because I drugged Eun Chong.

177
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,942
I didn't expect her to find the notebook I hid there.

178
00:10:36,742 --> 00:10:37,812
What notebook?

179
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,572
It's nothing.

180
00:10:40,442 --> 00:10:41,942
What are we going to do now?

181
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,782
Do we have to hope Aunt Yeo Jin never wakes up?

182
00:10:45,382 --> 00:10:48,482
Of course. If she does, it'll be the end of us.

183
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:49,722
Why?

184
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:53,392
Would she take it that far at us for drugging Eun Chong?

185
00:10:54,462 --> 00:10:57,292
No one knows Yeo Jin kicked us out,

186
00:10:57,892 --> 00:10:59,762
so don't tell anyone that she did.

187
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,702
Do you think even Ms. Jang doesn't know?

188
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:04,572
Just before, it seemed like she had no idea.

189
00:11:05,972 --> 00:11:09,102
Shouldn't we come up with two plans, just in case she wakes up again?

190
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:13,342
No, I need to siphon off Yeo Jin's assets...

191
00:11:14,682 --> 00:11:17,012
on the assumption that she won't wake up.

192
00:11:17,612 --> 00:11:20,582
Then, can I blame...

193
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:23,122
my embezzlement on her, too?

194
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,992
You're so clever.

195
00:11:27,892 --> 00:11:31,392
She's unconscious, so who'd know if we framed her?

196
00:11:34,802 --> 00:11:36,502
All right. Attention, please.

197
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:40,872
I have savory and rich cheese tteokbokki.

198
00:11:41,942 --> 00:11:43,142
Is this your bestseller?

199
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:45,141
This is the hottest tteokbokki at the moment.

200
00:11:45,142 --> 00:11:46,242
Try some.

201
00:11:49,212 --> 00:11:51,982
My gosh, Danny. Look at this cheese.

202
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,482
Oh, my. Going up.

203
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:00,292
What are you doing at a tteokbokki place?

204
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:03,392
Right? Get a room.

205
00:12:07,032 --> 00:12:08,102
Gosh.

206
00:12:11,532 --> 00:12:13,571
I like the cheese flavor. Try it.

207
00:12:13,572 --> 00:12:14,971
Yes, it's good.

208
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,642
Right? That's why it's the hottest fad.

209
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:17,972
We're hot, too.

210
00:12:18,412 --> 00:12:20,682
Cheese tteokbokki and cheese flavor.

211
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,782
Don't these make such a perfect couple?

212
00:12:26,052 --> 00:12:27,482
It's just like us.

213
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:36,761
(Jin Goo)

214
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:38,362
My Danny, do you want more?

215
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:39,792
I'm still working on it.

216
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,702
Hello, Mr. Hwang. No.

217
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:49,802
Jin Goo.

218
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:55,142
I'm at Ji Chang's snack bar. Is something going on?

219
00:12:58,282 --> 00:13:01,282
Chairwoman Shin fell unconscious?

220
00:13:03,922 --> 00:13:04,992
What happened?

221
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:08,522
Yes, all right.

222
00:13:12,432 --> 00:13:15,332
Chairwoman Shin fell unconscious?

223
00:13:30,012 --> 00:13:31,312
We must become...

224
00:13:32,282 --> 00:13:34,552
Eun Chong's legal guardians in Yeo Jin's place.

225
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:38,652
- Is that possible? - We need the court's help.

226
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:44,632
We must become his legal guardians until he comes of age.

227
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,502
And to do that, we need Yeo Jin's seal.

228
00:13:48,932 --> 00:13:50,632
We have to get that first.

229
00:13:51,902 --> 00:13:54,441
She probably has important things in the safe.

230
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:55,542
What?

231
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,172
Yes, I'll get a safe technician to come tomorrow.

232
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,112
Someone's here.

233
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:12,252
Why were you in there?

234
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:16,792
Well, the window was open, so I went in to close it.

235
00:14:17,262 --> 00:14:19,091
Why are you here?

236
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,002
- To sort out the chairwoman's room. - I see.

237
00:14:22,732 --> 00:14:25,602
Ms. Jang, will you continue to stay at the hospital?

238
00:14:25,972 --> 00:14:27,072
Yes.

239
00:14:31,712 --> 00:14:34,382
What about Eun Chong? Should we take him back?

240
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:37,782
He'd only be a nuisance if we brought him back now.

241
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,182
We have to get his legal guardianship first.

242
00:14:44,122 --> 00:14:46,152
How serious is it?

243
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:47,992
The doctor said...

244
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,962
it'd be impossible for her to wake up.

245
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,162
What will Eun Chong do now?

246
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:54,862
She'll get up.

247
00:14:55,332 --> 00:14:57,732
She wouldn't pass away in vain like this.

248
00:14:58,132 --> 00:15:00,502
If she passes away in that coma,

249
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,112
Choi Myung Ji will become Eun Chong's legal guardian.

250
00:15:05,542 --> 00:15:08,511
But she may be the culprit for Du Na's hit-and-run accident.

251
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,642
You're right.

252
00:15:11,012 --> 00:15:12,712
That was the first thing that came to my mind.

253
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:15,382
- Let's find a way. - Okay.

254
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,852
Eun Chong doesn't know yet, right?

255
00:15:18,022 --> 00:15:20,222
No, I'm taking him to the hospital tomorrow.

256
00:15:20,592 --> 00:15:21,822
Do you want to come?

257
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:27,232
Don't force yourself to do it if you don't want to.

258
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:29,962
I'll think about it and call you.

259
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,332
Okay.

260
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,302
I was acquitted after the police investigation,

261
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,672
thanks to you.

262
00:15:35,942 --> 00:15:37,242
How did you know?

263
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:38,812
I could get myself out.

264
00:15:39,842 --> 00:15:42,412
Thank you. I should've thanked you before.

265
00:15:43,682 --> 00:15:45,111
I was repaying your kindness.

266
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,682
You gave me the hint for the passcode.

267
00:15:48,582 --> 00:15:52,192
I relayed that to the chairwoman, and she said she was sorry...

268
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:55,162
and that she should pay for whatever she did.

269
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,762
I see.

270
00:15:58,492 --> 00:15:59,592
Are you okay?

271
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,762
After all, the chairwoman was like another mother to you.

272
00:16:04,402 --> 00:16:06,372
I feel much better after seeing you.

273
00:16:07,702 --> 00:16:09,542
This must be why everyone dates.

274
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:15,582
Then, I'll let you see me more often.

275
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:25,652
Okay.

276
00:16:44,872 --> 00:16:48,812
Chairwoman Shin needs to get up for Eun Chong.

277
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,782
I can't let Choi Myung Ji take Eun Chong.

278
00:16:57,752 --> 00:17:01,291
She knew Du Na emigrated to America...

279
00:17:01,292 --> 00:17:03,092
after some time at that children's home...

280
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,392
but kept it from the chairwoman intentionally.

281
00:17:07,462 --> 00:17:08,532
Is she...

282
00:17:09,802 --> 00:17:12,472
also involved in Du Na's disappearance?

283
00:17:15,272 --> 00:17:19,312
It's odd that Se Young is still traumatized by her disappearance.

284
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:24,312
- Ten? - You can't do this to me.

285
00:17:24,552 --> 00:17:27,181
What did I do?

286
00:17:27,182 --> 00:17:28,522
You were with me...

287
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,392
when I disappeared.

288
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:37,522
I'm so sorry.

289
00:17:38,132 --> 00:17:41,002
I apologize. Please forgive me.

290
00:17:41,162 --> 00:17:43,532
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:46,272
Why did Se Young apologize?

292
00:17:48,542 --> 00:17:51,172
What happened at the time of her disappearance?

293
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:55,711
I once went there on a ship from Seongbuk Port...

294
00:17:55,712 --> 00:17:57,711
when I was a kid.

295
00:17:57,712 --> 00:18:01,322
It's not too far from Seoul, and the place has a great sunset.

296
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,452
It looks exotic, so...

297
00:18:08,262 --> 00:18:10,592
- That... - Do you recognize this hat?

298
00:18:11,662 --> 00:18:13,592
I must've worn it as a child.

299
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,602
Is that why?

300
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,502
It seems familiar.

301
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:22,472
Se Young must know something.

302
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,682
There would've been a hint in Du Na's journal.

303
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,742
I shouldn't have thrown it out.

304
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:38,352
Please open your eyes, honey.

305
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:40,892
I'm sorry.

306
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:43,922
I apologize for everything.

307
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:48,232
I shouldn't have left you back then.

308
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,932
It's all my fault.

309
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,672
I lost Yu Jin...

310
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:00,772
and made you like this.

311
00:19:17,832 --> 00:19:19,632
The lock has been reset.

312
00:19:20,132 --> 00:19:22,632
- I'm all done. - Thank you.

313
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,672
(Ledger)

314
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,142
- All right. - Please enter eight numbers.

315
00:19:41,752 --> 00:19:43,682
Find any file that has her seal on it.

316
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,292
- And see if she left a will. - Okay.

317
00:19:49,592 --> 00:19:50,692
Is this her seal?

318
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,592
There it is.

319
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:00,472
It's the divorce paper.

320
00:20:04,642 --> 00:20:07,372
She kept it all along?

321
00:20:17,582 --> 00:20:18,922
What are you up to, Yeo Jin?

322
00:20:21,922 --> 00:20:23,762
(Divorce by Mutual Consent, Yoon Sung Ho)

323
00:20:24,062 --> 00:20:25,732
Are you going to divorce him?

324
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,732
We're only married on paper. It's meaningless.

325
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,672
What will you do with it?

326
00:20:38,342 --> 00:20:40,542
If I keep it with me, I can find a use for it.

327
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:45,782
Ms. Jang took away everything important two days ago.

328
00:20:46,852 --> 00:20:50,782
Hey, you should go to work and meet with the board.

329
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:55,292
I already told them to blame Yeo Jin for the embezzlement.

330
00:20:55,562 --> 00:20:56,662
Really?

331
00:20:58,192 --> 00:21:00,962
- What about you? - I have to go to the hospital.

332
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,162
Okay. I'll go, then.

333
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,632
Bye.

334
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:14,312
Detective Cho, are you still in hiding?

335
00:21:15,382 --> 00:21:16,742
Earn your keep while you're hiding.

336
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,652
I need a list of all the assets Yeo Jin owns.

337
00:21:21,622 --> 00:21:23,021
Did you make sure...

338
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,792
the press didn't find out about the chairwoman?

339
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,921
Yes, I took a measure yesterday.

340
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:28,492
What about the board members on the chairwoman's side?

341
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:31,462
- Any movements? - They aren't too bothered yet.

342
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,732
If her coma becomes prolonged, or if she passes away,

343
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,902
the governance will change drastically,

344
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,902
so the board must be on the edge, too.

345
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:43,142
Have you reached Mr. Han?

346
00:21:43,842 --> 00:21:46,272
Not yet. He won't pick up his calls.

347
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:50,912
I heard he didn't return home after he left like that yesterday.

348
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,652
I wonder what's going on.

349
00:21:53,782 --> 00:21:55,581
When are you going to the hospital, Mr. Hwang?

350
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:56,652
Let me go with you.

351
00:21:58,422 --> 00:21:59,492
Right now?

352
00:22:00,692 --> 00:22:01,762
Okay.

353
00:22:04,662 --> 00:22:07,192
- Is someone unwell? - What?

354
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,562
- Yes. - Who?

355
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,102
A colleague at work.

356
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:16,502
Mr. Han stayed the night out yesterday.

357
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:20,772
He's definitely seeing someone.

358
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,242
But still, I'm worried.

359
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:25,211
He probably isn't in an accident, right?

360
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:26,781
Don't be so slow.

361
00:22:26,782 --> 00:22:29,421
If he left frantically yesterday and hadn't reached out until now,

362
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:30,752
it had to be a woman.

363
00:22:31,292 --> 00:22:34,422
The spring breeze blows

364
00:22:35,692 --> 00:22:37,592
You need to go out and date someone, too.

365
00:22:38,762 --> 00:22:40,132
I'll manage.

366
00:22:45,172 --> 00:22:46,632
Ji Eun and Ji Chang are...

367
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:49,742
better off not knowing about her condition, right?

368
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,572
Her pulse became irregular,

369
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:54,312
and her blood pressure dropped.

370
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:56,782
Her condition isn't as good as yesterday.

371
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,581
Is she in danger?

372
00:22:58,582 --> 00:23:00,752
Her heart is beating irregularly,

373
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:03,052
so things may become worse.

374
00:23:03,722 --> 00:23:04,892
How can this happen?

375
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:07,192
Please just let her live.

376
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,522
I'll do my best. Excuse me.

377
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,002
Yeo Jin.

378
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:19,402
Please stay strong.

379
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:23,602
Mr. Yoon should grab a quick bite to eat.

380
00:23:25,072 --> 00:23:26,171
I'm fine.

381
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:27,982
If you want to stay by her side,

382
00:23:28,382 --> 00:23:30,281
you must look after yourself first.

383
00:23:30,282 --> 00:23:32,152
There won't be any problems from skipping a few meals.

384
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,312
Then, at least get some fresh air.

385
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:37,782
It's belated, but I wanted to stay by her side.

386
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,492
It'd be better...

387
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:44,892
if I could collapse and make her get up.

388
00:23:47,262 --> 00:23:50,632
Mr. Hwang will bring Eun Chong here.

389
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:52,502
Okay.

390
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,172
Please leave.

391
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,411
What are you talking about?

392
00:24:02,412 --> 00:24:04,381
You are not allowed inside the patient's room.

393
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:07,512
What? You're banning me from here?

394
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:09,352
Have you lost your mind?

395
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:11,182
Who dares to keep me out?

396
00:24:11,352 --> 00:24:12,492
Leave.

397
00:24:13,392 --> 00:24:14,522
Sung Ho.

398
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:17,722
Please leave quietly.

399
00:24:17,962 --> 00:24:19,062
Why should I?

400
00:24:19,662 --> 00:24:21,901
I need to be next to her.

401
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:23,832
Please do as I ask and leave.

402
00:24:24,002 --> 00:24:26,002
Who do you think you are to tell me to get out?

403
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:28,902
You were only her husband on paper.

404
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,912
You never did anything for her to this day.

405
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:36,082
I stayed with her when you left...

406
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:38,112
and served her to this day.

407
00:24:38,582 --> 00:24:40,452
If anyone has to leave, it's you.

408
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,282
I heard you drugged Eun Chong.

409
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,492
That's a misunderstanding.

410
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:50,991
What drug would I...

411
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:53,592
I heard that was why Yeo Jin kicked you out.

412
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:55,502
You told him that already?

413
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,832
These two had been communicating.

414
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:02,072
We reconciled over the phone in the morning.

415
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:05,142
She called it a misunderstanding and told me to return home.

416
00:25:06,742 --> 00:25:08,681
We'll find out once Yeo Jin wakes up.

417
00:25:08,682 --> 00:25:09,812
Sung Ho!

418
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:13,282
You can't do this to me.

419
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,882
I saved her life.

420
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:20,292
If it hadn't been for me, she wouldn't be here right now.

421
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,792
She would've been on the other side.

422
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:25,592
I found her fast enough and at least kept her alive.

423
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,692
We'll find out the truth when she wakes up.

424
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:31,402
Will you really be like this?

425
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:34,702
If this is a mistake on my part, I'll apologize later.

426
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:36,742
But today, you must leave.

427
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:43,182
You never even showed yourself while Yeo Jin was fine.

428
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:46,482
Do you suddenly want to act like her husband after she collapses?

429
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,882
Gosh, I'm sure Yeo Jin will be happy.

430
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:52,722
I'll leave today.

431
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:55,562
But I'm coming back tomorrow.

432
00:26:02,502 --> 00:26:04,532
Can you check the CCTV footage in front of my place?

433
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:06,271
I need to find out...

434
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:08,032
- if Myung Ji is telling the truth. - Yes, sir.

435
00:26:17,082 --> 00:26:18,182
Eat up.

436
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:21,722
How did you know I hadn't eaten?

437
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,382
I need to know that much to be your boyfriend.

438
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:26,492
I'll prepare some gimbap in the future.

439
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:33,692
It's good.

440
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:37,862
It looks like you didn't get any sleep.

441
00:26:38,132 --> 00:26:40,102
Did you stay up all night thinking about me?

442
00:26:42,342 --> 00:26:43,402
No.

443
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,012
You were worried about Eun Chong.

444
00:26:48,042 --> 00:26:50,882
- Can I ask you something? - Sure.

445
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:55,782
Do you know anything about the time when Eun Chong's mom...

446
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:57,622
went missing?

447
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:00,592
Be more specific.

448
00:27:01,122 --> 00:27:04,122
I heard Se Young almost went missing with her.

449
00:27:04,462 --> 00:27:06,462
They didn't go missing together.

450
00:27:07,362 --> 00:27:08,832
They were at the port together,

451
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,002
but only their daughter went missing.

452
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,702
Was it...

453
00:27:14,102 --> 00:27:15,572
Seongbuk Port?

454
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,972
Yes, how did you know?

455
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:30,882
- Are you all right? - Thanks.

456
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:32,952
- Are you from Seoul? - Yes.

457
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:36,092
Eun Chong's mom went missing at Seongbuk Port...

458
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,021
around when we met at the hospital...

459
00:27:38,022 --> 00:27:39,732
as ten-year-olds, right?

460
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:42,362
Yes, what's wrong?

461
00:27:44,202 --> 00:27:45,632
I have a feeling...

462
00:27:46,972 --> 00:27:48,772
there's also a secret behind Du Na's disappearance.

463
00:27:49,242 --> 00:27:50,371
"A secret?"

464
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,912
It's still a speculation,

465
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:53,912
so I'll tell you when I'm sure.

466
00:27:54,112 --> 00:27:55,912
Why don't you share your speculations with me, too?

467
00:27:56,412 --> 00:27:57,842
Let's uncover the secret together.

468
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:02,851
"Together?"

469
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:05,322
Make use of your boyfriend. What else will you do with him?

470
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:10,592
I'll make use of him.

471
00:28:25,272 --> 00:28:27,342
Have some coffee, too. It's too dry.

472
00:28:27,712 --> 00:28:29,112
You should have some, too, Mr. Hwang.

473
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,452
That appellation needs to go first.

474
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:34,652
Can you just call me Jin Goo?

475
00:28:36,852 --> 00:28:37,922
Jin Goo.

476
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:43,322
- Ha Na. - Jin Goo.

477
00:28:44,162 --> 00:28:45,232
Ha Na.

478
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:54,231
Why is it so hard to call you by your name?

479
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:55,242
Jin Goo...

480
00:28:59,412 --> 00:29:00,611
Be careful.

481
00:29:00,612 --> 00:29:02,711
Goodness. Hey.

482
00:29:02,712 --> 00:29:03,882
Goodness.

483
00:29:04,382 --> 00:29:05,682
Mom, let me get the car.

484
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:22,262
- Goodness, yes. - What's Ha Na doing?

485
00:29:22,362 --> 00:29:24,532
- I see. - I knew she'd do this.

486
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,902
But she promised she wouldn't see Eun Chong anymore.

487
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:36,912
You're under investigation for embezzlement.

488
00:29:37,312 --> 00:29:38,552
Why are you here?

489
00:29:38,952 --> 00:29:41,012
My aunt made me embezzle the money.

490
00:29:41,152 --> 00:29:44,682
You must've decided to frame her because she's in a coma.

491
00:29:46,192 --> 00:29:47,452
Did your mom make you do this?

492
00:29:48,292 --> 00:29:50,662
Why would she? It's true.

493
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,402
Do you know...

494
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,372
who Richard Han is?

495
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,642
Richard Han, the man who betrayed Aunt Yeo Jin,

496
00:30:03,642 --> 00:30:04,742
was my uncle.

497
00:30:05,972 --> 00:30:07,112
What do you mean?

498
00:30:08,242 --> 00:30:10,682
Think about it and figure it out.

499
00:30:15,952 --> 00:30:18,022
If he was her uncle, he must be Chairwoman Shin's husband.

500
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:22,062
Richard Han is Chairwoman Shin's husband?

501
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,032
Do you know anything about Mr. Han's family?

502
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:29,761
I know his daughter died as a kid, but what about his wife?

503
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,332
I have no information on his wife.

504
00:30:32,532 --> 00:30:34,272
- What's wrong? - Mr. Han is...

505
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:36,942
Did something happen to him?

506
00:30:38,812 --> 00:30:40,242
Where is Chairwoman Shin hospitalized?

507
00:30:43,582 --> 00:30:45,352
(Shin Yeo Jin)

508
00:31:17,982 --> 00:31:20,512
Yeo Jin, remember?

509
00:31:22,252 --> 00:31:24,282
When we first met,

510
00:31:25,692 --> 00:31:27,122
we hit it off right away.

511
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:31,322
We talked all night, not realizing time passed by so quickly.

512
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,562
You were so endearing when you talked...

513
00:31:38,302 --> 00:31:39,832
with your sweet voice.

514
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:45,572
Can you get up...

515
00:31:47,212 --> 00:31:49,612
and call my name just once?

516
00:31:56,852 --> 00:31:58,452
I'm sorry for everything.

517
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:08,092
What...

518
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:11,302
are you doing right now, Mr. Han?

519
00:32:18,302 --> 00:32:19,412
Ji Seok.

520
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,802
(Cinderella Game)

521
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,371
How can you be Chairwoman Shin's husband?

522
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:27,512
What brings you here, Mr. Han?

523
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:30,281
He seemed like the chairwoman's husband.

524
00:33:30,282 --> 00:33:31,811
I'm sorry for not telling you until this day.

525
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:33,181
I'll take over her hospital room.

526
00:33:33,182 --> 00:33:36,281
- Do you have a plan? - Think of why she had kept this.

527
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:38,321
I'll be a husband from now on.

528
00:33:38,322 --> 00:33:41,621
Are you doing this to inherit her assets when she passes away?

529
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:46,532
Do you think I killed Yu Jin or not?
