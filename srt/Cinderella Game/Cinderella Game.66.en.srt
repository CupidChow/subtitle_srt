(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,750
(Episode 66)

5
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,400
I'll make it up to you
until I die...

6
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,770
No, even after my death.

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,540
I'll do everything as you ask.

8
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,140
I'll do anything.

9
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,710
Eun Chong...

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,050
Please bring Eun Chong to me...

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,250
Ha Na.

12
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,820
Ha Na!

13
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,660
Ha Na!

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
You are not allowed
to barge in here unannounced!

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,600
Don't you know how to knock?

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,470
If you want to talk, come tomorrow.

17
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,770
How dare you blame Ha Na
for your fake daughter scheme?

18
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,110
I knew you betrayed...

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,710
hard-working businesses
with your raids,

20
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:46,540
but this new move was unexpected,
repaying kindness with evil.

21
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,380
- You may leave, Ms. Jang.
- Yes, ma'am.

22
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,820
I felt grateful and bad for Ha Na,

23
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,560
so I wanted to get along with her.

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,090
I also think it's a shame
that she keeps going astray.

25
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,130
You felt grateful, bad,
and thought it was a shame?

26
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,200
Your words couldn't be any lighter.

27
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,540
Your victim is suffering
from immense pain,

28
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:12,570
but you just think it's a shame?

29
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,840
I wanted her to cut her ties
with Eun Chong...

30
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
when I played this strong move.

31
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,010
But that's not working, either.

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:24,020
So? Are you preparing
a stronger move?

33
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,680
If you mess with her one more time,

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,090
I will not hold myself back.

35
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,390
Remember that you have more to lose
if you choose to fight me.

36
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,800
- And that includes your grandson.
- Shut up!

37
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,500
- That is my grandson!
- Because you messed with my sister!

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,270
This is my final warning.

39
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,310
Get your act straight
if you want your grandson's safety.

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,460
(Head Director's Office)

41
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,630
Move quickly and find a way
to infiltrate the security server.

42
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,100
I must get rid of Chairwoman Shin
as soon as possible.

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,600
What about Yoon Se Young's side?

45
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,110
I'll make her move now.

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,510
He called off the engagement...

47
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,910
even when you said
you were pregnant?

48
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,980
He must be out of his mind.

49
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,350
He has gone
head over heels for Goo Ha Na.

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,390
I also said I'd call it off, too.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,820
And even if I do it,

52
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,090
I'll do it after I kill Goo Ha Na.

53
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,060
Yes, good work with this photo.

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
His denial will be useless...

55
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,340
if you have this evidence.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,340
You two are over.

57
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,560
Ha Na.

58
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,360
What have I done to you?

59
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,500
Are you up? Are you all right?

60
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,310
How did I end up here?

61
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:35,080
You fainted due to exhaustion.

62
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,320
Do you not remember?

63
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,020
You have a bit of the IV shot left.
Why don't you finish it?

64
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,100
Please just listen.

65
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,610
I couldn't give you an answer
after you fainted.

66
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,410
I'll bring Eun Chong to you.

67
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,010
I'll do whatever it takes...

68
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,720
to bring him back to you.

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,120
First, let me know
what Eun Chong's condition is like.

70
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,890
I'll find out.

71
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,880
(Temporary Restraining Order)

72
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,750
Ha Na was banned
from approaching Eun Chong?

73
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:53,660
But she's his guardian.
How is this possible?

74
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,730
Why is she giving Ms. Goo
and Eun Chong a harder time?

75
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,160
It's such a shame.

76
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,800
Even the law is
taking these rich people's side.

77
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Darn it.

78
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,570
Ha Na.

79
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,040
Where have you been?

80
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,140
Why are you so late?

81
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,010
Ha Na, have you heard?

82
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,810
The chairwoman filed
a restraining order against you.

83
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,750
She told me yesterday
when I went over to get him.

84
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,250
I thought it was just a threat.
I didn't expect to see this.

85
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,520
Do you still not get it?

86
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,760
She may make your life
even harder from now on...

87
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:27,330
if you don't cut ties
with Eun Chong.

88
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,340
No way. She tore that up.

89
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:04,760
(Yeo Jin)

90
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,740
Who's that?

91
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,170
Is that Auntie Ha Na?

92
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,020
(Incoming Call)

93
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,360
Is this Sung Ho?

94
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,560
(Incoming Call)

95
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,700
Does she not pick up
numbers she doesn't know?

96
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,670
It's me, Yeo Jin.

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,110
(It's me, Yeo Jin.)

98
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,250
Can we meet tomorrow?

99
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,220
I want to talk to you
about Eun Chong.

100
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,690
You want to do that now
after standing me up?

101
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,090
Did you think I'd show up
just because you wanted to meet?

102
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:18,470
I'll take responsibility
for the baby.

103
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,170
I can either raise the child...

104
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,270
or let Se Young do it
if she wants to.

105
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,440
What is this ridiculous talk?

106
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,410
Both the baby and Se Young need you!

107
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,780
You're such a responsible person.
Why are you suddenly going astray?

108
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,890
I'm sorry, Mom.

109
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,220
And you want to live a good life
all on your own...

110
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,890
after making her a single mother?

111
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,390
You may be my son,
but you're pure evil.

112
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,400
That may be the case with you,

113
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,730
but why must Se Young suffer?

114
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,370
You need to be frank with me.

115
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,470
She did something wrong to you,
didn't she?

116
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,880
You wouldn't do this for no reason.

117
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,710
Se Young and I are
too different in many ways.

118
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,550
Marriage is finding ways to mediate
each other's differences.

119
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,780
What did Se Young do
to make you act like this?

120
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,120
It's not like that.

121
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,750
Then, marry her.

122
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,360
If you keep insisting on this,
I'll consider Ms. Goo as the reason.

123
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,630
Mom, please.

124
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,330
You cannot call off the engagement!

125
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,700
I will not let my grandchild grow up
without a father!

126
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,280
Turn everything back.

127
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,420
Put everything back in its place!

128
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,390
Turn everything back.

129
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,220
Turn everything...

130
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,560
At least you'll look at me
instead of ignoring me,

131
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,730
refusing to talk to me,
and looking away.

132
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,030
Thank you for that.

133
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,750
Eun Chong.

134
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,020
Did you not hear my voice?

135
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,290
I was in front of your place
all day long.

136
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,300
You aren't unwell, are you?

137
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll bring Eun Chong to you.

138
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,010
I'll do whatever it takes...

139
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:36,840
to bring him back to you.

140
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,770
Will he really
bring Eun Chong back to me?

141
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,080
Are you calling off the engagement
because of Ha Na?

142
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,320
If it had been because of Ha Na,
I would've been honest with you.

143
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,390
This is a problem
between Se Young and me.

144
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,460
Please leave the engagement
up to us.

145
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,530
You need to consider your child.

146
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,860
I don't understand
why someone responsible like you...

147
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,800
would do something like this.

148
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,270
I'll take responsibility
for the child.

149
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,540
And I'll let Ha Na
and Eun Chong meet.

150
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,240
It's too soon.

151
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,040
That'll only be a hindrance
as Eun Chong pulls himself together.

152
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,980
He won't be depressed forever.

153
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,950
He'll be fine once he starts school.

154
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,950
What if his depression worsens?

155
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,290
He lost his mother overnight.

156
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,090
He has the psychology
of a missing child.

157
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,990
You also knew
how happy Eun Chong used to be.

158
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,230
Ha Na is the only one
who can turn him back...

159
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,430
to his old ways.

160
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,200
You were worried about Eun Chong...

161
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,740
but not about the child
Se Young was pregnant with?

162
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,940
Take back what you said
about the engagement first.

163
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:20,010
And don't dream of letting Ha Na
and Eun Chong meet behind my back.

164
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,910
I let it go when Ms. Sim did that,

165
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:24,320
but I won't be as patient
if it happens again.

166
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,580
I was partially responsible
for what happened to them.

167
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,090
If you continue to oppose this,
I will let them meet.

168
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,360
- Instead, please let them...
- That's enough.

169
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,860
Tell Ms. Jang to come in.

170
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,130
Please, Ms. Chairwoman.

171
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,840
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

172
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:00,220
Sung Ho reached out to me yesterday.

173
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,250
Did he want to meet?

174
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,720
Yes.

175
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,360
He's waiting for me
in a room in my hotel.

176
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,890
He said he'd wait until I showed up.

177
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,500
Why don't you meet him?

178
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,370
You two need to talk
about Eun Chong at least once.

179
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,340
And about Yu Jin, too.

180
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,790
Eun Chong, why don't you
write a letter to Auntie Ha Na?

181
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,260
If it's hard to talk about,
you can write a letter...

182
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,830
or draw a picture.

183
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,710
(I miss you, Auntie.)

184
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,850
You did a great job.

185
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:04,080
Let's show it to your auntie later.

186
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,450
Hi, Eun Chong.

187
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,890
May I talk to him?

188
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,330
(I miss you, Auntie.)

189
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,360
You wrote a letter to Auntie Ha Na.

190
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,730
She'll love this.

191
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,810
I'll let you meet Auntie Ha Na soon.

192
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,610
Give me just a little more time.

193
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,240
- Really?
- It's a secret.

194
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,030
Eun Chong wrote this letter
to Auntie Ha Na.

195
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:54,800
Eun Chong...

196
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,300
(President Hwang Jin Goo:
I miss you, Auntie.)

197
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,070
I miss you, Auntie.

198
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,780
I miss you, too, Eun Chong.

199
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,080
Is anybody home?

200
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,160
You were home.

201
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,060
I'm sorry for barging in like this.

202
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,460
Why did you come to my place?

203
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,670
Because I had a reason, obviously.

204
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,600
What's going on, Ms. Sim?

205
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,240
- Well...
- You should at least serve water...

206
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,510
when you have elders at your place.

207
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,210
Have a seat, Bang Ul.

208
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,880
Let us take a seat.

209
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,790
I told you to bring some water.

210
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,330
They must be here
because of Se Young and Mr. Hwang.

211
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,270
What is it now?

212
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,270
Be nice to her.
Don't go looking for trouble.

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,140
Make sure you help me.

214
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,140
Don't just sit there
like you're a wallflower.

215
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:29,230
Goodness! What are you doing?

216
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:31,930
My gosh!

217
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,700
- How dare you?
- Was that refreshing?

218
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,040
You little...

219
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,140
My goodness.

220
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,700
If you slap me, I'll slap you, too.

221
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,940
How dare you speak to me like this?
Let go of me!

222
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,840
How dare a nobody like you...

223
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,610
Se Young must be a somebody
who took after her mother.

224
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,750
She also has a habit
of resorting to violence.

225
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,850
You could've just talked to her.

226
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,320
You need to lose that temper.

227
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,690
Is Se Young like this, too?

228
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,260
No!

229
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,490
Se Young...

230
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:07,300
has to call off her engagement
because of you.

231
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,230
Did you just scoff at me?

232
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,970
Let's see
if you can continue to do that.

233
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,010
Look. There's my evidence.

234
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,350
Are you going to slander me
by using this picture?

235
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,550
So, why didn't you open the door
and let me in...

236
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,050
when I went there to see Eun Chong?

237
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,220
Then, there wouldn't be
a picture like this.

238
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,120
You keep talking back at me
like you're the victim.

239
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,890
Listen here.

240
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,060
Se Young's engagement is about
to get called off because of you!

241
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,270
Nothing is going on
between Mr. Hwang and me.

242
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,500
You're using this single picture to claim
I'm the reason?

243
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,640
- She says nothing is going on.
- What's with you?

244
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,540
If Mr. Hwang is calling that off,

245
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,280
Se Young has to be the reason.

246
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,310
- I can't stand this ridiculous...
- Goodness.

247
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,850
Why do you keep trying to hit her?
You aren't a thug!

248
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,180
Bang Ul, please!

249
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,290
Whose side are you on?
Are you here to take her side?

250
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,920
You told me not to sit around
like a wallflower.

251
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,790
Come on.

252
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,160
Se Young is pregnant,

253
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,970
yet he still wants
to call the engagement off.

254
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,400
If that's not because of you...

255
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,940
Then, Se Young must've done
something really bad.

256
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,970
You have the wrong person.

257
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,640
Your daughter is the problem,
not me.

258
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,080
Did Se Young do something?

259
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,580
Se Young didn't do anything.

260
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,350
I'm warning you.

261
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,490
If her engagement is called off,

262
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,290
I will ruin your life...

263
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,730
and the lives of your siblings.

264
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,800
Why would you ruin their lives?

265
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,000
We're done talking. Get up.

266
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
What's with you?

267
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,640
Bang Ul,
you need to get a grip on yourself.

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
You were caught
trying to let Eun Chong...

269
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,470
and her meet in secret.

270
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,480
You're still not in your right mind.

271
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,780
Please don't meet Jin Goo...

272
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,780
even if he comes over.

273
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,750
It won't benefit you in any way.

274
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:11,020
I'm sorry for adding this
to your tough situation,

275
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,220
but please do that.

276
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,530
Why are you apologizing?

277
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,760
- Shut your mouth and come.
- Let go of me!

278
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:18,960
Come with me! Goodness gracious.

279
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,950
Ha Na, why were those women here?

280
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,120
Did she pour water on you?

281
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:50,590
You're late.
Did you have to work outside?

282
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,500
I just met with the chairwoman.

283
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,170
- Did you say our wedding was off?
- Yes.

284
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,970
It's because of Goo Ha Na, isn't it?

285
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,270
I already said no.

286
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,850
Will you still deny it?

287
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,550
I won't let this go.

288
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,020
If you insist on
calling the engagement off,

289
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,960
I'll show it to Aunt Yeo Jin, too.

290
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,330
Are you using this to blackmail me?

291
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,400
Sure, go ahead.

292
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,400
I can also expose you
and Goo Ji Seok.

293
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,230
Do you have evidence?

294
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,400
I'd just say Ji Seok was
someone I dated in the past.

295
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,170
But you held her in your arms
right before my eyes.

296
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,540
Then, you must've
seen her faint, too.

297
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,050
She stood out there all day
trying to see Eun Chong...

298
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,150
and then fainted.

299
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,380
Why would you want to take a picture
and blackmail her?

300
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,320
How would I know
if she was there all day long?

301
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,390
I was returning from work
when I saw you two like that...

302
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,890
and took that picture in disbelief.

303
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:53,960
Do whatever you want.

304
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,430
I'm not marrying you,
no matter what you say.

305
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,260
Then, I'll make her
into an adulteress.

306
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,130
I told you
she had nothing to do with this!

307
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,170
You get riled up
whenever I mention her,

308
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,230
yet you still deny it.

309
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,470
Even now,

310
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,670
you were more concerned about her...

311
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:08,470
than my feelings
after you called off our wedding!

312
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,010
I ruined her life.

313
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:17,110
I won't let Ha Na fall
into bigger trouble...

314
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,120
because of me.

315
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,920
Don't even dream
of harassing her with this.

316
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,250
It sounds like
you'd do anything for her.

317
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,790
Yes, if she wants,

318
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:29,590
I'll do anything.

319
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,700
Our child is listening.

320
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,670
If you don't want
to raise the child, I will.

321
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,570
Don't try to hold me back
by using the child.

322
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,370
What a great dad you are.

323
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,540
You'll never get to see our child.

324
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,750
Hwang Jin Goo
called off your engagement?

325
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,260
You're half responsible
for my ruined engagement.

326
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,560
Take responsibility for that.

327
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,630
How shall I take the responsibility?

328
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,360
- I'm not calling it off.
- Why not?

329
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,830
As you said,
it wouldn't be a bad idea...

330
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,130
if you married me
and adopted Eun Chong.

331
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,870
If I married you,

332
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,310
Aunt Yeo Jin would
never let us adopt Eun Chong.

333
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,680
Goo Ha Na is responsible
for the other half.

334
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,040
He told me
he'd call off our engagement...

335
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,150
and did this with her
behind my back.

336
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,580
I caught them.

337
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,990
Are you jealous?

338
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,730
I find it ridiculous.

339
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,530
She still hasn't come to her senses
even after his utter betrayal.

340
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,540
Did he call the engagement off
because of Ha Na?

341
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,670
Isn't it obvious?

342
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,010
You'd need...

343
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,780
a countermeasure
in case the marriage got called off.

344
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,550
"A countermeasure?"

345
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,620
Do you have clearance to access
the group's security server?

346
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,020
- No.
- You have to get that first.

347
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,560
You need to get your hands
on the group's weakness.

348
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Or is it because you need it?

349
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,370
What I need is what you need.

350
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,170
Hurry.

351
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,740
Don't rush me.

352
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,850
Do I have to put
a bowl or something in here?

353
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,220
What are you up to?

354
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,330
I heard my stomach is
supposed to be bigger at four months.

355
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,660
How am I going to fake that?

356
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:47,330
There's a way, so don't worry.

357
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,630
I went to Goo Ha Na's place today.

358
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:52,800
I showed her the picture...

359
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,240
and said she was the reason
why your engagement was off,

360
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,010
but she denied it
and acted shamelessly.

361
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,580
Did you hit her again?

362
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,610
I didn't hit her.

363
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,220
I threw water on her,
and she did the same to me.

364
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:08,850
She said she'd slap me
if I slapped her.

365
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,990
She became very vicious.

366
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,790
You can't do that, Mom.

367
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,530
If you rub her the wrong way,
he won't just call off the wedding.

368
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,530
He may not even see me again!

369
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,170
How ridiculous.

370
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,900
Should I change my strategy?

371
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:32,240
Yes, if she wants, I'll do anything.

372
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,310
I have a good idea.

373
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,450
- What is it?
- Let's meet Goo Ha Na tomorrow.

374
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,470
Leave.

375
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:04,370
I came to apologize for yesterday...

376
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,810
and discuss Eun Chong with you.

377
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,380
Don't you want to know
how he's doing?

378
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,560
You'll let me meet him?

379
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,430
Yes, we'll convince the chairwoman.

380
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,030
If that fails,

381
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,030
we can even let you meet him
in secret.

382
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,630
- How?
- There are lots of ways.

383
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,640
Se Young will be
Eun Chong's mom soon.

384
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,240
She can come out with him
and let you see him.

385
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,840
You're going to be his mom?

386
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,380
Aunt Yeo Jin told me
to marry Jin Goo and adopt him.

387
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,220
I want to be a really good mom.

388
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,750
Se Young will be Eun Chong's mom?

389
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,260
You don't like him.

390
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,090
No, I do.

391
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:58,190
He grew on me,
and he adores me, too.

392
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,070
It must be hard to believe,

393
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,800
but I now know how it feels
to be a mom after getting pregnant.

394
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,710
Eun Chong will also be happy
when his younger sibling is born.

395
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,680
So, what do you want in return...

396
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,310
for letting me meet Eun Chong?

397
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,480
Make him keep the engagement.

398
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,910
How am I going to do that?

399
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,620
You can meet Jin Goo
and convince him.

400
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,590
It's crazy to call this off
even though I'm pregnant.

401
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,190
He'd be shunned by the world
if the word got out.

402
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,890
- That's not my business.
- But you miss Eun Chong.

403
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,430
He also misses you
and cries every single day.

404
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,870
His depression is worsening, too.

405
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,840
It became worse?

406
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,540
He won't eat, sleep,

407
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,940
or talk.

408
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,010
He even wet the bed once.

409
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,580
The doctor said
if this became more serious,

410
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,050
he could even hurt himself.

411
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,460
"Hurt himself?"

412
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,390
Is he receiving treatment?

413
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,360
The best treatment would be...

414
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,200
meeting his aunt.

415
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,530
I must protect
the baby I'm pregnant with,

416
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,700
and you need to protect Eun Chong.

417
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,310
I'll be good to him
when I become his mom.

418
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,180
This is a win-win situation.

419
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,250
What do you say?

420
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,320
Is he still checked in?

421
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,090
Yes, ma'am.

422
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,960
Is he going to wait until I show up?

423
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,790
- Who is it?
- It's me.

424
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,010
It's been a long time.

425
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,540
Yes, it has been.

426
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,980
You stood me up last time.

427
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,780
Why did you want to see me again?

428
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,290
Return Eun Chong to Ms. Goo,
Yeo Jin.

429
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,960
I've kept my eyes on her
and have seen...

430
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,470
that she loves Eun Chong
more than anybody.

431
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,770
No one can love him more than I do.

432
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,570
There's no love
that transcends one's blood.

433
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:56,040
She wouldn't have raised...

434
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,880
or tried to adopt him
if she cared about his blood.

435
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,780
I heard Eun Chong had depression.

436
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,650
Have you been watching in hiding?

437
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,620
He's just adapting.

438
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,620
He's receiving treatment,
so he'll get better.

439
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,790
Do you know when he's the happiest?

440
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,260
Do you know
what he wants the most right now?

441
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,400
Losing family overnight is
tough for adults, too.

442
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,200
It happened to us...

443
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,270
when Yu Jin disappeared.

444
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:36,010
Why do you let Eun Chong
go through the same thing?

445
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,020
Don't do anything you'll regret,
Yeo Jin.

446
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,020
We have already had
many regrets to this day.

447
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,920
There's only one thing I regret.

448
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,330
That I failed to stop you
from taking Yu Jin to that island.

449
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,570
Yes, that is
what I regret the most, too.

450
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,870
I want to turn back the time
to that day, too.

451
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,270
You have no right to boss me around.

452
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,240
Did you know how painful life was
after I lost her?

453
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,510
Don't say this now...

454
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,680
after leaving me alone
throughout those years.

455
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,420
I'm sorry.
I also wasn't in my right mind.

456
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,050
I was foolish.

457
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,550
If you're sorry,

458
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,020
leave Eun Chong with me.

459
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,320
Let him continue to meet Ms. Goo
even if you raise him.

460
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:25,260
That way,
he'll grow up as a healthier boy.

461
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,900
I'll manage.

462
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,870
He needs Ms. Goo.

463
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,140
He doesn't need Goo Ha Na.

464
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,300
Se Young will adopt him...

465
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,370
once she marries.

466
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,820
He won't eat, sleep,

467
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,220
or talk.

468
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,160
He even wet the bed once.

469
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
The doctor said...

470
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,660
if this became more serious,
he could even hurt himself.

471
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,970
I must protect
the baby I'm pregnant with,

472
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,030
and you need to protect Eun Chong.

473
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,800
This is a win-win situation.

474
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,680
Mr. Hwang, I need to see you now.

475
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,840
Ha Na.

476
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:45,710
I heard my mom and Se Young's mom
visited you yesterday.

477
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,380
I'm so sorry.

478
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,680
Mr. Hwang.

479
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,050
You said
you'd do anything as I asked.

480
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,620
Yes.

481
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,990
I need to ask you for a favor.

482
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,190
Sure.

483
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,530
Marry Se Young.

484
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:12,640
Don't call off the engagement.
Marry her.

485
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Why are you asking me to do this?

486
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,680
You have to marry her
to make life easier for many.

487
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,810
I want to stop hearing that
the wedding is off because of me.

488
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,880
Marry Se Young...

489
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,980
and lift the misunderstanding
about me.

490
00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:29,850
I apologize
for such a misunderstanding.

491
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,130
Do you...

492
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,300
really want me to marry Se Young?

493
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,700
Yes.

494
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,070
I...

495
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,670
like you, Ha Na.

496
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,440
If possible,

497
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,240
I want to marry you.

498
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,750
You're the one I have feelings for.

499
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,150
I'm not trying
to put pressure on you.

500
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,850
But I...

501
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,960
wanted to share
my feelings with you.

502
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,600
Do you really want me
to marry Se Young?

503
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,560
(Cinderella Game)

504
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,860
Will you marry her or not?

505
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,790
Is there another reason
why I must marry Se Young?

506
00:34:17,790 --> 00:34:20,400
Why would you do this
to someone who raised your grandson?

507
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,100
I'm pregnant.
You aren't the dad, so don't worry.

508
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,930
Aren't you human?

509
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,000
How dare you? He's my grandson.

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,970
Can you bring Eun Chong back to me?

511
00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:29,270
"A son?" My foot.

512
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,210
Throw out everything
that belongs to Eun Chong...

513
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,740
unless you want to regret everything
before our parents.

514
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,540
- You'll marry her?
- Yes.

515
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,010
Why did you change your mind?

516
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,850
I have a term
as Eun Chong's future father.
