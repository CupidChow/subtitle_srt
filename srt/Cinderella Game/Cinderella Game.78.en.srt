1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,580
(Episode 78)

5
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:35,910
Why are you here?

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,340
To work.

7
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,440
What business do you have here?

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,820
Your suit would
stand out too much at work.

9
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:46,920
You aren't at a nightclub.

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,090
You can still sneer at me even after
your wedding got called off...

11
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,990
for faking your pregnancy?

12
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:56,630
- Just pull my videos.
- Just press the button.

13
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,270
- You're meeting the chairwoman?
- Yes.

14
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,610
Why would you meet her?

15
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,780
You'll find out soon.

16
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,120
Darn it. This is humiliating.

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,960
My wedding was called off,
and I got called out for abusing my power.

18
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,490
How am I going to face my team?

19
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,610
- Hello, Ms. Yoon.
- Hello, Ms. Yoon.

20
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,910
Hello, Ms. Yoon.

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,150
Are you all right, Ms. Yoon?

22
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,250
Please don't say anything.

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,180
- I won't.
- I won't.

24
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,620
Soo Jung, please write up an apology
for the power abuse scandal.

25
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,860
- Okay.
- And Jin Kyung,

26
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,160
please get things ready
to shoot an apology video.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,700
Okay.

28
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,230
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Hwang.

29
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:09,700
Hello.

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,880
Come in.

31
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,260
You came to work.

32
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,220
Yes, I had no choice but to come
because of the audit.

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,860
People are going to gossip
about our wedding,

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,760
so let's just stay quiet.

35
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,100
Okay.

36
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,670
Will you tell people...

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,970
my fake pregnancy was
the reason you called it off?

38
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,570
I'll come up with something else.

39
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,940
Okay.

40
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm taking a leave
right after the foundation anniversary,

41
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,510
so hang in there
even if you feel uncomfortable.

42
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,910
Okay, I guess.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,520
I saw Ha Na at work.
Why was she here?

44
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,720
- She's here?
- You didn't know?

45
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,260
- She went to see the chairwoman.
- Really?

46
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,060
What? He really didn't know?

47
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,430
Is nothing special going on
between them at this point?

48
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,360
I wonder why she's here.

49
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,330
Hello.

50
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,400
My name is Goo Ha Na,
and I am here to conduct...

51
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,540
Hyesung Group's audit
as a chief auditor starting today.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,970
Chief auditor?

53
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,270
You're the chief auditor?

54
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,140
Yes, nice to meet you.

55
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,150
- Ms. Jang, you may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

56
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,890
How can you be the chief auditor?
You're just a tour guide.

57
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,260
Are you worried
because I don't seem trustworthy?

58
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,600
You'll find out
in the investigation room.

59
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,100
What are you after?

60
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
The audit is just an excuse.
What are you really after?

61
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,270
- You're quick to catch on.
- Revenge?

62
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,840
You already guessed?

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,110
Then, do you also know who I am?

64
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,250
Do you know who my father is...

65
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,150
Goo Young Min, Youngshin Fashion.

66
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,680
You remember him.

67
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,890
The company Hyesung Finance
bankrupted and took 13 years ago.

68
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,490
You did that more than once,
so I didn't think you'd remember,

69
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,990
but you even remembered
my dad's name.

70
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,460
I guess you conducted
some background check.

71
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,760
Yes.

72
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,600
Thirteen years ago,

73
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
my father died in a car accident
while he was on his way to see...

74
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,140
his daughter's piano competition.

75
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,840
And on that day,
his business went bankrupt.

76
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,610
His daughter couldn't play the piano
ever since that day,

77
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,550
even until now.

78
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,690
And you're blaming me for that?

79
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,390
Why did my parents
have to pass away on that day,

80
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,120
and why did his business
go bankrupt on that day as well?

81
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,390
I need to know.

82
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,690
You already know.

83
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,400
The truth seemed to be
something else.

84
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,170
I'll see you
in the investigation room.

85
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,010
Thirteen years ago?

86
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,150
How long will you continue
to raid corporations?

87
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,580
Another person has died!

88
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,520
I didn't kill them.
It was just a car accident.

89
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,150
"Just a car accident?"
Do you really think so?

90
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,190
You need to think of Yu Jin!

91
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,690
Yu Jin won't return
just because I live a good life.

92
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,860
Then, I already lived a good life,
so why was she taken from me?

93
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,330
Living a good life...

94
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,930
just resulted
in the loss of my daughter.

95
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,470
Are you telling me
to live a good life?

96
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,040
You can do that if you want!

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,740
You shouldn't do that, Yeo Jin.

98
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,810
You should think of her...

99
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:38,910
and not do anything
that'd cause pain in others.

100
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:46,380
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

101
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,420
Ms. Chairwoman, are you okay?

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,620
Ms. Chairwoman.

103
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,000
The Goo siblings came here
to get revenge on me.

104
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,330
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin.

105
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,640
We're the audit team
with Cheongun Accounting Firm.

106
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,340
In accordance
with the Act on External Audit,

107
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,180
we will be conducting
an audit of your company.

108
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,250
We kindly ask for your cooperation
to ensure a smooth process.

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,560
And Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin,

110
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,230
your audit is scheduled
for tomorrow at 2 p.m.

111
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,800
Take everything.

112
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,980
Where's the chief auditor?

113
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,750
She went to the investigation room
after talking to the chairwoman.

114
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,250
She talked to the chairwoman?

115
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,350
Just press the button.

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,490
- You're meeting the chairwoman?
- Yes.

117
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,960
Why would you meet her?

118
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,530
You'll find out soon.

119
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,700
Is Ha Na...

120
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,340
No way.

121
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,410
- Ms. Yoon Se Young?
- Yes?

122
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,240
Please come with us
to the investigation room right now.

123
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Me? Why me?

124
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,950
You're also subject to audit,
Ms. Yoon.

125
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,750
What does this concern?

126
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,450
Her power abuse scandal.

127
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,330
Don't be nervous,
and only answer what's asked.

128
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,900
I need to see the chairwoman.

129
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,400
Okay.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,010
Why did my parents
have to pass away on that day,

131
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,840
and why did his business
go bankrupt on that day as well?

132
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,680
I need to know.

133
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,780
What will you do after finding out?

134
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,180
Are you trying to take the business?

135
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,020
Ms. Chairwoman.

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,790
- I heard the audit team came by.
- Yes.

137
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,460
Have you met the chief auditor?

138
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,730
You didn't know?

139
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,470
Was it someone I knew?

140
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,030
It was Goo Ha Na.

141
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,440
Ha Na?

142
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,350
I am Team Leader Yoon Se Young
of the Travel Service Department.

143
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,960
Have a seat.

144
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,230
You...

145
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,530
Why are you here?

146
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,130
Take a guess.

147
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,600
Wait, are you...

148
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,430
No, right?

149
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,100
Am I the chief auditor?

150
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,640
- I am.
- That's nonsense.

151
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,580
Nonsense seems to be your expertise.

152
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,610
You've taken your power too far
and used the staff as your assistants.

153
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,450
Only scumbags would go this far.

154
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,750
You're going to audit me?

155
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,860
Have a seat.

156
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,260
That's a list of abuses
you conducted under your power.

157
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,990
Please confirm.

158
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,930
"Revenge?" Revenge on what?

159
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
For getting used as a fake daughter.

160
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,740
"Getting used as a fake daughter?"

161
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,740
I don't understand why she'll go
this far to get revenge on that.

162
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,080
Is Richard Han behind her?

163
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,850
He probably is.
If it hadn't been for him,

164
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,250
what power do the Goo siblings have
to fight against me?

165
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
Not only is she
trying to take Eun Chong...

166
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,590
but she's also trying to control
my business as she likes.

167
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,960
Your audit is tomorrow,
so you should call it a day.

168
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,730
All right.
I hope you and Se Young...

169
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,470
prepare well for the audit.

170
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,700
Yes, ma'am. Ms. Yoon is
currently under investigation.

171
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,010
Wasn't ruining my wedding enough?

172
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,450
Do you admit to everything?

173
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,220
I never forced anyone.

174
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,690
They gladly did this for me.

175
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,590
You're in the investigation room.
Please show your respect.

176
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,790
Uncross your arms and legs.

177
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,610
Do you admit
to assaulting Ms. Goo Ha Na?

178
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:48,620
Do you admit to plotting
the money envelop incident?

179
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,460
It'll be disadvantageous for you...

180
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,630
if you refuse to cooperate
with the investigation.

181
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,860
Is that okay?

182
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,030
Hey, not bad.

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,730
You must've watched a lot of films.

184
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,000
If you refuse to answer,
I'll take that as yes.

185
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,370
You also abused your power
over many other team members...

186
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,770
and made them run
your personal errands daily.

187
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:11,010
They fetched coffee, polished shoes,
and even washed your car.

188
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,750
I have many testimonies
and voice recordings of those incidents.

189
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,380
My team gave testimonies?

190
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,690
I didn't do anything wrong!

191
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,490
There's too much evidence,

192
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,520
so it'll be harder
to deny the charges.

193
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,460
So, you should
just admit to everything.

194
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,130
Richard Han is behind you, isn't he?

195
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,600
What's going on between you and him?

196
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,100
How did you become
the chief auditor?

197
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,200
Watch what you say.

198
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,070
How dare you make up
this third-rate soap opera?

199
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,440
You have an amazing connection.

200
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,580
If you don't have one,
shut your mouth and back down.

201
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,780
This is the end for your mom
and Chairwoman Shin too.

202
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,820
"The end?"

203
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,620
One audit can't end the chairwoman.

204
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,390
And my mom doesn't even work here.
Why would she get involved?

205
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,830
Are you doing this audit
out of personal spite?

206
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll sue you for defamation...

207
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,870
after this audit.

208
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,530
Please do.

209
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,470
Let's find out
who's right and who's wrong.

210
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,970
This kind of audit
can't even make me flinch.

211
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,440
Ms. Yoon, your power abuse
wasn't the only problem.

212
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,420
- What are you talking about?
- Does something bother you?

213
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,350
You're throwing things out there
to see what you can get.

214
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,020
Is this how you investigate?

215
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:34,360
Well, you don't have the competence
or credentials to do anything right.

216
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,800
Professional auditors
already finished the audit.

217
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,460
I'm just using what I got
to conduct the investigation.

218
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,570
Look forward to it.
This is just the preview.

219
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,470
Are you saying
you have something else?

220
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,410
What I do know is...

221
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:54,210
you'll miss the day
when you were questioned for power abuse.

222
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,750
What do you know?

223
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,180
You're already up, so get out.

224
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,590
That's all for your investigation.

225
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,130
I'll take you and your mom down...

226
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,470
as a unit.

227
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,450
Se Young, are you that scared
to admit to your faults?

228
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,690
Mr. Hwang is here.

229
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,260
(Head Director's Office)

230
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,260
Things must be hectic because of
the audit. How many I help you?

231
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,300
I heard Ha Na returned to the office
to take revenge on the chairwoman.

232
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,700
Was that what Chairwoman Shin said?

233
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,610
Richard Han must've been behind her
to make her the chief auditor.

234
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,510
What revenge did she say
Ha Na was getting?

235
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,410
For getting used as a fake daughter.

236
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,580
The fake daughter thing?

237
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,120
She told a lie
that'd be exposed right away?

238
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,950
It must've been that urgent for her.

239
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,850
- So, no?
- According to her,

240
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,520
you'll soon suffer from revenge too.

241
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,930
You took part
in turning her into a fake daughter.

242
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,700
If not, then what's the reason?

243
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,430
- A grudge.
- "A grudge?"

244
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,970
Does this have something to do
with corporate raids?

245
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,110
Are Ha Na and you...

246
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,110
victims of corporate raiding?

247
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,450
Yes.

248
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,620
Revenge?

249
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,060
Wait, so the Goo siblings
began to work for you...

250
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,860
with this intention from the start?

251
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,590
Director Goo came for revenge,

252
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:52,130
but Ha Na must've heard it
after she found out she was a fake.

253
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,300
Then, she must've worked
as the live-in babysitter...

254
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,440
to use Eun Chong for her revenge.

255
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,880
He's my weakness,
so she threatened to take him.

256
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,580
Yeo Jin, shouldn't you send him abroad
as soon as possible?

257
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,850
I'd dread it even if she took him
to raise him well,

258
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,120
- but if this was for revenge...
- Watch what you say.

259
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,760
Yes, okay.

260
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,260
I see why she became so spiteful.

261
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,030
It must've felt ridiculous
that she raised her enemy's blood,

262
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,970
but she was also used
as a fake daughter. Goodness.

263
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,270
How can fate be
so maliciously twisted?

264
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,310
So, why didn't you live
a better life?

265
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,620
Is this how karma
finds its way back to you?

266
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,990
She should be getting furious.
Is she holding herself back?

267
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,900
Did she get scared that
the Goo siblings came for revenge?

268
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,940
Well, she repaid kindness with evil.

269
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,970
It must feel uncomfortable.

270
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,880
- Richard Han is named Han Min Su?
- Yes, ma'am.

271
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,550
And his age is unknown,
just that he's in his 60s.

272
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,750
- Anything else?
- I couldn't confirm...

273
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,450
if he was a victim
of corporate raiding,

274
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,990
but Director Goo once said
he was a father figure.

275
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,920
They probably first met
while he helped Mr. Goo...

276
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,260
as a victim of corporate raiding.

277
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,830
Richard Han is
behind the Goo siblings.

278
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,260
I need to meet him and find out
what he wants through this revenge.

279
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,470
- Reach out through Goo Ji Seok.
- Yes, ma'am.

280
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,240
Chairwoman Shin said that?

281
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,710
She made a request to meet you.

282
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,310
You also said you'd meet her,

283
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,050
so should I accept this?

284
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,850
Tell her that I'll reach out.

285
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,990
This isn't an audit. It's a revenge.

286
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,560
She gathered the evidence
of my power trips on her...

287
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,160
and even reached out to ex-employees
to record testimonies.

288
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,960
That spiteful brat came
thoroughly prepared.

289
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,230
Anything else?

290
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,370
She said this was the end
for Aunt Yeo Jin and you.

291
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,100
What?

292
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,570
Does she know
about our embezzlement?

293
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,040
What if she does?

294
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,780
You should've pried some more!

295
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,640
I did, but she wouldn't answer.

296
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,350
But it also seemed like she was
just throwing things out there.

297
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,020
Anyway, will I really get punished
for my power abuse?

298
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,150
Why would that happen
over something so petty?

299
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:31,490
Did you upload the apology
and the video?

300
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,020
I'll do it now.

301
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,860
You need to be careful from now on.

302
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:39,100
And Ha Na did return
to get revenge on your aunt.

303
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,670
- The fake daughter thing?
- Because of a grudge.

304
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,170
"A grudge?"

305
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,310
I heard you came
as the chief auditor.

306
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,550
- Yes.
- May I have a word with you?

307
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,720
You can come to my office.

308
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,690
Mr. Goo told me...

309
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,230
that the chairwoman took
your father's business.

310
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,560
I didn't know
there was such tragic history.

311
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,100
It must've been hard for you.

312
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,740
I found out only recently.

313
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,440
Is your revenge...

314
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,110
taking the chairwoman
and Hyesung down?

315
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,510
- Yes.
- And the audit is the beginning?

316
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,610
Yes.

317
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,680
You'll also undergo
an investigation.

318
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,620
I should.

319
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:38,020
You told me I could use you
for my revenge.

320
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,060
Can you let me use you...

321
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,830
to take Chairwoman Shin
and Hyesung down?

322
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,640
She was someone who saved your life,

323
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,640
and you've known her for 20 years,
so it wouldn't be easy.

324
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,410
What can I do for you?

325
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,540
Don't try to feel me out.

326
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:04,450
But when you know
you can be used for my revenge,

327
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,550
help me out then.

328
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,550
I won't force you.

329
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,920
Are you also using Eun Chong
to get your revenge?

330
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,730
Do you want his custody
because you genuinely care about him?

331
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,800
- Or are you using him...
- What if I am?

332
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:26,400
You don't know
who Chairwoman Shin really is.

333
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,370
I have to go even further
to put up a fight against her.

334
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:35,050
When I told Ji Seok
I'd join him in this revenge,

335
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,210
he tried to stop me.

336
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,150
He said I wasn't cut out
to get revenge on anyone.

337
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,420
I finally understand...

338
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,060
why he said that to me
after seeing you.

339
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,660
You also aren't cut out
to get revenge on anyone.

340
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,470
"I sincerely apologize
to many people..."

341
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,100
"who were hurt
by my thoughtless words..."

342
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,900
"and actions."

343
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,110
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

344
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,610
"I've reflected on myself
and realized how wrong..."

345
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,850
Darn it.
I didn't do anything that bad.

346
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,450
Ms. Yoon, I'm done
setting up your phone.

347
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,590
Okay. Give me a second.

348
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,390
Ms. Yoon, this is bad.

349
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,130
How much worse can things get?

350
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,640
What is this?

351
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,670
Did you tell him...

352
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,770
I faked my pregnancy?

353
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,540
Stop right there!

354
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,050
Goo Ha Na, I'll kill you!

355
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,250
("Why Was Power Abuser Yoon Se Young
Left at the Altar?")

356
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,120
How do I take this down?

357
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,750
Tell them to take it down now.

358
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,630
You've reached Hyesung Hotel.
This is Travel Service Department.

359
00:20:55,530 --> 00:20:57,260
A boycott against Hyesung Hotel?

360
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,260
You're canceling your booking?

361
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,600
Because of the power abuse scandal
and the fake pregnancy?

362
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,840
What is this about?

363
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,610
People began a boycott
of Hyesung Group on the Internet.

364
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:09,710
What?

365
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,910
Darn it!

366
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,080
No way. Is this Se Young?

367
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:17,650
What is it?

368
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:21,520
It's titled, "Why Was Power Abuser
Yoon Se Young Left at the Altar?"

369
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,790
"The Truth Behind
Her Fraud and Fake Pregnancy."

370
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,320
Look at the comments.

371
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,390
"I knew she'd be like this."

372
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:30,130
"I went to school with her."

373
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,630
"She was the meanest even then."

374
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,670
"She deserves
to be left at the altar."

375
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,570
"Kudos to whoever exposed
her fake pregnancy."

376
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,370
- Yes!
- Yes!

377
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,210
Se Young will soon become
the most hated power abuser...

378
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,740
and the worst con artist.

379
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,310
That's what she deserves
after messing with Ha Na like that.

380
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,680
She's done for good.

381
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,450
- Yes!
- Yes!

382
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,490
Goodbye, Se Young.
I won't see you off.

383
00:21:56,490 --> 00:22:00,260
- We won't. Yes!
- Yes!

384
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,960
Look at this comment too.

385
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,530
There's a two-factor authentication
on the security server?

386
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,660
Yes.

387
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,270
It'll take longer
to find crucial evidence.

388
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,270
We don't have much time
until the founding anniversary.

389
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,940
Try to hack into the system
to find the authentication password.

390
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,380
Yes, sir.

391
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,980
Learn how to knock.

392
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,450
Where's Ha Na?

393
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,860
You two were behind
the power abuse scandal...

394
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,060
and the video at my wedding.

395
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,260
Did something else come out?

396
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,700
Don't you know?

397
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,630
It all hit the fan right now.

398
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,030
Who uploaded a video like that?

399
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,400
That's an invasion of privacy.

400
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,770
People began boycotting our hotel
after my scandal and that video.

401
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,210
They're canceling reservations,

402
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,280
and someone even petitioned
to have me fired.

403
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,180
Things are snowballing
out of our hands...

404
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,920
just before
the founding anniversary.

405
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,080
This concerns you too.

406
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,120
I even gave you the key
to the security server.

407
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,550
I thought we were on the same side.

408
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,060
Patch this up right away.

409
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,260
I'll ask
to have the video taken down.

410
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,730
Everything will come to pass.

411
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,030
We're after Chairwoman Shin,
not you.

412
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,600
Then, why are you messing with me?

413
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,500
We need to take down the minions
before the big boss.

414
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,740
Did you call me a minion?

415
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,200
So, why did you mess with Ha Na?

416
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,310
I'll patch it up, though.

417
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,780
But there's a problem.

418
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,740
- What?
- There was...

419
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,680
a two-factor authentication
on the security server.

420
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,580
You should be grateful
that it wasn't three or four-factor.

421
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,680
Handle it on your own.

422
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,120
I guess she doesn't know, either.

423
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,330
The chairwoman was
a corporate raider.

424
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,630
I spent a long time by her side,

425
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,370
so how could I not have known?

426
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,970
Is Ha Na really using Eun Chong
to get her revenge?

427
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,340
The chairwoman is the only one
who can resolve this tragedy.

428
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,130
Aren't you going to ask
how my audit went?

429
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,430
Did it go well?

430
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,830
Ha Na was the chief auditor.
You knew that, right?

431
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,530
I heard it from the chairwoman.

432
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,570
You seem very calm.

433
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,510
The office is a mess
because of Ha Na.

434
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,040
My power abuse scandal
and the wedding video broke out...

435
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,180
I'm the only one who's suffering.

436
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,080
Things will be rowdy for a while,
but it won't last.

437
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,680
Is that all you have to say?

438
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,450
Are you drawing a line to show
that there's nothing between us?

439
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,960
This is Ha Na's revenge.

440
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:48,060
I'll suffer.
No, I'll let her do this.

441
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,230
I did her wrong.

442
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,430
You can also decide
to suffer or fight back.

443
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,300
Her revenge
must be really sweet for you.

444
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:00,040
All right. Suffer for her.

445
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,940
She keeps harassing me like this,

446
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,580
so will that make me want to see
you and her together?

447
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,980
I already want to kill myself
for calling the wedding off,

448
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,350
but if you go and date Ha Na,
it'll be like killing me twice.

449
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,280
So, do not date her.

450
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Hey, Mom.

451
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,740
I just saw Se Young's
fake pregnancy video. Are you okay?

452
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,170
Yes.

453
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,440
Who spread that around?

454
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:39,310
I'm disgusted by her, but it's still
awful to expose her to the world.

455
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:42,110
The company will take a measure.
Don't worry.

456
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,210
Bye.

457
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,790
- Goodness.
- Reverend Mother!

458
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,430
What happened?

459
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,500
I was worried
after we lost our touch.

460
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,170
Things just happened.

461
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,900
Gosh, Ha Na.
You've become even prettier.

462
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:09,940
You look the same too.

463
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,940
- Are you in good health?
- Yes.

464
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,010
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

465
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,520
I miss Eun Chong too.

466
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,620
- I heard he started school.
- Yes.

467
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,990
Right. I also heard
he found his grandmother.

468
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,990
How did you know?

469
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,400
I met someone who knew Du Na.

470
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,570
Who?

471
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,000
Was it Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin?

472
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,300
No.

473
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,610
Then, was it her father?

474
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:50,110
Someone who was investigating
Du Na's hit-and-run accident,

475
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,020
but not a detective.

476
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,950
How did that person
become interested in her case?

477
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,490
I don't know what the story is,

478
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:06,700
but I hear exposing that accident
can put Eun Chong in danger.

479
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,730
Why? Do you have an update
on the accident?

480
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,170
Yes, it seemed like
the police was involved.

481
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,970
It was odd how
they couldn't catch the driver...

482
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,040
and wrapped it up
as an unresolved case.

483
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,250
I can see the reason
behind the suspicion.

484
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,350
Was that why you returned to Korea?

485
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,420
That and more.

486
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,160
How have you been?

487
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,060
A lot has happened.

488
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,930
Let me update you one by one.

489
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,930
Okay.

490
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,860
It didn't end
with the power abuse scandal.

491
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,270
The video
from my wedding is out too.

492
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,540
Gosh. I can't live in Korea anymore.

493
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,010
Is this your unlucky year?
Things are spiraling down early on.

494
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:52,380
Breaking off the wedding was
already too much to handle.

495
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,540
Is Aunt Yeo Jin mad?

496
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,280
What if I get fired?

497
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,350
If you do, you can
go study abroad with Eun Chong.

498
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,320
I don't think she'll let it go
because of the company image.

499
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,560
The founding anniversary is soon,

500
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,320
so Ha Na must've planned it
to shame me.

501
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,960
She put her life into this revenge,
so she'd do anything.

502
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,030
People began to petition
for Ms. Yoon's dismissal...

503
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,000
and started a boycott
for the hotel too.

504
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,670
The public is furious.

505
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,710
Our stock price plummeted
by three percent just today.

506
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,310
It'll put a toll on our promotion
as a social enterprise...

507
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:30,450
along with our upcoming
founding anniversary event.

508
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,280
You must make a decision.

509
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,050
Do I have to fire Se Young?

510
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:39,690
I'd be letting the Goo siblings
have their way in this revenge.

511
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,930
I need to meet Richard Han and ask.

512
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,700
I'll persuade him or threaten him
to make them stop this revenge.

513
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,900
- Has he not reached out yet?
- No.

514
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,670
He said he'd reach out
and asked you to wait.

515
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:01,140
The chairwoman won't admit to her crimes
even in the investigation.

516
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,750
If she does,
are you willing to compromise?

517
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,720
I could reconsider if she showed regret
and reflected on herself,

518
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:13,590
but she wouldn't mean it.
She'll go behind our back again.

519
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,090
What about the security server?

520
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,800
There's two-factor authentication.
It's not easy to find the password.

521
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,000
We have a week
until the foundation day, so I'm worried.

522
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,600
It's probably made of letters.

523
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,300
"Letters?"

524
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,480
I hear many corporate owners...

525
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,510
prefer letters rather than numbers
to heighten the security.

526
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,010
Maybe Hwang Jin Goo knows.

527
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,820
He doesn't even have clearance
to the security server,

528
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,420
so he wouldn't know the password.

529
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,020
He's close to the chairwoman,
so he could offer a hint.

530
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,760
Grandpa, do you know what AAP is?

531
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,860
"AAP?"

532
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,830
I learned it at school today.

533
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:59,970
It's a way to make up with a friend
after a fight.

534
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,240
A way to make up?

535
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,040
Admit to my mistake, apologize,

536
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:06,840
and promise never to do it again.

537
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,080
And for short, it's AAP.

538
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,580
My teacher said
it requires a lot of courage...

539
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,450
to forgive and make up.

540
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:20,520
That's right. It requires courage.

541
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,960
You just have to stick to AAP
if you want to take courage.

542
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,600
That's a wonderful idea.

543
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,830
If I do anything wrong to make
my friend mad, I'll do the AAP...

544
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,230
and say sorry.

545
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,240
I should do that too.

546
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,010
You're brave too, Grandpa.

547
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,450
Youngshin Fashion.

548
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,080
Victims of corporate raiding.

549
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,790
Their parents' car accident.

550
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,520
Those are all my fault?

551
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,690
It was just an accident.

552
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,330
Ms. Chairwoman.

553
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,170
Richard Han just reached out.

554
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,310
Make an appointment.

555
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:27,020
Ms. Chairwoman, Richard Han is here.

556
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,260
Okay.

557
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,970
It's me, Yeo Jin.

558
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,580
Why are you here?

559
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,540
Why are you...

560
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,350
I am Richard Han.

561
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,520
You're Richard Han?

562
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,350
(Cinderella Game)

563
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,580
- People have died!
- I didn't kill them!

564
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,790
I can't forgive you
for calling me a murderer.

565
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:06,120
We'll take anyone's hand
if that's what it takes to get Hyesung.

566
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,090
Do they know you're my husband?

567
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,390
Did you do this reluctantly
because the chairwoman made you?

568
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,830
The chairwoman
must admit to her crimes...

569
00:33:12,830 --> 00:33:14,230
and apologize before it's too late.

570
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,900
You'll regret this for a long time.

571
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,600
Shut it
if you do not have crucial evidence.

572
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:22,270
I'll make you pay
for every tear of blood my family shed.
