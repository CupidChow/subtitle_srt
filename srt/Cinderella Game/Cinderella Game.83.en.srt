1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,310
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,910
You must know why I'm here.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,810
Leave right now.

6
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,250
Please take Eun Chong.

7
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,020
Why should I?

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,720
He has nothing to do with me.
He's your blood.

9
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,520
Find a way to protect him
on your own.

10
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,290
I will resign...

11
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:24,060
and apologize.

12
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,150
So, please keep Eun Chong safe.

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:43,780
I beg you.

14
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:47,750
You ended up kneeling before me...

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,220
because of Eun Chong.

16
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,360
Yes.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,590
- I knelt before you, so...
- You're doing this for yourself,

18
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,760
trying to keep your blood safe.

19
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:01,770
Can you kneel before the victims?

20
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,840
No, right?

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,870
You can't do that.

22
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,610
- I'll do it.
- No.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,350
This wasn't the first time
you fooled me.

24
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:16,750
I'd be an idiot
to fall for this once again.

25
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,050
Stop putting on a show and leave.

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,890
How can I put on a show
while Eun Chong is in danger?

27
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,460
If you agree to take Eun Chong,

28
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,560
I'll resign as the chairwoman
and apologize.

29
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,960
Are you scared
you'll lose your family?

30
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,430
Do not resign or apologize.

31
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,130
Keep holding out.

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,370
Victims of your corporate raids
still live in that pain today.

33
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,510
It's your turn
to put up with that torture.

34
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,580
You said you raised him like your own.
How can you talk like that?

35
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,580
Don't you think you'll be tortured
if something happens to him?

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,880
How cruel.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,520
I even came here,

38
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,790
knelt, and begged you.
How can you not even blink?

39
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,020
I knew you'd be like this.

40
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,060
You'd never reflect on yourself
and apologize.

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,830
- It's all nonsense.
- Think of how desperate I am.

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,730
Then, you need to stop saying
you raised him like your own.

43
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,700
You told me
not to even speak of him.

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,440
You only take what will benefit you,
then toss the rest,

45
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,810
and you'll be
self-centered until the end.

46
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,640
All you care about is your family.
What about the victims' families?

47
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,350
Yes, so I said I'd apologize.

48
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,350
The reluctant apology you'll give
because of Eun Chong?

49
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,520
How is that an apology?

50
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,550
If you really want to apologize,

51
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,920
- then my parents' accident...
- There's a misunderstanding.

52
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,520
"A misunderstanding?"

53
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,330
Why is this corporate raider here?

54
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,770
I heard you ruined
my dad's business.

55
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,870
Do you know how tough
our childhood was because of you?

56
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:47,340
She's right.
Ha Na became the breadwinner,

57
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,170
quit school,
and went out to make money.

58
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,810
- Ji Seok took up manual labor...
- Enough.

59
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,380
She needs to know...

60
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,720
she's why life was
miserable and tough for us.

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,290
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,990
I'll compensate for everything,

63
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,220
so please just take Eun Chong.

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,830
What's she saying?

65
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,900
"Take Eun Chong?"

66
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,800
Why would we take him?
He's our enemy's blood.

67
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,730
I'll talk to her, so go inside.

68
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,470
- You can't take him back.
- No, Ha Na.

69
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,070
I made myself clear.

70
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,540
If I catch you talking to him
on the phone or contacting him,

71
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,310
I'll cut ties with you, too.

72
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,220
- I get it, so go inside.
- Darn it.

73
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,920
You heard them.
My siblings have a deep resentment.

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,900
Will Se Young's mom do something to him
right this instant?

75
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:49,770
She said she could kill him
in the worst-case scenario.

76
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,770
- She wouldn't.
- She's crazy for Hyesung.

77
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,670
She could do
whatever it takes to get it.

78
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,850
I can't let that woman live
in the same place as Eun Chong.

79
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:04,650
Then, you should kick them out.

80
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,850
I will, once Eun Chong is
somewhere safe.

81
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,730
Leave!

82
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,160
Do you think we're a joke?

83
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,070
How dare you bring us
the blood of our enemy?

84
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,530
Ms. Chairwoman!

85
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,170
- Stop it.
- Stop telling me to stop!

86
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,110
I deserve to vent this much
against my enemy!

87
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,680
Yes, Ha Na.
Stop telling us to calm down!

88
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,560
Please let him stay here
just for a month.

89
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,340
She said...

90
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,480
she could kill him
in the worst-case scenario?

91
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,750
I can't believe what she says.

92
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,050
No.

93
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,890
Are you all right?

94
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:24,760
I should send her
the voice recording.

95
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,230
She won't turn him down
once she hears that.

96
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,700
Yes, ma'am.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,370
Call Jin Goo.

98
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,540
Jeez.

99
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,410
Darn it. How can she be so brazen?

100
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,940
How dare she ask us
to babysit Eun Chong?

101
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,710
She needs to apologize
and step down first.

102
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,080
She thinks
we're the biggest pushovers.

103
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,890
We were easy to handle and pathetic,
so she thought we were a joke.

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,890
She'll step down and apologize...

105
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,820
if we agree
to take Eun Chong for a month.

106
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,420
- Really?
- Really?

107
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,890
No, I still can't do that.

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,600
How are we going to believe her?

109
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,200
I already declined, too.

110
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,870
He must be depressed again.

111
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,470
How does she call herself a grandma
if she can't look after him?

112
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,640
(Voice Recording 0123)

113
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,520
I'll get rid of whatever stands
in the way of your future with her,

114
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,850
no matter who it may be.

115
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,190
Eun Chong won't be an exception.

116
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,760
What is this?

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,060
That was Se Young's mom.

118
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,400
Play it again.

119
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,660
Okay.

120
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,800
(Voice Recording 0123)

121
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,500
I'll get rid of whatever stands
in the way of your future with her,

122
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:41,540
no matter who it may be.

123
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,110
Eun Chong won't be an exception.

124
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,380
Is she saying she'll hurt him?

125
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,550
Why is Se Young's mom saying that?

126
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,290
Was that why the chairwoman
asked us to take him?

127
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,220
Yes.

128
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,530
I still say no.

129
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,290
Anyone can make empty threats.

130
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:06,500
Yes, she wouldn't hurt him.

131
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,500
It doesn't matter what it is.
This is their business.

132
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,840
Why are you all standing around?

133
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,280
Is something going on?

134
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,220
Why is there salt in the front yard?

135
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,990
No matter who it may be.

136
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,060
Eun Chong won't be an exception.

137
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:37,300
This was
a voice recording I recorded.

138
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,330
How did Chairwoman Shin get this?

139
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,430
I don't know how.

140
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,370
I never knew
Choi Myung Ji could be so scary.

141
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,610
How can she say
something like this about Eun Chong?

142
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,640
There's now a higher possibility...

143
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,640
that she caused the accident
for Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

144
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,540
She could do that and worse.

145
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,210
Will you do as the chairwoman asked?

146
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,750
I can't bring him home
because of Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

147
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:04,060
They called her our enemy
and threw salt on her, too.

148
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,390
It was a huge mess.

149
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,790
They won't even let me
talk to Eun Chong on the phone.

150
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,590
But you can't just ignore this.

151
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:14,600
Are you all right with me
bringing Eun Chong here?

152
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,900
First, we should make sure
he's safe.

153
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,040
It's also a chance for you to think.

154
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,410
You said you'd think about him
after we got our revenge.

155
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,380
Okay.

156
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,780
Yes, Mr. Hwang.

157
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,050
Right now?

158
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,020
The chairwoman told me everything.

159
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,060
When she told me what happened,

160
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,160
I didn't think Se Young's mom
would go that far with him.

161
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,900
But I could tell from the recording
that those weren't just words.

162
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,970
I need to bring Eun Chong
out of that house.

163
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,670
- Then, will you...
- I can't have him at my place.

164
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,640
I don't want
to hurt my siblings anymore.

165
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,580
And if he moved in now,
he'd only be hurt.

166
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,180
We should find another place.

167
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,020
I gave it a thought on my way here,

168
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:14,190
and there was one place
he could go to other than my home.

169
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,790
Where?

170
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,600
Your place.

171
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,060
My place?

172
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,140
The person you have reached is...

173
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,940
Auntie Ha Na
won't pick up her phone.

174
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,710
You can try again tomorrow.

175
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,580
It's weird.

176
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,280
What is?

177
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,810
Last time, our call was cut off,

178
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,350
but she didn't pick up
when I called her back,

179
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,050
and she didn't call me back, either.

180
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,990
She must be quite busy.

181
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
Eun Chong, I need to take this call.

182
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,500
- Okay. I'll go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

183
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,270
Hey, Jin Goo.

184
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,840
He'll go to your place,
not Ha Na's place?

185
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,680
Yes, her siblings are
adamant about not having him,

186
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,880
so she suggested having him here
as an alternative.

187
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,320
There's no good reason
to send him to your place.

188
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,720
Myung Ji will think it's odd
if he suddenly goes there.

189
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,430
So, she won't change her mind
even after hearing...

190
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,960
that voice recording.

191
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,430
It seemed like she didn't want
to hurt her siblings anymore.

192
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,470
I get what you mean. Thanks.

193
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,140
Are you scared
you'll lose your family?

194
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,640
Do not resign or apologize.

195
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,310
Keep holding out.

196
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,950
Victims of your corporate raids
still live in that pain today.

197
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,020
It's your turn
to put up with that torture.

198
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,020
Do you know how tough
our childhood was because of you?

199
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,490
She's right.
Ha Na became the breadwinner,

200
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,360
quit school,
and went out to make money.

201
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,990
- Ji Seok took up manual labor...
- Enough.

202
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,530
She needs to know...

203
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,400
she's why life was
miserable and tough for us.

204
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,040
"Torture."

205
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,340
I also lived in torture
after I lost Yu Jin.

206
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,910
What I did...

207
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,380
made their lives torture.

208
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,300
You're resigning?

209
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,870
You should hold out until the end.
Why are you stepping down?

210
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,770
You said I'd be a nobody...

211
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,170
and sided with Goo Ji Seok already.
How brazen can she be?

212
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,010
Reporters and protestors are
all around my place,

213
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,140
yapping about my corporate raids
and murder instigation.

214
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,050
I hear the board
on our website is...

215
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,720
also flooded with posts
asking for my resignation.

216
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,220
The articles were pulled,
so it'd grow quiet after a while.

217
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,990
And you'll release
a rebuttal with the press, too.

218
00:11:57,290 --> 00:12:00,190
You can overturn
the public sentiment like before.

219
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,330
The stock price keeps dropping,
so I can't hold out much longer.

220
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,230
Then, why don't you make Se Young...

221
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,770
the head director?

222
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,770
Se Young has to go abroad
with Eun Chong.

223
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,010
You can take a higher position
when you return in a few years,

224
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,010
not just the director.

225
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,550
Do you mean it, Aunt Yeo Jin?

226
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,450
It'd be great if that happened.

227
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,920
While we're on the subject,
why don't you two leave first?

228
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,620
- I'm leaving, too?
- You can go and find a place...

229
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,560
and a school he'll attend.

230
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,970
Eun Chong can come with us
by next month.

231
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,030
We should go there with him.

232
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,270
I'll take him there.

233
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,810
Right. So, you're coming, too?

234
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,010
You won't get to live
a peaceful life under my roof...

235
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,540
once Eun Chong leaves this place.

236
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,060
Would it be better to leave
for a few years just as she said?

237
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,200
She even said
she'd make me the chairwoman.

238
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,130
We have to play the right moves
in this situation.

239
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,370
Your aunt is the old string,

240
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,540
but Goo Ji Seok is
the new string we can pull.

241
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,870
Goo Ji Seok?

242
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,340
I'm almost done
talking him into taking our side.

243
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,880
You handed over the clearance
for the security server,

244
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,480
so we must demand our share.

245
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,420
- Will he give it to us?
- I doubt it'll happen right away.

246
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:40,990
But he seemed happy to hear
he could work with you and date you.

247
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:46,230
We'll demand
one percent of the share from him,

248
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,870
putting us at seven percent.

249
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,100
Then, you're next in line
after Ji Seok.

250
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,070
I'm destined to take the position
after the next one.

251
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,880
Then, I won't go abroad.

252
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,280
Just go there for a year.

253
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,450
You need
to hold onto Eun Chong, too.

254
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,150
Who knows when Ji Seok will go down?

255
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,720
But Aunt Yeo Jin told me
to leave right away. What now?

256
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,790
You're right. And she told you
to leave Eun Chong here.

257
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,660
It doesn't seem right.

258
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:24,870
The voice recording was shared
between me, Mr. Han, and Danny.

259
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,370
How did the chairwoman get it?

260
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,940
Did she tap Choi Myung Ji's phone?

261
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,850
Hello?

262
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,890
Chairwoman Shin will resign tomorrow
and make a formal apology.

263
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,260
Are you serious?

264
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,960

267
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,610
I stand here today...

268
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,220
to make
my last official appearance...

269
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,220
as the chairwoman of Hyesung Group.

270
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:23,030
I created
a countless number of victims...

271
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,960
through my business activities.

00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,060
(A Public Apology from Chairwoman
Shin Yeo Jin of Hyesung Group)

273
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,770
I have also greatly damaged...

274
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,340
the honor and integrity
of the business.

275
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,710
Everything was caused...

276
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,310
by my lack of virtue
and a sense of responsibility.

277
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,810
In the end,
she decided to step down.

278
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,020
I especially wish to tell those
who were affected...

279
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,360
by my corporate raiding attempts
and brutal mergers...

(Conduct a thorough investigation!

281
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:55,860
that I apologize...

282
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,030
with all my heart.

Hwang Jin Goo,
you need to wake up, too!

289
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,980

for our parents.

ever since Sung Ho came back.

308

about the hit-and-run accident?

Her suspicion doesn't matter.
There's no evidence.

310

and there were no activities.

who broke the brakes...

when Director Goo's parents
got into that accident?

337
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:25,800
I'm trying to find them
in many different ways,

338
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,340
but it was a long time ago,
so it'd take a while.

339
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,670
I must find them...

340

so you should help me now.

Only after you find the truth
behind my parents' death.

347
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,670
I'm dying to do that myself,
so give me a little more time.

348
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,000
It'd be faster to admit to it.

349
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,230
I was falsely blamed, too.

350
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,470
Will you continue
to avoid Eun Chong?

351
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,040
You'll be nearby
even if he goes to Jin Goo's place,

352
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,810
so please frequent there
and look after him.

353
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,920
I ask of you.

354
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,860
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

355
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,840
Congratulations,
Chairman Goo Ji Seok.

356
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,370
Are you empty-handed?

357
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,940
Give me some time.
I'll come with a plant or something.

358
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,840
You may leave.

359
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,410
Have a seat.

360
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,790
I saw Chairwoman Shin leave.

361
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,190
Where did all her associates go?

362
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,860
Life is vain.

363
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,130
She said she'd reveal the truth
behind the accident, so let's wait.

364
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,570
She suddenly resigned
because of Eun Chong, right?

365
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:02,900
Probably.

366
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,270
She asked me to take care of him
as soon as she saw me.

367
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,210
Will you send him
to Hwang Jin Goo's place?

368
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,540
Yes.

369
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,180
I don't think I can persuade
Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

370
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,980
Are you going to be at peace?

371
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,450
- No.
- Then, try to convince the two.

372
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,060
Chairwoman Shin resigned,
so you have a reason to talk to them.

373
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,640
- Hello?
- I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

374
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,280
Are you happy now?

375
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,350
You can say whatever you want.

376
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,580
I'll accept it.

377
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,950
If you have any other sins,

378
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,420
I'll deal with those, too.

379
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,390
What are you talking about?
What other sins?

380
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,060
It's appalling to see you
act like a sinner before me.

381
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,360
I don't want to hear
these empty words.

382
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,070
Don't call me
unless it's about Yu Jin.

383
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,970
It's Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.

384
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,440
Did you find something?

385
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,980
Yes, let's talk in person.

386
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,710
Where can I meet you?

387
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,660
This is the video of her accident?

388
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,670
But I didn't find it
in the police's list of evidence.

389
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,570
It must've been
left out intentionally.

390
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,910
How did you find it?

391
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,340
I restored the memory cards
discarded by the police station...

392
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,010
that investigated her case
for the last five years.

393
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,520
Can you find the culprit
by using this?

394
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,990
Image restoration technology has
developed rapidly these days,

395
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,960
so we'll probably find something
once we do that.

396
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,460
- Really?
- We must find the culprit...

397
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,200
for Eun Chong's sake, Yeo Jin.

398
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,870
We should.

399
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,500
If Myung Ji
really did that to Yu Jin,

400
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,270
I'll kill her myself.

401
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,810
You should send Eun Chong
to a safe place first.

402
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,380
Have you thought of a place?

403
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,700
Why is the door locked?

404
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,310
You're up, Eun Chong.

405
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,180
The door was locked.

406
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,410
It wasn't.
Are you still half-asleep?

407
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,020
Eun Chong, are you hungry?

408
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,120
Can I visit Auntie Ha Na's place?

409
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,920
She's at work right now.

410
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,490
Then, can I visit
Uncle Ji Chang's business?

411
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,860
The tteokbokki place?

412
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,560
I'll let you go after you get
your grandma's permission.

413
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,270
It felt amazing
to see her step down.

414
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,740
I should've thrown it harder
back there,

415
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,210
- right to her face.
- Bam.

416
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,510
Auntie Ji Eun, Uncle Ji Chang.

417
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,010
Surprise! Did I get you?

418
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,780
Eun Chong, how did you come here?

419
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,080
I got Grandma's permission,

420
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,050
then my driver brought me here.

421
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:46,060
Do something.
I can't stand to see him.

422
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:47,660
Should I kick him out?

423
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,690
The kid isn't at fault,

424
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,760
so let's not show it for now.

425
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,530
Darn it. Whatever.

426
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,730
Hey, you can't run off alone.

427
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,080
What are you up to?

428
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,110
It's my family drawing of the day. Ta-da!

429
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,050
I drew all of us
eating tteokbokki together.

430
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,590
I drew one every single day.

431
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,360
Yesterday, I drew our family
all taking a nap.

432
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,930
- You can stop that now.
- Why?

433
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,540
Should I draw you
and Mr. Danny, too?

434
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,070
- No.
- Did you two fight?

435
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:40,280
Eun Chong,
you can't come here anymore.

436
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,310
Even if I have Grandma's permission?

437
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,380
No, don't come here.

438
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,520
- Why not?
- I'm busy.

439
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,420
I'll come when you aren't busy.

440
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,860
A small kid like you
should listen to what we say.

441
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,160
Don't come here.

442
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,860
Did I do something?

443
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,200
- No.
- No.

444
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,840
- Talk to her.
- Do you have something to say?

445
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,810
Yes, what will you do
about Eun Chong?

446
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,580
You said he'd be in danger
in that house.

447
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,450
What about that?

448
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,420
I was going to talk to you
about that.

449
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,730
I'm really sorry, but...

450
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,730
You're going to bring him here?

451
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,660
- Ha Na.
- I'm with her.

452
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,830
- Ji Seok.
- Ji Seok.

453
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,370
It's for a month.

454
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,800
I hate that
he's Chairwoman Shin's blood,

455
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,740
but if something bad happens to him,
will you two live in peace?

456
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,140
If yes, I'll side with you.

457
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,410
We raised him since he was one.

458
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,610
Can you put up with him
just for a month?

459
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,680
I ask of you. I won't ask for more.

460
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,720
Maybe this was
why he came to the tteokbokki place.

461
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,960
Or did Chairwoman Shin send him
as a part of her plan?

462
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,860
- Eun Chong was at your work?
- Yes.

463
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,530
Eun Chong may be
the blood of our enemy,

464
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,670
but this happened
before he was born...

465
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,440
No, before he was even conceived.

466
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,870
- He can't be guilty by association.
- He's right.

467
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,940
It feels wrong to turn away from him
while he's in danger.

468
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,280
Then, may I bring him home?

469
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,420
- It's just for a month.
- It's just for a month.

470
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,990
Okay. Thank you.

471
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,050
I knew you'd come through.

472
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,220
But he has to leave
exactly after a month.

473
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,490
That's a wise decision.

474
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,400
- Then, I'll call the chairwoman.
- Call her here,

475
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,260
where we can hear you.

476
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,830
Yes, okay.

477
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,000
Your uncle and auntie were odd?

478
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,870
Yes, I thought
they'd be happy to see me,

479
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,710
but they told me not to return.

480
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,280
Do they hate me now?

481
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:57,750
No way.

482
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:01,680
Are they annoyed by me?

483
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:05,790
No. No one would hate you
or feel annoyed by you.

484
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,120
You're such an adorable
and kind child.

485
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,190
Then, why did they tell me
not to come anymore?

486
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,000
I want to go.

487
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,330
I'm sorry, Eun Chong. It's my fault.

488
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,570
I made your life difficult.

489
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,140
(Goo Ha Na)

490
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,240
Hello?

491
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:31,280
I'll take Eun Chong.

492
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,020
Really?

493
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,690
- Did your siblings agree?
- Yes.

494
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,220
I'll pick him up tomorrow.

495
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,400
- It's Goo Ha Na.
- Let her in.

496
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,400
Why is she here?

497
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,480
Glad you're here.

498
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,190
Yeo Jin, did you know she'd be here?

499
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,690
What's going on, Aunt Yeo Jin?

500
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,120
- I'm taking Eun Chong.
- What?

501
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:17,730
- Yeo Jin.
- I'm sending him to her place.

502
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,530
Says who?

503
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:21,930
- You can't do this.
- It was my decision.

504
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,640
Auntie Ha Na!

505
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,700
Hey, Eun Chong.

506
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,770
Hey, there.

507
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,810
I waited for you every single day.

508
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,780
- Did you? You can come with me now.
- Okay.

509
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,050
Why are you
letting him go with Ha Na?

510
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,150
- Pack up his things.
- Okay.

511
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,760
- Let's go, Eun Chong.
- Okay.

512
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,930
- Yeo Jin.
- He could be exposed...

513
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,130
to reporters and protestors
if he went to school from here,

514
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,870
so I decided
to let her take him for a month.

515
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,570
I'll take him abroad after that.

516
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,840
Can you really trust her?

517
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,710
I had no other options.

518
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,180
That's the place
you'll live with Eun Chong.

519
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,520
Go there and set it up.

520
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,990
I'm hoping you'll leave
within the next week.

521
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,860
Wait, Yeo Jin, what's the rush?

522
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,560
And this is rather disheartening.

523
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,830
You should discuss
Eun Chong's whereabouts with us.

524
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,170
You said
Se Young should be his mother,

525
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,940
but you didn't ask for her opinion.

526
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,270
She would've said no.

527
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,850
Eun Chong, have fun
at your auntie's place.

528
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,920
Okay.

529
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,670
We'd be left empty-handed
if Ji Seok and Eun Chong took sides.

530
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,510
Is that why she wants
to send us abroad?

531
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,510
Did you do something wrong
to Aunt Yeo Jin?

532
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,880
What could I have done?

533
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,480
Will you let Ha Na
steal Eun Chong like this?

534
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,850
We'll get him back.

535
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,290
Anyway, her siblings must know...

536
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,460
he's the blood
of their parents' murderer.

537
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,830
Why are they accepting him?

538
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,830
Maybe they don't know
the victims were their parents.

539
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:35,500
The article mentioned the accident
without the victims' names.

540
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,300
You're right.

541
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,470
Okay. That's our plan.

542
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,610
Eun Chong will make a U-turn
and return as soon as he gets there.

543
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,850
All right. Be careful.

544
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:58,920
Let's go.

545
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,560
("Goo's Parents Were the Victims
of Shin's Murder Instigation")

546
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,860
What is this?

547
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,030
The victims of the car accident
instigated by the chairwoman were...

548
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,270
our parents?

549
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,510
Eun Chong's here.

550
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:19,810
Uncle Ji Chang, Auntie Ji Eun.

551
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,250
Did Chairwoman Shin cause...

552
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,280
our parents' car accident?

553
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,050
Is Chairwoman Shin the enemy...

554
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,190
who killed our parents?

555
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,800
Did you know about this?

556
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,600
(Hyesung Group: A Public Apology
from Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

557
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,370
(Conduct a thorough investigation!
Arrest Shin Yeo Jin immediately!)

558
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,560
(Cinderella Game)

559
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,860
Cut ties with Eun Chong.

560
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,560
Will it be Eun Chong or us?
Make your choice.

561
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,570
Myung Ji was involved in everything.

562
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,000
Look forward to how you'll end.

563
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,910
She found out everything
you told me to do! What do I do?

564
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,410
I won't destroy you.

565
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,680
Promise that you'll protect me.

566
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,880
We're the police.
You're under arrest.

567
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,280
Goodbye, Yoon Se Young.

568
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,280
Did you think you'd live
after deceiving me for 20 years?

569
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:08,180
Die!
