00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:07,980
(Episode 9)

5
00:00:13,619 --> 00:00:14,720
Come on in.

6
00:00:15,589 --> 00:00:18,320
He's President Hwang Jin Goo
of Hyesung Tour.

7
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,629
- My name is Hwang Jin Goo.
- I'm Goo Ji Seok.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,170
She's Team Leader Yoon Se Young
of Hyesung Tour...

9
00:00:33,409 --> 00:00:34,909
and my niece.

10
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:39,280
Hello, my name is Yoon Se Young.

11
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,179
Hello, I'm Goo Ji Seok.

12
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,020
And these two will marry soon.

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,929
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,899
Now, Hyesung Group is
in the hands of you three.

15
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:05,469
Think of each other
as comrades on the same boat...

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,569
and turn this
into a mutually beneficial relationship.

17
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:08,609
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,310
Then, please excuse me.

19
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:15,250
The young ones can bond.

20
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,909
Mommy.

21
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,780
Yu Jin...

22
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,099
You shouldn't run.
You might hurt yourself.

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,599
Mommy, there are
so many fish over there.

24
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,300
Really? Let's check it out.

25
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,180
Ms. Chairwoman.

26
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:26,479
What?

27
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:30,860
Let's go.

28
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,360
- Do you drink?
- I don't.

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,400
We have something in common.

30
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,069
Then, why don't we
just pour each other one?

31
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,900
Sure.

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,379
Please.

33
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:08,060
- Do you also not drink, Ms. Yoon?
- I enjoy it.

34
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,330
It's rather bitter today.

35
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,939
Should I order your favorite drink?

36
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,439
It's okay.

37
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,210
We ran into each other at the hotel
a few days ago.

38
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:25,840
I asked if you had seen
a young woman.

39
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,580
Yes, I remember that.

40
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,949
Did you find her?

41
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,719
Yes, thanks to your help. Let's eat.

42
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,659
I heard my position was
supposed to be yours.

43
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,860
It seems like I've taken it away.

44
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,599
Things always change
depending on the situation...

45
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,129
and the conditions
when it comes to work.

46
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,729
I thought the company made
the best decision possible.

47
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:51,840
Do you really think so?

48
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:53,300
Yes, however,

49
00:03:53,469 --> 00:03:56,539
I hope the new guy
doesn't drive out the old one.

50
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,780
You're quite honest.

51
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,080
If you do a great job at work,
it'll benefit Hyesung Tour.

52
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,349
You do know that Hyesung Hotel
and Hyesung Tour are...

53
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:06,449
partners in business
as the group's subsidiaries, right?

54
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,889
- Yes.
- I look forward to our endeavors.

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,360
I hope we'll continue to remain
as good partners...

56
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,659
and mutually benefit
just as the chairwoman wanted.

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,000
Now that work is on the subject,
I want to make an offer.

58
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:24,100
Allow me to report back
to the chairwoman from now on.

59
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:28,569
Until now, I heard you reported
in a private audience with her.

60
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:31,980
That could've happened
without the head director,

61
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,180
but you should report to me now.

62
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,750
- I'll do that.
- No.

63
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,750
The chairwoman wanted him
in a private audience with her.

64
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Her love for President Hwang
and Hyesung Tour is that profound.

65
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,990
She won't allow it.

66
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,100
She already did.

67
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,600
I'll do that.

68
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,480
What did you call the two
to discuss in private?

69
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:08,779
Was it about Jin Goo's promotion
as head director?

70
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,519
It was.
I told them someone else got the job.

71
00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:15,050
What?

72
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,990
"Someone else got the job?"

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,189
What do you mean, Yeo Jin?

74
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,459
Things happened.

75
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:25,800
Are you serious?

76
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,699
Wait, how can you do this
without talking to me?

77
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,410
How can you deceive
the three of us with one move?

78
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,709
The two of them
worked so hard to this day.

79
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,449
This is betrayal.

80
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:45,220
Watch who you're talking to.

81
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,620
One of the investors
recommended him to me.

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,949
I had to take him.

83
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,089
Was it Richard Han?

84
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,829
What's his relationship
with Richard Han?

85
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,160
Was it his son or something?

86
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:01,629
Well, what did Jin Goo say?

87
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,629
He said he'd comply
with the company's decision.

88
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,870
That was what he said,
but he couldn't be pleased.

89
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,439
Do you think...

90
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,980
I enjoy accepting an outsider
who hasn't proven himself?

91
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:16,079
I'll find a suitable chance
to kick him out.

92
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:19,180
So, you won't let him stick around
for too long, right?

93
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,490
You have to do that, Yeo Jin.

94
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,360
What's going on?

95
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,959
She appointed someone else
as the head director?

96
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,629
Yes, Jin Goo lost his chance.

97
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,259
He always acts like he's so smart,

98
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,230
yet he loses this chance
right before his eyes.

99
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:37,870
What an idiot.

100
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,000
Who are you calling an idiot?

101
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:44,379
Did you just say my son,
your future son-in-law, is an idiot?

102
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,180
Gosh. Money is always the problem.

103
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,449
Good grief. I have a huge headache.

104
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,519
If I may,

105
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,589
can I ask what the investor,
Richard Han, is like?

106
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,089
There's not much information
about him.

107
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,360
He's like my stepfather...

108
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:05,199
and a mentor.

109
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,370
He gave me
the turning point of my life.

110
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,540
You met a great man.

111
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,470
How did...

112
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,009
you two begin dating?

113
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,339
I asked him out.

114
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,680
I thought he was
a smart and boring guy as a kid,

115
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,990
but when I came back from America,
he had become exactly my type.

116
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,519
He was a gifted child
since his childhood.

117
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,930
The chairwoman noticed his talent
and took him in early on.

118
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,959
He's like the chairwoman's son.

119
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,660
- You shared too much detail.
- They were all factual.

120
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,240
You haven't married, have you?

121
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,699
Are you dating anyone?

122
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,439
We broke up.

123
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,079
She was a poor woman.

124
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:54,779
Do you know what a marionette is?

125
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,449
The doll that gets controlled
by someone who pulls the strings.

126
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,290
She was like a marionette
on the strings her mother pulled.

127
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,959
She was affected by
every single word her mother said.

128
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,290
In the end, she broke up with me
because her mother said so.

129
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,860
I'm sorry...

130
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,699
for that lady and you.

131
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:12,759
If I were her,

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,600
I wouldn't have
broken up with my man...

133
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,569
if I truly loved him,
even if I were controlled...

134
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,769
like a marionette.

135
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,240
Do you mean...

136
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,439
that woman did not love me?

137
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,050
How would I know? I'm not her.

138
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,949
We were passionately in love,

139
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,519
so passionate that
we were burning for each other.

140
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,519
Are you all right?

141
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,659
I shared too much detail.

142
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:46,059
Right, you two
went to the same university.

143
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,230
Have you two ever met?

144
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
There are lots
of international students there.

145
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,539
I wasn't in the same community
as other international students.

146
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:55,070
It's an unlikely coincidence
for the alumni to meet like this,

147
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,340
so let's make this work.

148
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,879
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you two, too.

149
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,850
Why don't we call it a day?

150
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,509
Shall we?

151
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:06,750
And again,

152
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,919
congratulations on your wedding.

153
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,860
- Good luck to you two.
- Thank you.

154
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,830
I'll get the car.

155
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,279
This is hilarious.

156
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,220
I can't believe
my fiancé's backstabber...

157
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,450
was you, Ji Seok.

158
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,659
Show me what you can do.

159
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,889
Prove what you can do
as Hyesung Group's head director,

160
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:51,559
not as a poor
and pathetic international student.

161
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:54,570
That's the only way
I'll approve of you.

162
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,340
Why do I need your approval?

163
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,940
I don't feel anything
even when I see you.

164
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,409
You're like plain water.

165
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:24,429
I let my guard down too easily.

166
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,269
Who knows what else
Aunt Yeo Jin is hiding to surprise us?

167
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,500
You need to show your talent
with this chance.

168
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:34,240
Show him that
Hyesung Group and you...

169
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,539
both aren't an easy fight.

170
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,309
Weren't you honestly bothered?

171
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,809
I'm only human,
so it's a bit disappointing.

172
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:45,220
He's an unsightly type
from another man's perspective.

173
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,519
What does he seem like as a woman?

174
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,320
He's not my type.

175
00:10:50,289 --> 00:10:52,019
I wasn't asking if he was your type.

176
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:56,029
I'm saying you look much cooler.

177
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,230
I wouldn't lose against him
when it came to my looks.

178
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:00,899
And what did he mean...

179
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:02,100
when he wished us good luck
on our wedding?

180
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,500
That was tough to analyze.

181
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,600
Just ignore him.

182
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,879
She'll spend...

183
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,879
the next few hours in Yu Jin's room.

184
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,549
Why did it have to be
across the hall from my room?

185
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,789
What if she does that
until late in the night...

186
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,590
Keep a straight face.

187
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,990
Why do you care so much
about some room?

188
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,529
Some nobody suddenly barged in...

189
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,330
and ruined everything for us.

190
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,929
I heard Jin Goo will follow
the company's decision.

191
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,139
We can't lose the investment.

192
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,269
It doesn't change the fact
he turned Hyesung Tour...

193
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,769
into the runner-up in the industry.

194
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,980
He should want to return
to the hotel.

195
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:55,080
No one notices anything he does
at some travel agency.

196
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,379
And when is Director Choi coming?

197
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,750
Before the appointment ceremony,

198
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,159
with information about Richard Han.

199
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,389
Anyway, who was it?

200
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,789
She was a poor woman.

201
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:14,870
She was like a marionette
on the strings her mother pulled.

202
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,700
She was affected by
every single word her mother said.

203
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,909
In the end, she broke up with me
because her mother said so.

204
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,480
Who was this punk?

205
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:26,139
I'm tired.

206
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,389
Yes, so we should...

207
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,820
trample on him
before he makes us more tired.

208
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,000
Have you ever slapped anyone?

209
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,600
That was so random.

210
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,299
I've pulled out someone's hair
and slapped their back,

211
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,210
but I've never slapped anyone.

212
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,039
I guess slapping isn't for everyone.

213
00:13:58,509 --> 00:13:59,779
Who are you talking about?

214
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,480
The evil woman who's hated by...

215
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,919
Never mind.

216
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,649
Hey, stop talking nonsense
and do as Seok Ki says.

217
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:11,059
You need to prioritize your life.

218
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,720
Will you really break up with him?

219
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:18,960
It'd be a huge twist
if Eun Chong's grandmother...

220
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,399
suddenly showed up
and turned out to be rich.

221
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,669
But something like that
only happens in dramas.

222
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,639
She must be without any family...

223
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,870
if she's in
the public welfare program.

224
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,840
He might be better off
not meeting her.

225
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:34,139
I just want to find her first.

226
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,080
And I wonder if she's still alive.

227
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,419
Gosh, where did she drop it?

228
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,389
Hey, forget it.

229
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,590
How are you going to find something
she dropped out on the street?

230
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,690
It was her mother's keepsake.

231
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,029
She got in the habit of
touching the brooch...

232
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:49,830
whenever she missed her.

233
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,730
Then, she must've dropped it
while fiddling with it.

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,269
You make your life
way too difficult...

235
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,500
because you empathize
with others too easily.

236
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:58,899
"While fiddling with it?"

237
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,370
Goodness.

238
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:06,879
- Thank you.
- Like this.

239
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:09,710
All right.

240
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,549
Yes, there was fiddling.

241
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,049
There was fiddling.

242
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,389
Hello? It's me, Goo Ha Na.

243
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,059
I remember seeing the brooch
when she put the hanbok on.

244
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,929
She must've dropped it there. Yes.

245
00:15:24,929 --> 00:15:27,429
May I come over tomorrow
and take another look?

246
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,830
All right. Okay.

247
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,639
Oh, my gosh. This is mine.

248
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:36,539
Thank you so much.

249
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,539
Thank you, Ha Na.

250
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,440
I'm glad, too.

251
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:43,179
I want to give you
a present of my appreciation.

252
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,620
No, never mind.

253
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,279
I just did what I needed to do.

254
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,120
It's my job
to make my customers happy.

255
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,690
You surely made me happy.

256
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:59,929
(Group Building Construction Order
Contract Signing Ceremony)

257
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,940
Daeri Group was very happy.

258
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,210
They said
they'd leave us in charge...

259
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,039
of incentive trips
for the entire group.

260
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,379
I have another piece of good news.

261
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,509
Hassan wants
to work with our agency...

262
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:17,409
on inbound tours
for people from Dubai.

263
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,080
Is that so?

264
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,950
How did he make you
an offer like that?

265
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,419
The complaint over dinner
on the first day turned things around.

266
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,360
She must've earned their heart
after switching to fresh halal meat...

267
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,990
and even bringing them
halal meal boxes.

268
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,000
The most decisive moment was
when she retrieved a brooch...

269
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,299
for Hassan's wife.

270
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,200
Who found that?

271
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,740
I heard it was the tour guide
who brought the halal meals.

272
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,940
She wasn't one of us.

273
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,870
- Show her our appreciation.
- Yes, ma'am.

274
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:45,740
Have you had a talk
with Director Goo?

275
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,580
Yes, he's now with us,
so I'll get the most use out of him.

276
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,850
Why do I need your approval?

277
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,389
I don't feel anything
even when I see you.

278
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,659
You're like plain water.

279
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,659
I don't care what you think is fun.

280
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:07,500
You'll be married soon.

281
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,839
Soo Jung, compare and analyze...

282
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,509
all tour programs
for Middle Eastern guests.

283
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,140
All right.

284
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,210
Wait, people from that region...

285
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,750
love Korean dramas and K-pop.

286
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,910
Exactly.

287
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,579
I think it'll be a great idea...

288
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:27,849
to collaborate
with K-pop concerts or drama sets.

289
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,589
Ms. Yoon?

290
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,759
What?

291
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,130
Ms. Yoon.

292
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,700
Find the contact for the guide
who found the brooch for Hassan's wife.

293
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:42,099
That guide stole our guest.

294
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:44,539
And if we were to nitpick over this,
she simply did her job.

295
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,240
It was
the chairwoman's special order.

296
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,710
Thanks to her,
we can attract more tourists from Dubai.

297
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,779
Soo Jung, when's the application due
for experienced operators?

298
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:53,809
This weekend, sir.

299
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,789
You should've asked her
to find you a job.

300
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:06,690
You went through all that
to find her brooch and got nothing?

301
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:08,359
How can a Korean tour guide...

302
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,589
shamelessly ask a guest from Dubai
to find a job for her?

303
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,000
I'd be a national disgrace.

304
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,059
So, you haven't starved enough.

305
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,700
No, I'm unbelievably starving.

306
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:16,299
I can even eat dirt.

307
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,630
Why would you eat dirt?

308
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:19,670
There's so much food here.

309
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,539
You can feast on
all-you-can-eat fresh ingredients.

310
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:26,079
You need to stop eating.

311
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,309
Stop taking so much.

312
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:28,380
Hey, give me that.

313
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,849
- Come on.
- Stop eating so much.

314
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,490
All right.

315
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,220
It looks so good.

316
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,630
It's so fresh and delicious.

317
00:18:49,769 --> 00:18:50,970
- Right?
- Yes.

318
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:53,269
Hey, instead of sitting around,

319
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,539
you should have
one last talk with Hwang Jin Goo...

320
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:57,470
about the experienced operator position
Hyesung Tour is hiring.

321
00:18:57,539 --> 00:18:58,880
Who knows what will happen?

322
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,809
And especially so
between a man and a woman.

323
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,079
Are you teasing me?

324
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,019
(Scumbag Seok Ki)

325
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,230
- What?
- Hey, where are you?

326
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,900
- Are you at home?
- No.

327
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:20,059
My mom says
she's going to your place now.

328
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,930
What?

329
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,099
Granny, who are you?

330
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,440
Do I look like a granny to you?

331
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm Lee Seok Ki's mother.

332
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,049
Good grief.
Look at this ridiculous house.

333
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,819
You're Mr. Seok Ki's mother?

334
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,119
Hello.

335
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,819
- I go to Chamsae Kindergarten...
- Stop.

336
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:49,559
Are you here because of Auntie Ha Na
and Mr. Seok Ki's marriage?

337
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:51,500
Marriage, my foot.

338
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,269
Let's talk outside.

339
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,440
Auntie Ha Na.

340
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:01,069
Eun Chong, go to your room. Okay?

341
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,940
Let's talk outside.

342
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,910
Seok Ki and I broke up,
and I'd never meet him again.

343
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,980
How dare you play dumb?

344
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:17,750
You should've handled the money
issue as soon as you broke up.

345
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,019
How much
did you extort from Seok Ki?

346
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,930
There's more than
the 50,000-dollar bank loan, right?

347
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,130
That's all.

348
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:26,130
I was never behind on paying
the principal and the interest.

349
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,430
I also plan to pay the rest.

350
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,069
I had the IOU notarized, too.

351
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:30,869
What good will that do?

352
00:20:30,869 --> 00:20:33,539
It'd be useless once you ray off
with the 50,000 dollars.

353
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,539
Gosh, you must have extorted
so much money...

354
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,180
from my innocent son all along.

355
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,910
Just thinking about this
makes me shudder.

356
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:44,150
Your situation was absurd enough
with that baggage.

357
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,180
That's enough.

358
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,049
And now, there's a money problem?
Do you think he's an idiot?

359
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,950
I apologize for taking out a loan
under his name.

360
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:53,160
But I won't run away with it.

361
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,029
I'll spend the rest of my life
paying it back if I must,

362
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,630
so please go home.

363
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,059
The rest of your life?
Do you think I'm stupid?

364
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,730
Take the lease out of this place
and pay my son back first!

365
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,799
As you have seen already,
this is how I live.

366
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
I can't pay that back right away.

367
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,269
Even if I wanted to,
I didn't have the money to do that.

368
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,180
- If you wait...
- "Wait?"

369
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:13,710
What the heck is wrong with you?

370
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,609
- Come here!
- Let go of me!

371
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,309
I won't let you go
until you pay the money!

372
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,680
- Auntie!
- Let go of me!

373
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,049
- Not until you repay him!
- Stop hitting her!

374
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,319
Stop hitting her.

375
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,390
How dare you bite me?

376
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,930
Are you okay, Eun Chong?

377
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:32,900
Hey! That little thing is vicious.

378
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,130
Did you not learn
to respect your elders...

379
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,569
because you were raised
without proper education?

380
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,470
I'll put both of you behind bars!

381
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,769
You were the first to attack me
both verbally and physically.

382
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:44,009
I can't condone this anymore,
so leave.

383
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,680
So what?

384
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,910
Will you report me for assault?

385
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,980
Go ahead.

386
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,579
I'll sue you for fraud
under false promises of marriage.

387
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,480
I clearly warned you, didn't I?

388
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,349
That you'd see worse
if you didn't listen to me.

389
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,490
I left you here at your place today,

390
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,289
but next time, you'd be behind bars.

391
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:01,759
Bring my son's money back
within a week...

392
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,190
if you don't want to get arrested!

393
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:08,170
Three months.

394
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,799
This ridiculous girl is
trying to buy some time?

395
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
You get just one month.

396
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,509
I'm not very patient.

397
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,910
If you don't keep your promise,
I'll set your place on fire.

398
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,609
How did he get involved
with these ridiculous and lowly things?

399
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,519
Woman!
Were you talking to my family?

400
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,289
Who the heck are you?

401
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,490
Darn it.

402
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,960
Hey, woman!

403
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,700
Who is that woman? What's going on?

404
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,730
She's Mr. Seok Ki's mommy.

405
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,069
What?

406
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,400
Then, what's with the air in here?

407
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,039
Why is she making a scene?

408
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,039
Does he know his mother is here?

409
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,150
He's ignoring my calls.

410
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,380
Hang up.

411
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,450
We broke up.

412
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,789
Ha Na.

413
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,230
Who was the woman that just left?

414
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,460
That punk, Lee Seok Ki's mom.

415
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,200
Ha Na isn't marrying him.

416
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:21,170
Why not?
I thought the meeting went well.

417
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,089
I'm sorry.

418
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,569
Hi-yah!

419
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:26,200
Let's go.

420
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,480
(Burn in eternal fire.)

421
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,579
(Lee Seok Ki, you scumbag.
What a funny name.)

422
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,789
(You're a sly rat.
Goodbye, ugly guy. Loser.)

423
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,660
Let's keep it a secret from Ha Na.

424
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,460
That he had another woman.

425
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,000
It'll only hurt her to find out.

426
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:58,900
- And to Ji Seok.
- Why not?

427
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,869
Ha Na would be humiliated.

428
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:04,609
She couldn't be
more humiliated than this.

429
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,950
Hey, stop crying, man.

430
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:12,819
(You're a sly rat.
Goodbye, ugly guy. Loser.)

431
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,180
- Stop crying.
- Gosh.

432
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:33,500
I need to find
50,000 dollars in a month.

No rain, no flowers?

That's our family motto.

437
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:15,309
"No rain, no flowers."

438
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,519
- If it doesn't rain...
- Flowers don't bloom, either.

439
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,549
It means good days will come
if you endure bad days.

440

Remember those words
whenever you face trouble.

441
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:27,819
Okay.

442
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:30,430
Will I ever see good days?

443
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:33,029
Mom, Dad.

444
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,210
You can't even put on socks.

445
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:53,349
How much
did you extort from Seok Ki?

446
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:55,220
There's more than
the 50,000-dollar bank loan, right?

447
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,420
That's all.

448
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:01,220
Uncle Ji Chang,
how many 50 cents fit into 5 dollars?

449
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:03,660
- Why do you ask?
- How many?

450
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,299
Don't you know?

451
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,400
Ten, obviously.

452
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,069
Ten.

453
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,420
(1. I will walk your dog
for 50 cents an hour.)

458
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,440
It is hard to take out a loan

I'd love to help you,

461

but there was a limit
to foster home loans.

- How is it?
- You should try some, too.

468
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:50,000
- Okay.
- Here.

469
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,569

It's so good.

- Oh, no.

474
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,609
I'm sorry.

475
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,819
Did you say your aunt
can't marry because of you?

476
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:55,789
Yes, was I punished
for doing something bad?

477
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,990
"Something bad?"

your sneakers?

Hey! My sneakers!

480
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,710
You need to apologize first.

481
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,650
I won't give them back
if you don't apologize.

482
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,390
I'm sorry.

483
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,589
I ruined your auntie's face.

484
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:26,319
So, you did that.

485
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,589
Here. Don't do that from now on.

486
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,329

many good things from now on.

Auntie Ha Na be happy. Please?

Auntie!

490
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:51,380
Did you have a good day? Let's go.

491
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,039
Eun Chong was heartbroken
that you were unable to marry...

492
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,670
because of him.

493
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,269
And he was worried
about your layoff, too.

494
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:24,980
Eun Chong, I didn't break up
with Mr. Seok Ki because of you.

495
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,880
The two of us broke up...

496
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,549
because it was time
for us to separate.

497
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:34,059
Without me, his mommy could have...

498
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:37,089
He still wouldn't have married me...

499
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:39,500
even if you weren't around.

500
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,559
Why not?

501
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,069
You'll find out when you grow up.

502
00:32:45,869 --> 00:32:48,809
Also, I'll get a job soon.

503
00:32:49,069 --> 00:32:50,640
Really? Where?

504
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,740
I'll turn in my resume
to just about every company.

505
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,180

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,250

508
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,019

510
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:55,140
Auntie, did you get the job?

511
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:57,140
I passed the application screening!

512
00:33:57,569 --> 00:33:59,079
Why did it have to be Hyesung Tour?

513
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,180
Congratulations, Director Goo.

514
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:03,150
I have high expectations
of both of you.

515
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,720
Hyesung Tour is undergoing
a business contract with Dubai.

516
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,579
How dare she turn in
an application to our business?

517
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:12,489
She'd pass 100 percent
if only Hwang Jin Goo didn't come.

518
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,360
Who's Hwang Jin Goo?

519
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,829
All right.
I'll settle this for good today.
