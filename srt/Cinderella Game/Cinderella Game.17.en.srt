1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,509
Where are the discount stores
for children's clothing?

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,949
Auntie Ha Na, come here.

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,519
Yes? Where are you going?

7
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:21,690
Eun Chong, I don't need any clothes.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:24,629
You're free to try them on.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,699
I'll take pictures of you
in pretty clothes.

10
00:00:29,269 --> 00:00:31,399
Hello. Please come in
and try some on.

11
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:41,810
These two are a set.

12
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,479
Try that one.

13
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,439
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

14
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,579
Thank you.

15
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,980
Eun Chong.

16
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,750
Why did you run out alone?

17
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,129
Oh, my. Hello, Chairwoman Shin.

18
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:32,459
- Ms. Goo.
- Yes.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,530
Right. Say hello to her, Eun Chong.

20
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,439
She's the chairwoman
of my workplace.

21
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,670
The chairwoman?

22
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:41,870
Then, is that the highest position?

23
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,340
Yes.

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,780
Hello. My name is Lee Eun Chong
of Chamsae Class...

25
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,480
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

26
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,489
Auntie Ha Na, you look so pretty!

27
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,760
Ma'am, you look great in this.

28
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,099
That's the last of your size.
You should take it.

29
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,030
It's all right.

30
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,370
It looks great on you.
Let me give it to you as a present.

31
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,569
Goodness. No, Ms. Chairwoman.

32
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,169
I want to do that.

33
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,310
We got that contract with Dubai
because of you, too.

34
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,710
- Sorry?
- Don't say no and keep it on.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,280
It looks great on you.

36
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,110
No, it's too much for me.

37
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,120
It's not good manners to turn down
your elder's favor persistently.

38
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:30,520
In that case, thank you very much.

39
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:35,129
We got the contract with Dubai
because of me?

40
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,939
Yeo Jin, you were here?

41
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:50,780
Oh, hello, Ms. Yoon.

42
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,979
Hello, ma'am.

43
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,379
Why are you here?

44
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,020
Head Director Goo's
older sister, right?

45
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,759
"Head Director Goo's older sister?"

46
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:07,060
Yeo Jin, you didn't know?

47
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,360
Mr. Goo's older sister
got a job here in Se Young's team.

48
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,500
Is he your son?

49
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:19,599
He's my nephew.

50
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,770
- Hello.
- Yes, sure.

51
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,419
Grandma. I mean, Ms. Chairwoman.

52
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,349
This is my present.

53
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,090
So, Yeo Jin.

54
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,530
You should
hold onto Yu Jin's jewelry.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,099
Thank you.

56
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,270
You would've felt even better
if you went to the spa, too.

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,069
I'll draw a bath for you.

58
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,669
You should take a bath,
then get a massage.

59
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,860
Hello?
Ms. Jang, did you look into it?

60
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,129
Yes, according
to the private detective,

61
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,470
he couldn't find the contact
for the young woman...

62
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,639
who visited the island.

63
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,310
Find out her appearance,
what she was wearing, or her name.

64
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,939
Tell him to find whatever he can.

65
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:32,040
Let him know I'll compensate
if he finds anything.

66
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,079
At the very least,
I hope I find out her name.

67
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,899
Grandma. I mean, Ms. Chairwoman.

68
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,769
This is my present.

69
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:03,810
Don't I look awkward?

70
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,410
I'm not used to this kind of luxury.

71
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,050
I've never put on
such expensive clothes.

72
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,250
No, it looks perfect on you.

73
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,949
You look like a celebrity.

74
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:13,579
You're prettier than celebrities!

75
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,019
Let me take pictures for you.

76
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:25,560
You look completely different
in that new outfit.

77
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:28,670
Ha Na, you should
go to work in this on Monday.

78
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,069
Teach a lesson to those brats
who are suspicious of you.

79
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:34,269
Did someone get suspicious of you?

80
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,540
No.

81
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,379
That was unnecessary.

82
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:42,610
Anyway, why did the chairwoman buy you
such an expensive outfit?

83
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:46,350
She said they got the contract with Dubai
because of me,

84
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,290
but she must've mistaken me
for someone else.

85
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Can I really take this?

86
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,019
Should I return it to her?

87
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,519
Why would you do that?

88
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,860
You should cut the tags off
so that she wouldn't ask for it.

89
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,629
Wait, she got you shoes, too?

90
00:05:58,629 --> 00:06:01,769
Hey. Don't touch those and cause trouble.

91
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,370
Eun Chong,
I'll get changed and come out.

92
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,709
- Let's go to the marketplace.
- Okay.

93
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,540
You're going there right after
returning from a department store?

94
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:11,079
I'm visiting
Ji Seok's place tomorrow,

95
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,339
so I need to make some side dishes.

96
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,879
We end up with physical strain
because we have no money.

97
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,949
I'll make lots of money...

98
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:20,120
and let you shop for groceries
at the department store, too.

99
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,519
All right. Sure. Thanks.

100
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,790
- Hello.
- Hey, there.

101
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:28,889
- Five half-dried pollacks, please.
- Sure.

102
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,600
Give us big ones with lots of meat!

103
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,129
All right.
I'll pick out the biggest ones.

104
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,300
Thank you.

105
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,569
Look at that.

106
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,600
Can I have five half-dried pollacks?

107
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,910
- Hey, it's been a while.
- Yes.

108
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,779
I've been feeling busy
after my son fixed his wedding date,

109
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,310
although I wasn't much involved.

110
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,209
I hear the girl is
from an affluent family.

111
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:51,680
Yes, and she's pretty.

112
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,519
- Have a great business.
- Thanks. Goodbye.

113
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,589
- How much do I owe you?
- Yes, ten dollars.

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,089
- Thank you.
- Sure.

115
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,930
Goodness. What am I going to sell
if you keep nibbling on those?

116
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,029
Come on. You have so many.

117
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,230
- My gosh.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,139
- Sure. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

119
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,310
Where's the duck?

120
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,879
Mom, are you sure
you're making whole duck soup?

121
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,620
Pull out a pot from down there
to boil the duck.

122
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,490
- I don't see any duck.
- What do you mean?

123
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,220
It couldn't have found its wings
and flown away.

124
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,259
What is this?

125
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,000
Where's my duck?

126
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,199
(Whole Duck)

127
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,370
She got duck?

128
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,670
Did Ji Seok ask you to make
whole duck soup?

129
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,209
No.

130
00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:53,310
Wait, what?

131
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:55,779
What is this?
Why do I have this duck?

132
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:59,250
I still have the half-dried pollack.

133
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,050
Anchovies, bean sprouts,

134
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:03,319
spinach, and pork are all gone!

135
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,420
I didn't see them.

136
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,689
I'd love some whole duck soup.

137
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,529
Did my grocery bag get mixed up?

138
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:10,930
So, you didn't get these?

139
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,759
What's wrong, Auntie Ha Na?

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,470
Eun Chong, I think
my grocery bag got mixed up.

141
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,370
Where did it happen?

142
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,209
Was it when I got
the half-dried pollack?

143
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,009
Wait, it was that granny!

144
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,379
It must've gotten mixed up
right here.

145
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,090
Did anyone come by
with a mixed-up grocery bag?

146
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,350
No.

147
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,419
How did you end up
with the wrong grocery bag?

148
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,559
I must've been out of my mind.

149
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,929
If she comes by,
tell her where I live.

150
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,899
I live over there,
in Gureum Apartment.

151
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:46,960
"Gureum Apartment?"

152
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,600
Go straight...

153
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,740
and cross the crosswalk
to find an alley.

154
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,840
You'll see it
if you keep going down that alley.

155
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,240
She lives on the third floor.

156
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,440
The third floor. Thank you.

157
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,480
Let's go.

158
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:04,120
Hey, this must be it.
Let's go inside.

159
00:09:05,179 --> 00:09:06,250
Let's go.

160
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,850
Mom?

161
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,159
Goodness. Hello.

162
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,830
By any chance, the grocery bag...

163
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,029
What? Mr. Hwang.

164
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:23,700
Why are you here, Ms. Goo?

165
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,299
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

166
00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:29,169
What brings you here?

167
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,169
Oh, my.

168
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,340
I didn't know this was your place.

169
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,009
Yes, right.

170
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,549
I came for the grocery bag
that got mixed up.

171
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,019
That was yours?

172
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,049
My mother went to the marketplace
to find her grocery bag.

173
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,559
Anyway, come in.
I need to put on some clothes.

174
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:48,759
Yes, okay.

175
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, my.

176
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:55,399
She came while I looked like this?

177
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,779
That must be Mr. Hwang, his mommy,
and his daddy, the three family.

178
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:09,679
I guess so.

179
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,120
She won't pick up her phone.

180
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,750
Would you like a cup of tea?

181
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,149
No, thank you.

182
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,960
She's here.

183
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,759
Jin Goo, did the lady
who took my groceries come by?

184
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:25,129
- She did.
- Hello.

185
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:27,059
I'm sorry. I must've taken...

186
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:29,070
Wait.

187
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,370
Bang Ul, can you make us some tea?

188
00:10:32,669 --> 00:10:33,970
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

189
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,049
Do you two know each other?

190
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,679
No, how would we know each other?

191
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,450
No, we've never met.

192
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,220
I'm sorry. We had the same bags,
so we must've gotten them mixed up.

193
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,629
The supermarket in the neighborhood
gave it out during their opening,

194
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,929
so just about everyone has that.

195
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,929
Please check your things
and take them.

196
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:01,399
Okay.

197
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,899
Let's see.

198
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,500
I'll take that.

199
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,480
Do you have all your stuff?

200
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,149
What?

201
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,809
Well, I ate some.

202
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,549
How much do I owe you?
Let me pay for it.

203
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,679
Never mind. It's all right.

204
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,360
Goodness,
half the bag is gone already.

205
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,159
I'm sorry. My younger brother is
very quick when it comes to food.

206
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,360
I'll pay you.

207
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,500
Let's just call it even.

208
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:33,629
Do you have everything else?

209
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:36,000
Yes.

210
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,539
You should stay alert as a mother.

211
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,440
Aren't you too young
to be forgetful?

212
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,840
Mom, she's not a mother.

213
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,309
I'm sorry.

214
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,580
Granny, you took it first.

215
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:50,649
- What?
- You picked up...

216
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,279
my auntie's grocery bag first...

217
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,779
at the dried seafood store.

218
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:55,190
Eun Chong.

219
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,820
Really? I didn't know that.

220
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,029
I'm sorry.
I should stay alert, not you.

221
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:03,490
I didn't realize it, either.

222
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:07,700
So, she isn't your mommy,
but your auntie?

223
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,870
Yes, Mom. She works at my office.
Her name is Ms. Goo Ha Na.

224
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,600
- And he's...
- Hello.

225
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,110
My name is Lee Eun Chong...

226
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,809
of Chamsae Class
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

227
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,440
Let me introduce myself again.

228
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,179
- My name is Goo Ha Na.
- It's nice to meet you.

229
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,049
I felt too rushed
and didn't even say hello.

230
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:27,320
You look very clever and handsome.

231
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,950
And you're friendly, too.

232
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,220
Thank you.

233
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:36,590
Well, may I have a word with you?

234
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,299
Okay.

235
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,799
Goodness. Hey.

236
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,470
Please keep it a secret from my son.

237
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,980
That you saw me
at the chairwoman's place.

238
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,039
Yes, don't worry.

239
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,549
Can I put my trust in you?

240
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,149
Of course.

241
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,879
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Yes?

242
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,789
Do you want this?

243
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,549
This is all I have to give you.

244
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,860
Thank you.

245
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:07,929
Do you live nearby?

246
00:13:07,929 --> 00:13:10,860
Yes, I live in the alley
off the intersection.

247
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:17,899
Yeo Jin, I'll be in the living room.
Call me if you need anything.

248
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:19,639
I don't need anything.

249
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,039
Then, have a relaxing bath.

250
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,389
I'll stick it under her bed.

251
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:45,059
Yu Jin, please disappear
from your mother's mind.

252
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,299
That's the best you can do for her.

253
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,470
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Shh.

254
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,710
Does it actually work?

255
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:06,879
That's why
I'm sticking it under this.

256
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,289
And I'm adding my prayer,
hoping it'll work.

257
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,470
Hey.

258
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,240
Please keep it a secret from my son.

259
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,769
That you saw me
at the chairwoman's place.

260
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:31,940
Why is Mr. Hwang's mother...

261
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,610
working at the chairwoman's place
without his knowledge?

262
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,779
My gosh.

263
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,120
Gosh, your place looks great.

264
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,960
It looks like a place
you see in dramas.

265
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,519
- Isn't that so, Eun Chong?
- Yes.

266
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,190
Gosh, it's so soft.

267
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:52,330
You should sit here, too.

268
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,330
Yes, it feels wonderful.

269
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,470
How much does this place cost
per square meter?

270
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:01,909
At least 30,000 dollars, right?

271
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,809
Did he buy this unit?
Or is he taking out a lease?

272
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,879
So what if he bought this?

273
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,809
Do you suddenly
want to move in here?

274
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,009
If this fancy place
accepts someone shabby like you,

275
00:15:10,549 --> 00:15:13,720
it'll plummet the quality
of the residents here, so no.

276
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,450
Please be content
with your status as a visitor.

277
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,320
You aren't any better than me.

278
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,289
We may have been poor,
but we don't look it.

279
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:23,289
Isn't that so, Ha Na?

280
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,230
I told you to put on the outfit
the chairwoman bought you.

281
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,929
"The outfit
the chairwoman bought you?"

282
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,639
Never mind.
I was just talking nonsense.

283
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:35,769
Right? Were you dreaming
in the broad daylight?

284
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,009
So, where's Ji Seok?

285
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,049
- You're here.
- Hey, Ji Seok.

286
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,419
Are you leaving?

287
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,450
Hello, Uncle Ji Seok.

288
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,019
Hey, have fun while you're here.

289
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,360
I left my credit card on the desk
so you could all eat out.

290
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
We don't need to go out.

291
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,730
I brought some food.
You should eat lunch before you go.

292
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:56,830
Yes.

293
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,360
You need to stick around
when you have guests at your place.

294
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,559
Don't run away
as soon as we get here.

295
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,070
She made your favorite dish,
braised half-dried pollack.

296
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,870
And your favorite, doenjang stew.

297
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,879
Eat up.

298
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,210
I'm so sick and tired
of your neverending crush.

299
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,509
Are you jealous?

300
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,220
- You've finally lost it.
- What took you so long?

301
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:24,690
It had been so long
since we all ate together like this.

302
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,990
It's the first time
after Ji Seok left abroad to study.

303
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,230
It's been over five years.

304
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:32,230
That was when I was two years old.

305
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,299
You're right.
You probably don't even remember.

306
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,299
Let's meet like this
and eat together from time to time.

307
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,610
You two always meet at work.

308
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:45,679
And we need to keep some distance
to maintain a good relationship.

309
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:50,279
Yes, what happened to that incident
Yoon Se Young staged?

310
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,720
Everything is over.
You don't have to bring it up.

311
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,590
Auntie Ji Eun,
don't you get bored...

312
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,860
when you are alone
in a huge place like this?

313
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,990
I'm not here alone.
I'm with Uncle Ji Seok.

314
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:02,529
And who cares if I'm bored?

315
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,700
It had always been my wish...

316
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,859
to live in a vast and big place
with high ceilings.

317
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,799
But it mostly seems like
a quiet temple,

318
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,039
so it's nice to have
lots of company.

319
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,339
Isn't that so, Ji Seok?

320
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,210
I hired a maid.
You don't need to make food anymore.

321
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,480
I rarely eat at home anyway.

322
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,049
Is that so?

323
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,490
I have to go.

324
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,049
Bye, Ji Seok.

325
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,789
Goodbye, Uncle Ji Seok.

326
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,230
It probably isn't easy
to be such an eyesore all the time.

327
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,029
He didn't even finish half a bowl.

328
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,769
Give me that.
I'll finish everything.

329
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,670
Did you find out?

330
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,809
As you said, a powerful variable
has come into the picture.

331
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,180
Is this about her daughter?

332
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,210
Her DNA might be a match
with a missing person...

333
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:58,019
who could be her daughter,

334
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,720
so she conducted
a parentage test, too.

335
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,019
She's waiting for the result.

336
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,089
I didn't think this was possible,
but what would happen...

337
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,490
to Hwang Jin Goo and Yoon Se Young
if her daughter came back?

338
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,859
Timing would be an issue,

339
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,230
but in the end,
they'd have to give it up to her daughter.

340
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,299
The two must know that already.

341
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,269
Would they really want her
to find her daughter?

342
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:16,329
I don't think so.

343
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,740
I should report back
to Mr. Han, right?

344
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,869
I'll do it. What about Dubai?

345
00:18:20,869 --> 00:18:22,470
Hassan won't budge.

346
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,809
Ms. Goo Ha Na was
a tough card to beat.

347
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:27,950
I'll find something
stronger than that,

348
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,680
something that'll put political
and economic pressure on him.

349
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,619
Yes, Daeri Construction is his partner,
so dig into that.

350
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,759
Goodbye.

351
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:41,589
(Mr. Han)

352
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:46,359
The phone is turned off. Please...

353
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:47,900
Is something going on?

354
00:18:56,809 --> 00:18:58,779
- What brings you here?
- I live here.

355
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,710
What about you?

356
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,009
My newlywed home is here.

357
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,519
- What are the chances?
- I wonder.

358
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:09,119
I heard the perpetrator
at the ceremony was bailed out.

359
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,890
It was a surprise that
the chairwoman suddenly settled.

360
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,789
She's wise and generous,

361
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,460
so she must've made a good decision.

362
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,359
"Wise and generous?"

363
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,359
You don't know a thing about her.

364
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,599
Or is he feigning ignorance,
although he already knows?

365
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,369
The case was sealed,

366
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,700
so you should focus on
the bet you have with me.

367
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:30,069
I look forward to seeing
your work at full power.

368
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,980
I hope you're prepared,
Director Goo.

369
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,480
There's nothing for me to prepare.

370
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,849
I'm getting misunderstood
because of your presumptions.

371
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,890
So, I'll make sure I win.

372
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:49,490
Has Richard Han decided
on the date of his return?

373
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,529
It'd take longer than he planned.

374
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:54,059
- All of a sudden? Why?
- He must have a reason.

375
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,500
Because he's suspected as an investor...

376
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,670
trying to destroy Hyesung Tour?

377
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,740
Don't jump to a rash suspicion...

378
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,740
and make your decision
after you meet him.

379
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,970
Will he ever come back?

380
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,440
There's no reason not to.

381
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,920
(International Arrivals)

382
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,660
Director Goo lives in our apartment?
Are you serious?

383
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,769
I met him at the entrance.

384
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
He doesn't live in a unit across
or next to us, right?

385
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,309
Well, could the worst happen?

386
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:37,440
That'd make our lives too difficult.

387
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,609
Do I have to live with this tension
at home, not just in the office?

388
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,349
Should we move?

389
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,990
We don't need to go that far.

390
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,720
He wouldn't get stressed out.

391
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,319
He enjoys messing with us.

392
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,359
What did he say?

393
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:56,490
Mr. Goo?

394
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,730
The case was sealed,

395
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,329
so you should focus on
the bet you have with me.

396
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,670
I look forward to seeing
your work at full power.

397
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,339
He was just leaving,
so we only said hi.

398
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,019
She won't notice
the paper talisman, right?

399
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,720
She'd never look down there.

400
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,990
Yeo Jin, do you need any help?

401
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,490
No.

402
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,559
That must be Bang Ul.

403
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,170
The duck was so fresh and meaty.

404
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,910
I simmered it since last night,

405
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:49,910
so I just had to throw in abalone,
octopus, and vegetables.

406
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,819
These were all grown
in the countryside,

407
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,619
so she liked how good she felt
after she had this dish.

408
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,589
Goodness, she must feel
anxious and nervous.

409
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:03,390
She'll love it.

410
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,230
So, is she in her room?

411
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,569
It'll be nice
for her to have a bowl now.

412
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:10,500
She must feel uneasy.

413
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,970
She's cleaning Yu Jin's room.

414
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,940
I hope they call soon
with either good or bad news.

415
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,740
Even I began to feel agitated
as I waited.

416
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,549
You couldn't feel
more anxious than the chairwoman.

417
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,650
My gosh.

418
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,519
We don't have to state the obvious.

419
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:27,980
Oh, my gosh.

420
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:34,660
(Missing Persons Unit)

421
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,660
Hello?

422
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,700
Yes, do you have the result?

423
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,369
What do you mean?

424
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:50,569
There was no biological relationship
between the missing woman and you.

425
00:22:52,109 --> 00:22:54,140
So, she wasn't Yu Jin?

426
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,279
No, I'm sorry.

427
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,420
You said there was a possibility
because the DNAs matched.

428
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,150
There's nothing more accurate
than that.

429
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:03,789
The DNA that matched with the woman
we presumed as your daughter...

430
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:07,289
So, the DNA you registered
20 years ago...

431
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,660
must've been contaminated.

432
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:10,730
"Contaminated?"

433
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,660
How can that...

434
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,599
But first, I need to meet that girl.

435
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:17,869
I'll know when I meet her.

436
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:19,769
I can recognize my daughter.

437
00:23:19,769 --> 00:23:22,309
I need to ask her first.

438
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:24,910
I'll ask her, then get back to you.
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,380
Hello?

440
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,250
No, she has to be Yu Jin.

441
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,680
This time, I know it.

442
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,890
She said she'd come and see me.

443
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,720
The DNA has to be hers.

444
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:45,059
So, the DNA you registered
20 years ago...

445
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:46,599
must've been contaminated.

446
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,430
How could it be contaminated?

447
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,839
Did someone...

448
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,269
tamper with it on purpose
to prevent me from finding Yu Jin?

449
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,990
Yeo Jin, Bang Ul asks...

450
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:12,619
My goodness! Yeo Jin!

451
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:16,160
What do I do? Yeo Jin!

452
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,430
Honey, it's been ten years.

453
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:25,640
Have you been well?

454
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,710
Sir, please go to Hyesung Hotel.

455
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,410
Yes, sir.

456
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,779
(Emergency Response)

457
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,779
(Emergency Response)

458
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,980
Wait.

459
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:59,769
Sir, I'm sorry to ask,
but can you follow the ambulance?

460
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:03,210
All right!

461
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,509
Hey! How dare you
get on my bed with dirty feet?

462
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,609
Get off.

463
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,980
- I feel so full and drowsy.
- Get off.

464
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,190
- I'm going to take a nap.
- I'm sleepy, too.

465
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:20,059
Gosh, I'm so sick of both of you.

466
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,490
Wait, what is this smell?

467
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
Oh, my gosh.

468
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,869
- It's the witch's spit!
- The witch is mad!

469
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:37,710
His room is way too clean for a guy.

470
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,480
Gosh, that totally shows
his personality.

471
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,329
You only act cold on the outside...

472
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,240
and say we aren't family
because we have no blood relations.

473
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,339
It'd be nice to live
the way we did with our parents.

474
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,640
Why do you keep going astray?

475
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,990
Auntie Ha Na,
is this Uncle Ji Seok's room?

476
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,319
Yes, come here.

477
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,289
Look at that. Isn't that cute?

478
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,730
Wait.

479
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,329
Hello, Detective Min.

480
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,539
"Eun Chong's grandmother?"

481
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,940
Where is she right now?

482
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,339
The hospital?

483
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,349
Revenge? I already said
I had zero feelings about you.

484
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:54,049
I'm only doing my job.

485
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,220
Do you want me to get my revenge?

486
00:26:58,359 --> 00:26:59,960
Is that a sort of regret?

487
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,490
He must've moved
near my newlywed home on purpose.

488
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,000
I can't focus.

489
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,329
Then, take a nap.

490
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't feel sleepy.

491
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,009
This was our sweet home until now,

492
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:17,769
but it felt like jail
the moment I found out Mr. Goo lived here.

493
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:20,779
Then, let's live here for a while,
then move soon.

494
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,250
I can't focus, either.

495
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,250
Should we go to your place?

496
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:27,779
My mom made duck soup
and went there.

497
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,420
The chairwoman must feel
frustrated and anxious...

498
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,849
waiting for the police to call,

499
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,390
- so let's go and keep her company.
- Okay.

500
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:37,990
Yes, Mom.

501
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,599
The chairwoman?

502
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:42,500
Which hospital?

503
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,339
Thankfully, she received
excellent first aid,

504
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,069
so her blood pressure
and oxygen saturation became stable.

505
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:52,980
We'll conduct other exams
when she wakes up.

506
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,339
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you.

507
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,720
She must've received a call
from the police...

508
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,420
before she collapsed.

509
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:06,059
Then, the girl
wasn't her daughter? Again?

510
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,160
Hey, stop jinxing this.

511
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,730
Goodness.

512
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,230
- Mom.
- Hey.

513
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,329
Hey, you're here.

514
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,329
Is she all right?

515
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,029
She got sedated and fell asleep.

516
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,970
The police must've contacted her.

517
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:22,170
I'll look into it.

518
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,809
Her DNA was contaminated?

519
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,910
How could it be contaminated?

520
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,150
What did the chairwoman say?

521
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,420
She seemed greatly shocked.

522
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,789
Yes, I understand.

523
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,920
The result is out.
She wasn't her daughter.

524
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,059
She collapsed
after receiving that call.

525
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,660
I feel so bad for her.

526
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,099
What will she do, Jin Goo?

527
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,309
And what was contaminated?

528
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:59,240
Her DNA was contaminated,
so the match itself was wrong.

529
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,009
That's impossible.

530
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,210
How could the DNA at the police station
get contaminated?

531
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,980
Let's not show our concern
in front of the chairwoman.

532
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,759
Your aunt and uncle's DNAs were
contaminated a long time ago.

533
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,930
The DNA...

534
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,269
will never help her find Yu Jin.

535
00:29:33,009 --> 00:29:34,109
Detective Min.

536
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,450
Where is Eun Chong's grandmother?

537
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,849
There's something
we need to check first.

538
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:47,259
I feel so bad for Yeo Jin.

539
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,059
She prayed at the temple
every single day...

540
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:53,460
and got her hopes up,
thinking she'd really meet Yu Jin.

541
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:55,630
How can fate be so cruel?

542
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,529
Wasn't 20 years long enough?

543
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,769
How can she suffer like this again?

544
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,039
Mom, you should go home.
I'll give you a ride.

545
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
It's okay. I can take the bus.

546
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,549
You should be here
when she wakes up.

547
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,049
We'll be here,
so he doesn't need to stay.

548
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,420
You should let your son drive
and go home comfortably.

549
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:15,690
You should do that, Mother.

550
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,950
Just grab me a cab out in the front.

551
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,759
She'll want you when she wakes up.

552
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,569
Is Grandma very sick?

553
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,369
We need to check and see...

554
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,680
if she really is your grandmother.

555
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,349
And to do that,
you need to do a test.

556
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,380
A DNA test?

557
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,049
What a smart boy.

558
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,480
It won't hurt,
and it'll end quickly.

559
00:30:57,430 --> 00:31:00,500
Goodness, Yeo Jin. Are you up?

560
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,130
Let me call the doctor.

561
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,769
You're at the hospital.

562
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:11,210
Do you remember collapsing
in Yu Jin's room?

563
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:14,210
It could've been much worse.

564
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,349
You collapsed in shock
and went into hypotension.

565
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,450
Yu Jin.

566
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:27,390
Yu Jin. I need to meet her.

567
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,089
Yeo Jin, you must brace yourself...

568
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,200
in times like these.

569
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,160
You'll find another chance.

570
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,829
The DNA was contaminated.

571
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:40,900
Someone is trying to stop me
from meeting Yu Jin.

572
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,009
Everything was fabricated.

573
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,009
You're very quick to catch on.

574
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,680
You already guessed that far?

575
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,079
Yeo Jin, you should calm down first.

576
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,950
Once you feel better...

577
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:54,619
I need to go to the police station
and check this myself.

578
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,019
I need to see it.

579
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,849
Goodness, Yeo Jin.

580
00:31:58,049 --> 00:31:59,660
Yeo Jin.

581
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,220
- Go get Dr. Hong.
- Okay.

582
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:05,359
Goodness. You need to lie down.

583
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,279
(Cinderella Game)

584
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:28,849
I don't trust the police anymore.
I'm going to the NFS.

585
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,710
Can you find a way?

586
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:33,180
When will you have the result?

587
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,650
She must be my grandmother.

588
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,220
I'll do whatever it takes
to finish this search.

589
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,759
If that suspicion was correct,
then who would do that?

590
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,690
Someone who doesn't want
the chairwoman's daughter to return.

591
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,859
Just do everything I tell you.

592
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,559
What are you trying to get
by provoking me?

593
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:50,029
It's exciting.
