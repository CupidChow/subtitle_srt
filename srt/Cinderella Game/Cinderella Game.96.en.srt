1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,950
(Episode 96)

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:19,160
Wait, aren't you Detective Cho?

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,730
- Who are you?
- We met at the casino in Gangwon.

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Wait a moment.
Here's my business card.

8
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,210
Detective Cho?

9
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,780
What's going on?

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,160
Hey, let go of me. Let go.

11
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:07,610
What is this? Darn it.

12
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,010
Let go of me.

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm a detective.

14
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,550
Who are you two?

15
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,090
The police will be here soon.

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,000
You have the right
to consult an attorney.

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,130
Are you two...

18
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,270
detectives?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,740
- No. We're...
- No. We're...

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,670
- law-abiding citizens.
- law-abiding citizens.

21
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,870
Darn it.

22
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,340
Hey.

23
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:46,980
You're bleeding.

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,480
I'll put ointment on it later.

25
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,080
You should
call the chairwoman first.

26
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,620
Okay.

27
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,170
You must be Detective Cho Byung Jin.

28
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,570
Yes, I am. Who are...

29
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,070
I'm the mother to Yoon Yu Jin,
the woman who died...

30
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,810
in a hit-and-run accident
seven years ago.

31
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm Yu Jin's dad.

32
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,610
A hit-and-run accident?

33
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,810
Yoon who?

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,550
Myung Ji made you stage
Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident...

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,990
Yeo Jin.

36
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,820
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,290
Myung Ji and I are old friends,

38
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,960
but I never took a penny from her.

39
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,260
On top of that, I have no idea
what hit-and-run accident this is.

40
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,460
Bring my daughter back.

41
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,400
Who do you think you people are
to do that to her?

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,470
What's wrong with you?

43
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,910
I'll make sure I find evidence...

44
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,540
and lock you
and Myung Ji up in prison.

45
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,740
You hid yourself well
for the last seven years.

46
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,380
But you can't do that anymore.

47
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,010
When will the investigation begin?

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,880
My daughter, whom you allegedly
don't know, is named Yoon Yu Jin.

49
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,150
We'll meet again very soon.

50
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,140
You got arrested?

51
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,440
Someone must've found out
we were meeting there.

52
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,450
So, Sung Ho and Yeo Jin
came to see you?

53
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:30,480
The couple came together
and even grabbed me by the collar.

54
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,120
They asked
if I took money from you...

55
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,020
and acted as a broker
for the accident.

56
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,720
And what did you say?

57
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,420
I acted like I didn't know anything,
so don't worry.

58
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,190
There's no evidence
for the hit-and-run accident,

59
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,660
so they'll take you in
for accepting bribes.

60
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,330
They'll detain you
to begin investigating the accident.

61
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,070
Yes, so find an attorney for me
as soon as possible.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,440
I won't share your name,
so don't worry about that.

63
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,810
Okay.

64
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,610
Hey, Attorney Kim.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,310
I need you to go
to the police station now.

66
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,780
Detective Cho
and the driver must know each other.

67
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,020
Why don't we conduct
a confrontational questioning?

68
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,820
That's a great idea.

69
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,790
He keeps refusing to see us.
Will he agree to do that?

70
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,690
Mr. Yoon kept sending him food...

71
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,390
and wrote him many letters,
so shouldn't he meet him?

72
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,230
He's completely under
Myung Ji's grip.

73
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,300
Were you hurt?

74
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,570
Yes, right. One moment, please.

75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,580
You got hurt trying to save me.

76
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
Didn't we have great teamwork?

77
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,190
Except that you got hurt.

78
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,260
It's a glorious wound for me.

79
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,130
Did that hurt?

80
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,030
It was cold.

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,100
Something like that can't hurt me.

82
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,030
No way. I'm sure it stings.

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,870
I'm glad it wasn't any worse.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,440
All my pain goes away...

85
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,640
when you touch it.

86
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,970
Then, I'll keep my hands on you.

87
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,560
We should be together...

88
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,630
until the end of time.

89
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:27,470
Until the end of time.

90
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,570
You're fine, right?

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,020
Mr. Yoon.

92
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,720
Yes?

93
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,120
You can meet him.

94
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,760
- Please follow me.
- Did he agree to see me?

95
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,190
Yes.

96
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:56,790
Thank you.

97
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,620
Thank you for coming.

98
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,930
I have nothing to say.

99
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,000
Please stop sending me letters.

100
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,600
I came to say that.

101
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,700
Then,

102
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,270
please hear me out.

103
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,610
I can't bring back my late daughter.

104
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,480
But help us bring her justice...

105
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,080
and let her bereaved family...

106
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,720
say goodbye to her in peace.

107
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,820
There is...

108
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,090
nothing I can do.

109
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,690
He's my daughter's son.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,800
This child is now eight years old.

111
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,540
You took his mother away from him.

112
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,910
I'm not asking for anything much.

113
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:20,680
Just testify the name of the person
who told you to cause the accident.

114
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,550
You must know who Choi Myung Ji is.

115
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,020
- I don't.
- And Detective Cho Byung Jin.

116
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,860
I don't.

117
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,260
Detective Cho...

118
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,370
was arrested
and put under interrogation.

119
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:43,730
Even if you hold out,

120
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,640
it'll be the end of you
as soon as he talks.

121
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,810
You have a daughter, too.

122
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,180
You needed money because of her.

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,750
Would your daughter be happy
that you did something like this?

124
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,220
You can't undo
the crime you've committed.

125
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,250
But you can be forgiven.

126
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,420
Please help me.

127
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,030
Just testify that
Choi Myung Ji was behind this.

128
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,700
Then, I will...

129
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,330
forgive you and help you.

130
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,750
Did you meet him? What's he like?

131
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,880
He was an ordinary man.

132
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,750
How did he end up
doing something like this?

133
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,850
It had to be money.
What else would it be?

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,450
- Will he help us?
- Not yet.

135
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,220
But I thought meeting him was
a huge success today.

136
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,520
I'll do whatever it takes
to persuade him.

137
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,560
Our best move is to make the driver
put pressure on Detective Cho...

138
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,800
and then let him spill the beans
on Myung Ji.

139
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,100
We have to get the two
in a confrontational questioning.

140
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,670
Okay.
I'll try to let that happen, too.

141
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,110
They'll try to persuade those two.

142
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,340
Do not let them conduct...

143
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,080
- a confrontational questioning.
- No, ma'am.

144
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,880
Let Detective Cho know...

145
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,780
that he'll be dismissed or suspended
for accepting bribes,

146
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,790
but if he's charged
with murder instigation,

147
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,520
his life will be ruined altogether
whenever you meet him.

148
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,690
Tell him
not to worry about his family.

149
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,790
Yes, ma'am.

150
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,330
I just received an update...

151
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:21,600
that the hit-and-run driver
agreed to meet Mr. Yoon.

152
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,300
What?

153
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,600
He held out well to this day.
Why did he suddenly do this?

154
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,180
He can't begin to meet them.

155
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,380
Ban him from accepting visitors
starting tomorrow.

156
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,280
Find a way to send the hit-and-run driver
to another detention center.

157
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,550
The hit-and-run driver?
The one who hit Yu Jin?

158
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,000
What are you up to?

159
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,800
Please excuse me.

160
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,840
- Sure. Good work, Attorney Kim.
- Yes, ma'am.

161
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,180
I heard something
about the hit-and-run driver.

162
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,950
What was that about?

163
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,680
What hit-and-run driver?

164
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,820
I was discussing your embezzlement.

165
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,150
She was talking
about the hit-and-run driver.

166
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,220
Did she really do that to Yu Jin,

167
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,490
just as Aunt Yeo Jin said?

168
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,460
Was I sued for embezzlement?

169
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,760
Not yet.

170
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,430
Why hasn't Yeo Jin sued me yet?

171
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,940
I find that suspicious, too.

172
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,970
And I returned the million dollars,
so don't worry.

173
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,840
- Where are you going?
- I'm meeting my blind date.

174
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,310
You made a wise decision.

175
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,250
If he says something about
the article on your embezzlement,

176
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,480
tell him everything was fabricated,

177
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,050
that we're the victims.

178
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,420
I'll manage.

179
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,720
Since when did you manage anything?

180
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,190
It's belated, but I'll do it now.

181
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,730
And smile, will you?

182
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,160
Your life isn't over
just because you're fired.

183
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,970
You can get married
and become an even bigger success.

184
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,840
Goodness.

185
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,810
Do you not mind even
if my mom and I are both criminals?

186
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,180
There's only a hair of difference...

187
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,110
between what's illegal, expedient,
or legal when you run a business.

188
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,580
You were unlucky, so you got caught.

189
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,850
How generous.

190
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,850
An embezzlement charge is
not even a problem.

191
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,090
But there was talk
about how you two were behind...

192
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,060
the accident that killed
Chairwoman Shin's late daughter.

193
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,760
You two didn't do that, did you?

194
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,000
What's with that serious face?

195
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,370
I was just checking.

196
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,900
Honestly speaking,
my parents were against you.

197
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,910
You've been in too many scandals,
so the whole nation knew about you.

198
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,150
But I told them
that I wanted to marry you, so...

199
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,780
- Let's get married.
- Really?

200
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,520
I know you have
lots of women in your life.

201
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,220
- Them? It's...
- I don't care.

202
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,660
You can date them.

203
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,130
I also know that you gamble.

204
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,890
Keep doing it. It's not my money.

205
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,000
Do you mean it?

206
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,670
Yes.

207
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,530
You're almost too chill.

208
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,140
I heard about your family, too.

209
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,370
Your mom has
complicated money problems,

210
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,570
and you've separated
from Chairwoman Shin, too.

211
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,110
I don't care.
My family has more money.

212
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,650
Just let us never worry about money.

213
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,750
That's all I want.

214
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,720
That's a given.

215
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,850
Let's marry within three months.

216
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,790
Three months? I'm down.

217
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,260
We seem to speak the same language.

218
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:45,300
I'll need more money
to keep Detective Cho...

219
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,610
and the driver's mouths shut.

220
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,240
I should sell off this house
as soon as possible.

221
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,250
Or should I use that money...

222
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,780
to hire someone and kill the driver?

223
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,580
Ms. Choi.

224
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,950
Yes? I want to sell the place
as soon as I can.

225
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,090
The faster, the better.

226
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,260
Many people will come and see it
when I tell them...

227
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,190
that it used to belong
to Hyesung's chairwoman.

228
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,790
No, just show it to people
who actually want to buy it.

229
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,160
It's not an attraction.

230
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,730
- Okay. Please excuse me, then.
- Goodbye.

231
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,910
- You're back already?
- Are you selling the house?

232
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,710
It's a hassle to start a renovation,

233
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,680
so we'll sell it
and move somewhere else.

234
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,750
How did it go?

235
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,150
I'll marry him.

236
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,150
Really?

237
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,570
Use this chance
to leave your mother...

238
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,400
and live on your own.

239
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,770
Everyone is once a rando.

240
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,710
Even if I pick and choose,

241
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,140
men are all the same.

242
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,850
So? Will you marry him?

243
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,350
Yes, Ji Seok.

244
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,720
I'll marry him.

245
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,190
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

246
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,560
You'll abandon me now that
you got a good use of me?

247
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:18,030
I helped you take this position,
Ji Seok!

248
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,760
Did you really rat me out?

249
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,900
That's enough.

250
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,870
It's all your fault.

251
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,010
She got fired...

252
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,670
and cut ties with her mom.

253
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,610
She must be having a rough time.

254
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,330
You should stay seated.

255
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm perfectly capable of moving,
so I should help out.

256
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,230
I need to earn my keep, too.

257
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:01,210
I'll go over to your place
to grab Eun Chong's toys.

258
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,140
Are you sure you can go alone?

259
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,080
I'll go with Jin Goo.

260
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,750
Hey, stop making such a fuss.

261
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,550
Come and eat.

262
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,660
Eun Chong, how many times
do I have to say no...

263
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,960
to the pot lid alarm?

264
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,820
It wasn't a pot lid today.

265
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,190
You must've acted
as your uncle's alarm very often.

266
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,100
Yes, he was
Uncle Ji Chang's alarm clock.

267
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,540
- I'll use a recorder tomorrow.
- No way.

268
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,970
Yesterday, I saw you making
only shrieking sounds on it.

269
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,880
Then, I'll practice some more
before I use it to wake you up.

270
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,310
I'll set an alarm
and wake myself up,

271
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:43,580
so just eat your food.

272
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,580
- Come here.
- Stop it.

273
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,520
Cut it out.

274
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,230
I set up a meeting on the weekend
to meet the man's family. Okay?

275
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,860
You can manage this.

276
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,900
It's not like
you're walking into your death.

277
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:05,700
Jin Goo must've felt like this...

278
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,940
when he had to marry me.

279
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,210
Don't think like that.

280
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,180
You should look forward
to living a good life with him.

281
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,810
And go on a few dates, too.

282
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,220
Is that the realtor?

283
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,730
I came to get Eun Chong's toys.

284
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,100
Did you take off the cameras, too?

285
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,330
I'm doing what I want with my home.
Is there a problem?

286
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,970
Take your stuff and go.

287
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,670
Yes, Jae Jun.

288
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,670
I heard our families were meeting
on the weekend to discuss our marriage.

289
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,410
We can meet
at the Western cuisine restaurant...

290
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:45,480
at the Hyesung Hotel.

291
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,050
Yes.

292
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,280
Se Young is marrying...

293
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,950
the son of a rich family.

294
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,020
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

295
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,300
- Hello. Feel free to look around.
- Sure.

296
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,670
The place looks great.
Why are you selling?

297
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,210
I'm sick of the place.

298
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,080
You took good care of it,

299
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,380
although it hasn't been renovated
in a while.

300
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,510
Yes, once you buy it,

301
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,350
you can turn the place inside out.

302
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,620
Are you selling this house?

303
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,920
Mind your own business and leave.

304
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,660
She put the house out on sale?

305
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,470
She knows I gave birth to Yu Jin
and raised her there,

306
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,940
so she's trying to mess with me.

307
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,410
Did you apply for an injunction
to prohibit disposition?

308
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,740
Yes, it'll take some more time
until the decision is made.

309
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,580
I'll try to stop
the house from selling.

310
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,350
Please don't worry about it.

311
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,820
That impudent woman.

312
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,250
Se Young is getting married?

313
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
Who told you that?

314
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,360
I heard it at her place.

315
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,190
She was on the phone with the guy,
saying they'd meet on the weekend...

316
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:12,160
at the Western cuisine restaurant
at the Hyesung Hotel on the weekend.

317
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,200
You didn't know?

318
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,200
No.

319
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:19,470
How is marrying this easy?

320
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,870
It's like she went out to shop.

321
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,410
I heard you were getting married.

322
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes.

323
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,110
With who?

324
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,020
- You saw him.
- That blind date?

325
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,650
Do you know what he's like?

326
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,990
A rich womanizer...

327
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,660
who likes to gamble.

328
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,130
Why are you suddenly marrying
a man like that?

329
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,630
- Did your mom make you do this?
- Yes.

330
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,940
I'll grant her one last wish...

331
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,570
and escape from her grasp.

332
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,210
I don't want to be
miserable anymore.

333
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,080
You said you'd rebel against her.

334
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,210
I am rebelling.

335
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,580
I won't see her anymore
as soon as I marry him.

336
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,320
I wasn't picky about anything.

337
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,020
All I wanted was money.

338
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,950
Then, things became very simple.

339
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:14,090
Love? I don't need that.

340
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,430
Don't do it.

341
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,430
Who do you think you are?

342
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,030
It's not like you'll marry me.

343
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,140
You don't want me,

344
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,470
but you also don't want
others to have me?

345
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,040
Do you think marriage will
help you escape from your mom?

346
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,880
How are you going to do that
by giving up on yourself?

347
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,410
Go abroad to study instead.

348
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,580
Don't say it like you care.

349
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,220
If you think about it,
you're the meanest one.

350
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,620
Do you know how miserable I feel?

351
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,560
You took advantage of me,
then abandoned me.

352
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,360
But my mom will never leave me.

353
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,230
Well, she'll only sell me off.

354
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,500
Yes.

355
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,040
Both your mom and I
gave you a hard time.

356
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,600
Why are you adding to this?

357
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:02,640
It's your life.

358
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,540
You should reconsider.

359
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,050
I'll live a good life
as if I'm rubbing it in your face.

360
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,250
Are you marrying him
to rub it in my face?

361
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,920
I have no idea.

362
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,320
I felt like
I should at least get married.

363
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:25,760
If life gets too tough,
I'll just divorce him.

364
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,700
It's appalling
to see you seem concerned.

365
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,970
Don't ever call me again.

366
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,170
You and I are over.

367
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,940
If I ask you to be with me,
will you say yes?

368
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,940
Why?

369
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,110
Are you going to marry me?

370
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,210
- It's already too late.
- Why?

371
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,190
Marrying someone my mom wants is...

372
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,460
one last present I can give her.

373
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,670
The driver wanted to meet you?

374
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:11,240
Yes, I'm on my way to see him.

375
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,740
Do you want to come?

376
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,010
Of course, I'll go.

377
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,810
Call me when you're nearby.

378
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,220
Is something going on?

379
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,120
The driver reached out to Sung Ho
and said he wanted to meet.

380
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,960
Really?

381
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,230
That sounds like good news.

382
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,230
I'm sure it is.

383
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:54,750
Thank you.

384
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,390
I came with my wife.

385
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,460
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,860
It seemed like
you had something to say.

387
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,830
Why did you want to see me?

388
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,030
Why did you do that?

389
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,740
Why did you do that
to my poor daughter?

390
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,840
If I can,
I want to break this window...

391
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,280
and take your life, too.

392
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:24,950
But I changed my mind.

393
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,820
Please help us.

394
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,160
You're the only one
who can bring justice to my daughter.

395
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,760
I've committed
my share of sins in my life.

396
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,100
When I was the perpetrator,

397
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,070
I thought money was
the only thing victims wanted.

398
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,540
But now that I've become the victim,

399
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,140
I realized what I wanted was...

400
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,610
a heartfelt apology, not money.

401
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,420
If you truly wish
to apologize to us,

402
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,620
then help us bring justice
to our daughter's death.

403
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,160
Please.

404
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,860
We won't ask for more.

405
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,330
Can you just do that one thing?

406
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,330
Please think of our grandson.

407
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,240
You also have a child of your own.

408
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:25,140
At least tell the police that
there was someone behind this.

409
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:28,810
Then, I can forgive you
for everything.

410
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,880
I will.

411
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,820
I'll request
confrontational questioning...

412
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,160
with Detective Cho.

413
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,360
- Really?
- Really?

414
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,970
I'm not sure if he'll say yes.

415
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:52,470
Tell the detective that
Detective Cho made you do it.

416
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,340
Then, you'd be able
to make him move.

417
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,040
Okay.

418
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,640
Thank you.

419
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,540
Thank you.

420
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,250
Can they arrest the instigator...

421
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,090
after the confrontational questioning?

422
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,490
The chance goes up.

423
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,220
I hope it happens.

424
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,660
Do you know who's behind everything?

425
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,870
No.

426
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,000
Goodness.

427
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,170
Why would any human
in their right mind...

428
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,170
make someone do that
just to harm another?

429
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,840
I wonder.

430
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,350
Anyway, whoever is behind this is...

431
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:40,350
probably someone
who knows the chairwoman's daughter.

432
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,890
Who could it be?

433
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,230
The couple went to see him together?

434
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:54,430
I told you
to ban him from seeing anyone!

435
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,900
What did Detective Cho say?

436
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,600
He won't agree to do
the confrontational questioning,

437
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,710
so he told you to trust him
and not to worry.

438
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,310
Of course, he'll say no.

439
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,740
But the detective
may put them up for this.

440
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,810
If the driver says...

441
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,210
Detective Cho was behind it,

442
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,850
Cho will begin to feel
great pressure.

443
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,060
I'll meet with Cho
after I meet my future in-laws.

444
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,360
Tell him to refuse the questioning
until he sees me.

445
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,000
If I ask you to be with me,
will you say yes?

446
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,210
You'll meet your in-laws soon.

447
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,120
Why don't you go to a spa
and get a facial?

448
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,020
Don't act too servile...

449
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,250
in front of his family
when you meet them.

450
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,020
If you do, I'll feel like
you're really selling me off.

451
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,890
I never act too servile.

452
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,970
Hello? I'm Choi Myung Ji.

453
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,700
The police station?

454
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,840
What does this concern?

455
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,540
Did Detective Cho spill everything?

456
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,550
The embezzlement?

457
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,350
I'm not free on the weekend.

458
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,720
I'll be at the police station
on Monday.

459
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,790
Goodbye.

460
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,430
- Did they sue me?
- Yes.

461
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,900
I was called as a testifier...

462
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,760
to confirm a few things.

463
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,840
I can't believe we're tasting
the same black tea...

464
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,870
as the British royals in our house.

465
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,080
It feels like a dream.

466
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,180
Gosh. It's just bitter.

467
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,020
I prefer this.

468
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,060
Me, too.

469
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,430
It's probably not easy
for younger people to enjoy.

470
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,530
I like it.

471
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:12,170
I have the most luxurious taste
in this family.

472
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,610
You're only saying that
because it's expensive.

473
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,540
It's nice to be here
with my grandma, aunts, and uncle.

474
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,780
It's a shame that
Chairman Goo isn't here.

475
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,650
He can join us next time.

476
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,820
Please give me a chance.

477
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,260
Nothing I do will be enough
to pay everything back...

478
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,030
but allow me
to return your kindness.

479
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,660
And of course,
for everything I did wrong, too.

480
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,060
Okay, then.

481
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,230
Please punish Choi Myung Ji first.

482
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:48,140
It all depends
on the confrontational questioning.

483
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,710
We'll be able to get her
if the two men meet.

484
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,910
Really?

485
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,980
- You have our support.
- Yes.

486
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,250
It won't happen
if one person declines,

487
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,280
so it's not easy.

488
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,450
I was also worried that
the driver might change his mind.

489
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,420
I have a feeling that
it'll all go well.

490
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,460
I'll take your word for it.

491
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,160
- Yeo Jin.
- Mr. Yoon.

492
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,160
What brings you here without a call?

493
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,500
Is something going on?

494
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,470
Detective Cho and the driver
finally met.

495
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,000
They did?

496
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,470
Did they do the questioning?

497
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,970
This is great news.

498
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,650
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

499
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,660
She was on the phone with the guy,
saying they'd meet on the weekend...

500
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,290
at the Western cuisine restaurant
at the Hyesung Hotel on the weekend.

501
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,930
Let me see you.

502
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,630
Okay.

503
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:01,440
Nice to meet you.

504
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:14,720
Anyway, is your husband
running late?

505
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,290
He's abroad on a business trip,
so he can't come today.

506
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,830
Did he have to leave in a hurry?

507
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,070
It was already scheduled.

508
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,040
Golf is more important to him
than meeting the in-laws.

509
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:30,610
Hey.

510
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,310
I heard you were fired
and now have become unemployed.

511
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,780
Good. You can focus on
assisting my son.

512
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,490
Yes, right.

513
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,190
I'll teach her well.

514
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,160
Please be kind to her.

515
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,680
Who is it?

516
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,150
Does Ms. Choi Myung Ji live here?

517
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,550
We're the police.

518
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,030
Are you Ms. Choi?

519
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,400
She doesn't live here.

520
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,300
This was her legal address.

521
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,600
If you want to find her,

522
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,470
go to the Western cuisine restaurant
at the Hyesung Hotel.

523
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,410
You look quite worried
for a young woman.

524
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,920
Is it because
you went through a lot,

525
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,950
including the canceled marriage
and your dismissal?

526
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,220
I like her vibe.

527
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,630
Sure.

528
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,060
Come in.

529
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,070
Excuse me.
We're from Yongju Police Station.

530
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,740
Which one of you is
Ms. Choi Myung Ji?

531
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,810
That's me.

532
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:18,510
You're here
because of the embezzlement, right?

533
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,950
Let's talk outside.

534
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:23,620
You're under arrest without a warrant
for murder instigation.

535
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,320
What? What did you say?

536
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:37,670
What are you doing?

537
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,300
You're arrested without a warrant...

538
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,940
due to the possibility
of evidence destruction and flight.

539
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,240
It wasn't me.

540
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:44,640
I didn't do it. What are you doing?

541
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,480
I didn't do it.

542
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,680
Se Young, I didn't do it.

543
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,180
I didn't do it.

544
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,050
Myung Ji,

545
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,460
your fall and destruction
will begin now.

546
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,930
No!

547
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:08,630
It wasn't me. Let go of me. Let go.

548
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,530
Se Young, it wasn't me.

549
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:12,970
I didn't do it.

550
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,140
No. I didn't do it.

551
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,270
It wasn't me! No!

552
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,590
(Cinderella Game)

553
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:12,030
I never gave out such an order!

554
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,560
- Murder instigation?
- It's not true!

555
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:16,400
You've killed someone, too. Right?

556
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,870
Are you sure you didn't do it, Mom?

557
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,240
It's all my fault.

558
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,700
Myung Ji deceived us since that day.

559
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,740
I'm so scared and frightened.

560
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,210
I saw her at the police station.

561
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,740
Something didn't feel right.

562
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,440
I want to make a decision...

563
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,210
for the first and the last time.

564
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,550
Se Young!

565
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,320
I need to look for Se Young.
