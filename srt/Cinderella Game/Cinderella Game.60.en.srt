1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,179
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,610
(Episode 60)

5
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,380
How old was I when I went missing?

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,189
Why are you asking me?

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:15,750
I was ten, right?

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,460
You already know. Why did you ask?

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,190
Did she notice that she was a fake?

10
00:00:23,559 --> 00:00:26,230
Anyway, why do you suddenly ask?

11
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,000
I was ten, right?

12
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,429
I wasn't seven, was I?

13
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:31,339
Did she think
Yu Jin went missing at seven?

14
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,109
Seven? That was random.

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,439
You were ten.

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,909
I almost went missing with you
at that time.

17
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:42,750
What is it?

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,979
It's nothing.

19
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:56,130
She finally has
a grasp of the situation.

20
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,340
Hey, Mom.

21
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:11,379
Goo Ha Na asked me
for the age of her disappearance.

22
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,780
"The age of her disappearance?" Why?

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,049
She thought
Yu Jin went missing at seven.

24
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:20,150
She began to get suspicious
that she could be a fake.

25
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,459
This is great timing.

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,689
She'll soon find out she's a fake.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,829
The age of your disappearance?

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,560
You went missing at seven.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,299
The staff all thought it was ten,

30
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:37,069
and Se Young said the same thing.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,870
Se Young must be confused, too.

32
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,310
Could she really
get confused about this?

33
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,609
She was still haunted
by the memories of that time.

34
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,510
That's the reason for her confusion.

35
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,420
There was a mistake with your age
when it was in the newspaper.

36
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,489
I could trigger Se Young's trauma
if I tried to correct the number,

37
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,159
so I left her to believe that.

38
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:01,359
Were Ji Seok and Ms. Sim...

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,659
all mistaken, too?

40
00:02:05,299 --> 00:02:07,269
Is the exact age important?

41
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:11,139
That disappearance was
a huge incident for me.

42
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,340
I wanted to know the facts.

43
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,669
You did go missing at seven.

44
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:18,409
I remember it as clear as day,
so just believe that.

45
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,879
Okay.

46
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,560
Seven. Ten.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,620
Ha Na.

48
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:34,530
Hey, Ji Seok.

49
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,930
You thought I went missing
when I was ten.

50
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,129
How did you find out?

51
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:42,000
I saw it in a news article.

52
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:44,539
Wasn't I wrong?

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,340
Weren't you seven?

54
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:48,669
Yes, I was.

55
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,639
What's wrong? Is something going on?

56
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,240
Some people thought
I disappeared at ten.

57
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:57,250
I should know how old I was,
so I wanted to check.

58
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,419
What Chairwoman Shin says
must be the fact.

59
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,189
Bye.

60
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,830
Why is she suddenly asking
for the age of her disappearance?

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,199
I can't let Ha Na
begin to get suspicious.

62
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,069
Did she believe you
when you said she was seven?

63
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:25,509
She let it go for now,

64
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,650
but I don't think
her suspicion will disappear easily.

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,120
If this happens repeatedly,
her suspicion will only grow.

66
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,520
Can you have
another talk with Ha Na?

67
00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:36,849
I need to put Eun Chong...

68
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:39,219
on my family register
before she finds out she's a fake.

69
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,629
Ms. Chairwoman.

70
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,599
You need to tell the world
that Ha Na is your daughter.

71
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,099
It's too soon.

72
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:50,370
Ha Na got suspicious
about the age of her disappearance,

73
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,169
so she'd soon find out
she was a fake.

74
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:55,210
If you present her as your daughter,

75
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,009
she won't be suspicious
of the discrepancies in her age.

76
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,210
You should consider Ha Na...

77
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,819
more than adopting Eun Chong
at this moment.

78
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,689
You said you'd have Ha Na
as your real daughter.

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,360
You should put her
on your family register first.

80
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,490
On my family register?

81
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,300
Then, you can
let her adopt Eun Chong.

82
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,970
Naturally, he'll become
your grandson.

83
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Think of this as moving up the date
to make her public.

84
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,139
Things may become dangerous
if you postpone this any longer.

85
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,990
Mom said I was seven,

86
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,889
so I must've been seven.

87
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:47,889
What's that?

88
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,230
Wasn't that the chairwoman?

89
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:53,430
No, that was my nephew
and his grandmother.

90
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:55,870
- She looks like the chairwoman.
- Yes.

91
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,939
She gets that she looks like her
from time to time.

92
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,970
Hey, then she must be
good-looking, too.

93
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,339
What's with him?

94
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,180
- Good grief.
- What's going on?

95
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,610
It's Ha Na's nephew's grandmother.

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,079
She looks just like the chairwoman.

97
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,250
Her nephew's grandmother?

98
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,750
Ms. Goo, I need to see you.

99
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,939
You can't just share
Aunt Yeo Jin's picture.

100
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,410
- I didn't share it with them.
- Your colleagues saw it.

101
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,110
They also thought it was odd
that we were talking casually.

102
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,319
Are you dying to let them know
that you're her daughter?

103
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm not that desperate.

104
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:50,519
But I honestly want
to tell the world...

105
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,459
and get acknowledged
as her daughter.

106
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,560
Why are you scoffing at me?

107
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,370
Why have you
suddenly changed lately?

108
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,399
You were acting
just like that time...

109
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,040
when all you wanted to do was harass me
after I first came here.

110
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,610
I remained the same,
so there must be a reason...

111
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,279
why your attitude changed.

112
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,279
Yes, there's a reason.

113
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,709
- What is it?
- Find out on your own.

114
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:17,819
I think you'll figure it out soon.

115
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,490
Stop beating around the bush
and say it.

116
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,319
I don't want to.

117
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,160
It's your business,
so find out by yourself.

118
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,230
You'll soon find out you're a fake.

119
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,300
People would never know
you were Aunt Yeo Jin's daughter,

120
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,970
not anyone.

121
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,939
And you'll disappear just like dust.

122
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,509
Don't laugh like that
when you're with me.

123
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,509
- Why not?
- You look like a lunatic.

124
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,420
"Lunatic?"

125
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,670
You must've had fun
watching me all along...

126
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,300
like I was a monkey in a zoo.

127
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,769
I had fun.

128
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:15,970
But I'll probably have
even more fun in the future.

129
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:33,519
Are you avoiding me?

130
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,629
Why would I avoid you?

131
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,800
I've been getting that feeling
since yesterday.

132
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,730
Maybe you wanted to avoid me, man.

133
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,939
"Man?"

134
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:47,639
You sound quite annoyed.

135
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,639
Stop getting snarky
and say what you want to say.

136
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,350
Such as?

137
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,279
About Ha Na?

138
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:00,649
What about your sister?

139
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,949
She suddenly asked how old she was
when she went missing.

140
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,959
She went missing at seven, right?

141
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:08,060
It must be right.

142
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,029
"It must be right?"

143
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:22,540
You'll also be over
when the fake daughter gets exposed.

144
00:08:28,449 --> 00:08:31,850
Hey, Eun Chong. Don't cry. Hey.

145
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:35,889
Let me teach a lesson
to those kids who made fun of you.

146
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,320
Goodness.

147
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,230
My gosh. I have a headache.

148
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:45,799
- Gosh. You're back, Yeo Jin.
- Eun Chong, why are you crying?

149
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,570
Hey. What's wrong, Eun Chong?

150
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,240
Kids at the kindergarten
made fun of how he had no mommy.

151
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,649
Grandma, when would I get adopted?

152
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,919
- What?
- The graduation is coming soon.

153
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,090
So, Tae Hoon made fun of me
and said I'd be the only one...

154
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,059
who was without a mommy.

155
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,700
Auntie Ha Na will be there.

156
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,529
Grandma, you're really rich, right?

157
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,970
Is there something you want?

158
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,110
Can you grant me a wish?

159
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,909
"A wish?"

160
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,350
I heard my teachers
at the kindergarten say...

161
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,980
that everything was possible
if you had enough money.

162
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,250
You're rich,

163
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,720
so you can grant my wish, right?

164
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,960
Please help Auntie Ha Na adopt me.

165
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,490
Please.

166
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,100
If you grant my wish,

167
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,269
I'll run all your errands...

168
00:09:58,169 --> 00:10:00,240
and be a good boy, too.

169
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,169
Please?

170
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,909
Eun Chong, there are...

171
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:10,250
some things in this world
that money can't help.

172
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,720
I know.

173
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:14,690
I can't go see
my mommy in paradise...

174
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,789
no matter how much money I have.

175
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,330
That's why Auntie Ha Na is
here as my mommy...

176
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,259
instead of my mommy in paradise.

177
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:28,700
But the home visit
got canceled twice already.

178
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm not a bad boy,

179
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,269
so why can't I get adopted?

180
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,879
Eun Chong, yes.

181
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,649
You're such a kind and sweet boy.

182
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,250
So, you can't grant my wish...

183
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,250
no matter how rich you are?

184
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,419
I will...

185
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:58,360
do my best
to grant your wish, Eun Chong.

186
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,429
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:03,830
Then, let's make a promise.

188
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:05,740
I promise.

189
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:13,340
Yes, I should do this
if my grandson wanted it this badly.

190
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,950
Eun Chong will become my grandson...

191
00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:18,279
after I accept Ha Na as my daughter.

192
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,899
I need to put Eun Chong
on my family register...

193
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:38,200
before Ha Na finds out she's a fake.

194
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:43,870
Mr. Hwang.

195
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,539
You haven't gone home yet.

196
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,480
I had a meeting with a company
that does AI video restoration.

197
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,250
Right. I'll wash your top
and return it to you.

198
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,549
You can take your time.

199
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,659
I heard an update
from the chairwoman.

200
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,090
She said she'd adopt Eun Chong
herself, right?

201
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,230
Yes, but I said I'd manage.

202
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,460
I'm glad.

203
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,500
Do you want to eat dinner...

204
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,529
- before you go home?
- Sure.

205
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,000
Can we eat
something I want to eat today?

206
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:14,970
Sure.

207
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,990
Is this a special occasion?

208
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,320
No, it's not.

209
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,019
It's awkward, isn't it?

210
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,159
Yes, a little.

211
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,600
I feel odd, too.

212
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,870
Did I pick the wrong place?

213
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,629
No.

214
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,539
The night view is spectacular,

215
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,139
and the music adds a nice ambiance.

216
00:12:49,539 --> 00:12:52,110
I've only escorted tourists
to places like these.

217
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,309
I always wanted to treat you to a meal
at a place like this.

218
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:58,450
We may not get to do this often,

219
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,250
but don't we all want to come
at one time or another?

220
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,419
Thank you for bringing me here.

221
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,299
I just said something disrespectful
to the daughter of Hyesung Group.

222
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:14,269
No one knows
that I'm Hyesung's daughter.

223
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,029
- Does it make you sad?
- Yes.

224
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,870
That was honest.

225
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,870
I understand, yet I still feel sad.

226
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:24,840
I thought it'd be easy
to adopt Eun Chong...

227
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,009
once I became
Yoon Yu Jin, the Cinderella,

228
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:28,710
and get acknowledged
as my mom's daughter.

229
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,049
I thought it'd all go well,
but it wasn't so.

230
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:36,450
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:40,220
I said you'd be happy
once you met your birth mother,

232
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,629
but I didn't think
you recently seemed happy.

233
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,169
I am happy.

234
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:52,470
I want you to be really happy,

235
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,840
more than anyone in this world.

236
00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,039
I want to do anything for you
if I can make that happen.

237
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,169
It's my wish
as your happiness customer service rep.

238
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:31,440
What if people misunderstand us...

239
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,809
after eating a meal here?

240
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,409
Let them misunderstand.

241
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,450
I don't want to walk on eggshells,
hold back, or put things off now.

242
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,289
Things must be
quite tough for him, too.

243
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,590
We said we'd be friends,

244
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,330
but I kept forgetting.

245
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,799
I don't think
we can do that in this life.

246
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,639
Please eat.

247
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,009
- Eat up.
- Okay.

248
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,210
It's good.

249
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,120
Fate is truly incredible.

250
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,659
When we talked about the bracelet,

251
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,559
you said we would've met
If we were meant to meet.

252
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,259
That's an understatement.

253
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,169
This kind of relationship
isn't just ordinary.

254
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,200
At the very least,
we would've been...

255
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,470
first cousins once removed
in our previous life.

256
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,580
Thank you, Mr. Hwang.

257
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,580
I don't deserve
to hear that from you.

258
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,789
Why not?
You helped me even as a child...

259
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,759
and gave me
your lucky bracelet, too.

260
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:57,090
When you became older,
you found my mom...

261
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,059
and time to do customer service
for my happiness.

262
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:01,669
You're even there to eat
and drink with me, too.

263
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:04,440
I realized I should be so grateful
just as I spoke now.

264
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,940
I'll use the rest of my life
to repay my debt... No.

265
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,409
I mean your kindness.

266
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,779
No.

267
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,309
What?

268
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,549
Don't repay me.

269
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,820
I should be the one to repay you.

270
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:24,120
Why should you do that?

271
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,490
I've sinned.

272
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,090
"Sinned?"
That word is so far from you.

273
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,299
Is something worrying you?

274
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,169
- Ha Na.
- Yes?

275
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,669
You're bad at lying, right?

276
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:43,269
Well, I tell trivial lies.

277
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,179
You seem like the type
who can't lie.

278
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:50,080
I am...

279
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:53,580
such a good liar.

280
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:57,960
If you found out...

281
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,330
What's the lie?

282
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:07,900
I lied and said you were
Chairwoman Shin's daughter...

283
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,170
for your happiness.

284
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,970
Nonsense, right?

285
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,970
Do you think
that's a justifiable reason?

286
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,230
Everyone lies.

287
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,630
Even Eun Chong lies.

288
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:47,640
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,140
I'm afraid to find out...

290
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:52,880
how this lie will end.

291
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,880
I'm scared...

292
00:17:57,849 --> 00:17:58,950
you'll be hurt.

293
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm home.

294
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,859
Hey, you're back.

295
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,829
Yes. Where's Eun Chong?

296
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,230
He's asleep in my room.

297
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,430
I have something to say.

298
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,710
Yeo Jin, you must have
an important announcement.

299
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,640
You told all of us to come.

300
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,680
Yes.

301
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:29,710
It's finally time to tell the world
that Yu Jin is my daughter.

302
00:18:31,049 --> 00:18:32,180
Mom...

303
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,589
That's a wonderful decision,
Yeo Jin.

304
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,589
Congratulations, Yu Jin.

305
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:42,730
Congratulations, Yu Jin.

306
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,529
Thank you.

307
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,000
Sure.

308
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,069
When do you plan to do this?

309
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,970
Within next week.

310
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,970
I see.

311
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,440
Thank you for waiting.

312
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,410
You must've had a difficult time,

313
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,710
unable to call me your mom.

314
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,380
It's okay.

315
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,089
But I'm not ready in any way.

316
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:13,589
Don't worry.
Just follow my instructions.

317
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:16,089
Okay.

318
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:19,329
Let's proceed
with Eun Chong's adoption, too.

319
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,500
Thank you.

320
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:28,109
I can't let this happen,
not even over my dead body, Yeo Jin.

321
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,480
Go to that punk's house
and bring that piece of newspaper.

322
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,519
That will be
the fastest way to end this.

323
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,119
- Ask him to meet you tomorrow.
- Okay.

324
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,099
Hey, Ji Seok.

325
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:55,700
Can I come over tomorrow?

326
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:10,079
Du Na, I'd finally be acknowledged
as my mom's daughter.

327
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,420
Can I really do a good job?

328
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,349
Well, I have to.

329
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,660
Right. I should tell Mr. Hwang.

330
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,369
I want you to be really happy,

331
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,740
more than anyone in this world.

332
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,400
I want to do anything for you...

333
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,109
if I can make that happen.

334
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:39,680
Never mind.

335
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,380
He'll hear it from Mom.

336
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:45,019
I'm happy for your decision.

337
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:49,589
Why don't you share this
with the board members first?

338
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,890
Pick out 20 or so of them
and let them know quietly.

339
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,059
Ask them to keep it quiet
before she goes public.

340
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,930
- Yes, ma'am. And the date...
- Let's do it within next week.

341
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,299
- You two can talk and proceed.
- Yes, ma'am.

342
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:06,000
I prepared a list of things to prepare
before she goes public.

343
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,940
Okay.

344
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,339
Thank you, Ms. Chairwoman.

345
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:10,640
I'm not doing this for Ha Na.

346
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,279
I made the decision for Eun Chong.

347
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,680
What you do for Eun Chong is
also the best for Ha Na, too.

348
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:20,519
You care very much about her.

349
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,589
I promised myself
to make her happy...

350
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:25,319
when I made her your fake daughter.

351
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,190
And I want to keep that promise.

352
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,029
Hey, this is huge.

353
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:34,799
Ha Na will finally go public
as Hyesung's...

354
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,730
Hey! Be quiet.

355
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,640
Confidentiality is everything
when it comes to conglomerate families.

356
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,470
- When will you get used to this?
- Move your finger.

357
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,839
Should we get prepared, too?

358
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,349
Our hairstyle or clothes?

359
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,579
I'll dress in luxury brands
from head to toe.

360
00:21:51,349 --> 00:21:52,420
How tacky.

361
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,490
Just find a simple suit
from a luxury brand.

362
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,390
Something luxurious that provides
a great quality and perfect fit.

363
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,559
Wait, I should get facials
for that day.

364
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:06,299
She must've decided
to make her public...

365
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,799
because Ha Na got suspicious
of her age when she disappeared.

366
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,170
But she'll get to proceed
with Eun Chong's adoption, too.

367
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,329
It's good news...

368
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:12,940
- for your sister and Eun Chong.
- Yes, sir.

369
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:15,940
Will Yoon Se Young's mom stay quiet?

370
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,039
I was worried about that, too.

371
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:21,910
I plan to put secret bodyguards on Ha Na
in case she gets...

372
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,509
abducted and confined
to stop her from going public.

373
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:26,579
And I'll follow up
on the adoption process, too.

374
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,390
Chairwoman Shin is an enemy,

375
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,460
but I hope all three are happy...

376
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,960
for your sister
and Eun Chong's sake.

377
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:39,630
I was also happy for now
because Ha Na got what she wanted.

378
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,569
I'm also happy
that you seem to be in peace.

379
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,039
I'm glad, too.

380
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:48,369
I must've been
a huge concern for you two.

381
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,740
When everything ends,

382
00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:56,210
why don't we have some Vernus,
the wine Danny mentioned?

383
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,950
I'll prepare that.

384
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,079
That sounds great.

385
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,119
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

386
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,730
I am Yoon Yu Jin,
Chairwoman Shin Yeon Jin's only daughter.

387
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,670
I went missing when I was a child...

388
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:19,400
What are you up to?

389
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,539
Hey, Eun Chong.

390
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,269
Hello, Mr. Hwang.

391
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,769
You're here.

392
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,279
Congratulations.

393
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:28,450
You'd finally be known to the world
as the chairwoman's daughter.

394
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:31,549
Yes, I'm not sure
if I'll do a great job.

395
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,950
You will. I guarantee it.

396
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,720
You shouldn't go around
giving out your guarantees.

397
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,559
I don't do that for just anybody.

398
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:40,859
- Isn't that right, Eun Chong?
- Yes!

399
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,390
What were you up to?

400
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,160
I was practicing my speech
for that day.

401
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,730
My heart is already racing.

402
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,930
I'll prepare a calming pill.

403
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,069
Is Se Young home?

404
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,809
She left to meet her friends.

405
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,849
Shouldn't you be careful?

406
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,549
What if you get caught?

407
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,319
I won't get caught.

408
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,789
What were you up to?

409
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:10,950
I just got home, too.

410
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,089
I hear Ha Na is going public.

411
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,460
Yes, everyone is celebrating.

412
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,299
Can you make
some egg porridge for me?

413
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,569
Sure.

414
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,329
May I lie down for a minute?

415
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,170
- I'll call you when it's done.
- Okay.

416
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,960
(Missing Child)

417
00:24:53,829 --> 00:24:54,970
Found it.

418
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,839
Se Young seemed too relaxed
even after hearing...

419
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,210
that Ha Na would go public
and even adopt Eun Chong.

420
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,250
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

421
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,490
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

422
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:23,490
- Where are you?
- Hey, I'm with Eun Soo.

423
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,960
- What about you?
- I'm home.

424
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,990
Is that so?

425
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:38,970
I'm getting another call.

426
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:41,400
I'll see you later.

427
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,980
That didn't feel right.

428
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,349
He's home?

429
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:58,519
What's wrong? Do you think
Hwang Jin Goo is watching in hiding?

430
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,759
Let's go for a drive next time.

431
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,630
Will the world collapse
if you break off your engagement?

432
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:05,660
We still have
businesses to sort out.

433
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,829
You already know that.

434
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,630
Bye, now.

435
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:39,460
Is something going on?

436
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,130
I'm sensing stress
on my smiley son's face.

437
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,529
I must be tired.

438
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:45,700
Do you have a lot of work?

439
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,500
Yes, Eun Chong's auntie...

440
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,970
will be presented officially
to the board tomorrow...

441
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,109
as the chairwoman's daughter.

442
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:53,539
That's great news.
Everyone should hear the good news...

443
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:54,880
and celebrate with them.

444
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,009
You must be tired.
Wash up and get some rest.

445
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,579
Okay.

446
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,019
Is that so?

447
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,190
She said he was only in her past.

448
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:15,230
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

449
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,700
Wonderful job.

450
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:18,670
This is all we need.

451
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:21,869
Can you make her see this
without catching onto us?

452
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,910
Of course, I can.

453
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,380
That day will be our D-day.

454
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:50,470
Mom, are you leaving now?

455
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,869
Yes, I'll escort Yeo Jin
when she collapses.

456
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,039
I'll tell her
you're coming with Yu Jin.

457
00:28:56,339 --> 00:28:57,569
Okay.

458
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:01,950
Today is the judgment day,
and we'll find out...

459
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:04,549
if she'll go down or if we will.

460
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,519
Come to the hotel before 2 p.m.

461
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,849
Okay.

462
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,759
You'll be more nervous
if you get anxious, so relax.

463
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,230
Come with your auntie, Eun Chong.

464
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,289
Okay.

465
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,259
Yeo Jin, I'll go with you.

466
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,339
Gosh, you look
wonderful today, Ji Seok.

467
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,980
I polished your shoes, too.

468
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:36,450
- Thanks.
- Make sure you take a photo...

469
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,579
when she's on the stage.

470
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,980
It would've been great
if her family were invited.

471
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:42,490
I'm going there on your behalf.

472
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,599
- Does it look okay?
- Yes.

473
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,940
Eun Chong, from now on,
let's try to get along.

474
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,609
I'll be nice to you.

475
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,450
Why are you suddenly nice to me?

476
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,119
Both Little Grandma and you.

477
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,450
What?

478
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,089
Well, I always wanted
to be nice to you.

479
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,420
But Auntie Ha Na hogged you,

480
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,559
so I held back
from treating you nicely.

481
00:30:22,759 --> 00:30:24,859
Then, why did you hit my head?

482
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,359
That was...

483
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,230
a mistake.

484
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,470
I never did that again
after that day.

485
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,240
You believe me, right?

486
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,470
Okay.

487
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,980
This little kid is
making my life so tired.

488
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,710
If you keep doing this,

489
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,849
your life will be
even more troublesome.

490
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:53,119
- Who is it?
- Delivery service.

491
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
Oh, my. What is this?

492
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,150
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

493
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,349
- It's Mommy.
- "Mommy?"

494
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,849
Yes, that is
my mommy's childhood picture.

495
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,390
Is that so?

496
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,359
May I show it to Auntie Ha Na?

497
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,160
Of course.
Go ahead and show it to her.

498
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,230
Auntie Ha Na!

499
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,809
- Here.
- Thank you.

500
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,240
I like it. Thank you.

501
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,019
Auntie Ha Na, look. It's Mommy.

502
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:57,349
- "Mommy?"
- It's a photo of my mommy.

503
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,460
It's a flyer looking for Du Na.

504
00:32:03,859 --> 00:32:05,160
Where did you get this?

505
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:14,069
Yoon Yu Jin, age ten.

506
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,609
What is this?

507
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,740
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

508
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:22,710
Du Na is Yoon Yu Jin?

509
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,420
Why is Du Na...

510
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,190
Do you want me to tell you
who she is?

511
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,220
She's the real one.

512
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:35,690
What?

513
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:39,829
She's the real one.

514
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,170
You're a fake.

515
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,029
A knockoff.

516
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,539
A replica.

517
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,569
What are you talking about?

518
00:32:52,539 --> 00:32:55,140
What do you mean by real and fake?

519
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,650
She's the real Yoon Yu Jin,

520
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,420
and you're a fake.

521
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,650
Du Na is the real one,

522
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:09,259
and I'm a fake?

523
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,750
(Cinderella Game)

524
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,280
What about Eun Chong?
Is he not home?

525
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,449
Didn't you want to know
why she made you a fake daughter?

526
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,219
She found out she was a fake?

527
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,460
I don't believe you.

528
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,090
You want the worst for me.

529
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,989
You aren't Yoon Yu Jin.
You're Goo Ha Na.

530
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,530
You're Yoon Yu Jin's knockoff.

531
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,800
You shouldn't have let her find out
if you made her a fake daughter!

What will you do now?

533
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm sorry for everything.

534
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
I'll gladly receive any punishment.

535
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:28,570
Yu Jin, are you all right?

536
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,739
"Yu Jin?"

537
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,670
There's no Yu Jin here.
