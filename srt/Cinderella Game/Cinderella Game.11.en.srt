(Buddhist Prayer Ceremony
for Yoon Yu Jin's Safe Return)

6
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,509
My beloved daughter.

7
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:40,909
I miss you so much, Yu Jin, my girl.

8
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,420
I think of you
every moment of every day.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,090
Your round eyes.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,259
Your warm hands.

11
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:01,229
This morning,
I made hot chocolate, your favorite.

12
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,670
- And a marshmallow. You love this.
- Yay!

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,810
- Oh, my. How is it?
- It's good.

14
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,939
- Is it good?
- I remembered...

15
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,879
- how happy you looked,
- Do you want one more?

16
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,879
eating marshmallows
next to the fireplace.

17
00:01:17,379 --> 00:01:20,590
- Do you like it?
- It felt just like yesterday.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,420
But it has already been...

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,420
twenty years since I've seen you.

20
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:30,129
If I had known,

21
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,730
If I had known,
I would've hugged you more often.

22
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,269
I would've smiled more often.

23
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,939
But I believe...

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,180
you will return to my arms.

25
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,859
Please do not lose your heart.

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,599
She will come back to you.

27
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:04,799
Until that day,

28
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,269
- Yes.
- I'll pray that...

29
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,669
you'll always be happy...

30
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:14,069
and healthy.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,849
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

32
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,879
I hope the prayers
of everyone who loves you...

33
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:26,349
reach you.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,120
So, surely, one day,

35
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,319
(We miss you, Yu Jin.
Let us meet again.)

36
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,490
may you...

37
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,159
(Yu Jin, we'll always wait for you.
Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
return safely...

39
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,800
into Mommy's arms.

40
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,139
(Yu Jin, we'll always wait for you.
Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

41
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:50,379
(Incoming Call)

42
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,689
Why do you keep calling me?

43
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,759
I said I had no money
because I didn't.

44
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,400
You could've raised a building...

45
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:12,530
with the money you've extorted from me
until this day.

46
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,199
Hyesung Group isn't mine!

47
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,800
So, just wait.

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,870
Mom.

49
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,439
Yes, all right.

50
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,280
Then, please call me
if you hear any good news.

51
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,580
All right. Goodbye.

52
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,520
- Yes, what is it?
- Who were you on the phone with?

53
00:03:33,819 --> 00:03:34,990
A real estate agent.

54
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,719
What is it?

55
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:39,090
Everyone went to the sanctuary
to dedicate 3,000 bows.

56
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,360
"Three thousand?"

57
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,629
My knees will give out again.

58
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:53,810
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

59
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,180
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

60
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,150
(Always stay healthy.
Yu Jin, I love you.)

61
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,620
What are you doing?

62
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,289
I was thinking about Yu Jin.

63
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,129
Did you also like
hot chocolate and marshmallows?

64
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,000
I did.

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,000
But I never had them again
after what happened to her.

66
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:25,000
Can we leave first?

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,240
We have the head director's
appointment ceremony tomorrow,

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,410
and the chairwoman
told us to attend.

69
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,110
The Goo siblings start
on the same day.

70
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,420
It's good.

71
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,889
I should've made it for you
a long time ago.

72
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:51,129
Your mommy said she remembered
dipping marshmallows...

73
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,870
in hot chocolate
in front of a fireplace.

74
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,500
A fireplace sounds really cool.

75
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,699
Right?

76
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:00,939
If she had a fireplace at home,

77
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,439
she might have been from a wealthy family.

78
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,240
That would be wonderful.

79
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:09,779
If I meet a rich grandma,
I'll ask her...

80
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:11,980
to share a lot with you, too.

81
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,220
Really? Gosh, you're so adorable.

82
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,759
Then, I should
stick next to you for a long time.

83
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,829
Yes!

84
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,889
Right.

85
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,930
What's this?

86
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:31,639
I made your face
at the kindergarten.

87
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,069
I had to make it again
because it broke.

88
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,480
This is all I can give you.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,050
It's so pretty.

90
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,050
Thank you.
I'll leave it on my desk...

91
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,720
and look at it every day
as soon as I start working tomorrow.

92
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:48,850
Okay!

93
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:53,990
It's so pretty. You did a great job.

94
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,790
Hello!

95
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,100
My name is Goo Ha Na,

96
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,930
and I am the new guide and operator.

97
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,600
Welcome to the team.
I am Assistant Manager Yoon Ji Ho.

98
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:08,509
They're Ms. Lee Soo Jung
and Ms. Kim Jin Kyung.

99
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,779
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

100
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,079
We've met before, right?

101
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,910
Hey, yes. It's great to see you.

102
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,350
President Hwang and Ms. Yoon
went to Hyesung Hotel.

103
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,649
- You can meet them when they come.
- Yes.

104
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,350
This is your desk.

105
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,319
All right. Thank you.

106
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,620
Then, I'm going to Sewoon Hotel.

107
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,089
- See you.
- See you.

108
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,310
Hello? Mr. Yoon?

109
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,279
The contract with Dubai? All right.

110
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,060
Ha Na, can you take this
to President Hwang?

111
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:01,129
You'll find him
at the hotel's banquet hall.

112
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:04,329
All right. I'll be back.

113
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,430
This was
a Buddhist prayer ceremony...

114
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,930
she has held over 20 years
for her daughter's safe return.

115
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:14,370
She doesn't know if she's
dead or alive, so she can't mourn...

116
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,310
or give up on her.

117
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,910
She could've changed
after she lost her daughter,

118
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,420
but she continued to raid companies
since back then until now.

119
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:26,550
You're right.

120
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:29,120
How many people
do you think are sincere in here?

121
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,329
If her daughter returns alive,

122
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,689
things will become interesting
for Hyesung Group.

123
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Ten years ago, after Hyesung Finance
became Hyesung Hotel,

124
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
we all know
Chairwoman Shin's hard work...

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,709
and dedication was the foundation
for Hyesung Hotel to grow...

126
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,610
into the best hotel in Korea.

127
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,180
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok's
Inauguration Ceremony)

128
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,519
So, my father was victimized?

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,459
I heard Shin Yeo Jin
has been purposely bankrupting...

130
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,759
small businesses to sell them.

131
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,029
In a nutshell,
she's a corporate raider.

132
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,639
Without the sweat, tears,
and sacrifice...

133
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,449
of Chairwoman Shin and the staff,

134
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,379
Hyesung Group wouldn't be
what it is today.

135
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:34,690
It's a great honor to be
a part of this historical journey.

136
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,789
I would like to ask you
for one thing...

137
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,120
as we pursue a brighter future.

138
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,389
Rebel.

139
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,600
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok's
Inauguration Ceremony)

140
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,269
(Mom)

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,909
Good grief. What's with you?
Let go of me.

142
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:02,350
Why are you here?

143
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,080
I wasn't banned from here.

144
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:07,080
I need to see who this punk is.

145
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,289
It's Goo Ji Seok.

146
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,990
What?

147
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,529
Goo Ji Seok is the head director.

148
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,600
What is this nonsense...

149
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,700
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok's
Inauguration Ceremony)

150
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,100
What is this?

151
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,970
The word rebel
probably made the board anxious.

152
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,039
Please relax.

153
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,009
I want you to rebel creatively...

154
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,909
against the irrational rules
and system.

155
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,450
I ask for your bold rebellion...

156
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,350
against the customs
you couldn't change...

157
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,049
because of convention
and your superiors.

158
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,389
That rebellion will be
the biggest driving force...

159
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,929
leading Hyesung Group
into the world market.

160
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,389
I will unconditionally accept
any creative rebellion you bring...

161
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,830
for the sake of Hyesung Group.

162
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,149
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

163
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,620
Shin Yeo Jin!
How can you call yourself human?

164
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,250
Who do you think you are?

165
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,750
Bring my business
and my family back!

166
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,809
- Call the police first.
- Shin Yeo Jin, get over here!

167
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,539
Let go of me.
Shin Yeo Jin, come out!

168
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,139
Let go of me.

169
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,649
- Chairwoman Shin, are you okay?
- Let go of me!

170
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:44,419
Shin Yeo Jin, come out! Come!

171
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,480
Jin Goo, you're bleeding.

172
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,320
I'm fine.

173
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:52,789
You should give him first aid.

174
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,590
I called our medical service.

175
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,389
Are you all right, Ms. Chairwoman?

176
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,169
I should've known when I saw him
lurking around at the hotel.

177
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,669
What's his intention
in accepting a job here?

178
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,379
Get a grip on yourself,

179
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,950
and do not get caught up in this.

180
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,580
Don't worry.

181
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,659
What happened?

182
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,169
What's going on?

183
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,879
"Head Director Goo Ji Seok?"

184
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,850
Well, Chairwoman Shin.

185
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,919
You cannot show mercy
to those who spread false rumors.

186
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,350
You should lock him up in prison
for a long time.

187
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,559
- What happened?
- Yeo Jin.

188
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:08,570
Come to my office
with President Hwang and Director Goo.

189
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,669
Okay.

190
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,210
Goodness.

191
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,070
Jin Goo, were you hurt?

192
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,539
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

193
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,549
So, are you all right?

194
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,419
It was my brother, Ji Seok.

195
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:39,799
What on earth is going on?

196
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,580
Did something happen?

197
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,549
Did he get hurt?

198
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,690
Ms. Goo.

199
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,029
- Take the file.
- Okay.

200
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,500
She was in the interview with me,

201
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,370
and she was fired previously
for taking up a private gig.

202
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,139
On top of that,
she was even called a spy.

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,679
There was so much tension
between Ms. Yoon and her.

204
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,779
Really?

205
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,480
Then, how did a girl like her
get a job at our company?

206
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,879
Does she have connections?

207
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,190
I'm back.

208
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,259
What should I do next?

209
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:43,830
Wait until Ms. Yoon
gives you an order.

210
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,899
Okay.

211
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,509
Hey, don't touch that.

212
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,980
- It looked messy.
- Leave it alone.

213
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,450
She only got a job
thanks to a connection.

214
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,190
It was a shame this happened
on a good day like this, Mr. Goo.

215
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,600
I felt relieved it wasn't any worse.

216
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,529
Let me investigate and find out
if he did this alone or with someone.

217
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,340
I'll make sure
this never happens again.

218
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,740
This is way overdue,
but you should meet him.

219
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,840
He's Director Choi,
returning after his sabbatical year.

220
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,080
Nice to meet you.

221
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,909
I've been wanting to meet you.

222
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,519
Wait.
I'll pay it back in the future.

223
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:42,720
Please, sir.

224
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,419
I'm not the one who can help you.

225
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,360
I heard you made Hyesung Group
alongside Chairwoman Shin.

226
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,529
Is that so?

227
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,100
Then, I will come by soon
with my rebellious plan.

228
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,740
Feel free to come anytime...

229
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:00,870
with your rebellious plan,
Director Choi.

230
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:07,179
- We don't have to meet again.
- No.

231
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,980
Head Director Goo at the hotel,

232
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,419
and President Hwang
at the travel agency.

233
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,419
You have wonderful men
on both sides, Ms. Chairwoman.

234
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:17,490
Then, we can meet again later.

235
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,059
Let's call it a day.

236
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,690
My mom said she'd escort you home.

237
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,529
Then, please excuse me.

238
00:15:39,009 --> 00:15:40,679
We should find a new security team.

239
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:43,549
How could they let an assailant
into the banquet hall?

240
00:15:44,049 --> 00:15:45,320
They're useless.

241
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,820
- Did you look into it?
- Yes, ma'am.

242
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,090
His name is Jung Man Soo,
40 years old.

243
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,019
He used to work in the fashion
and cosmetics business.

244
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,590
He ran a family company
named Manyoung Fashion.

245
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:01,500
But he went bankrupt three years ago
and has been homeless since then.

246
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,429
"Manyoung Fashion?"

247
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:06,440
That's a business
you took over, right?

248
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,110
Why is he demanding
that I bring back his family?

249
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,509
I'm a businesswoman, not a doctor.

250
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,610
He's on a completely wrong track.

251
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,720
Yes, tell me about it.

252
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,419
His failure was due
to his incompetence and bad luck.

253
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:20,620
How dare he make a scene here?

254
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,250
My goodness.

255
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,519
It wasn't a crime...

256
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,759
to take over a company
that went down and would go down.

257
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:27,929
If anything, you should be rewarded.

258
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:32,730
Yeo Jin, you should call it a day
and come home with me.

259
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,399
Your older sister is
Ms. Goo Ha Na, right?

260
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:42,669
The younger brother became
the head director of the group...

261
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,940
on the same day
his sister began working...

262
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,679
at a travel agency affiliated
with the group by pulling strings.

263
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,179
The string-pulling siblings.

264
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,649
You must enjoy working.

265
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:55,990
You laugh quite often.

266
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,289
I'm just pointing out...

267
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,529
- the fact.
- Hyesung Tour must be free...

268
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,359
if you're obsessing over
an unimportant fact.

269
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,549
What an impressive speech.

270
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:28,250
I also have a knack for rebelling.

271
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,049
I'd love to see your rebellion.

272
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,259
When is your wedding?

273
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,690
We still have half a year to go.

274
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:41,529
Ms. Yoon, is there another subsidiary
you want to work at?

275
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:44,369
A married couple
shouldn't work in the same office.

276
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:47,569
Let me know if you think of a place.
You can come to the hotel, too.

277
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,140
The president should
work at the hotel.

278
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,779
Thank you for your concern.

279
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:58,119
Please spare my concern
and make a wise decision.

280
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,349
Wouldn't it be awkward for the staff
to have a couple as their superiors?

281
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,359
We were as good as married,
and we had no problems.

282
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,190
That's what you think.

283
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,009
The younger brother became
the head director of the group...

284
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,710
on the same day
his sister began working...

285
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:28,710
at a travel agency affiliated
with the group by pulling strings.

286
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:31,250
The string-pulling siblings.

287
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,319
Ha Na got the job
by pulling some strings?

288
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,789
Come in.

289
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,230
Yes, Director Goo.

290
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,970
My sister got a job at Hyesung Tour.

291
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:50,500
I heard she pulled strings
to get it, so I need more details.

292
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,539
Yes, sir.

293
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:54,200
And Mr. Jung Man Soo is
under police investigation.

294
00:18:54,609 --> 00:18:58,339
They'll summon the victims tomorrow,
President Hwang and Chairwoman Shin.

295
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,480
Find him an attorney...

296
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,109
to drop the case
before the prosecution's indictment.

297
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,509
Yes, sir.

298
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,789
You're back.

299
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,890
Did you see the bandage
around President Hwang's hand?

300
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,829
It's a relief that
it was his hand, not his face.

301
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:23,029
President Hwang risked his life
to save the chairwoman.

302
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,599
Anyway, why did that man
suddenly attack her?

303
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,769
There are more than
a couple of crazy people these days.

304
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:32,680
Make sure this incident
does not leave the office.

305
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,809
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

306
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,519
So, you are
Goo Ji Seok's older sister?

307
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,359
I hated how she was always the one
sacrificing and devoting herself.

308
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,799
I also hated seeing her
trying so hard.

309
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,000
That was why I always said
the meanest and harshest things.

310
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,900
- Did you like her?
- She's my older sister.

311
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:01,740
She wasn't related to you by blood.

312
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:03,940
Was she your first love?

313
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:06,680
It's kind of cliche.

314
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:09,079
I don't like cliches.

315
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,720
That's why I like you.

316
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,220
Ms. Yoon, what should I do?

317
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,019
Wait until I give you an order.

318
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:55,930
Yes.

319
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,430
- Ms. Yoon.
- Wait.

320
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,299
It's not that.

321
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:06,539
There were some inconvenient events
between you and me...

322
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,910
against our will, right?

323
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,809
We had no idea
we'd be in the same office.

324
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:15,680
Please forget everything
that has happened until now.

325
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,450
I won't keep it in my mind, either.

326
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,220
From now on, at work...

327
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,890
Get my car washed.

328
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,190
You'll find a car wash
about 200m behind the office.

329
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,519
My car is
on the second basement level.

330
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,160
- Why aren't you taking it?
- Yes.

331
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,640
There's a shoe repair shop
right outside the office, too.

332
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,089
I'll be back.

333
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,630
Hey, Ji Seok.

334
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,269
Congratulations on taking office
as the head director.

335
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:11,869
Why didn't you tell me?

336
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,369
You look great.

337
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,609
Mom and Dad
should've seen you like this.

338
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:22,680
We're at work.

339
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,549
I'm sorry.

340
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,119
I won't make it obvious
that I'm your sister.

341
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,019
Then, have a great day.

342
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:38,660
Ji Seok.

343
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,670
By any chance,

344
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:45,369
did you pull some strings
to get me a job here?

345
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,839
Why would I?

346
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,009
Never mind. Bye.

347
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:03,390
I came to work
because I was told to,

348
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,819
but I somehow pulled some strings
I didn't know about.

349
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:08,829
These are Ms. Yoon's, right?

350
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:10,660
Mr. Hwang.

351
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,329
Give them back.

352
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,430
You don't have to run these errands
while you're at work.

353
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Please turn a blind eye to it
just today.

354
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,700
- Let me have them.
- No.

355
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,940
Come on. Mr. Hwang.

356
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,940
- Give them back to me.
- Hey.

357
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,109
- Please.
- Why are you so strong?

358
00:23:27,109 --> 00:23:30,210
You hurt your hand,
so don't do this to hurt yourself.

359
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,549
No, you let them go.

360
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,690
My goodness! No.

361
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,690
Oh, no.

362
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,460
- My gosh.
- What am I going to do?

363
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,230
Ms. Yoon will flip out.

364
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,069
Please stick back on.

365
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,470
My gosh. What am I going to do?

366
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,910
Well, you can put it back on.

367
00:23:58,809 --> 00:23:59,980
Darn it.

368
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:02,910
What am I going to do?

369
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,220
You can't fix this here.

370
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,789
What? Why not? Please do it.

371
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:11,759
Just get it fixed
at the department store.

372
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,420
An artisan sewed these on
one at a time,

373
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,789
so you can't fix this here.

374
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:17,390
It's not that big of a deal.

375
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,599
Just make sure it's on securely.

376
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,869
My gosh.
He can't take a hint, can he?

377
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:24,430
- Aren't these your girlfriend's?
- They are.

378
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,039
She must've loved these,
so they should be fixed properly.

379
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,410
Isn't that so, young lady?

380
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:31,240
These were expensive,
so you looked very stressed out.

381
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,980
- What?
- Your boyfriend doesn't get it.

382
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:36,650
- Right?
- What?

383
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,079
- No, it's not like that!
- No, it's not like that!

384
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,160
I got into huge trouble
from day one.

385
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,859
I'll explain it to Ms. Yoon.

386
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,359
Don't worry.

387
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,329
The car wash.

388
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,039
Mr. Hwang, you should go first.

389
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:03,309
- I have to run to the ladies' room.
- Sure.

390
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,240
Yes.

391
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,910
The car. She said it was
on the second basement floor.

392
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,549
Ji Soo, you're my first customer.

393
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:16,920
How much money
do you want to save up?

394
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,119
Five dollars.
I just need ten fifty cents.

395
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,789
What are you doing, Eun Chong?

396
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,029
- Tae Hoon, do you have fifty cents?
- Fifty cents?

397
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:30,200
I'll clean your hamster's cage
if you give me 50 cents.

398
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,700
I'll also walk your dog, Ddoddo,

399
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,339
for 50 cents!

400
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,119
(Hyesung Hotel Financial Statement)

401
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:57,859
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

402
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,329
Shin Yeo Jin!
How can you call yourself human?

403
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:03,099
Bring my business
and my family back!

404
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:04,970
"Corporate raider?"

405
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,150
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

406
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,619
Why is this here?

407
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,660
You're back, Chairwoman Shin.

408
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,559
Did you draw a hot bath...

409
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,559
with lavender oil?

410
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,529
Yes, it should be ready by now.

411
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,130
I just need to boil
the abalone porridge,

412
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:38,799
and seaweed soup is much better
after it's boiled for a long time.

413
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:40,940
It'll take a little longer.

414
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,710
You need to speed it up.

415
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,210
Yeo Jin was shocked today...

416
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,410
What's that?

417
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:55,690
I found this in Se Young's pocket.

418
00:26:56,589 --> 00:26:59,420
She saw it on the floor
in the parking lot...

419
00:26:59,859 --> 00:27:02,829
and picked it up to hang it back up
the next time we visited.

420
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,259
- Let me have it.
- Sure.

421
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,569
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

422
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,109
Why was it in your pocket?

423
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:21,539
So, what did Aunt Yeo Jin say?

424
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,549
I made up an excuse
before she said anything.

425
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,920
I said it came off,
so you took it to put it back up.

426
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,819
You need to get a grip on yourself.

427
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:30,619
I'm sorry.

428
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,839
- My shoes.
- I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

429
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,509
I couldn't get them cleaned.

430
00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:53,279
Why not?

431
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:58,380
The ornament came off.

432
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,079
I'm sorry.

433
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,190
What is this?
What happened to my shoe?

434
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,890
What have you done?

435
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:12,230
You're doing this on purpose
to make me stressed out, right?

436
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,859
You're trying to make me mad!

437
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,470
I told you to get my shoes cleaned,
but you took revenge instead.

438
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,900
You couldn't slap me,
so you took it out on my shoe?

439
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,400
No, Ms. Yoon.

440
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,609
What are you going to do
about my shoes? What now?

441
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
I'll go to the department store
after work, and...

442
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,180
Why do I have to wait a month
because of you?

443
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,910
They have to be sent to Italy
if I want them fixed.

444
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,079
These shoes are
more valuable and precious than you!

445
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,750
Ms. Yoon.

446
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:37,119
I did that to the shoes.

447
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:38,720
Come to my office.

448
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:55,039
Why do you care about my order?
Why did you step into this?

449
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:56,670
Goo Ha Na is one of my subordinates!

450
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,140
I told you not to let the staff
run your errands during work hours.

451
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,680
That can be a power trip.

452
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,109
You're trying to turn me into a boss
that goes on power trips.

453
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,150
It's not that.

454
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,079
Who knows what she'll do
once she gets mad?

455
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,589
I tried to take them from her
for your sake, then that happened.

456
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,019
I probably
couldn't control my power.

457
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,230
It's so irritating.

458
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:20,099
It'll take over a month
to get that fixed.

459
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:21,359
You have lots of pretty shoes.

460
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,029
Do you want me to buy you
another pair?

461
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:25,940
Forget it.

462
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:40,119
You're doing this on purpose
to make me stressed out, right?

463
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,549
You're trying to make me mad!

464
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,750
What are you going to do
about my shoes? What now?

465
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,660
Why do I have to wait a month
because of you?

466
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,130
They have to be sent to Italy
if I want them fixed.

467
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,200
These shoes are
more valuable and precious than you!

468
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,470
They're just shoes,
no matter how expensive they are.

469
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,799
How can she say that to my face?

470
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,549
- Great work.
- Great work.

471
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:10,680
- Goodbye.
- Good work.

472
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,619
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodbye.

473
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:14,720
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

474
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:18,720
- Has Ms. Goo left?
- Her bag is still here.

475
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,140
Did everyone leave?

476
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:37,970
Time to go home.

477
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,250
I will never give up...

478
00:30:49,589 --> 00:30:50,720
no matter how hard
you try to harass me.

479
00:30:54,259 --> 00:30:56,859
If the Dubai contract included
Ms. Goo Na Ha as one of their terms,

480
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,130
it means
she was the one who got the deal.

481
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,299
That is so.

482
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,029
Yet she has no idea.

483
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,640
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

484
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,910
Pulling what strings?
They brought her in.

485
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:11,710
Should we hold off
selling the travel agency...

486
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,910
now that your sister
has begun working here?

487
00:31:16,579 --> 00:31:17,809
Let's stick to the plan.

488
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,849
What about hotels affiliated
with Hyesung Tour?

489
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,380
We're calling off the contracts.

490
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:24,690
Let's throw a big one
as an appointment present.

491
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:27,960
Hanguk Hotel.

492
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:37,569
Hello.

493
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:40,269
I was on my way to your office
to report on the Dubai contract.

494
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:46,839
We met here,
so let's go to your office.

495
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,809
Do you want to do that? Let's go.

496
00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:54,319
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

497
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,420
Mr. Hwang, Hanguk Hotel
canceled their contract with us.

498
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,759
What are you talking about?
Canceling the contract?

499
00:32:04,529 --> 00:32:05,630
What?

500
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,509
(Cinderella Game)

501
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:52,740
He didn't have
the intention to harm her?

502
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,980
He kept insisting
that he did this alone.

503
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,180
I'm sure someone is behind him.

504
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,779
You really didn't love me?

505
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,349
- Everything we did was love.
- Are you crazy?

506
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,519
You're still
the same loving younger brother.

507
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:05,619
Let's focus on work
when we're at work, Ms. Yoon.

508
00:33:05,619 --> 00:33:07,789
It's not very ethical
to do this without a discussion.

509
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,089
Something must be going on.

510
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:10,789
Did I get the job
because of someone's order?

511
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,799
Was it Goo Ji Seok...

512
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:14,230
It was me.

513
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,000
I hired you.
