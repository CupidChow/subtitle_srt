1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,209
(Episode 50)

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,219
What's with this?

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:22,989
What is this?

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,359
What's this photo?

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,929
Wait.

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,039
She's...

10
00:00:35,609 --> 00:00:36,740
Yu Jin.

11
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,250
What photo did you lose
to cause such a fuss?

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,149
Tell us,
and we can help you find it.

13
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:47,649
It's a photo of me, my mommy,

14
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:49,649
and Auntie Ha Na.

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,590
Wait.

16
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:57,030
Then, this was the photo
she had lost?

17
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:02,899
Could it mean...

18
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,469
that you're Yu Jin's son?

19
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,980
Little Grandma, what are you doing?

20
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:20,390
I'm not doing anything. What is it?

21
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,519
Eun Chong.

22
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,859
Yes?

23
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,859
So, he is...

24
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,469
Yu Jin's son?

25
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,709
When did she give birth to him?

26
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,250
I didn't see anything
on her family registry.

27
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,620
I never heard that
she gave birth to a child.

28
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,959
I thought I heard the director was
Ms. Goo's younger brother.

29
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,260
Should I ask her for a favor?

30
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,500
Bang Ul, I need some water.

31
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,469
Bang Ul, I need cold water.

32
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:19,180
Get it yourself.

33
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:23,110
Just get me some.
I'm not in my right mind.

34
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,979
You have working hands and feet.

35
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,449
I'm not your servant!

36
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,550
What's with you?

37
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,889
You said my son
just became unemployed!

38
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,389
How can you ask me
to bring you water right now?

39
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,889
The least you can do is
worry with me,

40
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,460
console me,
and try to find a way out of this!

41
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,460
This concerns you, too!

42
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:41,400
You're terrible.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,370
- Good grief.
- Ms. Bang Ul...

44
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:46,300
Goodness. What?

45
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,270
Why is she taking it out on me?

46
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,210
Does she have any idea
how stunned I am?

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,180
Jeez!

48
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10,900
Ms. Bang Ul, are you mad?

49
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,159
I was just heartbroken.

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,270
You can stay home
with your little grandma, right?

51
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,639
Take care, then.

52
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,340
- Are you not going to come anymore?
- No.

53
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,310
You can come over to my place
to see Yali with your auntie.

54
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,919
Can I go and see Yali with you?

55
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,050
- Right now?
- No, Eun Chong.

56
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,389
You shouldn't go out
this late in the day.

57
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,789
You can go with Auntie Ha Na
on the weekend.

58
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,530
Yes, you can come over
with Auntie Ha Na.

59
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,259
- I'll go now.
- Bye.

60
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:52,639
Eun Chong.

61
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,370
Eun Chong,
is there something you want to eat?

62
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,240
Should we order
fried chicken or pizza?

63
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,409
No.

64
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,349
Then, is there anything
you want to do?

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,550
You can tell me everything.

66
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,719
No.

67
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,919
Then, what's your mommy's name?

68
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,759
What's your mommy's name?

69
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:18,800
Lee Du Na.

70
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,439
Right. I see.

71
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:28,639
You are Yu Jin's son.

72
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:31,310
You were the real one.

73
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,120
Your suspension got lifted.

74
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,819
Would you like to be the president
for another subsidiary?

75
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,290
Did you have a place in your mind?

76
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,819
If I go to another subsidiary,

77
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,360
the current president will
get hustled out of their office.

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,430
I'll have to do that
if you want to work there.

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,199
What about my staff?

80
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,170
They specialize
in the travel business,

81
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,199
so they're not likely to get a job
at another subsidiary company.

82
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,939
I can't abandon my staff members.

83
00:05:03,339 --> 00:05:05,879
I understand
how much you care about them.

84
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,850
But you should first consider
the greater cause.

85
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,079
Will you let me work
at a place of my choice?

86
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,420
- Yes.
- In that case,

87
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,519
I'll go to the hotel.

88
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,230
But Mr. Goo is there.

89
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,029
Please create a travel department
at the hotel.

90
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,500
"Travel department?"

91
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,100
It's not the first half of the year
when everyone is hiring,

92
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,839
so there are no places to apply to.

93
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,470
Do we have to hold out
with unemployment benefits?

94
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,139
But unemployment benefits
don't just drop right away.

95
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,509
We're all in this mess
because of your brother, Ha Na!

96
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,480
That's enough.
She's on the same boat.

97
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,420
Mr. Hwang.

98
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:51,389
Mr. Hwang,
were we fired as of today?

99
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,230
No, I said I'd take responsibility.

100
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,500
You'd be transferred to the hotel.

101
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,100
- "The hotel?"
- "The hotel?"

102
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,939
How did they end up at the hotel?

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,839
Are we going to work for Mr. Goo?

104
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:10,639
You're my staff,
so you'll work for me.

105
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,110
We'll set up a new team,
the travel business department.

106
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:17,620
I'm transferring there
with all of you.

107
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,990
President Hwang, you'll go there
as a general manager?

108
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:29,959
- Chairwoman Shin?
- Yes, sir.

109
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,430
Let her in.

110
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,639
What brings you here
without prior notice?

111
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,379
I'll skip tea.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,110
Yes, ma'am.

113
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,220
I'd never been to your office,
so I came by on my way out,

114
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,449
and I had something to say, too.

115
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,829
As I promised, I'd keep
your corporate raiding off the record.

116
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,829
I kept it quiet
from your daughter, too.

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,199
She came to ask for a reason
after the business was sold.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,129
I see.

119
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,870
Even Mr. Hwang doesn't know,
does he?

120
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,439
You should be careful.

121
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,240
You found your daughter now.

122
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,779
If people hear about the raiding,
your daughter's safety may be...

123
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,810
Blackmailing won't work on me.

124
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,250
I was just worried.

125
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,920
I apologize
if it sounded like blackmailing.

126
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,519
Ha Na is a fake, so she won't have to
worry about her safety.

127
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:31,720
But she's sensitive.

128
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:36,189
Why don't we create
a travel service department...

129
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,529
at the hotel
and transfer Mr. Hwang there?

130
00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:39,629
"A travel service department?"

131
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:41,300
Mr. Hwang wanted that,

132
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,199
and it wouldn't be bad
to keep the trace...

133
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,970
of the travel agency, so I said yes.

134
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:48,639
Please do that.

135
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,310
I hope you get along with him
from now on.

136
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,040
That depends on him.

137
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,050
Please propose another video call
to Richard Han.

138
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,620
I'll meet all his conditions.

139
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,259
I'll ask him.

140
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,759
Do you see that? Gosh.

141
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,360
Have you ever seen this?

142
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,370
Here, Eun Chong.

143
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,639
- Thank you.
- Sure.

144
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,139
There's something in your hair.

145
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,910
- Ouch!
- Goodness. Did that hurt?

146
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,949
I saw something in your hair.

147
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:33,149
You're okay, right?

148
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:04,850
- Yeo Jin, you came home early.
- Yes.

149
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,850
Grandma!

150
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,720
- Was the kindergarten fun today?
- Yes!

151
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,429
Yeo Jin,
I need to go out for a moment.

152
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,629
What were you up to?

153
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,669
How did Yeo Jin
know about him and found him?

154
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,379
Right! Yes. The delivery.

155
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:35,909
You asked about something
that could be moderately sad and okay.

156
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,379
Yes, you're right.

157
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,549
She found out
about Yu Jin's death...

158
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,360
and her grandson at the same time.

159
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,090
It was probably tough
for her to sit in misery.

160
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,200
I knew she seemed busy
since that day.

161
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:53,899
My guess was correct.

162
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,230
The one who sent the delivery
must be her husband.

163
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,909
Of course.
Sung Ho must be in Korea, too.

164
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,710
The puzzle pieces are
finally coming together.

165
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,879
I don't even need to do
the DNA test.

166
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:09,509
But you should make sure of it.

167
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,279
You said
he wasn't on her family registry.

168
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,779
Who knows if he's really her son?

169
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,450
She might have adopted him.

170
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,990
I brought these just in case.

171
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,899
Get it done as soon as possible.

172
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:32,470
You should be careful.
You found your daughter now.

173
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:35,169
If people hear about the raiding,
your daughter's safety may be...

174
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:37,340
Blackmailing won't work on me.

175
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:40,179
Put off the corporate raids
that were in the process.

176
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,450
Eun Chong might fall into danger...

177
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,019
if the shell companies were exposed.

178
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:48,389
Should I examine if there are
bailout plans for those companies?

179
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,549
"Bailout?"

180
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,789
They failed
due to their incompetence.

181
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,799
Just put it off
until I kick Mr. Goo out of Hyesung.

182
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,899
I'll pick it up
as soon as I kick him out.

183
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:05,370
There must be another reason
why Chairwoman Shin hides...

184
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,440
her corporate raiding business.

185
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,840
Something other than her business
and personal reputation?

186
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:11,840
I mentioned her daughter's safety
in regard to her corporate raiding,

187
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:13,879
and she showed a sensitive response.

188
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,379
It felt like I hit a sore spot.

189
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,049
Come to think of it,
approving the disposal...

190
00:11:20,049 --> 00:11:21,519
is like betraying Hwang Jin Goo,

191
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,049
although she thinks of him as a son.

192
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,690
There might be something
she wanted to protect despite that.

193
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,259
That must be the reason
why she made Ha Na her fake daughter.

194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,500
And that is
Chairwoman Shin's weakness.

195
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,230
I need to do some digging on Ha Na.

196
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,200
Let's begin at the children's home.

197
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,240
I hope Mr. Hwang is okay.

198
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:44,240
He became a general manager
from a president.

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,210
Things may become more bloody
after he begins to work for Mr. Goo.

200
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,679
Can you stop talking about others?

201
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:51,320
Ms. Goo is here, too.

202
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,519
- Okay.
- Okay.

203
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,889
I'm still glad
we'll get to use this office.

204
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,929
All right, then.

205
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,299
Let's go for a group dinner.

206
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:08,470
It's my treat
to celebrate our new beginning.

207
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:15,610
What's wrong?
Don't be conscious of me.

208
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,080
Ms. Yoon, come with us.

209
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,710
Well, I'm with the hotel.

210
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,350
We're all with the hotel now,
so come with us.

211
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:25,480
- Come with us, Ms. Yoon.
- Come with us, Ms. Yoon.

212
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,190
- For our new beginning!
- New beginning!

213
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,000
Eat up, everyone.

214
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:46,000
Ms. Goo, we never had a team dinner
after you came. So, eat up,

215
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,909
and feel free to order extras, too.

216
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:49,970
Okay.

217
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,049
- Let me get some vegetables.
- I'll go.

218
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:57,350
No, I'll go.

219
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,679
Jin Kyung, why don't you go?

220
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,320
Right. Okay.

221
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,990
No, it's okay. I'll go.

222
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,559
Ms. Goo, give it to her.

223
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,250
Right. Your wedding is
just around the corner.

224
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,919
Three months is a long time.

225
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,419
People can have
12 weddings in that while.

226
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,820
Time really flies,

227
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,830
doesn't it?

228
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,929
Yes, you're right.

229
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,200
I need to make a call.

230
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,399
Sure.

231
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:59,279
(Home)

232
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,250
I need to take this call, too.

233
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,620
Hey, I suddenly had to be
at a team dinner. I'll be late.

234
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,830
Auntie, are you eating meat?

235
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,289
Eat a lot, then.

236
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,730
Okay, I'll eat a lot.

237
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,500
If you feel sleepy,
ask Grandma to put you to sleep.

238
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,740
Bye.

239
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,440
Where's the restroom?

240
00:14:33,379 --> 00:14:35,279
It's not like I want to be here.

241
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,210
I'm here to save Jin Goo's face.

242
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,950
I just came.
I can't leave right away.

243
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,649
You're nearby?

244
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,620
You're crazy.
What if someone sees you?

245
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,059
Just give me ten minutes.

246
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:53,529
How can you do that?

247
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:54,970
You can't mention marriage
that suddenly.

248
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,200
You should get married.

249
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,070
I don't have anyone to marry.

250
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,769
- Then, set me up with someone.
- I should.

251
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,009
How about Jin Kyung?

252
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,340
Mr. Hwang,
we don't marry our own family.

253
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,509
- We're pretty much family.
- Right.

254
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,350
Eat up.

255
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,049
Yes, thank you.

256
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,549
It's so good.

257
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,259
- It is.
- It's delicious.

258
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:19,889
- It's so good.
- It's tasty.

259
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,090
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:26,399
The canceled meeting
got rescheduled. I have to go.

261
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:29,799
- At this hour?
- The marketing team leader...

262
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,070
in New York is on a big power trip.

263
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,899
Where are you having the meeting?

264
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,440
Let me grab a taxi for you.

265
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:37,840
No, I'll find lots of them outside.

266
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,240
I'll get you a taxi.

267
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:43,149
It's okay, Ms. Goo. Eat your food.

268
00:15:43,149 --> 00:15:45,120
- I already had a lot.
- I'm fine.

269
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,320
Instead, this dinner is on me.

270
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,159
Thank you.

271
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:54,629
You're so caring, Ms. Yoon.

272
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,360
You'll be the best wife.

273
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,330
- Come on.
- What?

274
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,070
"Best wife?" My foot.

275
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,200
Call me.

276
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,269
Okay.

277
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,309
Bye.

278
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:21,220
Why did you agree to make
the travel service department?

279
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:23,019
You didn't even tell me.

280
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,590
- It was cute of him.
- Who was?

281
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,860
Jin Goo?

282
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,629
He has such a creative way
of rebelling.

283
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,899
I didn't expect him
to volunteer to work for me.

284
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,039
That man doesn't even have pride.

285
00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:39,539
He doesn't have pride,

286
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:42,370
but he has
a high level of self-respect.

287
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,240
I'll give him that.

288
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,850
You'd be reunited with Goo Ha Na.
How does that feel?

289
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,850
I don't really care.

290
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:53,950
We're on our own.

291
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:55,789
Jeez. You only say that.

292
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,590
So, how did you convince my aunt?

293
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,599
Jin Goo said
there seemed to be another reason.

294
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:07,259
I have no idea.

295
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,730
Well, she seems weird.

296
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,470
She's in such peace
even after betraying Jin Goo.

297
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:15,569
All she ever does is
play with that kid.

298
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,240
- Is it Eun Chong again?
- He must be a lucky kid.

299
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,509
He gets so much love from my aunt...

300
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:22,009
just because
he's Yu Jin's friend's son.

301
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,779
You're even jealous of him?

302
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,250
Whatever. This is so annoying.

303
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,730
It's such a relief he's only seven.

304
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:46,000
He'll need to be at least 20
to be her successor.

305
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:49,539
I'll have enough time until then.

306
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,940
Grandma, may I go see Yali...

307
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,480
after visiting Uncle's new business?

308
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,809
Was that Jin Goo's cat?

309
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,150
Sure. You can go with your auntie.

310
00:17:58,279 --> 00:17:59,819
All right!

311
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,650
- You must like cats, Eun Chong.
- Yes.

312
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,960
Grandma, I'm thirsty.

313
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,730
Is that so? Do you need
anything else other than water?

314
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,430
- Do you want some fruit?
- No.

315
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,000
All right.

316
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:16,569
My gosh, Eun Chong.
You're a good artist, too.

317
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,240
You took after your mom.

318
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:23,640
- Thank you for dinner.
- Thank you for dinner.

319
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,079
- Goodbye.
- Bye, now.

320
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,210
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

321
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,849
Bye.

322
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,980
- We should go, too.
- Okay.

323
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,930
Mr. Hwang, what do you see
in Se Young to marry her?

324
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,299
I've known her for a long time
since when we were children.

325
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,309
Everything happened naturally
and led to our marriage.

326
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:58,210
But you must love her
if you want to marry her.

327
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,009
I guess so.

328
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,910
You say it like
this isn't your business.

329
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,019
You should say it with confidence.

330
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,190
Right.

331
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,160
Gosh, she must be cold.

332
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:21,400
Do you want to go see it?

333
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,269
Yes.

334
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,400
Hello.

335
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,910
- Hello.
- Hello.

336
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,740
I have lots of pretty things.

337
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,609
Yes, there are
lots of pretty things.

338
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:34,480
Gosh, this is so pretty.

339
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,480
Hey, this looks like
the lucky bracelet.

340
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:41,150
- "The lucky bracelet?"
- Yes.

341
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:44,450
This kid gave me a bracelet
when I was younger.

342
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,930
He said the bracelet would protect me
instead of my family.

343
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,059
Right! I mentioned him to you.

344
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,900
He was the kid
who got the heart surgery.

345
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,700
Where...

346
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,039
and how did you meet him?

347
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,839
At the hospital.

348
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,380
By any chance, was it
Taesarang Seongmo Hospital in Incheon?

349
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,519
How did you know that?

350
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,059
I can't believe this.

351
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,960
Your hair was bobbed
back then, right?

352
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,000
Yes, how did you know?

353
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,569
- All right. Look here.
- Stop it.

354
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,740
Say something to Hwang Jin Goo.

355
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,140
Stop filming me.

356
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:34,869
Come on.

357
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,150
Wait, were you that boy
with the camcorder?

358
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,819
Yes! I was the boy
with the camcorder!

359
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,880
I can't believe this.
This can't be true.

360
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,490
How is this mathematically possible?

361
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,059
How did we reunite like this?

362
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:57,430
Gosh, no way. Wait, it's really you?

363
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,400
Gosh, that girl
with the bobbed hair...

364
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,269
became such a strong woman.

365
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,779
Was it thanks to my lucky bracelet?

366
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,009
Wait, this is real, right?

367
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:16,710
I still have that bracelet!

368
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,279
- Are you serious?
- Yes! I'll show it to you later.

369
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,150
- My gosh.
- What is this?

370
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:25,789
- I'm so happy to see you.
- Ma'am, we were childhood friends.

371
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:26,920
Really?

372
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:30,130
- I filmed you like this.
- My gosh. How can this be?

373
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,759
How can you be my childhood friend?

374
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:36,529
Doesn't he have any ambition?

375
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,970
Where did he get the idea
to work for Ji Seok?

376
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,309
I already know
who the real successor is,

377
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,880
so there's no need
to hang onto Jin Goo.

378
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,920
Se Young, you should be
nicer to Eun Chong from now on.

379
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,089
You're becoming
more like Aunt Yeo Jin.

380
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,160
He wasn't so bad.

381
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,720
He's clever and smart,

382
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:03,660
and he knows where the line is.

383
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:07,230
What's with you?
Is something going on?

384
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,900
No, not really.

385
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,039
I mean, think of that poor kid
who has no parents.

386
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,710
But Aunt Yeo Jin adores him.

387
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,339
He's 100 times better off than me.

388
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,480
Hey, how can you say that
while I'm around?

389
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:22,680
Do you not need me
as long as your aunt adores you?

390
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,849
No, Mom.

391
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:28,450
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

392
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:32,990
Exactly. Be nicer to Eun Chong.

393
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:36,289
I'm saying this for your sake. Okay?

394
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,500
How's Jin Goo?

395
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,869
He wouldn't show
that he was troubled.

396
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,000
We even had a team dinner
to keep everyone's spirits up.

397
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,369
He's like that.

398
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:52,079
Thank you for creating
the travel service department.

399
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,809
We'll do our best
and become as big as Hyesung Tour.

400
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,779
All right.

401
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:02,390
Right. I heard you helped Mr. Hwang
with his heart surgery.

402
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,759
- Did he tell you that?
- Yes.

403
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:08,019
Mom, here's a surprise.

404
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,960
We had met
when he was hospitalized...

405
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,700
to get his heart surgery.

406
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,430
- Really?
- Yes.

407
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:19,869
We were
both shocked out of our minds.

408
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,109
I was ten years old back then.

409
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,539
I couldn't believe
we reunited after 20 years.

410
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,650
I had lost Yu Jin
around when he got his surgery.

411
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,319
I realized...

412
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,990
I met so many great people
when I was ten.

413
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,119
My foster parents, Mr. Hwang,

414
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,589
and Eun Chong's mom, too.

415
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:45,329
If only
I had found Yu Jin back then...

416
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,299
Mom.

417
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,069
Yes, you should get some rest.

418
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,170
Let Eun Chong sleep in my room.

419
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,809
Okay. Goodnight.

420
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,920
Did I do something?

421
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,259
Did the meeting go well?

422
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,630
You said it was with
the marketing team leader in New York.

423
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,700
- Why do you ask?
- Did the person stay at our hotel?

424
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,569
Why do you want to know?

425
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,970
I'm with the hotel now.

426
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,410
I wanted to take an interest.

427
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,069
Why? Do you want to work
at another department?

428
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:32,680
Ask Aunt Yeo Jin, then.

429
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,180
No, I like
the travel service department.

430
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,279
Can you set up a meeting for me
with the marketing team leader?

431
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,819
I wonder if that person wants
a tour of Seoul.

432
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,450
I can be the tour guide.

433
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,690
It'll help with your business, too.
You should ask.

434
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:48,730
I'll bring it up.

435
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,869
Why is she seeing someone else
while dating Mr. Hwang?

436
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,500
Wait!

437
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,700
(Taesarang Seongmo Hospital)

438
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,640
You can have this.

439
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:38,779
What is this?

440
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:40,380
That bracelet will
bring you good luck.

441
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,579
Mr. Hwang was...

442
00:25:44,849 --> 00:25:48,589
still as warm-hearted and brave
as he was back then.

443
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,589
Then, you weren't unemployed?

444
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:57,259
Why would your son
become unemployed?

445
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,160
The hotel will create Travel Service
Department, and I'll lead it.

446
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,829
If it's just a department,

447
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,369
will you be a general manager
instead of a president?

448
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,240
Why? Do you want your son
as a president, not a manager?

449
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,180
Well, it's not that
I want one thing or the other.

450
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:14,950
- Are you all right?
- Of course.

451
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:17,349
I'm transferring there
with my entire staff.

452
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,779
I'll develop it with my best
and bring the travel agency back.

453
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:24,190
My son always ends up
starting from scratch.

454
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,190
It's because he's that competent.

455
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:27,990
That job isn't for everyone.

456
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,660
If you're fine, I'm fine, too.

457
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,329
Wonderful job, my son.

458
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,069
When will I put an end
to your physical...

459
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,140
and emotional suffering?

460
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,279
I'm sorry, Mom.

461
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,339
Don't say that again.

462
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:50,109
Mom, you know what?

463
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,920
Ms. Goo and I had met
when we were younger.

464
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,390
Really? When?

465
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,859
Congratulations on your new endeavor,
Mr. Goo Ji Chang.

466
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,259
Thank you, Ha Na.

467
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,730
Hey. "No rain, no flowers."

468
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:14,000
Our family motto is
perfect for this situation.

469
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,839
This tteokbokki place
will become my flowers.

470
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,309
Uncle Ji Chang,
congratulations on your business.

471
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:22,980
This is a rare item,
but it's a special present for you.

472
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,650
(May you become rich.)

473
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,380
Thanks a lot, Eun Chong!

474
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,789
I shall become rich!

475
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:31,920
Anyway, is Ji Eun not here yet?

476
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,490
She's always late.

477
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,559
She must be on her way.

478
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,059
- There she is.
- Hey.

479
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,500
Hey, congrats, Ji Chang.

480
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:46,569
Hey. That's very nice of you.

481
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,910
Money is the best present.

482
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:51,670
Are we all here?

483
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:53,779
Then, I'll show you what I can do!

484
00:27:54,109 --> 00:27:55,750
Gosh, what's with him?

485
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,549
- What's with him?
- What's with him?

486
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,420
- What's wrong with him?
- He got excited.

487
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:10,759
Hello, Chief Director.

488
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,630
So, you've heard.

489
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,970
I got a fresh start...

490
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,599
at the travel service department
with Hyesung Hotel.

491
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,240
I look forward
to our future businesses.

492
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,440
Yes, of course.

493
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,740
Right. Last night, I had a drink...

494
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,910
with the marketing team leader
from New York.

495
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,849
I heard Ms. Yoon Se Young was
there, too.

496
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,650
She didn't come.

497
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,319
Really?

498
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:37,089
I must be mistaken.

499
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,660
Yes, I'll stop by very soon.

500
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,230
Yes. Goodbye.

501
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,430
She wasn't at the meeting?

502
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,769
- Goodness, come in. It's cold.
- Oh, my. Hello.

503
00:28:52,769 --> 00:28:54,099
- Hey.
- Hello.

504
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,369
- Welcome.
- Hello.

505
00:28:55,369 --> 00:28:57,039
- Hey, Eun Chong.
- Hello.

506
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,109
Eun Chong,
Yali is hiding under the sofa.

507
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,049
Yali!

508
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,609
Eun Chong, play the hunting game.

509
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,819
Okay.

510
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,819
Right. I got some tteokbokki.
Please have some.

511
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,819
My brother opened
his new business today.

512
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,920
Really? Why didn't you tell me?

513
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,230
If I had known,
I would've stopped by.

514
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,900
Your brother?
You mean Eun Chong's second uncle?

515
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,500
- Yes.
- I'm so happy for him.

516
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,869
He seemed to be bright,
friendly, and diligent.

517
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,369
He is. He's a good kid.

518
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,069
I should go there sometime.

519
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:31,710
She's opening
a shabu shabu place soon.

520
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:34,039
Goodness, really? Congratulations.

521
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,210
Please come by.

522
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,049
And yes, Jin Goo told me.

523
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:40,480
- What are the chances?
- Gosh.

524
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,990
Yes, I was really surprised, too.

525
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,490
Chairwoman Shin
seems to hold a weakness?

526
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,430
Yes, something she wants to protect
even by turning Ha Na...

527
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,130
into her fake daughter.

528
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,769
When she collapsed
after receiving the delivery,

529
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:58,940
I thought she probably received
good news and bad news,

530
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,670
and my guess was right.

531
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,210
The news of her daughter's death
must be the bad news.

532
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:06,640
What's the good news?

533
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:11,109
Something that she can protect
only by making Ha Na her daughter.

534
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:17,720
What would she protect that dearly
even after her daughter had passed?

535
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,019
There must be something.

536
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:22,160
That's why she's hiding
her business in corporate raiding.

537
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:24,490
- Do you plan to find what it is?
- Yes, sir.

538
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,029
What about reporting
her daughter's death?

539
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,470
It wasn't so easy
to handle the police as I thought.

540
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:40,539
I'll find another way
other than the police.

541
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,650
Ji Seok, can't you just stop here?

542
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,690
Everyone will become miserable
if you find out.

543
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,890
(Head Director's Office)

544
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:02,299
What could her weakness be?

545
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,940
Well, she seems weird.

546
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,240
She's in such peace
even after betraying Jin Goo.

547
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,809
All she ever does is
play with that kid.

548
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,109
He must be a lucky kid.

549
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,049
He gets so much love from my aunt...

550
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,609
just because
he's Yu Jin's friend's son.

551
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:21,119
It's not just Ha Na.
I now have that kid as my superior.

552
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:25,089
At times, it feels like
he has the most power at my place.

553
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,359
Chairwoman Shin adores Eun Chong?

554
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,559
But her fake daughter
brought that kid home.

555
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,200
Eun Chong is Du Na's son.

556
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,700
And Du Na was a friend
she met at the children's home.

557
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,640
Hwang Jin Goo went to
St. Paul's Home two days in a row?

558
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,640
Yes, according to Zero,

559
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,680
his car navigator was
set to that address.

560
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:50,849
Yesterday, Chairwoman Shin
must've gone there with him.

561
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,079
Yes, I'm sure
she's looking for her daughter.

562
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,519
Du Na was
from that children's home, too.

563
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,359
What if she used a different name
that wasn't Yoon Yu Jin?

564
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:06,700
Wait, is Du Na actually Yoon Yu Jin?

565
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,640
Back then, Mr. Hwang was
just a young boy who was my age,

566
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:15,740
but he was really clever and nice.

567
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:17,640
He was like that.

568
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,680
Jin Goo was always brave
while fighting his illness.

569
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:25,880
That ten-year-old kid
went through the surgery bravely.

570
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,049
But I felt so bad
whenever I thought of the chairwoman.

571
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,559
What? Why?

572
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:35,690
What do you mean?
Because she lost you.

573
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:38,089
Back then?

574
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,400
The water is boiling.

575
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:48,000
But she said she lost me
when I was seven.

576
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,099
(Cinderella Game)

577
00:33:46,329 --> 00:33:49,500
Would she betray me
if she found out she wasn't Yu Jin?

578
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,730
You should be ready
for the worst-case scenario.

579
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,000
I'm seeing the plot here.

580
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,940
Du Na was Yoon Yu Jin?

581
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,440
You were pretty back then, Ms. Goo.
Especially when you smiled.

582
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,410
Goo Ha Na is nothing but a cover.
The kid was the real deal.

583
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,039
I'll wait for the right moment.

584
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,849
I want to stay with you, too,
Auntie Ha Na!

585
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:08,079
So, everything was staged
by Chairwoman Shin and Hwang Jin Goo.

586
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,550
You lost me when I was seven, right?

587
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,320
Did you hear something?

588
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:14,420
