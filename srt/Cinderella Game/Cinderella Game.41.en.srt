1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,909
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,439
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:04,910
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,279
Can we have the young gentleman
sit on the chairwoman's lap?

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,080
Should we do that?

6
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,019
All right.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,690
All right. Everything looks great.
I'll take one now.

8
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,800
All right. We're all done.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,129
May we wrap up?

10
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:26,429
Wait, one moment.

11
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:30,800
Se Young and Yu Jin
should take one as sisters.

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,369
Yes, okay.

13
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:35,140
Let's go over here.

14
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,740
Yu Jin, let's take one together.

15
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:39,609
Okay.

16
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,420
Gosh, look how beautiful they are.

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,390
Yu Jin,
life as Goo Ha Na fits you better.

18
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,359
Go back to your place.

19
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,570
You said you'd look forward to it...

20
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,600
when I said
I wouldn't be patient anymore.

21
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,109
All right, then.
Look forward to it, Se Young.

22
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,780
Okay. That's all.

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,549
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your work.

24
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:21,620
Thank you.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,390
Yu Jin, you must be tired,
so, Eun Chong, you can stay with me.

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,790
Okay.
Auntie, you should get some rest.

27
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,890
All right.

28
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,329
Take a rest.

29
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,230
Excuse me.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,180
My goodness.
Why did you take a shot like this?

31
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:52,519
Well, they looked
quite wonderful together.

32
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,150
I don't see a grandma
with her grandson too often now.

33
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:57,290
So, yes.

34
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,819
Grandson, my foot.

35
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:13,939
Mom, Dad, I owe...

36
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,340
meeting my birth mother to you two.

37
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,310
Thank you.

38
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:32,219
Please continue to grow well
in this place.

39
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,939
I felt tense all day long,
so my neck muscles are...

40
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,240
about to ache.

41
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,479
You've done well today.

42
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:52,139
Just keep up this good work.

43
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:54,509
That brat won't last long...

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,849
once I begin to do some digging.

45
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,889
Goo Ha Na is
Aunt Yeo Jin's daughter.

46
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:02,449
It won't be that easy
to kick her out.

47
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,289
It won't be.

48
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,189
No.

49
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,759
But every cloud has a silver lining.

50
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,729
And our days aren't cloudy just yet.

51
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,240
Come in.

52
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,840
Se Young, can we talk?

53
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,780
You can't do this to us.

54
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,150
How could you completely deceive us?

55
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:35,319
How can you deceive us and help her make
that fake daughter, you jerk?

56
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:36,960
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,060
Try to show Se Young a quarter
of your loyalty to Yeo Jin.

58
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,830
All you care about is
the chairwoman.

59
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,300
Didn't you know
how shocking it'd be for Se Young?

60
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:50,000
The chairwoman
may have put you up for this,

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,039
- but this is still a betrayal.
- Mom, that's enough.

62
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,770
I'm keeping my eyes on you.

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,650
When did you find out
Goo Ha Na was Yu Jin?

64
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,150
From the beginning?

65
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:11,819
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,860
You deceived me
from the start to the end?

67
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,600
You said some woman was
peeking at her in the lobby...

68
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,230
and that she wanted you to ask Ha Na
to take the parentage test!

69
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,329
That woman was...

70
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,529
Aunt Yeo Jin?

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,339
Se Young.

72
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,139
How can you do this?

73
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,810
How can you do this to me?

74
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:31,139
Did you get a kick out
of deceiving me?

75
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,850
Didn't you feel anything
when Goo Ha Na was stressing me out?

76
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,579
Did you feel nothing
when you said you didn't know...

77
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,120
whenever I asked about Yu Jin?

78
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,449
It tortured me
to be dishonest with you.

79
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:44,689
You're lying.

80
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,329
You were completely brazen
whenever I asked about Yu Jin.

81
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,899
Weren't you supposed to marry me?

82
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,970
Are you really on my side?
At least make an excuse!

83
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,069
I was the one who did wrong,
so how could I make an excuse?

84
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,370
If you want to hit me, I'll let you.

85
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,139
If you want to swear at me,
I'll listen.

86
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,470
At least use my aunt as an excuse!

87
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:06,639
You, me, and Mother
can't defy the chairwoman.

88
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,009
Did you want me to disappoint her?

89
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:10,850
I know you don't want that.

90
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,990
So, you expect me
to accept everything?

91
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,160
You had no choice, so I was free
to forgive you or do whatever?

92
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,160
What do you want me to do?

93
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,490
Do you want me to break up with you?

94
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,160
- What is this nonsense?
- Then, are you sure...

95
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,959
you won't lie to me in the future?

96
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:30,500
Can you share all
of the chairwoman's secrets with me?

97
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,500
See that?

98
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,209
You should've shared it with me
even if she wanted to keep it quiet.

99
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,610
That's the least courtesy
you can show your fiancee!

100
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,180
We knew about this
when we began dating.

101
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,949
I knew about it,
but it still felt nasty.

102
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,250
I felt like I'd always be
the 2nd or the 3rd priority.

103
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,490
Will I ever get my chance
after Aunt Yeo Jin and your mother?

104
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,019
No, I'm probably
fourth on the list now.

105
00:05:51,189 --> 00:05:53,319
Goo Ha Na will come before me.

106
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:54,959
All right.

107
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,160
She found her daughter now,
so I'll focus more on you.

108
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:00,970
I don't trust your words anymore.

109
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,930
Everything you say
sounds like a lie.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,540
I wasn't even sure
if it'd be right...

111
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:09,610
for me to marry someone like you.

112
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:19,250
Se Young.

113
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,259
I'm so heartbroken.
It's so hard on me.

114
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,220
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,800
Kiss me.

116
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,300
- Right now?
- No?

117
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,730
- Do you mean it?
- Now.

118
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,379
This is your problem.

119
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,250
You always do as I say.

120
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,050
You're so boring.

121
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:58,060
I can be a pretty fun guy, actually.

122
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,019
But you said
you hated playing games.

123
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:02,060
Did you change your mind?

124
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,129
Don't think that we're done here.

125
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm keeping my eyes on you.

126
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:11,100
I'll show all my loyalty
until you feel better.

127
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,910
I won't let you two
get away with this.

128
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:40,360
My lady, have you had dinner?

129
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,569
"My lady?"

130
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,069
I already ate. What about you?

131
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,269
I'm eating dinner now.

132
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,509
I splurged at the department store
with the chairwoman's credit card.

133
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,740
I'm now at a tteokbokki place
to discuss my potential business...

134
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,040
and eating dinner with Mr. Han.

135
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,850
The chairwoman
gave you a credit card?

136
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,879
- When?
- This morning.

137
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,120
Hey, stop calling your mom
the chairwoman.

138
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:02,149
Ji Eun also has one,

139
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,519
so make sure you thank her for us.

140
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,790
Don't use it up to the limit,
and keep it moderate.

141
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,529
Don't even worry about me.

142
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,329
Ji Eun is the one
you need to worry about.

143
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,430
Anyway, when will you
invite me, my lady?

144
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:18,899
Stop calling me that.
You're giving me the creeps.

145
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,209
I'll talk to Mom and set a date.

146
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,709
All right. What's Eun Chong up to?

147
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,610
Did he get nervous on day one
and get into trouble?

148
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,310
Hey, he's not you.

149
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:31,519
He's playing in my mom's room.

150
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:34,519
No way. He's playing
in the chairwoman's room?

151
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,049
I must've taught him well.

152
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,820
He's already playing good politics.

153
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:43,830
I should give him regular lessons
on fitting into the rich life...

154
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:48,500
Hello?

155
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,269
My lady?

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,309
Gosh, she hung up on me
without saying goodbye.

157
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,710
Has she already become haughty
because she's rich now?

158
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:00,139
What about Eun Chong?

159
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:05,750
That kid must've captured
the chairwoman's heart from day one.

160
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,190
He exceeded my expectations.

161
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,929
What do you think
about the vibe in this place?

162
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,440
This is on the top of my list
of potential businesses.

163
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,169
It's delicious.
And the place looks great, too.

164
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:36,110
Try and dip this
into the crunch here.

165
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:43,220
- I see.
- Isn't it good?

166
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,159
Hey, so, tell me
about the chairwoman's daughter.

167
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,129
You'd be surprised.

168
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,799
Why would I?
It's not like I know her.

169
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,830
It's Ms. Goo Ha Na,
Eun Chong's aunt.

170
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,870
Eun Chong's aunt is
the chairwoman's daughter?

171
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,379
Did you make up a lie to tease me?

172
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,210
It's true. Ms. Goo is
the chairwoman's daughter.

173
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,649
Goodness.

174
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,149
What's wrong, Mom?

175
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,419
If she really was
the chairwoman's daughter,

176
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,460
then I must've made a huge mistake.

177
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,029
I hope I didn't hurt her.

178
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,629
- Why?
- I didn't want any rumors...

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,559
before you got married,

180
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,870
so I told her
to distance herself from you.

181
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,669
I asked her to understand
how I was worried about my kid.

182
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,639
I said that to her.

183
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,669
It'll be fine.

184
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,009
Ms. Goo found her birth mother,

185
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:40,750
and she wouldn't run into you
too often anyway.

186
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,250
We'll see each other every day.
I'm in trouble.

187
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,649
So, Eun Chong meant he'd be moving into
the chairwoman's place.

188
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,990
I would've apologized to her
if I had known back then.

189
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:53,960
Goodness, what am I going to do?

190
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:58,200
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

191
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,799
Are you sure I won't have to worry?

192
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,700
I am.

193
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,210
No way. Yoon Se Young fainted?

194
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,039
That serves her right.

195
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,340
You should repay her
for every moment she harassed you.

196
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,649
What? The credit card?

197
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:17,720
Well, it's...

198
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:21,519
Hold the article...

199
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,350
- on selling Hyesung Tour for now.
- Yes, sir.

200
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,190
You were home, Ji Seok.

201
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,529
Ha Na, I have to go.

202
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,899
- You're home.
- Yes, Ji Seok.

203
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,700
- Who's that?
- He's my secretary.

204
00:11:38,139 --> 00:11:41,409
Hello, I'm his younger sister,
Goo Ji Eun.

205
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,840
Yes, hello. My name is Danny Jung.

206
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,080
"Danny Jung?"

207
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,750
Both his name
and style are so polished.

208
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,350
He's just my type.

209
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,850
By any chance,
are you a Korean-American?

210
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,090
Something like that.

211
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,519
Nice to meet you.

212
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,129
Nice to meet you.

213
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,129
Please excuse me, Mr. Goo.

214
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,860
See you tomorrow.

215
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,169
Goodbye.

216
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,610
Ji Seok, how is your secretary
so good-looking?

217
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,269
I thought he was a model.

218
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,279
How old is he? He's single, right?

219
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:24,519
What did he mean when he said
he was something like a Korean-American?

220
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,919
Who were you on the phone with?

221
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,720
Oh, it was Ha Na.

222
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,320
Yoon Se Young fainted
as soon as she saw her.

223
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,269
Ji Seok, will you
keep doing this with Ha Na?

224
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,610
I haven't received a gift like this
for such a long time.

225
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,409
Thanks, Yu Jin.

226
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,679
So? Do I look okay?

227
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,580
Yes, it looks great on you.

228
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,750
We have some for Grandpa, too.

229
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,580
"Grandpa?"

230
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,120
I bought Dad's presents, too.
They match with yours.

231
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,860
I see.

232
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,629
Once he came back, it'd be nice
for you two to wear these.

233
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,259
Has he not reached out yet?

234
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,570
No.

235
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,870
Is there no way
for you to contact him?

236
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,440
No.

237
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,610
The last time I heard from him was
over ten years ago.

238
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,210
By any chance, could he have
passed away or fallen ill?

239
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,279
I doubt that.

240
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,179
I would've heard something
if that was the case.

241
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,879
I see.

242
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,690
May I see his photos?

243
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,090
Photos?

244
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,529
Was this you when you were a baby?

245
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,970
You were cute.

246
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,139
You're right. I was really cute.

247
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,340
Those are childhood photos
of Eun Chong's mom.

248
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:02,879
I can't believe these are me.
It's so weird.

249
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,620
I see.

250
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,250
That must be Dad.

251
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,960
It must've been very hard on him
after he lost me.

252
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,970
He's a parent,
so of course, it's hard.

253
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,070
May I take one of the pictures?

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,100
Sure.

255
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,879
Hey, it's a wooden swing.

256
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:37,210
Was there a wooden swing
in the front yard?

257
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,750
This photo?
Yes, a long time ago for a short while.

258
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,759
Eun Chong must be sleepy.

259
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,259
Eun Chong, let's sleep in our room.

260
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,629
Goodnight, Mom.

261
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,769
You can leave him here on my bed.

262
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:58,039
Goodness, you'll be uncomfortable.

263
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,440
He often wakes up at night,
and he tosses and turns, too.

264
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,610
I rarely wake up once I fall asleep.

265
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,009
You can put him down here.

266
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,889
Okay.

267
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,429
Call me
if he gets up and starts to cry.

268
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,230
All right. You must be tired
after your first day. Get some rest.

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,429
- See you tomorrow.
- Goodnight, Mom.

270
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,809
My dear grandson.

271
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,389
It must've been a tough journey
back to your grandma.

272
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not time
for me to meet you yet.

273
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,799
Please take good care of Eun Chong.

274
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,539
I'll never let you see him.

275
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,340
Auntie Ha Na...

276
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,099
When did you get up and leave?

277
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,299
And you left alone
without waking me.

278
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,869
It wasn't my fault.

279
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
I didn't do it.

280
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,480
One. Two. Three.

281
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,579
- You should get in, too.
- Four.

282
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,190
- What?
- You don't want to?

283
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,089
- You said we were like sisters.
- Six.

284
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:07,259
Seven. Eight.

285
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:10,390
Nine. Ten.

286
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,930
- Eleven. Twelve.
- Yu Jin.

287
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,599
Thirteen.

288
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,900
- No, go away.
- Fourteen. Fifteen.

289
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,299
What?

290
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,099
Auntie...

291
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:57,670
What is this? Why are you here?

292
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,410
Get out of my room!

293
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:03,180
Why? What's wrong?

294
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,579
Wait, why is he here?

295
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,190
I have no idea.

296
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,259
Wait, hey. Why are you crying here?

297
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,029
- Eun Chong, why are you crying?
- Auntie...

298
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,799
What happened to your face,
Eun Chong?

299
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,720
So, you fell off the bed?

300
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:46,190
Oh, no. You got bruised.

301
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,059
He surprised me
and almost gave me a heart attack!

302
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:51,700
Why was he in my bed?

303
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:55,000
Why didn't you look after him
and cause trouble from day one?

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,970
You shocked her
while she was still stressed out.

305
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,640
You don't deserve to cry like that.

306
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,740
Anyway, he could get the rooms confused
on the first day.

307
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,309
I'll grab the first aid kit,
so give me a moment, Yu Jin.

308
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,920
Goodness. You must be in pain.

309
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,960
Darn it.
Why did it have to be my room?

310
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,529
What's going on?
I heard Eun Chong crying.

311
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,759
Eun Chong...

312
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,930
Well, I...

313
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,839
found him sleeping on my bed,

314
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,940
so I was surprised in my sleep.

315
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,009
Eun Chong.

316
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,809
What happened to Eun Chong's face?

317
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,279
What did you do to this kid?

318
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:47,349
He'll be fine
after he puts an ointment on it.

319
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,150
How will he be fine?
His face got bruised.

320
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:54,019
My goodness.
It must've hurt so much.

321
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,000
Bring some ice for him.

322
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,400
Now!

323
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,599
Are you talking to me?

324
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,910
- Let me see you.
- Okay.

325
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,180
Thankfully, he didn't bleed.

326
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,950
You must've been shocked and hurt.

327
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:20,049
I feel better now.

328
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,750
I found an ointment for scratches.
He'll be fine after this.

329
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:25,390
Come here.

330
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:29,690
Here, I got some ice.

331
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,529
All right.

332
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,130
- That's cold!
- Does it feel cold?

333
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:38,299
Why didn't you put it in a bag?

334
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,309
I can wrap it with this.
Give me that.

335
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,779
Okay. Let me put it on you.

336
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,680
Let's stay like this for a moment
until the swelling goes down.

337
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,450
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

338
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,920
I was really surprised.
I didn't know it was you.

339
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,750
Are you in a lot of pain?

340
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,490
How did you bruise him from pushing?

341
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,529
I'm sorry.

342
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:04,190
I'm sorry, too.

343
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:06,759
I thought it was
Auntie Ha Na's room.

344
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,069
It can happen.

345
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:10,430
You were confused
on your first day at a big house.

346
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:11,900
It wasn't your fault.

347
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,410
We now have another boss at home.

348
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,950
What happened to Eun Chong's face?

349
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,450
What did you do to this kid?

350
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,220
This was the first day Aunt Yeo Jin
got mad at me after that day.

351
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,059
Where's Yu Jin?

352
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,930
She was with you.

353
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,269
Why did you let Yu Jin
get on that boat all alone?

354
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,069
What were you doing?

355
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:19,240
Yoon Se Young fainted
as soon as she saw her.

356
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,710
Do you feel unwell? Have some water.

357
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,119
- No, thanks.
- I heard you fainted yesterday.

358
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:38,920
Did you hope I'd die
instead of fainting?

359
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,730
Yes, I feel like
I want to kill myself right now,

360
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,529
so don't add to this.

361
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:48,430
You don't have to put your guard up
against me. Drink this.

362
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,099
You have such a weak heart.

363
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:55,769
How are you going to survive
life with Goo Ha Na?

364
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,680
If you're unwell,
leave early and get some rest.

365
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,180
If you don't want to go home,
you can rest at my office.

366
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,890
(Do not open the fire door.)

367
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:21,769
Come out a little later.

368
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:37,210
Hello.

369
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,619
Hello.

370
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,660
Ms. Goo moved into
the chairwoman's place yesterday.

371
00:24:46,089 --> 00:24:47,119
You know, right?

372
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:51,230
I believe Ms. Goo
went through a lot of trouble...

373
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,529
trying to take care of her siblings.

374
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,869
I knew you two cut ties,
but you should wish for her happiness...

375
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,000
for the years
you two lived as a family.

376
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,940
You're quite nosy
about our family affair.

377
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,640
I thought the chairwoman's family
and Ms. Goo's family were enemies.

378
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,309
Otherwise, I couldn't understand
why you'd cut ties...

379
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,309
with your sister.

380
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,849
So? Were you disappointed
that you couldn't find anything...

381
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,319
after digging into my background?

382
00:25:18,789 --> 00:25:20,519
I was more relieved
than disappointed.

383
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,690
The two families
shouldn't be enemies.

384
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,359
At times, it seems like
you're more into Ms. Goo.

385
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,930
You should pay more attention
to your fiancee...

386
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,799
than the chairwoman's daughter.

387
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,900
At this rate,
will you actually get married?

388
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:34,769
I kept having this feeling.

389
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,640
Do you hold
a personal grudge against me?

390
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:40,880
Or were you interested in Ms. Yoon?

391
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,650
What is it? Just tell me what it is.

392
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,650
I don't have as much interest in her
as you have in Ms. Goo.

393
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:49,190
You should
look after Ms. Yoon first.

394
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:52,089
She's in a tough spot
because of the chairwoman's daughter.

395
00:25:52,589 --> 00:25:54,289
Don't make her life more miserable.

396
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,529
You have a lot of interest
in Ms. Yoon.

397
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:57,759
She's one of my staff.

398
00:25:58,430 --> 00:25:59,730
I should be interested.

399
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,670
I never knew you cared so much
about your staff members.

400
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,339
I learned that from you.

401
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,690
You should pay more attention
to your fiancee...

402
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,089
than the chairwoman's daughter.

403
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,799
At this rate,
will you actually get married?

404
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,299
He keeps getting on my nerves
as days go by.

405
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:42,509
I need to get some rest.

406
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,009
- Do you feel unwell?
- Yu Jin's nephew...

407
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,039
caused trouble.

408
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:50,880
"Trouble?"

409
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,480
He slept on my bed
in the middle of the night,

410
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,619
thinking it was Goo Ha Na's room.

411
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:00,190
I was so shocked
that I almost had a heart attack.

412
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,160
- He got the rooms confused.
- Is this funny to you?

413
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:05,700
I almost had a heart attack.

414
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:08,369
And Aunt Yeo Jin got mad at me...

415
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,069
over a little bruise on his face.

416
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,170
Why was his face bruised?

417
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:15,170
Were you also worried more about that kid
than me?

418
00:27:15,569 --> 00:27:17,910
Couldn't you fathom
how shocked I was?

419
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,380
Also, my aunt...

420
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,349
Gosh, forget it.

421
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,450
Try to understand. He's just a kid.

422
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,819
The chairwoman must've said that...

423
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:27,450
- because a kid was hurt...
- Good grief!

424
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,420
- What's wrong?
- I don't understand all of you.

425
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:33,289
Yu Jin, who moved in
with her friend's son,

426
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,660
Aunt Yeo Jin, who got mad at me...

427
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,460
trying to look after a strange kid,

428
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,900
and you, who told me to understand
instead of consoling me!

429
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,130
Se Young.

430
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,900
Do you know
what's on my mind right now?

431
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,910
I feel like I'm now in 5th place,
not even the 4th place.

432
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,009
It's as if that kid comes before me!

433
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,650
I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

434
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,509
Were you that surprised?

435
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,420
Should I get you a calming pill?

436
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,190
Se Young.

437
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:07,289
Please don't be mad. I'm sorry.

438
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,329
I'm sick of hearing you say that.

439
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,470
Why is she getting antsy
against Eun Chong, too?

440
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:24,440
Goodness.

441
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,950
You're going through so much
after following me.

442
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,119
That was a harsh way to settle in.

443
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:42,730
You should try your best
to keep your distance from Eun Chong.

444
00:28:43,259 --> 00:28:46,160
But he was hurt.
How could I turn a blind eye to him?

445
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,430
I wasn't saying you should do that.

446
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,170
I understand what you mean.

447
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:52,940
Yes?

448
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,309
Hey, Yu Jin. How's Eun Chong?

449
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,150
He's asleep.
The bruise got a little better.

450
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,180
Let's take him to a plastic surgeon
if it may scar him later.

451
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:07,849
There's this doctor I know.

452
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,549
I don't think it'll leave a scar.

453
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:15,329
Mom, thank you
for treating Eun Chong nicely.

454
00:29:15,859 --> 00:29:17,460
Don't say that.

455
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,160
If he's your family,
then he's my family, too.

456
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:24,069
Let's invite
your siblings soon, too.

457
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,440
Okay.

458
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,009
Right! I heard you gave
your credit cards to them.

459
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:32,309
They're still young and immature,
so they'll probably splurge.

460
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,839
Did you put a limit on it?

461
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,680
Let them use it
as much as they want.

462
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,849
No, they'll get into an awful habit.

463
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:41,480
Right. Ms. Ha Na,
I have your credit card, too.

464
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,190
I'm fine.

465
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,460
It's from me, so just take it.

466
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,160
Thank you.

467
00:29:55,099 --> 00:29:57,099
Have you been digging into
Goo Ha Na's background?

468
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,799
Who'd know if she got cash
or real estate?

469
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,240
Just look into everything.

470
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:07,279
Why did you think it was her
among so many girls?

471
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,809
There has to be a connection
between the two.

472
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:17,190
All right. Call me right away
when you find something. Bye.

473
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:24,089
I need to find out what the deal is
between Yeo Jin and her...

474
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,160
to find an excuse to kick her out.

475
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:39,309
You don't have to put your guard up
against me. Drink this.

476
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,009
You have such a weak heart.

477
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,519
How are you going to survive
life with Goo Ha Na?

478
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,150
If you're unwell,
leave early and get some rest.

479
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,990
If you don't want to go home,
you can rest at my office.

480
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:59,730
My fiance is
worse than my ex-boyfriend.

481
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:05,599
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

482
00:31:17,349 --> 00:31:18,650
Why do you look so down?

483
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,980
Do you know
how awful it feels to return home?

484
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:23,190
I feel like
I'm walking into my death.

485
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,849
You're putting on an act.

486
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,059
When you see Yu Jin,

487
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,730
ask about Eun Chong
and be nice to her.

488
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:41,000
Goo Ha Na, Yoon Yu Jin.
You're so annoying, whoever you are.

489
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,950
What's this?
Does this belong to the kid?

490
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,420
Darn it.

491
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:44,700
What are you doing in my room?

492
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,799
(Cinderella Game)

493
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,130
Do you have something to say?

494
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,069
I hope you'll die.

495
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:52,940
- Throw all these out.
- Why did she lie...

496
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,569
about Yu Jin's death
and take that brat in as her daughter?

497
00:33:55,569 --> 00:33:58,170
- Don't you understand?
- I understood.

498
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,809
You can tell me things
you can't tell Hwang Jin Goo.

499
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,349
I'm sick of hearing Goo Ha Na!

500
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:03,480
Don't sit down!

501
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,619
It's because Jin Goo
doesn't get his act together!

502
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:08,889
- Eun Chong's mom looked familiar.
- Mom!

503
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,219
Mom, be careful.

504
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:12,019
Yu Jin.
