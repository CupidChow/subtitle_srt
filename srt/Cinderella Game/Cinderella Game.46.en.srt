00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:05,645
(Episode 46)

2
00:00:06,475 --> 00:00:08,575
What's all this?

3
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:12,713
Mom would feel stiff when the weather turned cold,

4
00:00:12,714 --> 00:00:14,115
so I ordered some things to help with that.

5
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:18,185
You have no idea she's taking advantage of you as a fake daughter,

6
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:20,084
and you're acting like such a good girl.

7
00:00:21,924 --> 00:00:23,424
- Yeo Jin. - You're up.

8
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,023
- Yes. - What about Eun Chong?

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:26,064
He's still asleep.

10
00:00:26,395 --> 00:00:29,795
Yeo Jin, you got into a habit of putting that boy to sleep.

11
00:00:32,164 --> 00:00:33,405
What's this?

12
00:00:33,975 --> 00:00:38,844
I told her I was worried about your wrist condition,

13
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:42,115
so Yu Jin got all these for you.

14
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:45,344
You should take it when you feel stiff in the morning.

15
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,583
It'll help you if you keep taking it.

16
00:00:47,584 --> 00:00:48,715
I'll make sure you won't forget.

17
00:00:49,054 --> 00:00:50,925
Yes, you should have one now.

18
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:54,195
Okay. Just one.

19
00:00:54,695 --> 00:00:55,754
Try this.

20
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:58,665
This is why people need a daughter.

21
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:04,233
You don't even know you're getting deceived.

22
00:01:04,234 --> 00:01:05,905
Enough is enough.

23
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,674
Auntie.

24
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:11,545
Eun Chong must be up.

25
00:01:14,045 --> 00:01:15,144
Did you sleep well?

26
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:20,953
Why? What's wrong?

27
00:01:20,954 --> 00:01:23,385
I saw my mommy in my sleep.

28
00:01:24,954 --> 00:01:26,025
You did?

29
00:01:26,724 --> 00:01:27,954
What did she do?

30
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,465
She gave me this big hug.

31
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,665
They're like a mother and her son.

32
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:39,704
Do you feel emotional?

33
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,774
You must be getting older.

34
00:01:42,775 --> 00:01:44,874
You've become too emotional over irrelevant things.

35
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:46,274
I guess so.

36
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,715
Good morning, Grandma.

37
00:01:48,945 --> 00:01:51,814
- Good morning, Little... - Yes, good morning.

38
00:01:55,585 --> 00:01:58,854
Grandma, I saw Mommy in my dream.

39
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,354
You did?

40
00:02:01,854 --> 00:02:03,495
Do you remember what she looks like?

41
00:02:05,365 --> 00:02:07,064
I saw her in a photo.

42
00:02:13,205 --> 00:02:16,235
Se Young, are you still asleep?

43
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:19,504
You need to get to work. Get up.

44
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:24,284
What's going on? You were up? Why are you still here?

45
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:25,843
What about work?

46
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:27,314
I don't want to go to work.

47
00:02:27,754 --> 00:02:30,685
It's too embarrassing to be there after yesterday's humiliation.

48
00:02:32,085 --> 00:02:33,124
Goodness.

49
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:37,694
Then, will you lose the business to Yu Jin?

50
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:39,265
Gosh, darn it.

51
00:02:40,765 --> 00:02:41,835
Get up.

52
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:51,144
Yu Jin, your sister will apologize today, right?

53
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:54,015
Yes. Make some time at lunch.

54
00:02:57,515 --> 00:02:58,585
Okay.

55
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,563
What more was there to you that she had to deceive you...

56
00:03:12,564 --> 00:03:14,294
and have you as a fake daughter?

57
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:19,564
Do you have something to say to me?

58
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:21,374
Yes, well...

59
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,343
Do you plan to keep raising your nephew?

60
00:03:26,344 --> 00:03:27,414
Yes.

61
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:32,015
Yeo Jin didn't say anything,

62
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,015
but she wouldn't want the daughter she found...

63
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:37,055
after 20 years to become a single mother.

64
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,085
He's not even your child.

65
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:42,823
She likes Eun Chong.

66
00:03:42,824 --> 00:03:45,194
It's because you two are so close.

67
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:49,594
You should find good timing to let him go.

68
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:52,205
There are many adoption agencies.

69
00:03:52,905 --> 00:03:55,835
Mom's helping me with the adoption process.

70
00:03:57,544 --> 00:03:58,745
She is?

71
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:00,914
Why do I have to apologize?

72
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,615
That brat tripped you first.

73
00:04:02,775 --> 00:04:04,614
She should apologize to you.

74
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:07,414
I fell, but that was my business.

75
00:04:08,054 --> 00:04:11,125
There's no excuse for striking her head with a tray.

76
00:04:11,325 --> 00:04:13,723
It could be traumatic to be in such a situation...

77
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:15,255
in front of all those people.

78
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:17,964
It could lead to sociophobia...

79
00:04:17,965 --> 00:04:19,695
- and even depression... - Okay. Fine.

80
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,335
I'll do it.

81
00:04:22,465 --> 00:04:23,565
Darn it!

82
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:26,664
Darn it! Come on.

83
00:04:27,405 --> 00:04:28,474
What's going on?

84
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,844
Ha Na told me to apologize to Yoon Se Young.

85
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:33,005
Do it.

86
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:34,875
Why are you adding to this?

87
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:38,244
Why is nobody on my side?

88
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:42,484
I'll get my revenge on Yoon Se Young someday.

89
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:47,593
(Head Director's Office)

90
00:04:47,594 --> 00:04:50,224
Was there additional information about the death of her daughter?

91
00:04:50,455 --> 00:04:53,594
No, Chairwoman Shin must've taken measures to keep things quiet.

92
00:04:55,465 --> 00:04:56,565
You may leave.

93
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:03,304
Was it a false rumor?

94
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:14,114
Aunt Yeo Jin seemed weird.

95
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:17,854
If she was that concerned, she could reveal Ha Na as her daughter.

96
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,283
Also, Chairwoman Shin's daughter went missing when she was ten,

97
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:22,655
but my sister lost her dad in a fire when she was seven.

98
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,594
And she went to the children's home and then got adopted by us at ten.

99
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:27,864
Let me check the news article.

100
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:32,335
It says she went missing when she was seven.

101
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,934
(Yoon Yu Jin, age 7, went missing.)

102
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:39,405
What if her death was real, and she had the article fixed?

103
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:42,674
Wait.

104
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,315
Could Ha Na be fake?

105
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:49,484
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

106
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:56,553
- Yes, Mr. Goo. - Look up the articles...

107
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:58,525
about Yoon Yu Jin's disappearance again.

108
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:00,423
I already looked it up last time...

109
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:01,734
The death of Chairwoman Shin's daughter...

110
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,405
may be true.

111
00:06:05,104 --> 00:06:07,064
What do you mean? Are you serious?

112
00:06:07,065 --> 00:06:08,205
I'll find out if it's true...

113
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:11,945
starting now.

114
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,655
I'll become a reliable daughter who can protect you...

115
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:27,494
from now on.

116
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:32,794
Hey, Ha Na.

117
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,065
- Hey, Ha Na. - Hello.

118
00:06:43,534 --> 00:06:46,375
Ms. Yoon, why are you wearing sunglasses?

119
00:06:49,414 --> 00:06:50,914
- Ms. Goo. - Yes?

120
00:06:55,155 --> 00:06:56,215
I need coffee.

121
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:01,554
I couldn't get coffee because I rose to fame, thanks to someone.

122
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,724
Okay.

123
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,664
The sunglasses make her stand out even more.

124
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,775
The adoption papers were received?

125
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:21,974
Okay. I'll tell Eun Chong.

126
00:07:23,174 --> 00:07:26,244
Yes, goodbye, Mom.

127
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:34,125
I guess it's easy for you to call her Mom.

128
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:38,525
Are you happy living in that house?

129
00:07:38,664 --> 00:07:40,494
I don't want to talk if you want to pick a fight.

130
00:07:41,234 --> 00:07:42,465
You looked happy.

131
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:47,905
What are you trying to say?

132
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:51,645
Are you posing as Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

133
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:53,544
Why haven't I been made public?

134
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:56,445
- When the right time comes... - Don't do it.

135
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:00,955
I hope you'll be happy, just as you are.

136
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,184
Good luck to you, too.

137
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:30,845
Give me that.

138
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,294
I guess she really is happy.

139
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:49,794
This is so frustrating.

140
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:53,064
At this rate, I'll end up confessing the truth.

141
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,875
Haven't you talked to President Hwang?

142
00:08:56,605 --> 00:08:58,645
I'll find a chance to feel him out.

143
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,845
Detective Cho, don't just sit on your hands.

144
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,384
Go back to the children's home or do whatever you can...

145
00:09:05,385 --> 00:09:06,444
to find more information.

146
00:09:06,544 --> 00:09:08,214
- Why are you talking to a detec... - My gosh!

147
00:09:09,985 --> 00:09:12,355
Why are you eavesdropping on me?

148
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,525
I wasn't eavesdropping.

149
00:09:14,855 --> 00:09:17,194
I just overheard you.

150
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:19,095
Is something going on?

151
00:09:19,324 --> 00:09:22,533
- You were talking to a detective... - His pseudonym is Detective,

152
00:09:22,534 --> 00:09:23,765
and he's a real estate agent.

153
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:27,433
She was asking someone to find out more at the children's home.

154
00:09:27,434 --> 00:09:28,505
Gosh.

155
00:09:28,605 --> 00:09:30,875
Anyway, is Se Young okay?

156
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:32,505
She seemed quite startled yesterday.

157
00:09:33,975 --> 00:09:35,115
Why isn't she here?

158
00:09:37,314 --> 00:09:39,413
This isn't the attitude of someone who's apologizing.

159
00:09:39,414 --> 00:09:40,814
She's almost here.

160
00:09:42,454 --> 00:09:44,485
Accept her apology when she does.

161
00:09:44,885 --> 00:09:46,554
You're older than her.

162
00:09:47,554 --> 00:09:49,995
Yet she struck an older person that brutally.

163
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,095
Hey, you're here.

164
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:54,664
Take a seat.

165
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:04,544
Now, everyone is busy, so let's cut to the chase.

166
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:05,875
Ji Eun, you go first.

167
00:10:07,475 --> 00:10:09,775
Sorry for yesterday.

168
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,784
You're rather stiff for someone who's apologizing.

169
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,614
It's like you're wearing a cast on the neck.

170
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,525
Let's not pick a fight from the start.

171
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:20,355
It wasn't like I wanted to apologize.

172
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,854
So, I had to twist your arm to get an apology.

173
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,694
It may be forced, but take it with gratitude.

174
00:10:25,924 --> 00:10:27,294
I wouldn't have done this...

175
00:10:28,164 --> 00:10:29,793
if it hadn't been for my sister.

176
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:31,235
It sounds like you can hit me any moment now.

177
00:10:31,865 --> 00:10:33,703
I'd be grateful if you hit me...

178
00:10:33,704 --> 00:10:36,105
and gave me a reason not to hold back and sue you.

179
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:38,573
I wanted a public apology,

180
00:10:38,574 --> 00:10:40,105
but I held back because it sounded too humiliating.

181
00:10:41,245 --> 00:10:42,344
Or we can do this publicly...

182
00:10:42,345 --> 00:10:43,713
and even record it on a video.

183
00:10:43,714 --> 00:10:44,944
Did you think I'd be scared?

184
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,213
Why don't we look up the CCTV footage first?

185
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,053
Are you seriously picking a fight?

186
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:51,924
- Why? Are you scared? - Not at all. Look it up!

187
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:53,155
Stop!

188
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,255
Enough is enough.

189
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:59,865
I'll invite the chairwoman if you continue to act like this.

190
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:01,894
Do you want to do round two in front of her?

191
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,694
And we can tape the incident, too!

192
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,865
Are you threatening me?

193
00:11:06,735 --> 00:11:08,004
You don't have to bring Aunt Yeo Jin into this.

194
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:10,834
She's right. Let's not bother that busy lady.

195
00:11:11,745 --> 00:11:15,074
Then, apologize, accept the apology, and put this to an end!

196
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,115
I apologize.

197
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:24,424
Fine.

198
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,125
Shake your hands and hug each other.

199
00:11:29,424 --> 00:11:30,694
- Are you crazy? - Are you crazy?

200
00:11:31,194 --> 00:11:32,494
I have to show it to the chairwoman.

201
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:34,563
She told me to send her a video after you two made up.

202
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:35,635
Now, quickly.

203
00:11:36,635 --> 00:11:37,735
Now!

204
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:39,204
Go.

205
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:43,875
Come on. Quickly.

206
00:12:01,725 --> 00:12:04,265
Just wait, the awful Goo sisters.

207
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:07,595
I'll repay both of you for this humiliation.

208
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:10,694
I'm only taking a step back to take two steps forward.

209
00:12:10,794 --> 00:12:12,765
We'll do this again, Yoon Se Young.

210
00:12:13,564 --> 00:12:14,674
Smile.

211
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,944
One, two, three.

212
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:28,954
Come to my office.

213
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:31,324
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

214
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:33,655
He probably heard all about the fight.

215
00:12:40,064 --> 00:12:41,995
Oh, Amira. It's been a while.

216
00:12:42,664 --> 00:12:43,964
How are you?

217
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,405
(Head Director's Office)

218
00:12:55,944 --> 00:12:57,115
Do you have an eye condition?

219
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:01,284
Please cut to the chase, Director Goo.

220
00:13:02,784 --> 00:13:04,084
Is that because of yesterday?

221
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:06,855
Why didn't you take the day off?

222
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:08,655
I thought about it,

223
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,324
but I came to take part in the Goo sisters' apology show.

224
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,834
This office is better than mine. There's only one pair of eyes.

225
00:13:17,534 --> 00:13:18,963
Did you accept the apology and make up with her?

226
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,804
I told you. It was a show for the chairwoman.

227
00:13:23,775 --> 00:13:26,845
Right. I saw Goo Ha Na talking to Amira on the phone.

228
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:29,914
What if she gets evidence that you're behind the Dubai incident?

229
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:31,615
I should talk to Hassan.

230
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:34,084
What would you have done without me?

231
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,814
Then, let me ask one more question.

232
00:13:36,655 --> 00:13:38,824
How old was Yoon Yu Jin when she went missing?

233
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,394
- Why do you ask? - Was she seven?

234
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:43,954
She was ten!

235
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,765
- Are you sure? - She's your sister. Don't you know?

236
00:13:49,294 --> 00:13:51,635
Well, I got confused.

237
00:13:51,735 --> 00:13:53,135
That's not something you can be confused about.

238
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:59,304
Don't bring that up to me again. It's a nightmare.

239
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,544
My memories were correct.

240
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:04,645
She went missing at 10, but it was turned into age 7.

241
00:14:06,115 --> 00:14:09,355
Only your siblings, Mr. Hwang, and Ms. Jang know...

242
00:14:09,885 --> 00:14:11,184
that she's my daughter.

243
00:14:11,554 --> 00:14:13,255
Even Ms. Yoon and her mother don't know.

244
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:15,495
Please keep it a secret for a while.

245
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:18,964
Ha Na was a fake, so she deceived everyone in her life, too.

246
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,095
Did you call me here to ask that?

247
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:25,635
- I'm leaving. - What's wrong?

248
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,204
I called you because of yesterday.

249
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,404
I'm glad you seem fine.

250
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:30,934
I'm not fine.

251
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,543
I wanted to die at the thought of the Goo sisters ruining my image!

252
00:14:34,544 --> 00:14:36,314
Don't blurt out that you want to die so easily.

253
00:14:39,084 --> 00:14:41,115
Even if her daughter died,

254
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,954
why did she lie about her daughter's age...

255
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,355
to make Ha Na into a fake daughter?

256
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:52,125
Ms. Bang Ul made candied fruit for you?

257
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:57,264
Yes, last time, I said I craved some.

258
00:14:57,265 --> 00:14:59,963
Make sure you thank Ms. Bang Ul...

259
00:14:59,964 --> 00:15:01,933
for making you a snack.

260
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,074
Okay.

261
00:15:03,674 --> 00:15:06,875
Are you alone at home with Ms. Bang Ul?

262
00:15:08,414 --> 00:15:12,515
I see. See you later, Eun Chong. Bye.

263
00:15:16,284 --> 00:15:18,755
My mom is at the chairwoman's place?

264
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,954
She didn't say she was visiting today.

265
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:24,155
Well, she must've had some business.

266
00:15:24,865 --> 00:15:28,735
Right, Mr. Hwang! Amira called.

267
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:29,934
What did she say?

268
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:31,934
She'll send me the evidence.

269
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,804
Those files should be enough to stop the sales process.

270
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:37,105
Is that so? When will she do that?

271
00:15:37,434 --> 00:15:39,573
She said she'd get those ready within the day,

272
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:41,275
so we'd have it by tomorrow.

273
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,444
That's great news.

274
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:44,213
I'm trying to persuade the board members.

275
00:15:44,214 --> 00:15:46,115
We won't have a problem since we're backed by evidence.

276
00:15:46,544 --> 00:15:48,655
- Thank you. - Don't mention it.

277
00:15:58,895 --> 00:16:01,494
Make sure you thank Ms. Bang Ul...

278
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,534
for making you a snack.

279
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:07,635
Are you alone at home with Ms. Bang Ul?

280
00:16:08,905 --> 00:16:12,405
You don't say something like that about a guest.

281
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,515
My goodness.

282
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,454
- Mom. - Jin Goo.

283
00:16:22,814 --> 00:16:24,755
What are you doing here?

284
00:16:26,184 --> 00:16:27,855
Well, it's...

285
00:16:33,324 --> 00:16:35,735
This looks like my mom's.

286
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:44,975
Where are you, Mom?

287
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:48,245
I came to work. What is it?

288
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,914
It's nothing. Bye.

289
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:01,085
- Is it good? - Yes.

290
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:03,295
You should have some, too.

291
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,795
I'm fine.

292
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,463
You can leave it in the fridge and have some more tomorrow.

293
00:17:07,464 --> 00:17:09,234
Okay. Thank you.

294
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,135
Goodness.

295
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:13,163
What did you make?

296
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:16,203
Eun Chong wanted candied fruit, so I made some.

297
00:17:16,204 --> 00:17:17,273
I'm not sure if it's good.

298
00:17:17,274 --> 00:17:19,645
- Why don't you have a bite? - I don't like sweets.

299
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,345
Why does everyone obsess over a kid...

300
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,545
Good grief.

301
00:17:26,984 --> 00:17:31,524
Did you pour sugar here? It's so sticky! My gosh.

302
00:17:33,754 --> 00:17:35,055
- I'll get it. - Okay.

303
00:17:41,335 --> 00:17:42,434
It's Mr. Hwang.

304
00:17:47,704 --> 00:17:48,734
Mr. Hwang.

305
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,135
- Shh. - Shh.

306
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:55,274
Clean up the sticky stuff before dinner.

307
00:17:55,645 --> 00:17:57,345
Did you marinate some short ribs?

308
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,315
Not yet.

309
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:02,884
I told you to make some a while ago,

310
00:18:02,885 --> 00:18:05,354
and you still haven't? Good grief.

311
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,385
Mom.

312
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,895
- My gosh, Jin Goo. - Jin Goo.

313
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:12,524
What brings you here at this hour?

314
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:16,065
Was this the place you worked for?

315
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,933
No, Jin Goo. It was just today.

316
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:22,035
- Come with me. - Jin Goo.

317
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:26,604
She stopped by only for a moment.

318
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,805
Come out!

319
00:18:28,075 --> 00:18:30,244
My gosh, Jin Goo.

320
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,684
- Hey... - Okay, fine. I will!

321
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:36,854
Goodness. My bag. Where's my bag?

322
00:18:36,855 --> 00:18:38,254
Yes, okay.

323
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,953
Hey, she wanted to do this.

324
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,554
We didn't ask her to come.

325
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:44,693
Isn't that so, Bang Ul?

326
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:47,125
Of course, I wanted to do this.

327
00:18:47,494 --> 00:18:49,734
My gosh, Jin Goo. Hey.

328
00:18:51,734 --> 00:18:52,835
Goodness.

329
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:59,545
Mr. Hwang... Ms. Bang Ul...

330
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:03,214
I'm sorry for yelling.

331
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,244
Let's go, Mom.

332
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:13,754
- Goodness. - Gosh.

333
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,994
Good grief. Why did he have to come now?

334
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,905
Gosh, it's so sticky.

335
00:19:26,105 --> 00:19:27,605
It's all your fault!

336
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:30,734
Darn it. It's so irritating.

337
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:35,045
What? How did Jin Goo know?

338
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,714
He must've come at this hour because he found out.

339
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:44,285
Wait, did Mr. Hwang find out Ms. Sim was their housekeeper?

340
00:19:44,585 --> 00:19:46,155
Who did he hear it from?

341
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:51,594
If you get married, she'll be your mother-in-law.

342
00:19:51,595 --> 00:19:53,694
How does it make any sense to employ your in-law as a housekeeper?

343
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,535
How upset would Mr. Hwang be when he finds out later?

344
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,835
Mom, I have to go.

345
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:07,744
I need to see you, Ms. Goo.

346
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:21,624
Did you tell Jin Goo that Mother was our housekeeper?

347
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,754
No!

348
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:25,565
No, Ms. Yoon.

349
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:27,794
He must've overheard...

350
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,565
- my call with Eun Chong. - What call?

351
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,835
He said Ms. Bang Ul made candied fruit for him,

352
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,664
so I told him to thank her.

353
00:20:34,535 --> 00:20:38,273
Jeez. My family is never in peace anymore...

354
00:20:38,274 --> 00:20:39,974
because of you and your nephew!

355
00:20:40,974 --> 00:20:42,545
What's the situation right now?

356
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:45,315
Mr. Hwang came to my place and escorted her home.

357
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:48,385
She can't come to our place anymore because of you and your nephew.

358
00:20:49,655 --> 00:20:51,754
This will be trouble for Aunt Yeo Jin, too.

359
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:54,483
He'll resent her and me so much.

360
00:20:54,484 --> 00:20:55,625
What are you going to do now?

361
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,164
This is so irritating.

362
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:03,295
Were you irritated by this?

363
00:21:04,365 --> 00:21:05,463
Weren't you irritated?

364
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:08,305
Shouldn't you be worried, not irritated?

365
00:21:08,575 --> 00:21:10,503
Mr. Hwang must be upset,

366
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:12,274
and Ms. Sim must be heartbroken.

367
00:21:13,174 --> 00:21:15,914
If I were you, I'd run over to his place...

368
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,673
and apologize first.

369
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:18,785
Why should I?

370
00:21:19,214 --> 00:21:21,344
She wanted to be our housekeeper.

371
00:21:21,345 --> 00:21:22,983
It was the elders' decision.

372
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:25,355
They're going to be your family.

373
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,295
Make sure you console them.

374
00:21:32,395 --> 00:21:34,524
Wait, she's the one at fault.

375
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:36,434
Why is she ordering me around?

376
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:44,943
Jin Goo, I'm sorry.

377
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:47,045
So, you should go back to work.

378
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:48,645
Have a seat.

379
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:58,555
When did this begin?

380
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:01,124
It hasn't been too long.

381
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,024
I'll confirm it with Se Young's family.

382
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:05,494
It's been about two years.

383
00:22:06,164 --> 00:22:07,224
Two years.

384
00:22:08,464 --> 00:22:11,035
I did it because I wanted to.

385
00:22:12,234 --> 00:22:14,405
I had your food for two years...

386
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:17,434
and said it was similar to your cooking.

387
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:21,974
I'm not a decent son.

388
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:24,114
Why do you say that?

389
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:26,484
It's hard to find a kinder son than you.

390
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:29,614
It wasn't that hard for me.

391
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,954
You were treated like dirt by your future in-law,

392
00:22:32,224 --> 00:22:33,454
and it still wasn't hard?

393
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:36,253
That's why she keeps looking down on you!

394
00:22:36,254 --> 00:22:39,163
I could ignore Myung Ji's bad temper.

395
00:22:39,164 --> 00:22:41,795
- I still liked doing this. - Why?

396
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,693
The chairwoman likes my food.

397
00:22:44,694 --> 00:22:46,865
I was very proud and happy...

398
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:50,075
to repay her kindness in that way.

399
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:53,104
- Mom. - She showed a favor...

400
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:56,645
and helped you stay here with me in full health.

401
00:22:57,014 --> 00:22:58,644
I was excited...

402
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,045
and grateful to repay her.

403
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:03,285
Don't be so heartbroken.

404
00:23:05,224 --> 00:23:06,684
You can't do this anymore.

405
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:08,895
Today is your last day.

406
00:23:08,994 --> 00:23:11,763
Jin Goo, I'm still healthy, so...

407
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:13,424
You have bad joints, Mom.

408
00:23:14,424 --> 00:23:16,865
You can't work as a housekeeper for anyone from now on.

409
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,364
I'll repay the chairwoman's kindness.

410
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,664
I'm doing it right now,

411
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,535
and I'll continue to do so.

412
00:23:23,774 --> 00:23:26,274
- She'd be disappointed, too. - Mom!

413
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:29,444
Okay. Fine.

414
00:23:30,815 --> 00:23:33,545
So, stop making a scene...

415
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:35,254
and let it go quietly.

416
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,055
I'll manage.

417
00:23:43,994 --> 00:23:46,024
- Hello? - Where are you?

418
00:23:47,764 --> 00:23:48,835
I'm going back to work.

419
00:23:50,194 --> 00:23:53,164
Don't say anything to Se Young.

420
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:55,335
The elders are responsible for this.

421
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:01,774
I'm sorry. You should get some rest.

422
00:24:02,045 --> 00:24:03,214
I'm going back to work.

423
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:24,164
Are you mad?

424
00:24:33,545 --> 00:24:34,774
Did you not feel anything...

425
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,115
as you watched my mom work as a housekeeper at your place?

426
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:41,984
How can I not feel anything? I felt like I was in the hot seat.

427
00:24:42,754 --> 00:24:45,085
But Aunt Yeo Jin wanted her to do it,

428
00:24:45,224 --> 00:24:46,855
and Mother wanted to do it even more.

429
00:24:47,155 --> 00:24:49,994
My mom and I only followed their decision.

430
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,924
I'm speechless.

431
00:24:53,065 --> 00:24:54,394
What did Mother say?

432
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:56,164
I don't understand this situation.

433
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,065
Even if my mom wanted to do this,

434
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,865
she was going to be your in-law,

435
00:25:01,635 --> 00:25:03,605
and I frequently went to your house, too.

436
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:08,444
How can you have my mom as a housekeeper?

437
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:12,544
And it was odd how she and I never ran into each other.

438
00:25:12,545 --> 00:25:13,615
How did that happen?

439
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:17,285
Did she hide whenever I was there?

440
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:19,355
Are you interrogating me?

441
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:21,254
I'm asking a question, so tell me what you know.

442
00:25:21,684 --> 00:25:22,794
She hid.

443
00:25:22,795 --> 00:25:24,254
- Where? - The utility room.

444
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:26,224
The utility room is freezing cold!

445
00:25:30,964 --> 00:25:32,305
She did that recently, didn't she?

446
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,164
I have no idea.

447
00:25:35,204 --> 00:25:38,444
I understand how you feel, but can you let it go quietly?

448
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,944
I saw your mom...

449
00:25:41,944 --> 00:25:43,773
treating my mom like a housekeeper...

450
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:46,084
with my own two eyes, so how can I let it go quietly?

451
00:25:46,085 --> 00:25:47,684
What are you going to do, then?

452
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,953
Do you plan to nitpick over this with Aunt Yeo Jin?

453
00:25:49,954 --> 00:25:52,324
Or are you going to call off our marriage?

454
00:25:52,325 --> 00:25:53,385
Why do you...

455
00:25:54,184 --> 00:25:56,094
always bring up calling off our marriage?

456
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,994
- I asked because I was curious. - What?

457
00:25:59,295 --> 00:26:00,924
It looks like you will do that.

458
00:26:02,565 --> 00:26:05,704
Well, I won't let it go quietly.

459
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:08,575
- It's not even a big deal. - It's not?

460
00:26:09,835 --> 00:26:13,145
What if your mom was my housekeeper? Is that not a big deal?

461
00:26:14,474 --> 00:26:16,045
Lower your voice.

462
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:19,484
I didn't mean that it wasn't a big deal, but...

463
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:27,753
It might be nothing compared to the lie you told me.

464
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:30,055
- How can you... - What do you expect me to do?

465
00:26:32,264 --> 00:26:34,595
I don't know what's what, so do whatever you want.

466
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,264
Do you not care...

467
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:39,304
about how my mom or I feel?

468
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:42,173
What am I going to say when you're yelling at me...

469
00:26:42,174 --> 00:26:43,335
with that mad face?

470
00:26:43,474 --> 00:26:44,674
I didn't make her the housekeeper!

471
00:27:05,055 --> 00:27:07,524
Ms. Goo, I'm leaving first.

472
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,065
Okay.

473
00:27:12,934 --> 00:27:16,535
Why did she report her whereabouts to you?

474
00:27:16,974 --> 00:27:18,004
I don't know.

475
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:20,703
I've never seen her and Mr. Hwang in such a serious fight before.

476
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:23,345
Couples fight a lot as they plan their marriage.

477
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:25,345
It's a lovers' quarrel.

478
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,824
As I confirmed last time,

479
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:42,494
the articles all said she disappeared at age seven.

480
00:27:43,164 --> 00:27:45,535
But you and Ms. Yoon remembered the same thing,

481
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,365
so the article must've been tampered with.

482
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:52,674
First, let's find out if her daughter is actually dead.

483
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:55,345
I'll start with the police record at the time of her disappearance.

484
00:27:55,575 --> 00:27:57,174
I'll find a picture of her there.

485
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,944
If her real daughter died,

486
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:02,155
why did she take Ha Na in...

487
00:28:02,585 --> 00:28:03,754
as a fake daughter?

488
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:06,154
Did she not want to leave her assets to Ms. Yoon?

489
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:08,355
It doesn't sound right for Ha Na to get it, either.

490
00:28:08,595 --> 00:28:11,355
Your sister must be in this with her.

491
00:28:16,835 --> 00:28:17,934
Give me that.

492
00:28:24,504 --> 00:28:25,974
You're too harsh.

493
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,244
I get the animosity between you and the chairwoman in business,

494
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:32,885
but why do you take things this far?

495
00:28:34,014 --> 00:28:38,155
Is there another problem other than business I don't know about?

496
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,454
It seemed like she was deceived like a fool.

497
00:28:46,865 --> 00:28:48,365
Hey, I'm on my way home.

498
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:50,464
Are things going well for the grand opening?

499
00:28:50,734 --> 00:28:53,405
Yes, everything is smooth, thanks to Mr. Han.

500
00:28:54,535 --> 00:28:58,405
Okay. Look forward to my tteokbokki, the best in the world.

501
00:28:59,474 --> 00:29:00,545
Is that your sister?

502
00:29:01,045 --> 00:29:02,444
Don't be so careless.

503
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:04,974
I'll be there with Eun Chong on the day of the grand opening.

504
00:29:05,514 --> 00:29:07,315
She'll come with Eun Chong on the grand opening day.

505
00:29:07,984 --> 00:29:10,654
Hey, you can't tell Ji Seok.

506
00:29:10,655 --> 00:29:12,984
If he found out, I'd have to close as soon as I opened.

507
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,555
All right. Go, now.

508
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:20,125
Bye.

509
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:29,474
Mr. Hwang?

510
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:35,774
Excuse me. May I have a glass?

511
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:36,914
Sure.

512
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,645
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

513
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:55,024
Ms. Goo?

514
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,464
You're already drunk this early in the evening.

515
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:06,244
Did you get drunk after half a bottle of this?

516
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:08,204
My gosh.

517
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,484
You must be heartbroken.

518
00:30:14,885 --> 00:30:17,155
- I'm sorry. - Why are you apologizing?

519
00:30:18,454 --> 00:30:19,785
I should be...

520
00:30:21,625 --> 00:30:23,055
sorrier for you, Ms. Goo.

521
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:26,194
Don't say that.

522
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:31,135
How's your mother?

523
00:30:34,934 --> 00:30:36,004
I just thought...

524
00:30:37,105 --> 00:30:39,905
it was so uncanny...

525
00:30:41,845 --> 00:30:44,075
how the food Se Young's housekeeper made...

526
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:47,615
tasted so much like my mom's food.

527
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,214
Don't you think I'm such an idiot?

528
00:30:53,224 --> 00:30:54,885
I'm such an awful son.

529
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,055
I've only put her through trouble...

530
00:31:00,365 --> 00:31:01,924
since my childhood and until now.

531
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:04,494
Don't be so hard on yourself.

532
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:07,504
My mother-in-law, who treated her like dirt,

533
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:11,075
Se Young, who slyly looked down on my family,

534
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,514
and the chairwoman, who turned a blind eye, weren't the worst.

535
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:20,444
I'm the worst one.

536
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:25,785
I had already known...

537
00:31:27,024 --> 00:31:28,754
she was treated awfully.

538
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,664
I, Hwang Jin Goo, who looked the other way,

539
00:31:35,835 --> 00:31:37,194
was the worst...

540
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,565
and the most evil of them all.

541
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:48,674
Mr. Hwang.

542
00:31:52,414 --> 00:31:53,514
Mr. Hwang.

543
00:31:54,184 --> 00:31:56,055
Mr. Hwang, are you okay?

544
00:31:57,355 --> 00:31:59,054
He shouldn't fall asleep here.

545
00:31:59,055 --> 00:32:02,125
Mr. Hwang.

546
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,463
- Hello, Ms. Sim. - My goodness.

547
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:13,663
Why did he drink this much?

548
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:15,805
Hey, Jin Goo. Wake up.

549
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,034
- Wake up. Hey, don't fall over. - Mr. Hwang!

550
00:32:18,035 --> 00:32:19,943
- Where should I... - This way, please.

551
00:32:19,944 --> 00:32:21,544
- Oh, no. - Okay. Thank you.

552
00:32:21,545 --> 00:32:23,673
My gosh. Come this way. In here.

553
00:32:23,674 --> 00:32:24,874
This way, please. I'm so sorry.

554
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,983
- Oh, no. - No, it's okay.

555
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:27,614
- My gosh! - Put him down right here.

556
00:32:27,615 --> 00:32:29,213
- I'll make some honey tea. - Okay.

557
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,314
- Get yourself together. - Mr. Hwang.

558
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:32,424
- Mr. Hwang. - Put him down.

559
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:34,954
Mr. Hwang, we're here. What am I going to do?

560
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:43,494
(Cinderella Game)

561
00:33:43,954 --> 00:33:45,054
Yu Jin?

562
00:33:45,055 --> 00:33:46,463
Once a bad rumor begins,

563
00:33:46,464 --> 00:33:48,095
- it'll chase you forever. - Ms. Goo, come to my office.

564
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:50,034
Did something happen between them yesterday?

565
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:51,963
If she was meant to be caught, it would've happened in any way.

566
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:54,163
May I say something?

567
00:33:54,164 --> 00:33:55,604
Just let this go quietly.

568
00:33:55,605 --> 00:33:57,134
Why do you refuse to take the easy way?

569
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,943
I don't care about a rumor like that.

570
00:33:58,944 --> 00:34:00,804
Your daughter seemed concerned.

571
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,104
What do you want me to do?

572
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:05,213
If you keep doing this, then, one day, I'll grow tired.

573
00:34:05,214 --> 00:34:07,515
Are you saying you're hesitant to marry me?

574
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:08,814
Is he calling the marriage off?
