1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,309
This way, please. I'm so sorry.

5
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:08,710
- Oh, no.
- No, it's okay.

6
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,380
- My gosh!
- Put him down right here.

7
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,019
- I'll make some honey tea.
- Okay.

8
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,019
- Get yourself together.
- Mr. Hwang.

9
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:15,449
- Mr. Hwang.
- Put him down.

10
00:00:15,689 --> 00:00:17,789
Mr. Hwang, we're here.
What am I going to do?

11
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:49,990
Why did he drink so much
all by himself?

12
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:51,490
Goodness.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,159
He shouldn't drink like that.
My gosh.

14
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:55,929
Why not?

15
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:00,399
He was sick when he was a child.

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,069
Right. I heard he found out
you were the housekeeper.

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,310
I'm sorry. He must've overheard
my call with Eun Chong...

18
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,579
and took notice.

19
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,010
It's okay.

20
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,980
Anyway, what about the chairwoman?

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,090
She loves my food.

22
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:24,319
I can't keep going there
behind his back.

23
00:01:25,489 --> 00:01:27,230
Can you persuade him...

24
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:30,030
and let me continue to do this?

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,599
I don't think that can happen.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,370
I also thought it was nonsense
for you to be our housekeeper.

27
00:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,609
Mr. Hwang must've been
really heartbroken.

28
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:43,480
That was why he got so drunk.

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:47,049
I'm making both Jin Goo...

30
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,650
and you suffer.

31
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,650
I'm fine.

32
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,049
Please excuse me, then.

33
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,650
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

34
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,959
Hello?
Let me call you back right away.

35
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,730
Goodness.

36
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,170
She'll call me back.

37
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,530
Goodness.

38
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,500
What's Jin Goo going to do
if he won't let this go quietly?

39
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,039
Will he call the marriage off
for making his mom a housekeeper?

40
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,039
No idea.

41
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,840
Does he think
it's okay for him to lie to us?

42
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,650
He gave me the death glare.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,650
If he had a gun,
he would've shot at me.

44
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,990
Even he disregarded his mother
while playing a son for Yeo Jin.

45
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:31,460
Why is he acting like
such a good son now?

46
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,319
What did Aunt Yeo Jin say?

47
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,759
She's playing with that boy.

48
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,460
That boy is the biggest problem.

49
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:47,069
Hey, Bang Ul. What did Jin Goo say?

50
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,169
He got drunk and passed out?

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,250
Goodness, he never drinks.

52
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,120
It wasn't even a big deal.

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,449
It's a big deal for him.

54
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:04,090
He saw his mom cooking
and cleaning at his in-law's place.

55
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,219
That's not all.

56
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:07,229
He also saw
how you ordered me around.

57
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,229
I didn't order you around.

58
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:11,360
It's because we're that close.

59
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,469
You'd treat me like a slave
if we got any closer.

60
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:17,039
And Ms. Goo...

61
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,099
I mean, the chairwoman's daughter...

62
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,509
had a tough time bringing him home
after he got knocked out.

63
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,879
Yu Jin?

64
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,449
Were you at Mr. Hwang's place?

65
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,759
- How did you know?
- Mother told me.

66
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,159
Did you two drink together?

67
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:43,129
I saw him alone at a cart bar
on my way back home.

68
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:45,159
We talked for like a minute.

69
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:48,400
He fell asleep immediately,
and it wasn't easy to take him home.

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,530
Are you patronizing me?

71
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,770
You should've called me right away
if that happened.

72
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,370
Other people could be watching.
Why would you take him home?

73
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,939
I was too surprised
to think of anything else.

74
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,650
If something like that happens again,
call me immediately.

75
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:05,280
But of course,
it shouldn't happen again.

76
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,419
Okay. Sure.

77
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:11,189
Once a filthy rumor begins
in this circle,

78
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,490
it'll chase you forever.

79
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,460
Don't let people gossip about me.

80
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,600
"Filthy rumor?"

81
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,470
I didn't even do anything.

82
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,319
Ms. Sim wanted to do this.

83
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,879
Try to persuade Jin Goo...

84
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:41,519
and let her keep coming here
if she wants to.

85
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:43,759
Jin Goo looked at me like
I was his sworn enemy.

86
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,519
I don't think that can happen.

87
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,459
It's all Eun Chong's fault.

88
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,399
He asked her for candied fruit,

89
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,899
so Jin Goo overheard Yu Jin
talking to him on the phone...

90
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:56,970
and took notice.

91
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,740
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,300
You shouldn't be sorry.

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,610
If she was meant to be caught,
it would've happened in any way.

94
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,139
He was mad at me, too.

95
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:07,410
I don't think
he'll let this go that easily.

96
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,980
Mother's food is the best, though.

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,480
Do we have to find a new helper?

98
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:18,819
May I say something?

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,220
Yes, sure.

100
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:25,500
I don't think it's right
for Mr. Hwang's mother to come here.

101
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,730
I didn't think we should have
our in-law as a housekeeper.

102
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,939
It was already a problem
even if she wasn't caught.

103
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,310
We shouldn't ask her to return
after she got caught.

104
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,639
We know that, too.
But we need the help, so...

105
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,680
- Yeo Jin loves her food the most...
- Yu Jin is right.

106
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,779
We can find another housekeeper.

107
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,819
- Find someone.
- Okay.

108
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:54,329
Thank you.

109
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,660
I'm sorry, Mom.

110
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,629
You shouldn't get so drunk.

111
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:02,370
I didn't even have much.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,670
I got hammered after half a bottle.

113
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,870
How did I make it home?
I don't remember.

114
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,209
Ms. Goo brought you home.

115
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:12,810
Ms. Goo?

116
00:06:18,449 --> 00:06:20,689
Yes, we met at the cart bar.

117
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,720
I completely blacked out.

118
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,319
I hope I didn't make any mistakes.

119
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,790
Blacking out was already a mistake.

120
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:32,060
Don't you remember
how she put you down on your bed?

121
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,160
My bed?

122
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,230
It must've been hard.

123
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,470
You should thank her
and buy her a meal.

124
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:41,769
Mom, you're now telling me
to eat a meal with her?

125
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,910
Nothing will happen...

126
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,180
between the chairwoman's daughter
and you.

127
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,480
I said that because I wasn't worried.

128
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,250
- Did Se Young call?
- No.

129
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,449
Don't be so harsh on her.

130
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,660
What about her mother?

131
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,319
She called me last night.

132
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,129
She felt sorry and was worried.

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,100
Just let this go quietly.

134
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,899
I'll go to the chairwoman's place
and tell them that you're quitting.

135
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,939
I'll go there
until they find someone new.

136
00:07:12,939 --> 00:07:14,670
I should wrap up my work.

137
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,610
Mom, let's eat lunch together.

138
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,129
He wouldn't remember, right?

139
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:41,800
No.

140
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,720
Was that a dream?

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,629
Honestly speaking,
I was disappointed, slighted,

142
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,329
- and angry.
- It's a misunderstanding.

143
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:14,470
I saw you mistreating my mom
with my own two eyes...

144
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:18,399
and heard it with my ears.

145
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,300
It was just yesterday.

146
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,209
I usually don't do that.

147
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,379
I wouldn't do that
to my future in-law.

148
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,810
You also lied to me last time
when the chairwoman collapsed,

149
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,310
saying your housekeeper
went on a break.

150
00:08:30,509 --> 00:08:34,850
You said you wouldn't hire
your in-law as a housekeeper.

151
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,450
Goodness.

152
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:39,720
I was disappointed in you, too,
Ms. Chairwoman.

153
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,830
Yes, I understand how you feel.

154
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,600
It all began
because I loved her food so much,

155
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,799
so she wanted to come
and do this for us.

156
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,240
I should've thought it through.

157
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,710
I want to ask you
to show your respect to my mom...

158
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,679
as your in-law.

159
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,779
Are you saying I treated her
like dirt or something?

160
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,350
We were good to her, too.

161
00:09:06,049 --> 00:09:07,149
That's enough.

162
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,990
I understand what you mean,
so let go of your hard feelings.

163
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:13,659
I also feel sorry
for bringing this up.

164
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:17,090
Well, will she keep coming
until we find...

165
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,730
a new housekeeper?

166
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,669
Find someone very soon.

167
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,269
Then, please excuse me.

168
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,250
Do you see someone you know?

169
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,789
No. This place is really popular.

170
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,320
It's always bustling
whenever I come here.

171
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,330
Is that so?

172
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:07,240
I felt pleased whenever I came here.

173
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:10,110
Not only is it delicious,
but it comes in a variety, too.

174
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:14,620
Mom, do you want to try
running this restaurant?

175
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,720
You said you wanted to try.

176
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,289
I was just saying that.

177
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,730
Do you mean it?

178
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,289
Only if you won't overwork.

179
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,460
You're such a good cook,

180
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,669
so it's a shame
to keep it between us.

181
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,039
I'd be grateful
if you'd open a restaurant for me.

182
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,769
Then, let me find out
how we can join the franchise.

183
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,009
Mom, you can get yourself ready.

184
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,250
Wait, then I get to be the owner
of a shabu shabu restaurant?

185
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:46,250
Yes, I should've paid
more attention to you first,

186
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,389
but I've been negligent.

187
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:52,460
- I'm sorry.
- I have zero complaints about you.

188
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,990
It's so reassuring to have
someone like you on my side.

189
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,529
- Try some.
- Goodness.

190
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:06,500
I can feed myself, really.
All right.

191
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,210
It's good. Eat up.

192
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,950
Ta-da!

193
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,750
It already smells great.

194
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:23,450
Congratulations.
You'll be a small business owner soon.

195
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,029
It's good. You made all these?

196
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,830
Yes, I followed the recipe
from the headquarters, and it was easy.

197
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,399
Mr. Han, I'll use tteokbokki,
the Korean soul food,

198
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,509
to shake up the entire country
365 days in a year.

199
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:45,440
Korea better be ready.

200
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,710
Look how pretty this tteokbokki is.

201
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,909
The whole world better be ready.

202
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:02,190
I think it's right for
Mr. Hwang's mother to stop coming.

203
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,269
I didn't think we should have
our in-law as a housekeeper.

204
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,899
Does she think
she's the daughter-in-law?

205
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,740
Why does she care so much
about my future mother-in-law?

206
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,980
Aren't you all feeling snacky?

207
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:22,710
- Yes.
- Yes.

208
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,649
Ms. Goo, go out
and get some fish buns.

209
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,590
I don't think
there's a vendor nearby.

210
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,059
I don't know about that.
Go out and find something.

211
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:35,059
How about steamed buns?
They're filled with red beans, too.

212
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:37,389
I'm craving fish buns
filled with custard cream.

213
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,070
I can see right through you.

214
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,039
Yet you still say
you want to get along with me?

215
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,720
Let's eat fish buns next time.

216
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,419
Gosh, darn it.

217
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,789
- Hello, Mr. Hwang.
- Hello.

218
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,000
Hello.

219
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
Ms. Goo, come to my office.

220
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,429
Yes, sir.

221
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,340
He should talk to me first.
Why does he want to see her?

222
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,179
Did something happen
between them yesterday?

223
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,649
I heard I gave you
a tough time yesterday.

224
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,879
I'm sorry.

225
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:35,590
It's all right.

226
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:42,429
- What's wrong?
- What?

227
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,759
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

228
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,200
I'm not.

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,370
Okay, then.

230
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:51,399
Did I do anything weird yesterday?

231
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:54,470
Well, no.

232
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,139
I guess you don't remember anything.

233
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,509
Gosh, I completely blacked out.

234
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,250
I only remember seeing you
at the cart bar.

235
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,649
I don't remember you
taking me back home.

236
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,419
But...

237
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,419
Wait, did he remember?

238
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,299
I'm sorry...

239
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,629
for making you concerned yesterday.
And thank you.

240
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,200
You probably paid for the cab.

241
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,200
No, it's okay.

242
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,440
I already owe you 50 dollars,
so let's call it even.

243
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,679
Wait, you owe me money?

244
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:33,840
Yes.

245
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:39,879
Amira sent me the files.

246
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,220
- Really?
- Yes, I'll bring them.

247
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,600
("Hyesung Tour Gets Cornered
and Rushes into Sale")

248
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm showing it to you in advance.

249
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,070
Can you drop this article tomorrow?

250
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,570
Not yet.
I still have to check a few more things.

251
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,870
Such as?

252
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,980
The evidence that
Chairwoman Shin's daughter is dead.

253
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,350
Anyway, why tomorrow?

254
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,809
She's going to the temple to remove
the altar and the wishing tree...

255
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,049
she made for Yu Jin's return.

256
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,690
Ha Na is a fake,
yet she'll remove the altar?

257
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,720
Because her real daughter was
already dead and long gone.

258
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,899
You must've taken the lead...

259
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:32,740
to turn Ha Na into her fake daughter.

260
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:37,070
Hello.

261
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,509
Have you found the source
of the rumor...

262
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:42,950
of the death
of Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

263
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:45,820
It was a groundless rumor.

264
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,750
Then, you could've ignored it.

265
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:49,519
Why are you
looking for the reporter?

266
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,860
What do you plan to do?

267
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:56,830
I need to make sure
they won't spread such a rumor again.

268
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,799
Wouldn't it be the easiest
to make her public?

269
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:03,070
Why aren't you taking the easy way?

270
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,399
That's what you think.

271
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:08,210
The chairwoman must have an idea.

272
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,309
What idea?

273
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,809
Is she unable to disclose her
because she's fake?

274
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,440
I'm not her, so I don't know.

275
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:15,350
Excuse me.

276
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,429
There's a rumor
about selling Hyesung Tour.

277
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,730
You were the source, right?

278
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,100
I couldn't wait
until the compensation from Dubai...

279
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:34,299
came in.

280
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,570
Wait until I give my approval.

281
00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:42,210
- What about Richard Han...
- He returned to America.

282
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,539
- Without seeing me?
- You canceled on us,

283
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:47,809
and you didn't say anything
after that.

284
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,879
But I understand.

285
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,750
Things must've been hectic
after finding your daughter.

286
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,460
You must be quite concerned...

287
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,059
regarding that rumor
about your daughter.

288
00:17:02,029 --> 00:17:04,059
I don't care
about a rumor like that.

289
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,059
Your daughter seemed concerned.

290
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,930
- She was?
- It'd be weirder...

291
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,500
if she didn't care
about the rumor of her death...

292
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,200
unless she was a fake.

293
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,480
Wouldn't she want to tell the world
that she was perfectly alive?

294
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,750
Yu Jin and I talked
and said it was too soon.

295
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,910
Why would it be too soon
to publicize your daughter?

296
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:25,420
You can just announce it.

297
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,890
You harshly said
you'd cut ties with her.

298
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,220
But it seems like
those were only words.

299
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,890
I want to stop minding it,

300
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,089
but I hear about her at work.

301
00:17:34,089 --> 00:17:36,359
Pretend like you don't hear it
no matter what comes your way.

302
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,299
I couldn't forget
what I already heard.

303
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,660
You need to stop them
from reaching me.

304
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,769
She said hiding her was your way
of protecting her as her mom.

305
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,609
She seemed to care
very much about you.

306
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,319
Yu Jin and I will handle
any business that involves us.

307
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,990
If you turned Ha Na
into a fake daughter,

308
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,960
it had to be for your benefit
and only for you.

309
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,119
What could it be?

310
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:13,259
I heard you got hammered last night
and had Goo Ha Na take you home.

311
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,940
Apparently, but I don't remember anything
because I blacked out.

312
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:19,240
You should be careful.

313
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,970
What would people think
if they heard a female employee...

314
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,609
escorted her hammered boss
back home?

315
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,380
Were you more worried about...

316
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,009
what others would think
than how I was?

317
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,150
I saw a cart bar on my way home,
so I walked in.

318
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,019
I finished about half a bottle...

319
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,890
and blacked out
as soon as Ms. Goo came.

320
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,990
And you sound so proud.

321
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,059
Are you still mad?

322
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,500
My mom and Aunt Yeo Jin
both apologized to you.

323
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,900
I only followed their decision.

324
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,700
You didn't even call my mom.

325
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,269
My mom did.

326
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:55,569
You'll be her daughter-in-law.

327
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,710
How could you not call her...

328
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,440
after something
like that happened...

329
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:01,549
at your place?

330
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,980
What do I mean to you,

331
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:05,980
and who's my mom to you?

332
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,250
Why are you so sensitive?

333
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,259
What do you think?
My future husband and mother-in-law.

334
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,690
I'll break off this marriage
if you take another wrong turn.

335
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:17,730
You still have no idea why I'm mad.

336
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,099
What do you want me to do?

337
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,569
Do you expect me
to kneel before her?

338
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:22,769
Should I beg for forgiveness?

339
00:19:22,769 --> 00:19:25,170
I once found your selfishness
and self-centeredness...

340
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,170
cute and lovely.

341
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,470
At times, it seemed like...

342
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:33,339
you wanted a glimpse of your dad,
whom you lost early on,

343
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,079
so I felt bad for that, too.

344
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,410
So, not anymore?

345
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,809
If you keep doing this,

346
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,279
then, one day, I'll grow tired.

347
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,789
After all, I'm not your dad.

348
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,789
You and I have to live together
for the rest of our lives.

349
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:49,390
But to you,
your emotions always come first,

350
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,500
and you disregard
everyone else's feelings.

351
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,730
I worried for the first time,

352
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,400
wondering if I'd be able
to handle you.

353
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:00,240
Are you saying
you're hesitant to marry me...

354
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,109
just because of what happened
with Mother?

355
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,640
It's not just about my mom.

356
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:08,650
You know
what reality check means, right?

357
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,779
I had my first chance
to do a reality check.

358
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay, fine.

359
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,089
I also didn't like
everything about you from the start.

360
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,019
Let's take a break
and do a reality check, then.

361
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,839
Come in.

362
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,539
Are Amira's files here?

363
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,140
The files are...

364
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,309
gone.

365
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,279
"Gone?"

366
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,920
The post officer said
he left it in the lobby,

367
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,049
but it was gone.

368
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,390
Nothing is on the CCTV,
so I don't know what's going on.

369
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,660
Has it been lost?

370
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,359
Or did someone steal it?

371
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:59,099
"Steal it?" Who would do that?

372
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,730
Chairwoman Shin and the board had
a tighter bond than I thought.

373
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:04,769
We need something more evident...

374
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,670
to pressure them
into selling the business.

375
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,710
It was just as I expected.

376
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,380
This is
Chairwoman Shin's shell company.

377
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,049
"Shell company?"

378
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,990
I knew she couldn't have lost
her old habits.

379
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:33,759
She was raiding corporations
in secret.

380
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,470
She makes me shudder.

381
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,240
Hwang Jin Goo probably doesn't know
about this, right?

382
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,710
She would've kept it a secret.

383
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,309
Chairwoman Shin will do as you say
if you use this.

384
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,910
These files
must've been confidential.

385
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,549
How did you get these?

386
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,180
I had some connections and intel,

387
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,720
and I was as committed as you were
in this job.

388
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,460
I see.

389
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,460
Hyesung's disposal
will make the news tomorrow.

390
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,390
All of a sudden? Why?

391
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,029
I thought
you planned to take it slowly.

392
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:06,599
You gave me a card to play.

393
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,329
And tomorrow is the day...

394
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,470
when Chairwoman Shin cleans up
the altar and the wishing tree...

395
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:11,569
she set up
to pray for her daughter's return.

396
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,599
It'd make a wonderful gift.

397
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,240
Also, it seems like
her daughter is dead.

398
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,779
But she found her daughter.
What do you mean?

399
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:24,950
It seemed like...

400
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:28,150
she made Ha Na a fake daughter
because she died.

401
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:31,390
What are you saying?

402
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,990
Order some tangerines
from the farm on Jeju Island.

403
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,329
Make sure they give us
only the best quality...

404
00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:40,500
like those distributed
at department stores.

405
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,369
Okay. Are these for you?

406
00:22:42,369 --> 00:22:43,700
Eun Chong likes tangerines.

407
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,269
Yeo Jin, you adore that kid so much.

408
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,779
Anyway, I hear
you're helping Yu Jin...

409
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,410
with Eun Chong's adoption.

410
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,180
That means Hyesung's only daughter
will become a single mother.

411
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,019
Are you sure you're okay with that?

412
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,650
That's nothing to worry about
in this day and age.

413
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,660
Does she not care
because she's a fake anyway?

414
00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:10,089
You should be worried.

415
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,799
She'll have to marry
when she finds a good spouse.

416
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,000
It'll be hard to marry someone
with that burden.

417
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,140
Are you calling Eun Chong a burden?

418
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,839
What if he hears you?

419
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:23,210
He has to start school soon,

420
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,279
so he can't stay
in foster care forever.

421
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,039
I was also worried...

422
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,109
he'd become an outcast
among his peers.

423
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,549
It seems like...

424
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:36,589
she cares more about that burden
she brought than her fake girl.

425
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,519
Have you confirmed
her daughter's death?

426
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,029
I looked up the records
of her disappearance from 20 years ago,

427
00:23:42,259 --> 00:23:43,490
but nothing was available.

428
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:46,859
She must've taken a measure
to hide that Ha Na was a fake.

429
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,299
How can this happen?

430
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,329
It's something
Chairwoman Shin can do.

431
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,599
I really can't forgive her.

432
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,640
If I don't find any evidence,

433
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,410
I'll conduct a parentage test
between the two of them.

434
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,279
What if you got caught?

435
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,890
If your sister
turns out to be a fake daughter,

436
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,490
do you plan to expose everything?

437
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,259
But first, I should find out
why she had to turn Ha Na...

438
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,990
into a fake daughter.

439
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,359
I can't let Ji Seok
find out about Eun Chong, too.

440
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:23,500
- Then?
- I'll find a way...

441
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,769
to fatally hurt Chairwoman Shin...

442
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,809
as much as I can...

443
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,779
without hurting Ha Na.

444
00:24:32,109 --> 00:24:34,180
If it's fatal enough for Yeo Jin,

445
00:24:34,509 --> 00:24:36,150
it can hurt Eun Chong, too.

446
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,920
And you won't tell your sister
right away?

447
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,480
I'm not sure about that yet.

448
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,660
I need to stop Ji Seok
before he finds out about Eun Chong.

449
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,029
Eat up.

450
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,599
Is it good?

451
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,869
Is it?

452
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,710
Isn't my mommy pretty?

453
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,210
Yes, she's very pretty.

454
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,049
Grandma, are you sad?

455
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,680
No.

456
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:17,089
It's wonderful to see you
and your mommy look happy.

457
00:25:22,359 --> 00:25:23,490
Eun Chong.

458
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:24,930
- Auntie!
- Hey.

459
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,329
- You're home.
- Yes, Mom.

460
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,599
What were you up to?

461
00:25:30,769 --> 00:25:34,500
Me? Eun Chong wanted to show me
his mommy's phone.

462
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,640
This was why he could remember
what his mom looked like.

463
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,710
Yes.

464
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:43,910
Hey, did you make Grandma tired?

465
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,519
No.

466
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:52,089
Right. Thank you very much
for helping Ji Chang start his business.

467
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:54,460
He looked so excited
to open his place.

468
00:25:54,589 --> 00:25:56,059
How many times
do I have to tell you?

469
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:59,029
Your siblings are
as good as my own children.

470
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,099
My foster parents would
also be grateful on the other side.

471
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,240
Oh, what's that in the flower pot?
"No rain, no flowers?"

472
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,609
That's our family motto.

473
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:16,880
If it doesn't rain,
flowers don't bloom, either.

474
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,380
It was something
my foster parents said.

475
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,119
I felt better when I thought of that
when tough things came my way.

476
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,559
You had such wonderful people...

477
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:28,190
raise you, Yu Jin.

478
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,829
Yes, meeting them must've been...

479
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,700
the biggest luck of my life.

480
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,930
And, of course, meeting you, too.

481
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,339
Auntie, what about me?

482
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,109
What?
You're my best luck, too, Eun Chong!

483
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,750
It would've been great
if Yu Jin also had such luck.

484
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:55,619
My poor girl,
you only suffered in this world.

485
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,960
She looks sad again.

486
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,089
I wonder what's on her mind.

487
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,029
Jin Goo won't notice.

488
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,740
Tomorrow is finally the D-day.

489
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,910
Is tomorrow our first day?

490
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,380
- What do you want?
- Well.

491
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,789
I was wondering
if we should take anything...

492
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:30,049
to the temple tomorrow.

493
00:27:30,049 --> 00:27:31,589
Did you think
there was a dress code?

494
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,390
Just wear something
in black and white.

495
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,789
It's not that.
Is there anything we can prepare...

496
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,960
for the monks and the volunteers
to show my gratitude?

497
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,859
You still haven't lost
your servile attitude?

498
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,230
That's something Ms. Jang does.

499
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,609
Who was she on the phone with?

500
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,480
Tomorrow is their first day?

501
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,049
Wait, was that a man?

502
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,230
It's becoming more and more vivid.

503
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,200
Ms. Goo brought you home.

504
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,099
Don't you remember
how she put you down on your bed?

505
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,140
Wait, was that Ms. Goo?

506
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,079
It can't be.

507
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,309
I doubt that.

508
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,250
- Yeo Jin?
- Yes.

509
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,789
Her eyes look very heartrending
as if she misses something.

510
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:41,559
I wonder if she still feels sad
even after finding me.

511
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,630
I thought you would know.

512
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,299
I don't know.

513
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,000
That's because you're a fake.

514
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,470
Could it be about my dad?

515
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:57,970
That's not it.

516
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:02,079
She wouldn't miss a husband
who was absent for 20 years.

517
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,390
Then, what could it be?

518
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:14,559
(Buddhist Prayer Ceremony
for Yoon Yu Jin's Safe Return)

519
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:01,240
She will be furious once
she finds out she was deceived.

520
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,069
That'd be fun to watch, too.

521
00:30:13,849 --> 00:30:16,819
(Yu Jin, we'll always wait for you.)

522
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,490
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

523
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:29,500
Ms. Chairwoman, there's an article
on Hyesung Tour's disposal.

524
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,069
What?

525
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,400
("Hyesung Tour Gets Cornered
and Rushes into Sale")

526
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:37,210
Are you serious?

527
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,140
What happened?

528
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,579
This is Hwang Jin Goo
of Hyesung Tour calling.

529
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,950
Pull the article on our disposal.
It's not true.

530
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,420
I'll return to my office.

531
00:30:51,589 --> 00:30:53,190
All right. Let me know how it goes.

532
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,930
A false report?
No, what he said was a false report.

533
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,599
We'd dispose of the business
as stated in the article.

534
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,569
(Head Director's Office)

535
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,210
Goodbye, then.

536
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,509
I've been expecting you, Mr. Hwang.

537
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:20,279
Release a correction that
the disposal is not true.

538
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,480
I will present...

539
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,859
the disposal of Hyesung Tour
at the board meeting.

540
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:27,960
Who the heck are you?

541
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,990
Are you here as a corporate raider?

542
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,230
Why does selling Hyesung Tour
make me a corporate raider?

543
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:34,460
I already said
I'd put my focus on the hotel.

544
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,400
You were the one who disregarded me.

545
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,829
You killed it on purpose.

546
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,940
You destroyed our contracts...

547
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,970
starting with Hyesung Hotel
and other affiliated businesses,

548
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,710
and you ruined
our business with Dubai!

549
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,710
You've clearly shown
your filthy intentions on display.

550
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,750
If you knew,
why did you let it happen?

551
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,119
You're more cut out to be
the chairwoman's personal assistant.

552
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,160
Take your hands off Hyesung Tour,
and just look after her daughter.

553
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,640
I was the one
who held back from punching you,

554
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:20,039
but you punched me instead.

555
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,509
Shut your mouth.

556
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:23,680
Just wait.

557
00:32:24,349 --> 00:32:26,250
You'll be unemployed in no time.

558
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:27,839
(Cinderella Game)

559
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:31,210
Your son's company is
about to go down.

560
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,880
Is the president your sworn enemy?

561
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,420
Do you know
what Hwang Jin Goo is like?

562
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,019
What is he like?

563
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,150
Did you give this sticker...

564
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,019
- to anyone else?
- The chairwoman.

565
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,519
You said you'd come to me
after Hyesung's disposal makes the news.

566
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,660
I guess you still have feelings
for Hwang Jin Goo.

567
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,759
Wait. Where are you going?

568
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:47,559
Do I have to report
my whereabouts to you?

569
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,970
Se Young isn't home yet?

570
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,569
Didn't you two
work overtime together?

571
00:33:50,569 --> 00:33:52,700
You said you were happy
to be Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

572
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,700
Then, show me
that you're really happy.
