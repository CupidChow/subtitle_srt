00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,209
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,080
(Episode 10)

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,750
- Hey.
- Hey.

6
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:13,689
How did the business go?

7
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:15,820
Can you handle...

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,289
two hundred teams a year?

9
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,890
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

10
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,089
Congratulations,
Mr. Hwang and Ms. Yoon!

11
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:22,489
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

12
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,129
- We haven't signed the contract.
- All right, sir.

13
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,530
Did you screen all applications
for experienced operators?

14
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,370
Yes, we'll announce the result
within the day.

15
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,929
Did anyone stand out?

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,740
(Now hiring tour guides,
Tour operator assistant wanted)

17
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,009
(Stay healthy.)

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:47,590
(I hope you'll become rich.)

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,829
(Hello, Ms. Goo Ha Na.
Thank you for applying for...)

20
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,130
What is it, Auntie?

21
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,400
Can you read that, Eun Chong?

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:06,909
"Hello, Ms. Goo Ha Na."

23
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,739
"Thank you for applying..."

24
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:15,310
"for the experienced operator position
at Hyesung Tour."

25
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,680
"We are glad to inform you..."

26
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,719
"that you have passed..."

27
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:23,689
"the application process."

28
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:26,060
Auntie, did you get the job?

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,129
Yes, I passed
the application screening!

30
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,530
All right!

31
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,560
Congratulations, Auntie!

32
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,200
I need to go through an interview
and do a presentation...

33
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,299
to actually get the job.

34
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:38,939
I know you'll do a great job!

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,510
Isn't that so, Kongkong?

36
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,109
- Thank you.
- Sure.

37
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,239
Thank you.

38
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,329
She'd pass 100 percent
if only Hwang Jin Goo didn't come.

39
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,459
Who's Hwang Jin Goo?

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,099
It's this guy.
The president of Hyesung Tour.

41
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,000
She'll still pass
even if he's there.

42
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,870
Auntie Ha Na is the best!

43
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:15,439
You need to stop living off
of my sister...

44
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,909
and go find your grandmother.

45
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:19,110
What makes you different from me?

46
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,949
We both don't share
any blood with her.

47
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:24,479
Hey, you and I are
completely different.

48
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,520
Guys. Look!

49
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,060
My gosh.
You look wonderful, Auntie.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,389
Do I?

51
00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:35,389
Here. Put these on.

52
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,460
Aren't these way too high?

53
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,729
That's the least you can do.

54
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:44,699
They're small.
Cram your feet inside.

55
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:47,110
Try to walk.

56
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,810
- You can do it, Auntie!
- I can do it!

57
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,909
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

58
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,650
Excuse me, wait!

59
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:56,949
Thank you.

60
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,319
Darn it. I'm off to a bad start.

61
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,539
Hello, President Hwang.

62
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,210
I was already fed up with you.

63
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,780
Get out before I call the police.

64
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,879
Oh, my.
I am here on a different business,

65
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:32,379
so I have a pass, too.

66
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:38,990
I sincerely apologize
for the slipper incident.

67
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,789
I truly apologize.

68
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,960
Please don't be mad.

69
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,900
I looked back on myself very much.

70
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:49,900
You probably
didn't come to apologize.

71
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,840
Wait, are you...

72
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,770
I am here
for the operator job interview.

73
00:03:57,009 --> 00:04:00,039
I'll do my best for Hyesung Tour!

74
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:02,150
I look forward to a great interview,
President Hwang!

75
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,229
(Job Application, Name: Goo Ha Na)

76
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:16,290
What?

77
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,060
Why is this woman here?

78
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,970
How dare she want a job here
after taking up an illegal gig?

79
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,209
(Family Relations:
Goo Ji Seok, younger brother)

80
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,180
(Family Relations:
Goo Ji Seok, younger brother)

81
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:36,149
Wait, she was
Goo Ji Seok's older sister?

82
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,230
(Interviewer)

83
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,399
Jin Goo, look at this.

84
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,430
(Job Application, Name: Goo Ha Na)

85
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,269
I ran into her on the elevator.

86
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,339
She must be out of her mind.

87
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,560
How dare she turn in
an application to our business?

88
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,500
Let us begin the interview.

89
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,899
- Ms. Goo Ha Na.
- Yes!

90
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,939
You can work
both as a guide and an operator.

91
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,939
You have a lot of experience,
and you speak three languages.

92
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,240
- That's wonderful.
- Thank you!

93
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
Why did you quit Good Day Tour?

94
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:40,579
Answer me.

95
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,680
I was fired.

96
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:48,420
What was the reason?

97
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:50,920
Why were you fired?

98
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:55,930
I took up a job as a private agent.

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,470
"A private agent?"

100
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,939
I will take that into account.
Next, Ms. Kim Jin Kyung.

101
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,839
Is that all?

102
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,110
We can't have you
if you've worked as a private agent.

103
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,439
It'll never happen again.
It was a mistake.

104
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,680
Please give me just one chance.

105
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,709
"A mistake?"

106
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,680
Has that never happened before?

107
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,050
Was it really your first time?

108
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,759
I was ashamed of taking up
illegal gigs as a private agent.

109
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,889
I regretted what I had done
and looked back on it.

110
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,790
- It'll...
- You regretted and reflected...

111
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,290
because you got caught and fired.

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,100
You might have continued
if you weren't caught.

113
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,370
No.

114
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,100
Please allow me
to finish the interview.

115
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,639
I spent all night
planning a tour package.

116
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:44,639
Give it a go, then.

117
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,220
Everyone, what is
the purpose of traveling?

118
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,189
There may be many reasons,

119
00:06:57,189 --> 00:07:00,160
but I believe
relaxation comes first.

120
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,399
One survey asked which family member
people wanted to travel with,

121
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,769
and the number one answer was
either their mother or daughter.

122
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,430
So, I prepared...

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,240
a mother-daughter therapy tour.

124
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,439
Why did it have to be Hyesung Tour?

125
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,009
It's the rising star
in the travel industry.

126
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,310
It became the runner-up
in just two years,

127
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,379
and it came in affiliation
with the hotel I work at.

128
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,889
What's President Hwang Jin Goo like?

129
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,449
Do you know him?

130
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:31,889
Right. Did you get a job
at a travel agency?

131
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,930
- A company that puts them down.
- What?

132
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,829
When will you come home?

133
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,370
I got scared when Ha Na said...

134
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,670
she had seen someone
who looked like you at the hotel.

135
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,100
And we almost got caught
after dinner at the hotel.

136
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:48,970
She was there to drop guests off
with Eun Chong.

137
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:52,610
Gosh, Eun Chong caught us.

138
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:56,050
That little kid
nitpicked over everything...

139
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,779
and asked
why we kept your arrival in secret.

140
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,319
Anyway, his behavior screams
that he's Ha Na's son.

141
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:03,120
Is she looking for his grandmother?

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,290
She hasn't heard anything until now,
so it probably fell through.

143
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,529
So, she'll really marry
with that kid?

144
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,629
The wedding's off.

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,129
All women love taking selfies,

146
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,339
chatting, and enjoying tea time.

147
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,970
We bring them all together.

148
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,480
Imagine enjoying your tea time
in front of a beautiful landscape...

149
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,819
and experiencing
the luxury of brewing...

150
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,820
the finest white tea.

151
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,889
That's enough.

152
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,019
I still have more to go.

153
00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:40,019
We were considerate enough
to give you a chance...

154
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,590
despite your critical flaw
in your work ethic as a guide.

155
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,759
You do not qualify, Ms. Goo.

156
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,070
What happened that day was...

157
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,169
I have more to present.

158
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,909
Please let me finish
my presentation...

159
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:56,769
Ms. Goo, you are now in the way
of other interviewers.

160
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,509
Unless you're trying to get a job
at Hyesung Tour as a spy,

161
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:01,480
please leave.

162
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,179
Your side gig was
confirmed as a fact.

163
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,049
I'm still confirming
if you're a spy.

164
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,120
I will take legal measures
once I confirm the truth,

165
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,519
and I will release news articles.

166
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,330
Have you not confirmed it yet?

167
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,830
Hassan left during dinner
because of frozen meat.

168
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,799
How did you know that?

169
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,299
Because she's a spy.

170
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,940
I confirmed it with Hassan.

171
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,580
And he said
there wouldn't be a problem...

172
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,879
with Daeri Construction's business.

173
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,539
Was there a problem?

174
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:36,009
You know way too much
about our business.

175
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,720
Which is more than enough
to think she's a spy.

176
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,779
It doesn't matter
if you're a spy or not.

177
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,289
You don't qualify anyway.

178
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:42,450
Leave.

179
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,830
You were suspicious of me,
and then you blackmailed me.

180
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,600
But when I told you the truth,
you didn't care what it was...

181
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,230
and just told me to leave.

182
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,429
At the very least,
you owe me an apology...

183
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,129
if you are a decent person.

184
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,470
Watch what you say.

185
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,409
I will sue you for defamation
by spreading false information.

186
00:10:01,409 --> 00:10:02,409
Leave right now.

187
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:05,309
Please leave for now.
We must interview the others.

188
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,250
I will leave for now.

189
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,690
People in this company
don't know how to apologize...

190
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,950
for what they did wrong,
but instead, you got suspicious of,

191
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,789
looked down on,
and even ridiculed me.

192
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,690
Even if you gave me a job,

193
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,360
I'd turn it down.

194
00:10:41,409 --> 00:10:44,019
That heiress was
a downright narcissist.

195
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,980
Why was she still going on
about how I was a spy?

196
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,220
I could suffer it once,

197
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,720
but I'd be an idiot
to let it happen twice.

198
00:10:52,059 --> 00:10:53,820
Darn it. How will I retaliate?

199
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:59,759
Yes, I should've played
the CCTV footage.

200
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:07,809
All right.
I'll never have to see you again,

201
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,570
so I'll settle this for good today.

202
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,690
She deserved the blame
for her illegal gig,

203
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,919
but calling her a spy was too much.

204
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,860
Are you taking that woman's side?

205
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,220
I'm not taking sides.
Hassan's interpreter said...

206
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,559
Goo Ha Na had visited.

207
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,429
Anyway, did you find out
how to contact the guide...

208
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:32,659
who made the halal meal box?

209
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,570
- Was it...
- It was Goo Ha Na.

210
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,940
And the brooch, too?

211
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,440
I don't like her,
so I'm going to keep quiet.

212
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:47,279
We received her help,
so we should return the favor.

213
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:48,980
The chairwoman will check on us.

214
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,649
We don't know what she'll demand.

215
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,049
If she asks for a job,
will you give it to her?

216
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:53,720
She wouldn't ask
for something like that.

217
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,350
You saw how she was.

218
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:56,919
If she found out
about our contract with Dubai,

219
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:59,159
she'd even visit the chairwoman
and do worse.

220
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,429
Let's just tell the chairwoman
we thanked her and let it slide.

221
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,799
I can't do that,
but let's think of a way.

222
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,509
What is it this time?

223
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,720
Make your choice.
You get three options.

224
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,320
One, an eye for an eye.

225
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,659
Two, disclose the video
to Hyesung Tour.

226
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,929
Three, apologize sincerely.

227
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,700
Hey, if you keep doing this...

228
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,039
How could you slap an innocent woman
and pretend like nothing happened?

229
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,809
I was going to let it pass
if it wasn't any worse,

230
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:52,710
but a narcissist like you
who doesn't know how to apologize...

231
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,080
Lower your voice.
We'll talk outside.

232
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,149
Leave her alone.

233
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,820
I'll make the choice.

234
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,690
An eye for an eye.

235
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,320
Slap me.

236
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,629
She must be a sociopath,
not a narcissist.

237
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:10,789
That's enough, Se Young.

238
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,169
There are more than
1 or 2 CCTVs around here.

239
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,509
You'll be charged with assault
on top of defamation, so...

240
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:28,049
- You!
- What's with you?

241
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,389
Ji Seok.

242
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,230
When did you arrive from America?

243
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,370
They really were siblings?

244
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,340
- Let's go.
- They must know each other.

245
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:58,639
Let's go.

246
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,110
So, it was you.

247
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,279
I recently saw you here...

248
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,990
and thought you were
someone who looked like you.

249
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:10,350
- When did you come?
- It's been a few days.

250
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,590
It's been a few days,
but you haven't called?

251
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:14,929
And you didn't come home.

252
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,799
- Are you staying here?
- Yes.

253
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,970
Then, Ji Eun must know.

254
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,100
So does Ji Chang.

255
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,070
I see.
I was the only one who didn't know.

256
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,870
Are you back for good?

257
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,009
Yes, and what brings you here?

258
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,879
I had to do something.

259
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,309
I couldn't tell what was going on,

260
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,019
but a guide shouldn't make a scene
in the hotel lobby.

261
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,250
- What?
- I have to go out for business.

262
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,690
I'll be home on the weekend.

263
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,500
They're siblings?

264
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:55,570
So, did she apply here
because she knew...

265
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,399
her younger brother
became the head director?

266
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,669
She had to have known...

267
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:00,299
to be brazen enough to apply
after what she did.

268
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,409
But she didn't know
Goo Ji Seok was in Korea.

269
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,840
If she's his older sister,
we better return the favor.

270
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:10,110
What if they both end up here
after pulling those strings?

271
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,779
It feels horrible just to imagine.

272
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:13,120
You're jumping to a conclusion.

273
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,519
Anyway, did you really slap her?

274
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:18,789
- Is that so important now?
- You shouldn't resort to violence.

275
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,590
Apologize to her.

276
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:23,659
I already have a lot on my mind,
so stop pestering me.

277
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,909
Jin Goo won't be the head director
even if I tell him that.

278
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,169
It'll only trouble him.

279
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,480
I didn't know you were Solomon,

280
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,350
talking so wisely.

281
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,320
Only I felt frustrated.

282
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,879
I just can't get along with you.

283
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,049
Who's here this late?

284
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,289
I can't get along with you, either.

285
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,860
Bang Ul, you need to hide.

286
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,730
- Jin Goo is here. Okay?
- "Jin Goo?"

287
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,500
What are you doing?
You need to hide!

288
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,700
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,169
- Take your phone.
- Right.

290
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,970
- Hide. Quickly.
- Okay.

291
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,539
Why didn't he say he was coming?

292
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,779
- Where's Mother?
- In there.

293
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:19,120
Hey, you should've called.

294
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,649
He told me he'd come
after we got in the car.

295
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:21,850
Did you miss my text message?

296
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,019
He's staying for dinner.

297
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,730
Anyway, why didn't you
call me earlier?

298
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,340
The dinner looks too humble
without the maid's help.

299
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,500
It's a feast.

300
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,470
I always thought
it was like a meal I ate at home.

301
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,539
I see. That's wonderful.
Please eat up.

302
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,679
I heard you went to see
your newlywed home.

303
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:51,820
When will you sign the contract?

304
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,220
They'll do it soon.

305
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,990
We'll prepare everything
for your marriage,

306
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,759
so please tell your mother
she has nothing to do.

307
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,259
Thank you for the offer,
but it'll make my mom sad.

308
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,430
I'm her only son, so she wants
to do something herself.

309
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,700
I said that
because I thought of you as my own.

310
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:12,470
What I do for you is like
what your mother is doing for you.

311
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,710
Yes, just leave it up to her.

312
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,759
Auntie, can you dry Kongkong?

313
00:17:35,059 --> 00:17:37,460
After I dry Eun Chong.

314
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,900
- Wait there, Kongkong.
- Okay.

315
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,369
Ha Na, how did the interview go?
You got the job, right?

316
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,569
She didn't.

317
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:48,170
What? Why not?

318
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,869
Don't ask, Uncle Ji Chang.

319
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,410
Give me that.

320
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:57,579
You have hands, too.

321
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,019
I never boss around my sister,
but you always do.

322
00:18:01,019 --> 00:18:03,089
You should date someone
instead of obsessing over Ha Na.

323
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:05,289
You're always jealous
of a seven-year-old...

324
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,829
because of your hormonal imbalance.

325
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:11,730
- Worry about yourself.
- I'm already doing great.

326
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,400
Ji Seok will come home
on the weekend.

327
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:20,240
Wait, Ji Seok is coming home?

328
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,440
- You must've talked on the phone.
- I met him.

329
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,279
He was in Seoul.

330
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:29,079
The guy I saw at your hotel was him.

331
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:31,450
You also knew about this, right?

332
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,650
Ha Na, the thing is, I...

333
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,720
What did I tell you?

334
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,660
I said I was going to tell her
from the start!

335
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,160
Why are you yelling at me?

336
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,990
Ji Seok told you not to tell her!

337
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,730
And in the end, you did as he said!

338
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,559
Ha Na, I really didn't want
to go and meet him,

339
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,529
but Ji Eun kept saying
the Japanese course meal...

340
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,730
- at her hotel was good...
- Hey!

341
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:55,309
So, it was the day
when we met at the hotel.

342
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,009
You must've been flustered
when I couldn't take a hint...

343
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:00,339
and kept asking questions.

344
00:19:00,809 --> 00:19:04,480
Ha Na, I really didn't want to go.

345
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,619
On that day, I had a big fight
with Ji Seok and left.

346
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:09,150
I said it wasn't fair
to leave you out.

347
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,220
- And...
- Don't say anything to Ji Seok.

348
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,500
What are you looking at?

349
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:24,200
You should've handled this well
if I kept my promise to you!

350
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:27,200
What is this? She found out first!

351
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,509
I'm sorry that we're so clumsy.

352
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,710
You aren't sorry at all!

353
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,079
If you get it, just stay quiet.

354
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,049
I'm annoyed enough,
so don't add to this.

355
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,519
Darn it.

356
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,269
Ji Seok told you not to tell her!

357
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,769
And in the end, you did as he said!

358
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,670
I couldn't tell what was going on,

359
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,369
but a guide shouldn't make a scene
in the hotel lobby.

360
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:04,980
I have to go out for business.

361
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,279
I'll be home on the weekend.

362
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,420
You have such a big head, Ji Seok.

363
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,000
I heard your older sister applied
for an operator job at Hyesung Tour.

364
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,259
Will it be all right?

365
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:30,170
I don't think she'll get the job.

366
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,970
And I don't care
even if she makes it.

367
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,839
Hyesung Tour is undergoing
a business contract with Dubai.

368
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:37,980
That's great.

369
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,980
People feel the most afraid
when they're 11m above the ground.

370
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:46,019
People can die before the impact
if they're too high before the fall.

371
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:49,289
That seems appropriate.

372
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,319
We're very glad
to be partners with Hassan.

373
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:57,230
We will present the best trip
for guests visiting from Dubai.

374
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,940
Wait.

375
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,980
You must be Uncle Ji Seok.

376
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,579
Hello.

377
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,009
My name is Lee Eun Chong...

378
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,779
of Chamsae Class
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

379
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,150
You're calling him an uncle
as soon as you meet him?

380
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,519
Auntie Ha Na went grocery shopping.

381
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,759
You're here.

382
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,660
Hey, you're here.

383
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,670
I thought you'd come in time for dinner,
but you got here early.

384
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,400
Let's go inside. Come on.

385
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,940
I can't stay for dinner.
I have to go soon.

386
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,509
You finally came after a long time,
but you couldn't stay for dinner?

387
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,220
I got groceries to make
braised pollack, your favorite.

388
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,720
Please have a seat, Uncle Ji Seok.

389
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Do you want coffee or green tea?

390
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,869
Wait, you can't sleep
because of caffeine.

391
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,900
- Do you want plum tea?
- I'll do it.

392
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,039
No, thanks.

393
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,339
I came to give you this.

394
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,079
- Is it money?
- It's for Ha Na.

395
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,750
- It's for me?
- It's for taking good care...

396
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,980
of my younger siblings to this day.

397
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,319
I know it's not enough.
I'll give you more later.

398
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:33,559
- Ji Seok.
- Go live your life now.

399
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:35,759
I'll take care of my siblings.

400
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:38,700
I'm already living my life.

401
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,859
What kind of life
are you trying to make me live?

402
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:43,700
Is that all you can say
after five years?

403
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,869
You haven't changed.

404
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:48,140
You were the one who hadn't changed.

405
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,039
You need to live like a human
and be more selfish.

406
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,339
I heard the wedding was off, too.

407
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,210
You'll never get married
if you continue to live like this.

408
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:56,750
I wasn't born to marry.

409
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,880
And not marrying is
the latest trend.

410
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:01,019
You were worried
I wouldn't get married?

411
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:03,089
You have the most ridiculous concern
about me.

412
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,319
Yes, marriage is hardly the problem.

413
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:11,559
Ji Eun and Ji Chang will
move into my apartment unit.

414
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:14,900
I'm not going.
I never said I was going.

415
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,130
Ha Na, I want to live with you.

416
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,240
Do whatever you want.

417
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,869
When will you move in, Ji Eun?

418
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,869
Well, toward the end of the month.

419
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,480
He lived there alone,

420
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,250
so I should look after him.

421
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,180
You, look after him?
That's enough to make a cat laugh.

422
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,619
If you want to go, then go.

423
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,890
Why not?
It's your older brother's place.

424
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,720
Why have you
always been like this, Ji Seok?

425
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,859
Why are you always dying
to keep Ha Na away from us?

426
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,089
Then, why did you come back...

427
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,759
instead of enjoying a good life
alone in America?

428
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,170
Ha Na left home back in the day...

429
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,039
because you and Ji Eun...

430
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:54,700
That's enough, Ji Chang.

431
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,839
I'm telling you this
so you can get a grip on yourself.

432
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:58,480
No one will commend you
for living like that.

433
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,680
Do you think Ji Eun
or Ji Chang will know?

434
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,079
- Even I don't.
- I know how hard she works!

435
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,119
I've never asked them to commend me,

436
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,849
and I don't need them to.

437
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,059
I don't think life will be different
no matter how I choose to live.

438
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,329
Is blood relation that important?

439
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,329
More than the fact
we lived 20 years as a family?

440
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,359
You're always going on
about blood relation.

441
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,099
Are you telling me
to take the money and get lost?

442
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,670
Fine. I'll gladly accept this money.

443
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,039
Gosh, I love money,

444
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,980
but it's the first time
it's making me feel awful.

445
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:45,059
Ji Eun, get your stuff ready
and move in.

446
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,220
Okay.

447
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:57,430
Our family never lets
anything happen in peace.

448
00:24:58,099 --> 00:24:59,170
What an evil brat.

449
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,410
Uncle Ji Seok,
you'll come back, right?

450
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:17,789
Come again, Uncle Ji Seok.

451
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:24,230
No way. He must've made it big.

452
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:27,430
Gosh, how many bills
did he put in here?

453
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,170
Start packing up in advance.

454
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,240
If you also want to go,
you can go, Ji Chang.

455
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,839
Don't say that, Ha Na.

456
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,710
I told you.
I'd live with you forever.

457
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:46,779
That's why Ji Seok is
always getting mad at you.

458
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:49,589
Don't get your hands on that.
It's Ha Na's.

459
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,559
You can use the money
only for yourself.

460
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,430
Get some clothes, shoes, bags,

461
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,500
your hair done,
and use up everything.

462
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,829
Don't you want to know
how much it is?

463
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:05,369
No, I don't.

464
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,869
What I want to know is
why Ji Seok is...

465
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,980
always dying
to pull us away from Ha Na.

466
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,750
Is there a way
to read into his mind?

467
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,970
All done.

468
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:44,240
Eun Chong's first friend.

469
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
Or should I say
it's his younger sibling?

470
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,549
I don't understand you,
and I hate Du Na, too.

471
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,420
And him.

472
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,859
One day, not too long after
I started school,

473
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:05,400
the rain was pouring.

474
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,829
All my friends' moms
came for them with umbrellas.

475
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:17,009
They'd go,
"My girl, did I keep you waiting?"

476
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,640
That was when I realized...

477
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,420
I had no one to wait for.

478
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,279
I had no one.

479
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,190
It didn't matter if it rained,
got windy,

480
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,190
or began to snow.
I knew I'd always be alone.

481
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:43,400
I had no one
to stand in the rain with...

482
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,470
or put an umbrella over my head.

483
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,569
But your parents...

484
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,980
became an umbrella for me.

485
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:59,380
I could never be a parent
to you, the kids,

486
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:01,549
and Eun Chong,

487
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,720
but at the very least,
I wanted to let you know...

488
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,619
that you weren't alone
in this world.

489
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,410
You should've told Hassan
she was fired for an illegal act,

490
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,180
and our company didn't allow
working with someone like her.

491
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,150
It wasn't Hassan.
His wife said it had to be her.

492
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,950
Come on.
It was all because of the brooch.

493
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,789
Restaurant Mirim called,

494
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,759
and they said she found out
about the frozen halal meat, too.

495
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:42,730
I really hate her!

496
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:44,230
Then, should we
call the contract off?

497
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,029
Come in.

498
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,599
Mr. Hwang, Ms. Goo Ha Na
won't pick up her phone.

499
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,740
Why would that unemployed woman
be so busy?

500
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,109
Where does she live?

501
00:28:55,109 --> 00:28:57,539
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

502
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,640
She lives in my neighborhood.

503
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:02,180
- I'll stop by on my way home.
- Yes, sir.

504
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,549
Fine, go ahead
and start working here.

505
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,319
I'll make you grovel before me.

506
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:24,670
Is this Ms. Goo Ha Na's place?

507
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,910
Yes, that's my auntie.

508
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:30,670
Who are you?

509
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,579
Well, my name is Hwang Jin Goo.

510
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:37,750
- Is your auntie home?
- Hwang Jin Goo? That evil...

511
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,680
You must be
the president of Hyesung Tour.

512
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:42,019
How do you know me?

513
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,349
My auntie is really good at her job.

514
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,160
She's the best
at marketing products,

515
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,589
and she gets
a lot of tips from her guests.

516
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:50,430
She was a talented tour guide.

517
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,230
- So, why didn't she get the job?
- What?

518
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:57,400
You will regret
not giving her a job.

519
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,940
- Auntie.
- Hey.

520
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,049
My gosh.
Why are you here at my place?

521
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,210
- Why won't you pick up your phone?
- My phone?

522
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,220
What's going on this time?

523
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,990
What do you want?

524
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,690
Come to work starting Monday.

525
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,829
What? I didn't get the job.

526
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,599
Wait, is she doing this
to apologize for slapping me...

527
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,269
after thinking I was a spy?

528
00:30:30,269 --> 00:30:31,500
We conduct
our business professionally,

529
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,640
leaving out
personal affairs and emotions.

530
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:36,970
Your resume
and the presentation weren't so bad.

531
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,009
There was a mishap,

532
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:40,680
but you said
you'd never do it again.

533
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,180
I want to see how good you are.

534
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:45,619
- Are you serious?
- I thought you'd be thrilled.

535
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,079
Wait, did you get a job
somewhere else?

536
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,559
Well, I've been
picking and choosing.

537
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,920
There's no need to do that.
You'll start on Monday.

538
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,990
Okay?

539
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:59,859
Well, if you really want that.

540
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,200
Then, that's that.

541
00:31:03,829 --> 00:31:04,930
Goodbye.

542
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:06,670
Goodbye.

543
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,250
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie!

544
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:19,349
My gosh. I can't believe this.

547
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,680
Congratulations, Director Goo.

548

Thank you, President Hwang.

549
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,220
Congratulations.

550
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,880
I look forward to working with you.

551
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:58,420
I have high expectations
of both of you...

552
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:01,119
in work...

553
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,359
and marriage.

554
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,109
Hyesung Tour.
We meet again like this.

555
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,920
No rain, no flowers.

556
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:34,119
My future will
only be filled with flowers!

557

(Cinderella Game)

558
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,470
How can a girl like her
get a job at our company?

559
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,140
I will never give up...

560
00:33:22,269 --> 00:33:23,440
no matter how hard
you try to harass me.

561
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,410
You're doing this on purpose
to put me in trouble, right?

562
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,910
You're trying to make me mad!

563
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:30,450
How many people
do you think are sincere in here?

564
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:32,220
Why do you keep calling me?

565
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:34,250
I said I had no money
because I didn't.

566
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,450
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,

567
00:33:36,589 --> 00:33:38,490
step down from your office!

568
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,119
Get a grip on yourself,

569
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,019
and do not get caught up in this.

570
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,789
Things will become interesting
for Hyesung Group.
