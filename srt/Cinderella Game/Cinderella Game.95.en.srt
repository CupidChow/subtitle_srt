1
00:00:01,422 --> 00:00:04,262
They can't approve the loan because the documents were fake.

2
00:00:04,692 --> 00:00:06,432
What's going on?

3
00:00:06,762 --> 00:00:08,392
You only wanted to change the name.

4
00:00:08,732 --> 00:00:09,902
I did that.

5
00:00:10,862 --> 00:00:12,632
I didn't promise anything more.

6
00:00:13,232 --> 00:00:14,872
What?

7
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,412
Did you try...

8
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:22,572
to con me from the start?

9
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:25,881
Do you know who I am?

10
00:00:25,882 --> 00:00:28,982
Chairwoman Shin had placed a two-factor security system...

11
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:33,122
on Eun Chong's trust fund before she collapsed.

12
00:00:33,522 --> 00:00:36,322
You were the one who tried to con her.

13
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:41,092
Hey!

14
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,772
Shin Yeo Jin.

15
00:00:48,072 --> 00:00:51,502
Did you expect I'd do this?

16
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:14,692
Did you just break the door open?

17
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:16,702
Everything you do is ridiculous.

18
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:19,362
Get out. How dare you come here?

19
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:21,232
Those are my words.

20
00:01:22,602 --> 00:01:24,842
You have to leave this place.

21
00:01:25,142 --> 00:01:27,372
This is my house.

22
00:01:28,612 --> 00:01:29,682
Your house?

23
00:01:30,612 --> 00:01:33,382
Take a look and see whose name is under the title.

24
00:01:33,852 --> 00:01:34,912
What?

25
00:01:42,822 --> 00:01:44,322
(Given to Choi Myung Ji on April 15, 2025)

26
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,362
How did it...

27
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:50,832
I gave you this house?

28
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:53,832
Did you do this after putting me in a coma?

29
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:57,342
You tried to take Eun Chong's trust fund and this house?

30
00:01:59,072 --> 00:02:01,542
You wanted me to die. That was why...

31
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,411
you put me off the respirator.

32
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:05,182
Do you have evidence I did that?

33
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:08,112
Why is everyone yapping without evidence?

34
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:12,022
It's not like I love this place.

35
00:02:12,482 --> 00:02:14,392
You should be grateful...

36
00:02:14,992 --> 00:02:18,062
that this was all you had to give for 20 years of my service.

37
00:02:24,632 --> 00:02:27,101
Get out of my house right now!

38
00:02:27,102 --> 00:02:29,602
You're the one who needs to go.

39
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:33,172
Get out of my house right now!

40
00:02:33,542 --> 00:02:35,442
You're on another level of insanity.

41
00:02:35,872 --> 00:02:38,742
I'll take legal action to invalidate this change, and I'll win anyway.

42
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:40,112
Go ahead and try.

43
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:43,522
This is just crazy.

44
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:45,422
You stole it from her illegally.

45
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:49,522
Illegal? What you two are doing is illegal.

46
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,322
Why are you occupying my house?

47
00:02:52,522 --> 00:02:54,032
This is considered trespassing!

48
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,532
You only make me laugh.

49
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:03,242
You should probably go to Eun Chong's school right now.

50
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:06,842
What? What are you talking about?

51
00:03:07,512 --> 00:03:09,842
Haven't you been on the Internet?

52
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:16,751
("Chairwoman Shin's Hidden Grandson and Her Successor, Lee Eun Chong")

53
00:03:16,752 --> 00:03:19,952
This is... Did you leak this information?

54
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:23,222
What is this?

55
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:26,492
Victims of your corporate raids will come after Eun Chong now.

56
00:03:26,762 --> 00:03:27,992
What will you do?

57
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:33,302
Chairwoman Shin's other corruptions came out in the open, too.

58
00:03:33,772 --> 00:03:35,232
You evil brat.

59
00:03:36,472 --> 00:03:37,602
That's why...

60
00:03:38,842 --> 00:03:41,672
you should've given me half of your fortune.

61
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,241
I already made myself clear...

62
00:03:45,242 --> 00:03:46,882
while you acted like you didn't remember.

63
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,452
Have you also gone deaf?

64
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,852
I just can't forgive you.

65
00:03:55,352 --> 00:03:57,462
Everyone knows what Eun Chong looks like,

66
00:03:57,692 --> 00:03:59,792
and reporters will camp out in front of this house.

67
00:04:01,062 --> 00:04:03,332
Can you really live with him under this roof?

68
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:07,472
I'll destroy you into pieces.

69
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:12,272
I'll make sure there is not a drop of you left...

70
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:14,412
on the face of this earth.

71
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:17,312
Sure. Go ahead.

72
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:19,182
Enough is enough!

73
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:21,582
Human punishment is far from enough for you.

74
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:24,082
You'll be cursed by fate.

75
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:30,962
I have to go to Eun Chong's school.

76
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:38,262
Ms. Chairwoman, have you seen the news article?

77
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:41,602
Yes, you can stay here, Ms. Jang.

78
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,202
I'll go with you.

79
00:04:43,203 --> 00:04:45,671
I'll make the call and dispose of your stuff.

80
00:04:45,672 --> 00:04:47,842
Do not lay a finger on my stuff.

81
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:55,582
What's going on?

82
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:00,822
What do you think?

83
00:05:01,852 --> 00:05:03,422
What went around came around.

84
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:14,632
Hey, Se Young.

85
00:05:15,772 --> 00:05:17,472
Come to Pyeongcheong-dong after work.

86
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:19,072
To Pyeongcheong-dong?

87
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:20,911
Did Aunt Yeo Jin say we can return?

88
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:23,782
Why do we need her permission? It's our house.

89
00:05:25,342 --> 00:05:26,412
Our house?

90
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:29,311
What are you talking about?

91
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,822
Let's talk after work.

92
00:05:36,562 --> 00:05:40,492
Ms. Jang, isn't it about time you left the chairwoman?

93
00:05:41,762 --> 00:05:43,462
It'd be even better if you crossed over to my side.

94
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,902
Aunt Yeo Jin's house is our house?

95
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:54,512
What did my mom do this time?

96
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:59,081
Chairwoman Shin had a grandson?

97
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:00,812
He's the son of her late daughter.

98
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:06,521
Gosh, his identity got exposed, too.

99
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,692
His photo and school were made public.

100
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:10,392
What's going on?

101
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:15,232
("Chairwoman Shin's Hidden Grandson and Her Successor, Lee Eun Chong")

102
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:18,062
When was this released?

103
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:20,532
It must've been Mom.

104
00:06:21,272 --> 00:06:23,442
Did she blackmail my aunt and take her house?

105
00:06:23,872 --> 00:06:25,102
No way.

106
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:38,522
I'm sorry you have to go through so much trouble because of me.

107
00:06:38,952 --> 00:06:41,092
Did you do something wrong?

108
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:42,952
I wonder.

109
00:06:43,062 --> 00:06:44,721
Your Pyeongcheong-dong home is exposed,

110
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:45,962
so it seems dangerous.

111
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:47,562
We'll go to a hotel.

112
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:50,701
It's easy for reporters to find him at a hotel,

113
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,062
and it'll be uncomfortable for you two.

114
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,872
Why don't you stay here a few days and think of a plan?

115
00:06:56,972 --> 00:06:58,002
Here?

116
00:06:58,102 --> 00:07:01,912
Is Grandma going to live in our house from now on?

117
00:07:02,972 --> 00:07:04,082
I don't know.

118
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,712
Excuse me.

119
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:12,022
Jin Goo, did you see the article?

120
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,321
The chairwoman and I went to his school...

121
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:17,462
and picked him up because of that article.

122
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,162
How was that article released?

123
00:07:19,262 --> 00:07:20,632
It was Choi Myung Ji.

124
00:07:21,592 --> 00:07:23,131
She changed the title of the house deed to her name...

125
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,062
while the chairwoman was unconscious.

126
00:07:26,502 --> 00:07:29,171
She just barged in with the certified register,

127
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:31,641
claimed it was her house, and told the chairwoman to leave.

128
00:07:31,642 --> 00:07:32,702
What?

129
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:36,372
How much lower is she going to go?

130
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:39,442
What did the chairwoman say?

131
00:07:39,782 --> 00:07:42,452
She got worried about Eun Chong and had to leave right away.

132
00:07:42,952 --> 00:07:45,282
There were reporters in front of his school, too.

133
00:07:46,182 --> 00:07:47,552
We can never have a day of peace.

134
00:07:48,792 --> 00:07:51,322
The chairwoman and Eun Chong are at my place right now.

135
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:53,022
I'll be there after work.

136
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:00,871
Did you know your mom stole...

137
00:08:00,872 --> 00:08:02,602
- the chairwoman's house? - She stole it?

138
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:05,002
She changed the title when the chairwoman was unconscious.

139
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,412
It's a forgery of private documents. You need to stop your mother.

140
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,812
How much lower is she going to go?

141
00:08:11,182 --> 00:08:13,111
Who do you think you are to condemn my mom?

142
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:14,411
She didn't take your place.

143
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,782
- But what she did was wrong. - Mind your own.

144
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:18,682
Right or wrong, she's my mom.

145
00:08:29,332 --> 00:08:30,462
Darn it.

146
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:47,881
Did Choi Myung Ji kick the chairwoman out...

147
00:08:47,882 --> 00:08:49,682
and expose Eun Chong's identity, too?

148
00:08:51,252 --> 00:08:54,822
People who hold a grudge against the chairwoman may hurt him.

149
00:08:56,792 --> 00:08:59,292
Choi Myung Ji is so evil. How can she do this to a child?

150
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:01,692
I'm sorry to say this to you,

151
00:09:02,332 --> 00:09:05,232
but the chairwoman and Eun Chong are at our place.

152
00:09:05,432 --> 00:09:06,432
- What? - What?

153
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,602
It's true that Choi Myung Ji kicked her out,

154
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:12,201
but reporters and malicious people came to her place anyway,

155
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:13,271
so they couldn't go inside.

156
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:14,372
It's dangerous for Eun Chong, too.

157
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,112
Tell them to go to a hotel.

158
00:09:16,582 --> 00:09:18,012
Even a hotel can be dangerous.

159
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:20,582
Reporters would stake out at her home, office, and hotel.

160
00:09:20,712 --> 00:09:23,422
We can't live in the same house as our enemy.

161
00:09:24,352 --> 00:09:25,451
Just for a few days.

162
00:09:25,452 --> 00:09:27,922
- No. - I'm also against this.

163
00:09:28,692 --> 00:09:30,592
I hate what the chairwoman did in the past,

164
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,332
but she apologized once again after she regained her memories.

165
00:09:33,462 --> 00:09:36,062
She also wanted to do the same to you two, too.

166
00:09:37,102 --> 00:09:38,162
Also,

167
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:41,972
take a look at this.

168
00:09:43,302 --> 00:09:44,342
What's that?

169
00:09:44,842 --> 00:09:46,402
It's a letter of apology from Eun Chong.

170
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:49,711
Choi Myung Ji must've told him that his grandma did...

171
00:09:49,712 --> 00:09:51,042
something wrong to our family.

172
00:09:52,442 --> 00:09:54,582
He thought we hated him and walked on eggshells around us.

173
00:09:55,112 --> 00:09:56,722
I heard you told him not to come here.

174
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,352
We just...

175
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,152
Yes, I was a bit harsh on him.

176
00:10:03,362 --> 00:10:05,462
I have this love-hate feeling for that kid.

177
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,862
We'll let them stay if Ji Seok agrees.

178
00:10:11,132 --> 00:10:12,602
Yes, okay.

179
00:10:15,102 --> 00:10:16,132
Okay.

180
00:10:16,842 --> 00:10:18,142
You don't need my permission.

181
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:20,042
You can do as you like.

182
00:10:20,972 --> 00:10:22,072
Bye.

183
00:10:25,482 --> 00:10:26,612
Come in.

184
00:10:31,052 --> 00:10:32,452
Let me take a break.

185
00:10:34,822 --> 00:10:36,292
I heard you stole Chairwoman Shin's house.

186
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,962
I can't even rest here anymore.

187
00:10:41,232 --> 00:10:43,562
- Word gets around fast. - Get some rest.

188
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,062
- I won't say anything. - Forget it.

189
00:10:46,932 --> 00:10:48,402
Chairwoman Shin won't sit on her hands.

190
00:10:51,402 --> 00:10:54,272
What kind of move do you think she can play?

191
00:10:56,512 --> 00:10:59,312
Will you save me if my aunt abandons me?

192
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:05,522
Was that such a difficult question?

193
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:14,962
I don't think I'd be able to help.

194
00:11:19,162 --> 00:11:21,131
The notebook and Detective Cho are...

195
00:11:21,132 --> 00:11:22,672
the only two things we can use to catch Choi Myung Ji.

196
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:25,401
The notebook is gone without a trace,

197
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:27,072
so it'll take a while.

198
00:11:27,372 --> 00:11:30,982
Expose Se Young's embezzlement, the one she blamed on me.

199
00:11:32,912 --> 00:11:36,512
Make it look like the money she took went to Detective Cho...

200
00:11:37,082 --> 00:11:38,382
and put him...

201
00:11:38,722 --> 00:11:40,492
under internal investigation by the police.

202
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:43,691
Once the investigation begins, Detective Cho will...

203
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,292
have to reach out to Myung Ji.

204
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:46,862
And we'll catch him then.

205
00:11:47,732 --> 00:11:48,932
It's like catching two birds with one stone.

206
00:11:49,932 --> 00:11:51,432
We'll get Detective Cho...

207
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:55,902
and make him spill that Myung Ji was behind everything.

208
00:11:57,142 --> 00:11:58,472
Did you have to take things this far?

209
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,142
Yeo Jin kicked us out, too.

210
00:12:02,672 --> 00:12:04,242
Why do we have to sit around and put up with her?

211
00:12:06,412 --> 00:12:09,451
The title change for Eun Chong's trust fund...

212
00:12:09,452 --> 00:12:10,722
didn't do anything.

213
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:12,721
- Why not? - She thought I'd take it,

214
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:14,352
so she placed a two-factor security system on it,

215
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:16,892
and then worked with the CEO of the trust company...

216
00:12:17,222 --> 00:12:18,892
to make me look like an idiot.

217
00:12:19,962 --> 00:12:22,392
So, do we have no money?

218
00:12:23,802 --> 00:12:26,632
I took out a loan with this house as collateral.

219
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:29,401
Aunt Yeo Jin raised Yu Jin in this house.

220
00:12:29,402 --> 00:12:30,771
You know what this place means to her.

221
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,602
Yes, we'll renovate the place...

222
00:12:33,142 --> 00:12:35,171
and erase all traces of Yu Jin.

223
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:38,612
Did she do something to you?

224
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:43,382
I dread your aunt, so I hate her, too.

225
00:12:44,182 --> 00:12:46,252
Was that why you instigated the hit-and-run accident?

226
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:47,722
No, right?

227
00:12:50,622 --> 00:12:54,262
People are more suspicious of you because of these actions.

228
00:12:54,332 --> 00:12:58,132
Yes, so you need to get married to get my revenge.

229
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:01,372
It'd be much faster if you married someone.

230
00:13:03,302 --> 00:13:05,372
So, you won't marry him?

231
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:08,242
- He says he likes you. - I don't.

232
00:13:09,112 --> 00:13:10,982
Why don't you meet him a few more times?

233
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:20,722
Myung Ji took the chairwoman's home like it was her place?

234
00:13:21,152 --> 00:13:23,522
- Yes. - My gosh. That cunning woman.

235
00:13:24,162 --> 00:13:25,961
It's preposterous that she changed the title...

236
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,362
while the chairwoman fell unconscious,

237
00:13:27,862 --> 00:13:29,092
but she even kicked her out?

238
00:13:30,862 --> 00:13:34,772
But the chairwoman wouldn't let her take the place so easily.

239
00:13:35,002 --> 00:13:37,242
She had to leave because of Eun Chong,

240
00:13:37,502 --> 00:13:38,772
but she should return soon.

241
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:41,842
She and Eun Chong are at Ha Na's place now.

242
00:13:41,942 --> 00:13:43,072
Is that so?

243
00:13:44,342 --> 00:13:47,682
It must be tough for the chairwoman to put up a fight against that girl.

244
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:54,392
Eun Chong, did you like your grandpa?

245
00:13:54,922 --> 00:13:58,962
Yes, he was Santa, so he granted my wishes, too.

246
00:14:00,122 --> 00:14:01,232
Did he?

247
00:14:02,662 --> 00:14:05,832
Grandma, why don't you live with Grandpa?

248
00:14:07,132 --> 00:14:10,771
- What? - Grandpa likes you,

249
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,102
so what about you?

250
00:14:14,712 --> 00:14:15,811
I like him.

251
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,542
Then, you should live together.

252
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:20,682
You want to live with Auntie Ha Na, right?

253
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:23,821
Yes, but it'll be even better...

254
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,282
if we all live together in a big house.

255
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,722
You, Grandpa, Auntie Ha Na,

256
00:14:31,062 --> 00:14:33,122
and my uncles.

257
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:35,492
Gosh, that's a lot of people.

258
00:14:36,732 --> 00:14:37,802
That is.

259
00:14:44,272 --> 00:14:45,442
Hello.

260
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:47,512
Right. Hello.

261
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:49,612
Hello.

262
00:14:49,672 --> 00:14:50,981
I'm here, too.

263
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,242
- Hey. Hi. - Hey. Hi.

264
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:55,982
I'm sorry. I owe you another one.

265
00:14:56,312 --> 00:15:00,152
I guess so. Life is full of surprises.

266
00:15:02,092 --> 00:15:05,622
I folded these for you two.

267
00:15:06,392 --> 00:15:07,492
- What are those? - What are those?

268
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:10,302
It's my heart.

269
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:21,571
Eun Chong.

270
00:15:21,572 --> 00:15:24,411
- Will you stay here for a while? - Yes.

271
00:15:24,412 --> 00:15:26,541
Then, will you study English here, too?

272
00:15:26,542 --> 00:15:27,982
Of course!

273
00:15:28,782 --> 00:15:29,852
Awesome.

274
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:32,752
All right! You're my lucky charm.

275
00:15:34,222 --> 00:15:35,292
Yes!

276
00:15:40,092 --> 00:15:44,102
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

277
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:50,972
I must catch Detective Cho Byung Jin to get to Myung Ji.

278
00:15:51,372 --> 00:15:53,202
I'll make a report and say...

279
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:56,142
the million dollars she took all went to Detective Cho.

280
00:15:56,342 --> 00:15:58,382
Are you asking me to fire Se Young for embezzlement...

281
00:15:59,142 --> 00:16:01,682
to let things go according to that plan?

282
00:16:02,152 --> 00:16:03,552
Of course, she should be fired over this.

283
00:16:04,722 --> 00:16:08,052
But I heard you two had history, so I was worried...

284
00:16:08,292 --> 00:16:11,262
you might get too emotional as you handled this.

285
00:16:22,572 --> 00:16:23,741
What should we do?

286
00:16:23,742 --> 00:16:25,342
The deadline for the article is coming up.

287
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:27,172
Let's stick to the rules.

288
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:30,342
- Release the article. - Yes, sir.

289
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:54,932
What is this?

290
00:16:56,072 --> 00:16:58,572
"Shin Yeo Jin Framed for Taking a Million Dollars While Unconscious."

291
00:16:58,942 --> 00:17:00,842
"Who's Really Responsible?"

292
00:17:01,612 --> 00:17:04,612
I thought this case was over, Ms. Yoon.

293
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:07,052
Why was this article released without a warning?

294
00:17:11,722 --> 00:17:13,352
Ms. Yoon, your phone is ringing.

295
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,362
You've reached Team Leader Yoon Se Young.

296
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,832
The HR?

297
00:17:32,442 --> 00:17:33,572
Okay.

298
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:41,252
Why did your embezzlement suddenly come out?

299
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,212
Aunt Yeo Jin must've reported this...

300
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:45,022
because you took her house.

301
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:49,052
I'm doomed if this gets exposed.

302
00:17:49,522 --> 00:17:51,022
I'll stop everything.

303
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,422
It's already too late.

304
00:17:53,022 --> 00:17:55,191
The HR wants to see me.

305
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,332
Already?

306
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,932
Don't admit to anything.

307
00:17:59,402 --> 00:18:01,002
Your aunt was the one who repaid everything.

308
00:18:01,472 --> 00:18:03,231
That's not going to work!

309
00:18:03,232 --> 00:18:06,502
Well, then, ask Ji Seok for help.

310
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:08,642
I'll be at the office now.

311
00:18:13,282 --> 00:18:17,752
Director Cho, can you handle Se Young's embezzlement quietly?

312
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:21,752
We'll talk in person.

313
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,892
- Was the article released? - Yes, ma'am.

314
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:31,831
Wrap it up within the day...

315
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,502
before Myung Ji has a chance to make a move.

316
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:34,832
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:18:44,742 --> 00:18:47,112
- You're with my aunt, aren't you? - Yes.

318
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:49,712
She had been quite patient.

319
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:52,821
She should've kicked you and your mom out...

320
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:54,022
as soon as she remembered.

321
00:18:54,352 --> 00:18:55,421
It's not even your house.

322
00:18:55,422 --> 00:18:57,622
She should've fought evil with worse evil.

323
00:18:57,892 --> 00:19:00,962
Otherwise, the good always ends up suffering.

324
00:19:02,162 --> 00:19:05,502
Who's the good one here? You? Aunt Yeo Jin?

325
00:19:06,162 --> 00:19:08,032
No one here is good.

326
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:11,002
You'll end up serving time, thanks to your mom.

327
00:19:11,572 --> 00:19:14,272
You should cut ties with her before it's too late.

328
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,942
She's always going after my mom.

329
00:19:23,182 --> 00:19:24,752
I should cut ties with my mom?

330
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:28,652
Does she think my mom is behind the hit-and-run accident?

331
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,702
- Are you going to the hotel? - Yes.

332
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:43,702
I'll work with the chairwoman and Mr. Yoon today.

333
00:19:44,002 --> 00:19:45,202
You should join us later.

334
00:19:45,902 --> 00:19:46,972
I'll see.

335
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:50,471
Se Young thought she was safe from the embezzlement charges,

336
00:19:50,472 --> 00:19:52,282
so she looked devastated after seeing the article.

337
00:19:52,842 --> 00:19:55,412
She'll fall apart when she gets fired.

338
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:58,252
She made the wrong move when she framed the chairwoman.

339
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:03,792
She probably thought the chairwoman wouldn't wake up.

340
00:20:03,962 --> 00:20:06,191
Yes, that's the reasoning...

341
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:07,632
behind the home title and the trust fund.

342
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:11,402
- It all feels bitter. - Doesn't it?

343
00:20:13,162 --> 00:20:14,371
(Termination Notice)

344
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:15,472
I got a termination notice.

345
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:17,842
Did you know the article would be released?

346
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,871
That my aunt would come after me with the embezzlement?

347
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:22,912
I didn't. I was also surprised to see this happen...

348
00:20:23,742 --> 00:20:24,842
as soon as you said that.

349
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:26,482
Help me out.

350
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:29,181
All you have to do is say something.

351
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:31,352
It's all over the media, so it's too late for me to help.

352
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,452
If I turn a blind eye to such a huge crime,

353
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,622
it'll take a huge toll on the company's image.

354
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:39,762
Are you playing it safe just to keep your position?

355
00:20:39,992 --> 00:20:41,762
I would help if it only took me down.

356
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:43,932
The decision was made at the corporate level,

357
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:46,662
so it'd be impossible for me to turn it around.

358
00:20:47,702 --> 00:20:49,931
You'll abandon me now that you got a good use of me?

359
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,442
I helped you take this position, Ji Seok!

360
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:59,012
I do know a way that'll hurt you less.

361
00:20:59,982 --> 00:21:02,452
- What? - Expose your mom as the instigator.

362
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,592
- I can't do that. - She made you frame the chairwoman.

363
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:12,362
No, I told my mom that we should do that.

364
00:21:12,462 --> 00:21:13,792
Are you going to take the entire blame?

365
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:15,362
You might even get arrested.

366
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,532
I know your mom made you do this.

367
00:21:20,432 --> 00:21:22,232
If I say my mom made me do this,

368
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:24,942
will I be legally safe?

369
00:21:25,402 --> 00:21:27,242
I'll let you evade legal responsibility.

370
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:30,612
That's some help.

371
00:21:31,142 --> 00:21:33,182
Use this chance to leave your mother...

372
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:35,952
and live on your own.

373
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:38,552
Forget it.

374
00:21:39,622 --> 00:21:41,122
I'll just keep living this life.

375
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:44,421
What can I do without her?

376
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:45,562
Se Young.

377
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:48,392
Expose your mom and say she's behind this.

378
00:21:49,792 --> 00:21:51,332
That's the only way you'll live.

379
00:21:58,302 --> 00:22:00,242
Who would dare to fire my daughter?

380
00:22:00,772 --> 00:22:03,912
Take back that decision right now!

381
00:22:03,982 --> 00:22:06,212
The decision was already made under the chairman's approval.

382
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:08,482
It cannot be reversed.

383
00:22:09,582 --> 00:22:11,182
Is this Goo Ji Seok's order?

384
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:18,692
Where is he?

385
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:23,732
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

386
00:22:32,342 --> 00:22:34,642
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

387
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:42,312
Put everything down and take your seat.

388
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:44,852
Who would dare to mess with you?

389
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:50,352
That's enough. It's all your fault.

390
00:22:50,762 --> 00:22:52,562
What's my fault?

391
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:55,662
- Hello. - Hello.

392
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:56,832
Ms. Choi Myung Ji.

393
00:22:57,702 --> 00:23:01,332
You don't have time to stand here and worry about your daughter.

394
00:23:01,432 --> 00:23:02,672
I'm glad you're here.

395
00:23:03,702 --> 00:23:05,972
- How can you do this... - I heard you were behind this.

396
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:10,372
What?

397
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:12,912
You made your daughter embezzle money...

398
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:15,112
and frame Chairwoman Shin.

399
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:17,622
Ms. Yoon told me everything.

400
00:23:19,452 --> 00:23:20,552
What?

401
00:23:22,222 --> 00:23:24,792
Did you really rat me out?

402
00:23:24,962 --> 00:23:26,492
Then, did you think I'd take the blame alone?

403
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:29,262
It's true that you made me do this!

404
00:23:33,532 --> 00:23:35,331
Se Young!

405
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:39,202
You are stripped of all rights you had here at Hyesung Group.

406
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:41,412
Of course, you're banned from entering the office building.

407
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:45,482
We'll take legal action, so make sure you're prepared.

408
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,252
You. You!

409
00:23:56,192 --> 00:23:58,392
Ms. Yoon was fired.

410
00:23:59,362 --> 00:24:01,362
It's time for the police to move.

411
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,602
Let's turn in evidence to prove illegal moves Detective Cho made...

412
00:24:05,002 --> 00:24:07,362
to increase his assets and that he received bribes.

413
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:10,772
Yes, I'll also report the million dollars of embezzlement...

414
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:12,571
seemed to have gone to him.

415
00:24:12,572 --> 00:24:15,142
Detective Cho will reach out to Myung Ji,

416
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,782
so report his location to the police as soon as you find him.

417
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,542
Yes, and I'll stay nearby, too.

418
00:24:23,852 --> 00:24:26,281
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

419
00:24:26,282 --> 00:24:27,382
Come in.

420
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:30,892
- Can you spare some time? - Sure.

421
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:40,802
I didn't expect Se Young to hand over her mom so easily.

422
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:42,902
Did you convince her?

423
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:45,072
She made the choice herself.

424
00:24:46,242 --> 00:24:47,302
I didn't expect that.

425
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:50,842
She should also try living without her mom.

426
00:24:51,182 --> 00:24:52,742
Are you worried about her?

427
00:24:54,012 --> 00:24:56,382
Worried? Hardly. I have enough problems of my own.

428
00:25:01,152 --> 00:25:04,562
Have you not met with Mr. Yoon since that time?

429
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:06,022
No.

430
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:08,032
How do you feel?

431
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:10,392
I don't know.

432
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,402
When will you find out?

433
00:25:14,532 --> 00:25:15,702
I don't know that, either.

434
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,572
Call me anytime if you need me.

435
00:25:21,442 --> 00:25:22,542
Okay.

436
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,312
What about the driver? Still refusing to meet anyone?

437
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:30,812
Yes, Choi Myung Ji must be excellent at controlling people.

438
00:25:31,222 --> 00:25:32,282
He wouldn't even budge.

439
00:25:40,662 --> 00:25:42,232
How can you rat me out?

440
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:45,162
I was about to get arrested. What else could I do?

441
00:25:46,232 --> 00:25:48,571
I can't get another job because I was dismissed in disgrace.

442
00:25:48,572 --> 00:25:51,401
You ruined my life.

443
00:25:51,402 --> 00:25:54,042
Why would you get a job? Just get married.

444
00:25:54,172 --> 00:25:56,212
That's not marriage. You want me to sell me off.

445
00:25:57,342 --> 00:25:59,812
And it's all for your own good.

446
00:26:00,842 --> 00:26:04,422
How can you not even apologize after betraying me?

447
00:26:04,552 --> 00:26:06,022
You're why I embezzled money.

448
00:26:06,622 --> 00:26:08,752
Do you want me to end up behind bars?

449
00:26:10,822 --> 00:26:12,092
You wouldn't want that.

450
00:26:12,562 --> 00:26:14,292
It'd be harder for you to sell me off.

451
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:16,761
- Will you really... - Stop using me as an excuse...

452
00:26:16,762 --> 00:26:18,361
to do all these things you enjoy doing!

453
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:21,202
Just leave me alone.

454
00:26:38,282 --> 00:26:41,722
Se Young, what happened to your life?

455
00:26:42,792 --> 00:26:46,022
I want to run away to a place where no one knows me.

456
00:26:46,822 --> 00:26:49,292
Ji Seok is just awful, and I dread my mom, too.

457
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:52,602
Is marriage my only way out?

458
00:27:05,712 --> 00:27:07,982
So, this is how she'll attack me.

459
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:13,782
I'll only be put on probation if I pay back the million dollars.

460
00:27:21,992 --> 00:27:24,032
- Hello? - How do you feel?

461
00:27:24,402 --> 00:27:25,502
Awful.

462
00:27:26,462 --> 00:27:29,272
What about you? Do you feel great?

463
00:27:30,102 --> 00:27:31,842
Your daughter only got fired,

464
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,672
but my daughter died in your hands.

465
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:37,542
You'll never catch me.

466
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:39,982
There's no evidence.

467
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:42,682
That's why I'm still putting up with your nonsense.

468
00:27:43,712 --> 00:27:45,252
I'll find the evidence soon.

469
00:27:46,722 --> 00:27:48,352
Enjoy your time until then.

470
00:27:48,892 --> 00:27:51,022
You'll never find the evidence.

471
00:27:57,262 --> 00:27:59,362
The police began an internal investigation?

472
00:27:59,832 --> 00:28:02,432
It's for increasing assets illegally and receiving bribes.

473
00:28:02,732 --> 00:28:05,241
Also, they said the million dollars your daughter embezzled...

474
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:06,571
apparently ended up in my account.

475
00:28:06,572 --> 00:28:08,772
That's crazy. What happened?

476
00:28:09,042 --> 00:28:11,642
No idea. But we should talk in person.

477
00:28:11,842 --> 00:28:13,211
Can you meet me?

478
00:28:13,212 --> 00:28:14,752
The hit-and-run case was closed,

479
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:16,852
so I should get moving.

480
00:28:17,282 --> 00:28:19,622
All right. I'll meet you there.

481
00:28:22,852 --> 00:28:25,992
That's odd. There's no way anyone would find out.

482
00:28:26,722 --> 00:28:28,632
Have you located Detective Cho?

483
00:28:28,762 --> 00:28:31,702
Yes, he must've turned his phone on because of his investigation.

484
00:28:32,132 --> 00:28:33,702
He'll try to meet Myung Ji.

485
00:28:33,862 --> 00:28:36,932
Jin Goo and I will leave now and go to where the detective is.

486
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:39,302
It was Yeo Jin.

487
00:28:41,842 --> 00:28:43,942
There were no bank transactions.

488
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:46,011
Did you make any mistakes?

489
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:49,052
I sent the money you gave me to New Zealand.

490
00:28:49,252 --> 00:28:51,552
Are they suspicious because the dates overlap?

491
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:55,452
Why are they making us scared over such a petty deal?

492
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:57,592
I live in a penthouse, drive a foreign car,

493
00:28:58,362 --> 00:29:01,331
and even send my kid abroad to study with a detective's paycheck,

494
00:29:01,332 --> 00:29:02,932
so I can't deny this.

495
00:29:05,032 --> 00:29:08,131
Keep our relationship quiet until the very end.

496
00:29:08,132 --> 00:29:10,502
Of course. Otherwise, we'll both go down.

497
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:14,002
What about the driver? Is everything okay there?

498
00:29:14,272 --> 00:29:17,572
Yes, but the two persistently come to visit him.

499
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,182
Have another talk with him.

500
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:24,822
I'll leave first. You can take your time.

501
00:29:25,922 --> 00:29:27,182
Make sure you aren't tailed.

502
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:50,412
Wait, aren't you Detective Cho?

503
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:58,952
- Who are you? - We met at the casino in Gangwon.

504
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:01,652
Wait a moment. Here's my business card.

505
00:30:08,032 --> 00:30:09,392
Detective Cho?

506
00:30:15,902 --> 00:30:16,972
What's going on?

507
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:24,142
Hey, let go of me. Let go.

508
00:30:24,582 --> 00:30:25,642
- Let go! - Darn it!

509
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:40,092
What is this? Darn it.

510
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:43,562
Let go of me.

511
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:46,432
I'm a detective.

512
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,972
Who are you two?

513
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:00,481
The police will be here soon.

514
00:31:00,482 --> 00:31:02,351
You have the right to consult an attorney.

515
00:31:02,352 --> 00:31:05,382
Are you two detectives?

516
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:09,122
- No. We're... - No. We're...

517
00:31:09,852 --> 00:31:11,121
- law-abiding citizens. - law-abiding citizens.

518
00:31:11,122 --> 00:31:12,322
Darn it.

519
00:32:11,152 --> 00:32:13,251
(Cinderella Game)

520
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:14,551
Even if you hold out,

521
00:32:14,552 --> 00:32:16,791
it'll be the end of you as soon as Detective Cho talks.

522
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,062
Should I hire someone to kill the driver?

523
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:20,392
I'm going to get married.

524
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:22,462
How is marrying this easy?

525
00:32:22,762 --> 00:32:24,562
- Don't do it. - It's already too late.

526
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:26,432
I'll live a good life as if I'm rubbing it in your face.

527
00:32:26,662 --> 00:32:28,802
The couple went to see him together?

528
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:29,972
Please help us.

529
00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:31,441
Bring my daughter back.

530
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:33,501
Who do you think you people are to do that to her?

531
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:35,712
Did Detective Cho spill everything?

532
00:32:35,812 --> 00:32:39,982
Myung Ji, your fall and destruction will begin now.
