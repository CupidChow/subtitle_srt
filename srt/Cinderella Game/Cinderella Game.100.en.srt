1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,580
(Episode 100)

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,050
Why are you giving it back?

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,620
Why would you make me do
something this important?

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,760
You should give it
to the chairwoman yourself.

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,060
Me?

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,400
It took a lot of courage from you.

10
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,760
I think it's more proper
for you to finish this.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,370
The chairwoman will be happy, too.

12
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:33,670
If it's too hard to do alone,

13
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,540
I'll go with you.

14
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,580
A copy of the notebook?

15
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,820
Yes, I have it here.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,160
Yes.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,690
This is it.

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,930
Where did you get this?

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,170
I made a copy
when I brought the notebook...

20
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,670
from the safe.

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,000
You did?

22
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,370
Great job.

23
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,810
My mom and I will...

24
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,210
leave for America tomorrow.

25
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,440
Our flight is at 11 a.m.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,380
Tomorrow?

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,550
Don't you think we'll be tailed?

28
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,990
Even if we are,
they can't hold us down.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,590
But just in case,

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,790
I'll go downstairs
and grab a cab first.

31
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:26,860
Come down when I call you.

32
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,960
Okay.

33
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,500
- Mom.
- Yes?

34
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,270
Let's not sin anymore.

35
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,100
Let's atone for everything we did...

36
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,210
to this day.

37
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:44,280
I just want to live
an ordinary life.

38
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,880
Why are you talking like
a weakling again?

39
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,410
We aren't like ordinary people.

40
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,720
I'll go.

41
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,160
Okay.

42
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,830
Did I leave anything out?

43
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,440
Why isn't she calling me?

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,410
Is it hard to find a taxi?

45
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,550
- The person you have reached is...
- What? Why is she not picking up?

46
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,250
Gosh.

47
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,690
What do you want?

48
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:32,820
How dare you run away?

49
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,260
Why do you care where I go?

50
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,790
Leave.

51
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,400
I came to offer one last chance.

52
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,700
Chance?

53
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,570
What chance?

54
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,670
A chance for you to confess.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,070
Goodness. Why are you and Sung Ho
taking turns to ask me that?

56
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,280
I can only confess
to whatever I did wrong.

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,180
There's no evidence.
Why are you telling me to confess?

58
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,450
What do you mean
there's no evidence?

59
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,720
Because you burnt that notebook?

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,520
There was no notebook.

61
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,520
But look.

62
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,290
Gosh.

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,460
(Cho Byung Jin: October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

64
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,630
This is...

65
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,330
It's a copy of that notebook.

66
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,100
- A copy?
- Yes.

67
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:23,610
It'll frighten you
more than the original.

68
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,340
Do you expect me to believe
this fake document?

69
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,380
Ms. Choi Myung Ji.

70
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,580
What? What do you want?

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,720
- Move aside!
- You're under arrest...

72
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,390
without a warrant for instigation
of murder by accident.

73
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,220
No.

74
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,590
I didn't do it!

75
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,560
I didn't do it!

76
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,460
Let go of me. Let go!

77
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,660
Everything was fabricated
and forged!

78
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,700
You should've confessed
when you had a chance.

79
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,070
You refused to take it.

80
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,370
No, it's not true! Let go of me!

81
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,640
Goodbye, Myung Ji.

82
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,180
Let go of me!
Let go! I didn't do it!

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,580
Let go of me!

84
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,890
How did it go?

85
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,220
Did they arrest Choi Myung Ji?

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,590
Yes.

87
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,030
Congratulations, Ms. Chairwoman.

88
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,700
Thank you.

89
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,260
It's thanks to everyone's help.

90
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,900
It took 20 years
to bring justice for Yu Jin.

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,470
That notebook is the evidence,

92
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,070
so she won't escape this time.

93
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,170
No, the hard evidence is solid.

94
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,780
It'll be tough for her to get out.

95
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,310
Did you see Se Young there?

96
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,850
No, Myung Ji was there alone.

97
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,690
Why are you giving this to me?

98
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,260
I wanted to apologize...

99
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,300
for the sin my mom and I committed.

100
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,600
I also wanted my mom
to stop sinning...

101
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,440
and pay for everything she had done.

102
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,610
Ask Se Young
to visit me at home sometime.

103
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,780
Please do that.

104
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,310
- Okay.
- Okay.

105
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:10,920
This is a copy
of your notebook, Ms. Choi.

106
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,500
These were fabricated.

107
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,530
They were forged and faked!

108
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,900
Where's the original, then?

109
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,230
Let's compare them.

110
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,570
Where did you get this?

111
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,170
Do you have evidence I wrote this?

112
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,810
We conducted a handwriting analysis,

113
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,340
and the result clearly said
it was your writing.

114
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,580
We also have some testimonies...

115
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,750
that the original is
the same as this copy.

116
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,780
Your accomplices in this notebook,
both Detective Cho Byung Jin...

117
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,820
and the hit-and-run driver,
also admitted to everything.

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,720
Detective Cho.

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,130
The source of this copy is
also highly trustworthy.

120
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,600
Ms. Choi Myung Ji.

121
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,300
You're a flight risk
who'll try to destroy more evidence,

122
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,870
so you'll be taken into custody.

123
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,640
So, you should cooperate
with the investigation.

124
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,870
My daughter.
I want to talk to my daughter.

125
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,680
Call her here!

126
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,350
I got my mom arrested...

127
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,750
with my own two hands,

128
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,820
although she was my mom.

129
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,930
You've done well.

130
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,400
You can break away from her now...

131
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,630
and live freely.

132
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,430
Break away from her?

133
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,870
But I don't feel any lighter.

134
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,170
After some time,

135
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,940
you'll realize
you made the right choice.

136
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,980
You tried your best
not to take after her.

137
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,280
That's more than enough.

138
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,080
I decided who I wanted to be...

139
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,950
for the first time,

140
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,890
and that decision was
abandoning my mom.

141
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,630
You chose to protect yourself.

142
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,460
You had to do this,
and it was the right decision.

143
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,600
No one can criticize you,

144
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,000
not even your mother.

145
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,250
You're going to face
many confusing and hard days.

146
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,410
It probably hasn't hit you yet.

147
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,150
But still, hang in there.

148
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,690
I chose to do this,

149
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,390
so I should do that.

150
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,160
It's Ha Na.

151
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,230
You should answer it.

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,510
Hello?

153
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,580
This must be hard for you.

154
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,220
Have you met your mom?

155
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,050
Not yet.

156
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,160
Does she not know
you handed over the copy?

157
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,620
No, she probably doesn't.

158
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,930
How did you come up with that idea?

159
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,260
At first,
I didn't think much about it.

160
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,200
When I looked at the notebook,

161
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
it felt like I opened Pandora's box.

162
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,370
Then, frightening truth
began to spill out,

163
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,380
so I wasn't in my right mind.

164
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,610
I felt like...

165
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,150
I witnessed who my mom really was
in that notebook.

166
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:38,420
I realized I never knew who she was.

167
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,090
I had a shocking
yet belated revelation...

168
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,900
that I had ignored the truth.

169
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,600
I didn't know what to do.

170
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,100
Could I truly flee
even if I backed away from the truth?

171
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,870
I had that kind of fear.

172
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,440
If my mom became a monster...

173
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,310
because of the lie I told
on that day,

174
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,120
then I thought
it was my punishment...

175
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,990
to stop her myself.

176
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,430
You've done well.

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
The chairwoman asked
to visit her at home.

178
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,570
You should go when you have time.

179
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,540
She's probably waiting for you.

180
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,480
Mom, did you pick all these?

181
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,550
I'll make mugwort rice cake.

182
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,450
That sounds delicious.

183
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:42,350
This time, will Myung Ji...

184
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,820
really stay arrested?

185
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,730
Yes, she'll stay in custody
throughout the trial.

186
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,190
That girl was born
under an unlucky star.

187
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,270
She was always sly
and a bit of a trickster,

188
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,000
but she was never that evil.

189
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,770
How did she end up like that?

190
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,200
Her greed caused this disaster.

191
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,740
We should all be content
with what we have.

192
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,040
You're right.

193
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,140
She would've been happy
even if she wasn't so greedy.

194
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,810
The chairwoman
finally would've vented...

195
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,720
the sorrow she had in her
for the last 20 years,

196
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,650
and her husband returned, too.

197
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,490
I'm worried about Se Young.

198
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,890
She has never been separated
from her mother.

199
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,260
She should've cut
that umbilical cord ages ago.

200
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,360
The fastest way
to ruin a child's life is...

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
to keep them sheltered
until they turn 30.

202
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,570
You're right.

203
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,010
Get up, Se Young.

204
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,880
Se Young.

205
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,390
Let's go shopping.

206
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,120
Let me get you some pretty clothes,

207
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,860
and you can get your hair done, too.

208
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,400
Mom.

209
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,000
Mom?

210
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,440
Mom.

211
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
The guard said...

212
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:38,170
- what she did was unbelievable.
- Why?

213
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:41,070
Murder instigation,
attempted murder,

214
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,870
child abuse,
fraud, and embezzlement.

215
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,580
I can't even say it in one breath.

216
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,580
So, why does she seem so haughty?

217
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,120
Does she still think
she's out in the real world?

218
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,550
All of you are
nothing but petty thieves.

219
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,320
Do you think
I'm the same as all of you?

220
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,360
My daughter will form
the best defense counsel...

221
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,030
and get me out right away.

222
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,130
If you get it, you may grovel.

223
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,400
We may grovel if we get it?

224
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,940
You don't understand
what's going on, do you?

225
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,640
We need to give you
the good old hazing ritual.

226
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,940
Hey, what are you waiting for?

227
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,010
Get her.

228
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,550
Hey! What are you doing?

229
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,920
Hey, you!

230
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,020
Darn it. Take this!

231
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:31,590
Hey, don't get smart with me.

232
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,660
- You think you can mess with me?
- Stop what you're doing!

233
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,300
Inmate number 1818, Choi Myung Ji.
You have a visitor.

234
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,430
It's my daughter.
My daughter is here.

235
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,680
I thought you'd be Se Young.

236
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,350
How much did you spend
to have me detained?

237
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,390
You still haven't come
to your senses.

238
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,590
This is...

239
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:09,990
so unfair to me.

240
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,570
I'm sure you aren't here
because you missed me.

241
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
What do you want?

242
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,370
I wanted to see you
locked up behind bars.

243
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,210
Did Se Young visit?

244
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,280
Sure.

245
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:28,010
She comes every single day.

246
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,910
So, she hasn't visited.

247
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,750
Well, she'd rather cut ties with you
than have someone like you...

248
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,450
as a mother.

249
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,990
Did you tell her
to cut ties with me?

250
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:43,590
Why? Did she mention that?

251
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,930
That's just nonsense.

252
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
She hasn't come yet...

253
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,170
because she was busy hiring...

254
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,940
the best attorneys out there
for my defense counsel.

255
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,850
No one else can testify
that those are...

256
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,380
actual copies of my notebook
other than you.

257
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,650
So,

258
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,560
I'll be freed soon
for lack of evidence.

259
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,190
You aren't showing any remorse.

260
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:20,660
You'll be a sinner
to both Yu Jin and Se Young...

261
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,530
for the rest of your life.

262
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,970
Rot in prison until you die,

263
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,300
reflecting on everything you did.

264
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,310
How ridiculous.

265
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
I'll be out of here
as soon as Se Young comes...

266
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,680
with my defense counsel.

267
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,590
Once I get out,

268
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,320
I'll pay you back many times more
for this humiliation.

269
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,790
So, just wait.

270
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,310
Myung Ji was
not short of my expectations.

271
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,580
Her feisty spirit won't last long.

272
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,650
She'll have to accept
the reality soon.

273
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,120
It looks like
Se Young hasn't visited.

274
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,550
Really?

275
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,220
I hope she reaches out to us...

276
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,690
and tells us how she's doing.

277
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,090
She must feel ill at ease, too.

278
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:22,960
I'm sure.

279
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,860
You should get some rest. I'll go.

280
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:28,570
You can stop staying at a hotel.
Come home.

281
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,840
Come home.

282
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,210
How can I return home?

283
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,440
I don't deserve to do that.

284
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:42,610
I'll give you the right to return.

285
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,720
Eun Chong is here with us,
so come back home.

286
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,390
You haven't been a husband
for the last 20 years,

287
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,220
so you need to start doing that.

288
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,020
May I really?

289
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,560
It's your last chance,
so you better do well.

290
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,460
Thank you, Yeo Jin.

291
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,010
Grandma!

292
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,810
- We're back.
- Come on in.

293
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,580
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

294
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,910
I heard you two set the date.

295
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,080
Congratulations.

296
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

297
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,920
Thank you.

298
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,250
You're also happy, Eun Chong.

299
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,320
Yes.

300
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,490
After you two marry,

301
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,320
why don't you adopt Eun Chong?

302
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,430
Yes, we'd love to.

303
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,500
Eun Chong, do you want to be my son?

304
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,130
Yes!

305
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,370
I've been meaning to tell you.

306
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,840
I want to pay for your wedding.

307
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,240
Goodness, no, Ms. Chairwoman.

308
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,880
We're going to hold
a simple wedding.

309
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,280
I don't care how you do it,
but I want to fund it.

310
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,550
I just want to.

311
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,050
I think you two deserve that.

312
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,650
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

313
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,460
We can browse
for the wedding present together.

314
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,130
Okay.

315
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,330
Ms. Chairwoman.

316
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,730
I have great news.

317
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
What is it?

318
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,570
One of the people
who caused the accident...

319
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,970
for Ms. Goo's parents
has been caught.

320
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,640
Is that so?

321
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:23,280
Did you withdraw everything
Choi Myung Ji had...

322
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,450
- in her slush fund?
- Yes.

323
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,250
She'll be deeply shocked to see...

324
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,250
ten million dollars
turned into zero.

325
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,820
What will you do with it?

326
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,690
Mr. Yoon said
he'd follow your decision.

327
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,670
Mom.

328
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,810
Even now,

329
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,280
I want to believe that you loved me.

330
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,110
That you had...

331
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
no other choice but to do that.

332
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,820
But in reality,

333
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,390
it wasn't your love for me.

334
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,490
You had kept me locked up...

335
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,400
to protect yourself.

336
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,970
This ten-year-old girl...

337
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,570
didn't know that.

338
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,580
Se Young, what took you so long?

339
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,880
I thought you went to America alone.

340
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,550
I'm sorry I came so late.

341
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,860
What are you wearing?

342
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,060
And you aren't wearing makeup.

343
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,330
Were you at a funeral or something?

344
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:48,170
Se Young, get me out of here
as soon as possible.

345
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,730
I need more attorneys.

346
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:56,340
I'll tell you
what my slush fund account is.

347
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,710
- Get money from there and hire...
- Mom.

348
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,510
I'll be out there soon.

349
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,480
So, don't worry.

350
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,680
Also,

351
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,190
find out how they got
the copy of my notebook.

352
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,560
I need to find out
who did that and...

353
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,720
I did it.

354
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,000
- What?
- I copied the notebook...

355
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,970
and gave it to Aunt Yeo Jin.

356
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,940
What are you talking about?

357
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:30,740
Why would you do
something like that?

358
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,980
I wanted you...

359
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,480
to get punished.

360
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,950
Are...

361
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,490
Are you serious?

362
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,890
Did you really...

363
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,120
do this?

364
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,860
Yes.

365
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,260
How...

366
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,260
How can you do this?

367
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,230
You just...

368
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,100
sold me off!

369
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,710
That's what you did to me.

370
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,680
You took advantage of me,
deceived me,

371
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,510
- hid things, and framed me...
- Shut your mouth!

372
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm done.

373
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,890
I'm done living...

374
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,620
as your daughter.

375
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,990
You're done living as my daughter?

376
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,760
You can't just declare that.

377
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,490
That's impossible!

378
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,900
If I say I'm done, that's that.

379
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,100
Why are you saying this?

380
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,070
You'll be punished by fate
if you abandon me!

381
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,700
I'm already getting punished.

382
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,210
What happened to you?

383
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,740
Who did this to you?

384
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,910
Was it Shin Yeo Jin?

385
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,380
Or the Goo siblings?

386
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,150
You did this to me.

387
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,680
Today,

388
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,090
I came to see you one last time.

389
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,390
What?

390
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,160
From now on,
I won't live as your daughter.

391
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,690
I'll live as Yoon Se Young.

392
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:00,060
No. Do you...

393
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,970
Do you think
you can live without me?

394
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:07,340
You could never do anything alone
since when you were young.

395
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,940
If I go down,

396
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,480
you'll go down with me.

397
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,540
Bye.

398
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,710
No, Se Young!

399
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,450
Se Young, you can't do this.
Come back.

400
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,690
Come back to me.

401
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,620
Don't leave me.

402
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,290
Why do you think
I ended up like this?

403
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:31,260
It's because of you.

404
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,530
I did everything for you.

405
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,330
It was all for you.

406
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,480
Se Young. Se Young!

407
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,880
Se Young.

408
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,480
No, Se Young.

409
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,350
No!

410
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,560
How...

411
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
How can my daughter betray me?

412
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,600
I gave birth to you and made you.

413
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,280
You were my past,
present, and future.

414
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,610
You should be
getting me out of here.

415
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,820
How can you betray me?

416
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,820
How?

417
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,560
I'll get out.

418
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,090
I'll get out and kill all of them.

419
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,600
Guard! Get me an attorney!

420
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:43,100
Guard!

421
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,800
Then, will the real culprit
of our parents' accident...

422
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,840
get caught?

423
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,010
It'll happen...

424
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,280
with the evidence I have
and the culprit's confession.

425
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,880
Is there anything we can do to help?

426
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,550
No.

427
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,510
Gosh, I wanted to see
that jerk's face.

428
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,550
Yes, we need to find out
what our enemy looks like.

429
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,690
Let's go to the trial together.

430
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:04,860
That sounds great.

431
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,060
My gosh.

432
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,500
I hope he confesses
before your wedding.

433
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,030
We'll make it happen.

434
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,630
Right. While we're on the subject,

435
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,270
let me make
your wedding dress, Ha Na.

436
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,610
- Really?
- Yes.

437
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,140
That'll save me money.

438
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,470
Thanks.

439
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,710
I also have news
as a wedding present.

440
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:31,380
Well, I was going to share it later.

441
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,450
What is it? Tell me now.

442
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,920
Actually, I will...

443
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,050
open up my second snack bar.

444
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
Really?

445
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,930
It hasn't been long since you opened
the first one. The second one?

446
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,400
That's amazing. Congratulations.

447
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,300
Hey, you won't be
just a famous local snack bar.

448
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,700
You'll go global in no time.

449
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,970
Congratulations.

450
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,370
Don't you think I'm great?

451
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,710
I think I deserve some pats.

452
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,680
Great job, my brother.

453
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,580
What about you?
Do you have any news?

454
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,150
Don't you have to go back
to the snack bar?

455
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,190
Yes, right. The break time is over.

456
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,290
Hey, come quickly.

457
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,590
I'm coming.

458
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,190
- Hey, grab that. The second store.
- What? Okay. Darn it.

459
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,460
- Goodness.
- I'm coming, CEO with two stores!

460
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,530
We can finally have some peace.

461
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,500
That reminds me of the old days.

462
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,770
Yes.

463
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,440
What brings you here?

464
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,540
Right.

465
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,210
It's for Jin Goo.

466
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,950
What is this?

467
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,750
A watch?

468
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,460
I heard parents were supposed
to get a watch for their son-in-law.

469
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,090
Let me do that instead.

470
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,700
How did you know that?

471
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,070
I have to call him
my brother-in-law?

472
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,570
Gosh. You can take your time.

473
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:01,810
Anyway, this looks expensive.

474
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,580
You can use this for your wedding.

475
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:11,980
You don't have to give me money.

476
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,250
We're going to have a small wedding.

477
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,790
And the chairwoman...

478
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,190
offered to fund our wedding.

479
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,660
Then, use it
for your honeymoon trip.

480
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,860
Take it.

481
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,840
Are you doing this
in our parents' place?

482
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,750
You've done well, Ha Na.

483
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,180
You had to raise...

484
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,760
all three of us at such a young age.

485
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,330
I didn't raise you guys.

486
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,160
You all raised yourselves.

487
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,230
Thank you for growing up
into a great person.

488
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,590
(The Most Outstanding
Franchise Operator Award)

489
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,090
Thank you.

490
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,090
Thank you.

491
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,840
(The Most Outstanding
Franchise Operator Award)

492
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,710
Congratulations, Mom.

493
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,680
Mother, you're so awesome.

494
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,740
You're the best!

495
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:49,910
Thank you.

496
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:53,350
I must've had a knack
for running a business.

497
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,120
Until you open the second store,
let's go!

498
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,390
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

499
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,490
Let's go!

500
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,990
Let's go!

501
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,330
- These look beautiful.
- Congratulations.

502
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:03,430
Thank you.

503
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,800
There's no evidence
that I tried to kill someone,

504
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,700
and the evidence
of my murder instigation is a copy.

505
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,930
Get me out of here now.

506
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,400
The evidence was copied,

507
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,500
but the circumstances
and testimonies all aligned.

508
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,840
The situation is
disadvantageous for us.

509
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:19,910
Are you saying
I have no way of leaving?

510
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,980
I'll find a way
if you pay my fees...

511
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,810
for covering your case thus far.

512
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,850
Give me the laptop.

513
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,460
(Account balance: 0 dollars)

514
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,130
What is this? What's going on?

515
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,240
What is this?

516
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,910
How did my ten million dollars...

517
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,110
turn into zero?

518
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,180
Who did this?

519
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,880
Who took my money?

520
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,890
It must've been you, Yeo Jin.

521
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,500
What's wrong, honey?

522
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,440
This is awful.

523
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,670
Who sent you this?

524
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,440
It must be Myung Ji.

525
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,510
She couldn't have sent this
from the detention center.

526
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,310
Did she pay someone
to do something like this?

527
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:39,720
(You will be cursed
for abandoning your mother.)

528
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,070
Ha Na and Mr. Hwang are
getting married?

529
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,040
- Yes.
- Come on, that's impossible.

530
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,340
It hasn't been long
since he called off

531
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,440
his marriage with Ms. Yoon.

532
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,880
Some people are
meant to be together.

533
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,610
- Hello.
- Goodness.

534
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

535
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:04,710
Hello.

536
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,820
Good morning.

537
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,420
Ha Na, congratulations on returning.

538
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,820
Anyway, is it true
that you two are...

539
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,890
getting married?

540
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:15,560
The word got around already?

541
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,330
Actually, we brought
the wedding invitations.

542
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,000
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,270
- Thank you.
- Wait.

544
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,700
This time, are we going to see the groom
walking down the aisle?

545
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
Come on, Mr. Yoon.

546
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,670
You have to forget that now.

547
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:32,340
I'll make sure he walks in,
so don't worry about him.

548
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,710
I have to be at a meeting
with the chairman.

549
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,020
Hey.

550
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,650
Mr. Hwang. Are you running away?

551
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,950
- He ran away.
- He ran off so quickly.

552
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,890
The mother-daughter therapy tour
was a big hit.

553
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:49,060
It ranked...

554
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,760
first place in the customer survey
for hotel excursions.

555
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,700
It's all thanks
to my team's hard work.

556
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:59,140
As you promised,
please bring Hyesung Tour back.

557
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,270
I should keep my promise.

558
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,840
Nice watch.

559
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,210
It's because the model looks nice.

560
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,580
We got the wedding invitation.

561
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,630
(You are invited to Hwang Jin Goo
and Goo Ha Na's wedding.)

562
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,130
Congratulations.

563
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,500
Thank you.

564
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,900
Although I knew
we were bound by a complicated fate,

565
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,100
I never expected us
to become family.

566
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,670
Right?

567
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:34,100
How's Se Young?

568
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,740
She's learning to live alone.

569
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,070
She must be going through
trials and errors.

570
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,240
Yes. I'll see her later today.

571
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,750
I'm glad you're there for her.

572
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,210
(Yoon Se Young)

573
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,910
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

574
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,880
Please check the number and...

575
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,480
The number doesn't exist?

576
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,720
Se Young.

577
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,360
Se Young?

578
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,140
We'll need...

579
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,740
at least 3 bedrooms
and 2 bathrooms for 4 people.

580
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,850
Can we just move into your place?

581
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,950
We don't have enough rooms.

582
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,580
We can share one,

583
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,290
and Mother and Eun Chong
can share one.

584
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:57,650
I feel too bad
for my mom and Eun Chong.

585
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,790
I think they'll be happy.

586
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,390
Also, I hear you have to live
in a small place...

587
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,960
to make up quickly after a fight.

588
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,530
That's true.

589
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,500
We can't leave any place to hide.

590
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,970
Hey, it's Ji Seok.

591
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,800
Hey, Ji Seok.

592
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:17,710
Ha Na, Se Young is gone.

593
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,780
What?

594
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,880
Se Young is gone?

595
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,500
(Cinderella Game)

596
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,400
I'll turn everything back.

597
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,470
I'll get you back...

598
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,970
and take Eun Chong away, too.

599
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,870
Do you think Eun Chong will be okay?

600
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,810
Can you find Se Young?

601
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,810
Their wedding is my D-day.

602
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,280
Just wait.

603
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,720
Inmate 1818! Stop right there!

604
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,280
Where's Eun Chong?

605
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,950
What if he was kidnapped?

606
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,190
Eun Chong!

607
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,520
Eun Chong.

608
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,690
Eun Chong!
