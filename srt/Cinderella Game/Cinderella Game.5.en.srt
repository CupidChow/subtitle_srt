00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:42,525
(Episode 5)

2
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:12,525
- Stop hitting me! - Have you brought water?

3
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:14,896
What about your son?

4
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:17,336
Ji Seok, let's call Ha Na.

5
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:20,464
Let's wait just a little more.

6
00:01:20,465 --> 00:01:22,935
She can't pick up her phone when she's playing the piano, dummy.

7
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,605
I'm not a dummy.

8
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:27,146
- You're ugly. - What?

9
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:29,545
I'm calling her.

10
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:33,946
Hey, it's Mommy.

11
00:01:35,045 --> 00:01:36,085
Hello?

12
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:39,056
- I'm going to pick it up! - Go away.

13
00:01:39,256 --> 00:01:40,556
Ji Eun, do you want me to get angry?

14
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:43,295
Come here, Ji Chang. Hey.

15
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:45,525
Yes, they're my mom and dad.

16
00:01:46,325 --> 00:01:47,465
"An accident?"

17
00:01:48,125 --> 00:01:50,566
Mommy...

18
00:01:51,566 --> 00:01:52,696
Hello?

19
00:01:54,765 --> 00:01:55,765
(The 35th Yeohwa University Piano Competition)

20
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:59,806
And now, only the gold and the grand prize remain.

21
00:02:00,375 --> 00:02:04,715
Who will receive the honor of the gold and the grand prize?

22
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:06,546
I'm looking forward to finding out.

23
00:02:06,745 --> 00:02:10,855
And now, allow me to announce the winner of the grand prize.

24
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:12,214
(The 35th Yeohwa University Piano Competition...)

25
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,586
(for High School Students)

26
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:16,956
The grand prize...

27
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:19,595
goes to...

28
00:02:20,896 --> 00:02:23,195
Hello? Hey, Ji Seok.

29
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:26,095
Goo Ha Na from Hanyoung Girls' High School.

30
00:02:27,465 --> 00:02:31,176
- What? - Ms. Goo, come up to the stage.

31
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:35,676
Ms. Goo, the winner of the grand prize.

32
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,275
Please come up to the stage.

33
00:02:40,386 --> 00:02:41,546
He was speeding?

34
00:02:42,345 --> 00:02:45,015
My father never speeds. He never does that...

35
00:02:45,016 --> 00:02:47,154
Your father's car took a sharp turn...

36
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:49,426
and almost put the other car in grave danger as well.

37
00:02:49,796 --> 00:02:52,225
It's a relief that the accident didn't lead to something worse.

38
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:03,736
Ji Seok.

39
00:03:04,076 --> 00:03:05,236
Ha Na.

40
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:09,345
The police said our mommy and daddy died.

41
00:03:10,076 --> 00:03:11,374
No, right?

42
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,916
They didn't die, did they?

43
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:15,516
Right?

44
00:03:15,616 --> 00:03:18,155
Mommy...

45
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:21,056
- Mommy... - What is he saying?

46
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:23,796
- Why did Mom and Dad... - Mommy...

47
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,356
Where are they?

48
00:03:26,995 --> 00:03:29,766
Mommy...

49
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:30,995
What's wrong?

50
00:03:31,396 --> 00:03:33,806
- Where are Mom and Dad? - Mommy...

51
00:03:37,035 --> 00:03:39,336
Mommy...

52
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,306
Ji Seok.

53
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,546
Ha Na...

54
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:51,886
- Ji Seok... - Mommy...

55
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:55,285
- Mom... - Mommy...

56
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:03,935
(Chapel of Rest)

57
00:04:33,495 --> 00:04:35,395
Ji Eun, are you sleepy? Do you want to sleep?

58
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:39,395
Ji Seok.

59
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,375
Have we become orphans?

60
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:46,346
I don't want to be an orphan.

61
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:50,645
I don't want to be an orphan.

62
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:12,966
No, get out of here!

63
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:14,966
Who do you think you are?

64
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:19,846
Get out of my place now. Get out!

65
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:23,314
Kid, if you take that off,

66
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,014
you'll have to pay a fine and get arrested.

67
00:05:25,015 --> 00:05:26,584
Why? It's ours.

68
00:05:26,585 --> 00:05:28,244
Your dad owes a lot of money,

69
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,815
so he has to sell his home and belongings to pay people back.

70
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:33,884
Nothing in here is yours, so you cannot touch them.

71
00:05:33,885 --> 00:05:36,825
It's ours. My mom and dad bought these!

72
00:05:41,366 --> 00:05:45,236
Mommy... Daddy...

73
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:49,335
Mommy...

74
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,445
Why are you crying?

75
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,345
- Who are you? - Hello.

76
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:58,046
We came from the bank for confiscation.

77
00:06:00,346 --> 00:06:01,986
Our family was ruined.

78
00:06:02,085 --> 00:06:03,455
It's all your fault.

79
00:06:03,786 --> 00:06:05,415
Mom and Dad wouldn't have been in that accident...

80
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,056
if you hadn't competed in that piano competition.

81
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,426
It's all your fault!

82
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,796
Bring Mom and Dad back!

83
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:14,195
Bring my mom and dad back!

84
00:06:17,096 --> 00:06:19,666
- Bring Mom and Dad back! - Mommy... Daddy...

85
00:06:19,806 --> 00:06:21,866
Bring them back!

86
00:06:30,616 --> 00:06:31,874
(Warning: The ownership of this building has been...)

87
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,416
(transferred to Hyesung Finance due to compulsory execution.)

88
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,056
Wait. Sir.

89
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:41,986
Please let us keep just our father's factory.

90
00:06:42,556 --> 00:06:44,425
This is his life's work.

91
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:47,096
Your father sold this factory off because of debt.

92
00:06:47,596 --> 00:06:50,096
Hyesung Finance took it over instead of money.

93
00:06:50,995 --> 00:06:52,736
Wait.

94
00:06:53,406 --> 00:06:54,935
I'll pay it back in the future.

95
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:56,934
Please, sir.

96
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,635
I'm not the one who can help you.

97
00:07:10,216 --> 00:07:14,255
Chairwoman Shin. Please hear me out.

98
00:07:14,486 --> 00:07:17,725
Chairwoman Shin! Please let me talk to you!

99
00:07:17,726 --> 00:07:21,064
- Please, Chairwoman Shin! - Stop it!

100
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:24,466
- Please listen! I'll repay you! - Get away!

101
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,606
Goodness.

102
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:38,416
Ms. Chairwoman.

103
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:42,315
- Begin the disposal. - Yes, ma'am.

104
00:08:20,286 --> 00:08:21,555
(Hyesung Finance)

105
00:08:21,556 --> 00:08:24,395
Next, Hwang Jin Goo. Congratulations.

106
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:26,895
(2011 Hyesung Finance Scholarship Presentation Ceremony)

107
00:08:26,896 --> 00:08:28,364
Yoon Se Young. Hwang Jin Goo.

108
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:30,865
- Congratulations. - These students...

109
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,864
have proven themselves to be excellent talents...

110
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,766
who will grow up to benefit our country.

111
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,575
Please return to your seats.

112
00:08:40,806 --> 00:08:45,276
Hyesung Finance Foundation's annual social contribution programs...

113
00:08:45,516 --> 00:08:49,646
include a wide variety of projects other than scholarships.

114
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,755
Among them, the media and the public are interested in...

115
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:55,926
Your aunt has her eyes on Jin Goo.

116
00:08:56,126 --> 00:08:58,454
I know she will give him a position at the company.

117
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,364
I don't care.

118
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,666
Stay alert.

119
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,536
- You might end up betrayed. - The founders of the business...

120
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,805
They're total strangers anyway.

121
00:09:06,806 --> 00:09:08,166
Her expectations couldn't be that high.

122
00:09:11,235 --> 00:09:15,506
It's uncomfortable to get involved with the Hwang family continuously.

123
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:33,056
Will Se Young study music at university?

124
00:09:34,065 --> 00:09:35,595
For your benefit?

125
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:42,806
She decided to study business management.

126
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,876
Se Young is Yeo Jin's only relative,

127
00:09:47,006 --> 00:09:49,604
so of course, she needs to help her business.

128
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:51,614
She can hire the most talented people...

129
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,515
with her money,

130
00:09:53,516 --> 00:09:55,386
but no one can compare to her relative.

131
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,256
What relative?

132
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,526
She's her brother-in-law's daughter, not her direct family.

133
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:05,526
A university in America invited Jin Goo,

134
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,995
but he decided to stay by the chairwoman's side.

135
00:10:08,996 --> 00:10:12,665
We're here by her side. Why would you worry?

136
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,136
He owed his life to her, and she helped him study, too.

137
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:19,036
She wouldn't do that even for her own.

138
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:21,506
How will I ever repay her?

139
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:25,276
Well, Jin Goo is...

140
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,485
as good as her son.

141
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:30,885
Do you really think so?

142
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:32,516
I'm just saying that's how we feel.

143
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:36,526
We think of her as our savior.

144
00:10:36,695 --> 00:10:40,266
I saw many who disappear quickly after acting up out of their places.

145
00:10:41,426 --> 00:10:45,065
Why do you say such rude things?

146
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:47,765
My family knows where our place is,

147
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,465
so you need to know where yours is.

148
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:55,075
Jin Goo will work hard on behalf of her daughter...

149
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:57,746
until the day she returns.

150
00:10:58,345 --> 00:11:01,115
That's how he can repay the chairwoman's kindness.

151
00:11:01,546 --> 00:11:02,614
Isn't that so?

152
00:11:02,615 --> 00:11:05,815
Sure, he's a perfect candidate to use and lose as a substitution.

153
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:09,985
When will her husband return?

154
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:13,666
What's wrong with you? This is my sister-in-law's privacy.

155
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,666
I just feel bad. That's all.

156
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:18,996
I just feel bad.

157
00:11:28,046 --> 00:11:30,176
I knew I was a good judge of people's character.

158
00:11:30,445 --> 00:11:32,574
I had a feeling Jin Goo would become a great talent,

159
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:33,585
and you exceeded my expectations.

160
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:34,944
I'm flattered.

161
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,715
And it's all thanks to your help, Chairwoman Shin.

162
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:40,325
Hyesung Finance will soon start a hotel and tourism business.

163
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:44,556
I hope you two will play crucial roles in turning Hyesung Group...

164
00:11:45,296 --> 00:11:47,495
into a global business.

165
00:11:47,496 --> 00:11:48,595
Can you do that?

166
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:51,666
Of course, I should help with whatever you do, Aunt Yeo Jin.

167
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:53,266
I'll do my best.

168
00:11:54,006 --> 00:11:58,376
You two need to help Yu Jin a lot when she returns.

169
00:12:00,575 --> 00:12:02,475
Of course. Don't worry.

170
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:06,886
I'll stick around next to Yu Jin and take care of her all the time.

171
00:12:07,046 --> 00:12:08,546
Don't worry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

172
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,155
You two have known each other for a long time,

173
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,926
so why haven't you two broken the ice?

174
00:12:14,685 --> 00:12:16,585
She's rather the cold type.

175
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,855
I guess she doesn't want to be a friend.

176
00:12:19,256 --> 00:12:20,396
What did I do?

177
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,666
Think however you like, but don't jump to a conclusion.

178
00:12:22,796 --> 00:12:24,594
So, you don't hate me?

179
00:12:24,595 --> 00:12:25,896
But I don't like you, either.

180
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:42,386
Why did you hit me?

181
00:12:43,085 --> 00:12:45,416
Why did you hit him while he was eating?

182
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,626
This is awful. I'm not eating this.

183
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,255
I'm sick of pickled veggies, spinach, and eggs.

184
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:50,854
It's awful.

185
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:53,296
I like everything you make, Ha Na.

186
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,796
I'll grill pork belly for you once I get paid.

187
00:12:58,296 --> 00:13:00,806
- Finish your meal. - I'm not eating this.

188
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:03,105
Look at this place.

189
00:13:03,235 --> 00:13:05,376
The smell of garlic is giving me a huge headache.

190
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:07,204
My clothes smell like it, too.

191
00:13:07,205 --> 00:13:09,776
Okay, don't eat, then. We'll get to save on rice.

192
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,376
- In Africa, there are children... - Hey.

193
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:16,614
What do their hunger and death have to do with me?

194
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:19,455
Why would I worry about strange kids in Africa in this situation?

195
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:22,955
- This is so annoying. - Hey, Ji Eun!

196
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:25,725
What's wrong?

197
00:13:26,455 --> 00:13:27,595
It's not a big deal.

198
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,996
Ji Seok, she just threw a fit about our food.

199
00:13:31,396 --> 00:13:33,535
She hit my head with a spoon,

200
00:13:33,536 --> 00:13:35,204
yelled at Ha Na,

201
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:37,335
and kicked the garlic cloves, too.

Do kids in Africa really starve to death?

- Eat your food. - Okay.

206
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:30,496
What's this rice?

207
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:34,225
That one? I'll mix it in soup later.

208
00:14:34,465 --> 00:14:36,194
It's already dry. Throw it out.

209
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,334
We don't need to do that. You should go wash up.

210

Enough is enough!

211

Please...

213
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:15,605
run away, Ha Na.

214
00:15:20,075 --> 00:15:21,276
Run away.

215
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:32,185
From now on,

216
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:34,285
only the three of us will live together.

00:15:34,286 --> 00:15:35,426
What about Ha Na?

218
00:15:35,756 --> 00:15:37,125
Is she going somewhere?

219
00:15:37,126 --> 00:15:39,025
We don't share the same mom and dad.

220
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:41,095
We have different moms and dads, but she's our sister.

221
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:43,996
Mom and Dad said we were all siblings.

222
00:15:44,565 --> 00:15:45,735
Right, Ji Seok?

223

225
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,746
Ha Na will have a hard time if she lives with us.

226
00:15:54,246 --> 00:15:56,276
She had to quit school and go out and work hard...

227
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:57,974
to make money.

228
00:15:57,975 --> 00:15:59,646
If you really like her,

229
00:16:00,615 --> 00:16:01,915
you have to let her go.

230
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:04,615
No! I want to live with Ha Na!

231
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:06,886

233
00:16:10,556 --> 00:16:13,454
Ha Na, don't go anywhere.

234

235
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,365
Where would I go?

236
00:16:21,435 --> 00:16:24,205
I have nowhere to go, and no one called me, either.

237
00:16:27,376 --> 00:16:29,146
You don't have to suffer because of us.

238
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:31,516
Mom and Dad aren't here anymore, so let's go on our own way.

239
00:16:32,945 --> 00:16:34,085
You're saying that again?

240
00:16:36,516 --> 00:16:39,656
I already told you. I'm going to live with you three.

241
00:16:40,656 --> 00:16:42,626
Do you really enjoy living like this with us?

242
00:16:42,825 --> 00:16:45,056
- Yes, I like it. - Liar.

243
00:16:45,825 --> 00:16:47,225
Go while you can.

244
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:50,025
Don't run away later after saying you won't go.

245
00:16:50,026 --> 00:16:51,666
You can go if you want to, Ji Eun.

246

Come here.

251
00:17:10,956 --> 00:17:12,186
I won't change my mind.

Are you okay? How badly were you hurt?

257
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:37,875
I asked if you were okay!

258
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,716
Have you been skipping school to work at a construction site?

259
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:43,614

260
00:17:43,615 --> 00:17:45,154
I've been doing that.

261
00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:46,685
I'll pick up more part-time jobs.

262
00:17:46,686 --> 00:17:48,726
That's not what I'm talking about!

263
00:17:49,855 --> 00:17:51,996
I'm not in a position to sit around and study at ease.

264
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:55,226
I have to make a living for my siblings as the head of the family.

265
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,364
You were going to study while I made money.

266
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:59,095
We decided to split up our roles.

267
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:02,536

What are you talking about?

272
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:18,486
It wasn't your fault. It was an accident.

273
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:21,355
I'm partially responsible.

274
00:18:22,956 --> 00:18:24,355
It was because of the competition.

275
00:18:24,456 --> 00:18:26,296
So, you're sticking around and suffering...

276
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:30,165
with these total strangers because of that sense of guilt?

277
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:33,595
I would've stuck around even if it hadn't been for that.

278

I'm the head of this family without Mom and Dad.

You can't get rid of me.

Of course, muffins, donuts,

303
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:34,246
and French macaroons were delicious, but this was made with rice.

304

It's a healthy snack that's good for your body,

305
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:38,755
and it's not too sweet.

306
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,085
Come and have a taste.

307
00:21:46,825 --> 00:21:49,165
I barely make anything off these.

Don't be such a crybaby.

309

I know you have the best business in Insa-dong.

Goodness, no one will pay you for groaning.

312
00:21:59,575 --> 00:22:01,374
Have you considered how I felt...

313
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,875
when I groaned even if it didn't make me money?

314
00:22:03,075 --> 00:22:04,914

Hello, Teacher.

322
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,564
Eun Chong's second aunt will be there.

323
00:22:27,565 --> 00:22:28,706
I'll call her.

324
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,605
An extracurricular activity?

325
00:22:33,175 --> 00:22:34,875
He didn't mention that.

326
00:22:35,546 --> 00:22:36,675
How much will it cost?

327
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:43,016
Yes, all right. Goodbye.

328
00:22:47,425 --> 00:22:48,686
Did she say 170 dollars?

00:22:58,065 --> 00:22:59,165
Hey, where are you?

331
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,335
What do you mean? You told me to go to the kindergarten.

332
00:23:02,165 --> 00:23:03,405
So, you're there now?

333
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,375
You can come and check if you don't believe me.

334
00:23:06,875 --> 00:23:09,605
You aren't doing this for free. You have to do your best.

335
00:23:10,206 --> 00:23:12,815
Do you expect me to do my best after offering just 50 dollars?

336
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,115
You can't even get a cent for free.

337
00:23:19,786 --> 00:23:21,385
I can't go around picking up a cent to make money.

338
00:23:22,825 --> 00:23:24,395
I need to pick up a guy who already has money.

339
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,296
Does he come on Wednesdays and not Tuesdays?

340

341
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,565
The hour and the place are all correct.

- Da Hyun. - Mommy.

00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,145
- Mommy. - Shin Ae.

344
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:56,485
Now, it's time to make your family's faces.

345
00:23:56,486 --> 00:23:59,756
Parents, please take a seat next to your child.

346
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:06,865
Shall we?

347
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:13,306
Did your mommy not come?

348
00:24:13,905 --> 00:24:15,575
Eun Chong doesn't have a mommy.

349
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:19,276
My aunt will be my mommy soon.

350
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:22,546
She'll adopt me once she gets married.

351
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:27,755
Ginseng tea contains saponin,

352
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,884
which can boost your immune system,

353
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,726
and it has anticancer properties.

354
00:24:33,155 --> 00:24:36,726
And Korea produces the best ginseng out of the whole world.

355
00:24:36,996 --> 00:24:40,365
And it's also good for stamina.

356
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,465
Gosh, it's so soft.

357
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:47,104
And this is ginseng powder.

358
00:24:47,105 --> 00:24:48,874
And it's really good for the skin.

359
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:52,815
I mix it with yogurt and use it as a skin treatment.

360
00:24:53,216 --> 00:24:54,985
See? You can touch me.

361
00:24:54,986 --> 00:24:57,344
- Very soft. - It's very soft.

362
00:24:57,345 --> 00:24:58,485
Does she have to try that hard?

363
00:24:58,486 --> 00:25:00,925
She sells ginseng even to Americans.

364
00:25:01,186 --> 00:25:02,756
She's very tenacious.

365
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:06,026
She took the GED test while working many different jobs in high school,

366
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:08,095
then she taught herself three languages.

367
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:10,665
- "The GED test?" - Yes.

368
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,266
And she's the head of the family.

369
00:25:13,565 --> 00:25:15,766
- No way. - She's so tenacious.

370
00:25:16,065 --> 00:25:19,206
Here. Thank you.

371
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:25,645
All right.

372
00:25:27,645 --> 00:25:28,746
Hey, Hyun Ju.

373
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:31,516
Pick up someone at the airport? What time?

374
00:25:34,425 --> 00:25:35,486
Okay, I'm down.

375
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:51,875
Just pray.

376
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:01,145
We'll be there by the end of this.

377
00:26:27,645 --> 00:26:30,945
Goo Ha Na is such a good driver

378
00:26:30,946 --> 00:26:32,875
It's another fun day

379
00:26:34,246 --> 00:26:36,246
Following the traffic lights

380
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,415
It's my favorite gig

381
00:26:39,756 --> 00:26:40,885
My gosh!

382
00:26:42,855 --> 00:26:44,085
What was that?

383
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:47,456
Where are his manners? He didn't even put the blinkers on.

384
00:26:53,966 --> 00:26:55,036
Okay.

385
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:01,706
Hey, you!

386
00:27:03,175 --> 00:27:04,276
Hey!

387
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:07,344
Why are you driving like this?

388
00:27:07,345 --> 00:27:08,845
You almost caused an accident.

389
00:27:09,516 --> 00:27:10,615
Sorry.

390
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:20,696
Did he just flip me off?

391
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:27,236
What the heck is wrong with that rude jerk?

392
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:35,806
What's with her?

393
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:38,075
Why has she lost her temper and begun to follow me?

394
00:27:43,615 --> 00:27:44,716
Did you speed up?

395
00:27:46,385 --> 00:27:48,425
I'll get you today.

396
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:57,625
Yes. Hey!

397
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:00,766
You! The window!

398
00:28:01,165 --> 00:28:03,806
Mister! Did you just flip me off?

399
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:06,706
Did you flip me off?

400
00:28:07,135 --> 00:28:09,905
Fine, you won't look at me?

401
00:28:42,246 --> 00:28:44,976
Only ten minutes left before the boarding closes.

402
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:56,884
I hope your mother gets well.

403
00:28:56,885 --> 00:28:58,255
We'll pray for her.

404
00:28:58,256 --> 00:28:59,355
Thank you.

405
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:09,466
No worries. Mr. Hwang will be fine, as he's a professional.

406
00:29:10,266 --> 00:29:11,706
Take good care of this, President Hwang.

407
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:27,885
Hey! You!

408
00:29:28,686 --> 00:29:29,786
You!

409
00:29:31,496 --> 00:29:33,225
If you were wrong, you should apologize...

410
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:35,125
instead of flipping me off and running away.

411
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:38,295
Did you think I'd drive off and call it a bad day?

412
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,036
I didn't flip you off and run away.

413
00:29:40,595 --> 00:29:43,236
You drive recklessly, flip people off, and lie?

414
00:29:43,506 --> 00:29:45,835
Look at everything you've done.

415
00:29:46,736 --> 00:29:49,546
- Apologize for doing this! - I didn't do this.

416
00:29:51,575 --> 00:29:52,716
Sorry.

417
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,045
- I did this. - What?

418
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,486
I said sorry, not this.

419
00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:04,495
These are the same!

420
00:30:04,496 --> 00:30:06,525
No, they're totally different.

421
00:30:06,526 --> 00:30:08,526
One of them is offensive, and the other one is apologetic.

422
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:11,996
All you had to do was just apologize.

423
00:30:48,135 --> 00:30:50,604
I apologized, and you misunderstood.

424
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:51,805
It's completely absurd...

425
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:53,776
for you to follow me here and demand an apology.

426
00:30:54,135 --> 00:30:55,206
Don't you think so?

427
00:30:55,575 --> 00:30:56,905
I'll be completely absurd,

428
00:30:57,706 --> 00:30:58,875
so apologize to me!

429
00:31:55,065 --> 00:31:57,105
(Cinderella Game)

430
00:31:58,536 --> 00:32:01,206
Things seemed to have changed a lot, but they also looked the same.

431
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,475
It's also my first time receiving an investment...

432
00:32:03,476 --> 00:32:04,775
without knowing what the investor looks like.

433
00:32:04,776 --> 00:32:06,446
Let me pick my dress.

434
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:08,615
I did everything else as you wanted, Mom.

435
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,655
And did anything ever go wrong after you did as I asked?

436
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,956
Things are more fun with competition.

437
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:16,525
You met your potential mother-in-law on the day you received a bouquet.

438
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:18,095
I have a good feeling about this.

439
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:20,055
- Mother. - I'm not your mother!

440
00:32:20,056 --> 00:32:22,564
I'll marry you as soon as Eun Chong is out of your life.

441
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,665
Eun Chong and I are family, too.
