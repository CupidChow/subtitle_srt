1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,070
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,110
I told you not to take money
from Chairwoman Shin...

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,480
and said it'd be dangerous.

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,250
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

7
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,720
You were a bit too late.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,020
No, Chairwoman Shin was
a little quicker.

9
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:19,490
Yes, we're innocent victims.

10
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,760
Talk to every place
you invested in...

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,400
and take whatever money you can.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,570
She set you up in this trap
from the get-go...

13
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,970
if she got you a loan
from those loan sharks.

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,070
If I don't pay them
the principal and the interest,

15
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:34,540
they'll come back to break my legs.

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,810
Hey, it'll be a relief
if it ends with just our legs.

17
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,240
What if they take our organs?

18
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,110
- No...
- Oh, no.

19
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,720
Please help us.

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,520
Ji Seok. Mr. Han.

21
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,060
I'll look over the contract
with an attorney.

22
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,160
Ji Seok.

23
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,630
Leave Chairwoman Shin
to your sister.

24
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,960
You can focus on
patching up this incident.

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,970
Will Ha Na be okay all alone?

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,840
Is Chairwoman Shin that dreadful?

27
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,670
I need to go to Ha Na.

28
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,070
- I'll go with you.
- Hey.

29
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,670
It'll be more helpful
for you to stay out of this.

30
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,010
Why is Chairwoman Shin
doing this to us?

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,320
And this wasn't the first time.

32
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,180
Why does she repay kindness
with evil?

33
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,590
Don't you agree, Mr. Han?

34
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,130
What is this?
Where are your manners?

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,540
No, what are you doing?

36
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,810
How dare you go on
to mess with my siblings?

37
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,810
I didn't mess with them.

38
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,380
I gave them money
because they wanted it.

39
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,950
You still claim they wanted this...

40
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,920
after writing up
a contract like this?

41
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,090
I can't believe you used
your corporate raiding scheme on them.

42
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,890
How do you call yourself human?

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,890
Corporate raiding?

44
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,660
Should I sue you for defamation?

45
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,730
You'll have to pay two million,
the penalty, and for the damage.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,300
I'll give you a chance to save them.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,440
It's your choice.

48
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,240
One. Get away from Eun Chong...

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,270
and go live quietly without a trace.
Two.

50
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,540
Sacrifice your siblings
on this mountain of debt.

51
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,820
What do you think you're doing?

52
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,390
Three.

53
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,760
Fight until the end.

54
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,760
My siblings won't become sacrifices,

55
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,900
and I'll never give
Eun Chong to you, either.

56
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,900
I'll take him from you.

57
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,640
Do you think you can win against me?

58
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,740
You have no upper hand
both legally and financially.

59
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,010
The world isn't only about
the law and money.

60
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:53,680
Let's take this to the end
and see if I can win or not.

61
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,950
I'm done crunching numbers with you
for raising Eun Chong.

62
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,480
I'm not done yet.

63
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,490
Auntie Ha Na, are you in a fight?

64
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,530
Eun Chong, were you shocked
because of her yelling?

65
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,500
I was very surprised, too.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,670
What's going on, Yeo Jin...

67
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,470
Did you two fight?

68
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,740
Did you do this?

69
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,380
Auntie Ha Na.

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,890
It was an unfair contract,

71
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,890
so I was wondering
if it could be declared void.

72
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,570
I'll send you a photo of the copy,
so take a look as an attorney.

73
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,440
Goodbye.

74
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,010
Is something going on?

75
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,580
Why were you on the phone
with an attorney?

76
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,680
It's work.

77
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,610
Mom, could you take a seat?

78
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,250
Is something going on?

79
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,890
What's wrong?
You're making me scared.

80
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,990
It's nothing big.

81
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,020
After I marry,

82
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,060
I want to leave the chairwoman
and stand on my own feet.

83
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,260
"Leave?"

84
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,100
You'll be even closer to her
after you marry and adopt Eun Chong.

85
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,170
What do you mean?

86
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,100
I haven't thought of the specifics.

87
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,370
But I thought you should know.

88
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,670
Did the chairwoman
hurt you in any way?

89
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,240
It's not that.
I thought I had done enough.

90
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,610
I want to leave her shadow...

91
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,550
and live my own life.

92
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,390
Yes, you've done more than enough.

93
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,560
It worries me to hear you say that
right before the wedding.

94
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,290
It's nothing you should worry about.

95
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,800
It's been on my mind for a while.

96
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,340
- Ha Na.
- You're here.

97
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,780
I got worried and went all the way
to Chairwoman Shin's place.

98
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,080
That's for you to drink.

99
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,080
How are Ji Eun and Ji Chang doing?

100
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,450
They're scared to death.

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,120
They're shuddering at the thought
of the loan sharks returning.

102
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,460
What did Chairwoman Shin say?

103
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,800
I just can't understand.

104
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,030
How can she not feel sorry
after everything she has done?

105
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,740
She didn't end with our parents
and began to harass me and all of you.

106
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,610
She couldn't do this
if she considered Du Na and Eun Chong.

107
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,410
She's not like us.

108
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
Don't try so hard to understand.

109
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,780
I'm not trying.

110
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,450
I just felt frustrated and angry.

111
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,980
How are you so composed?

112
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,050
I thought you'd blow up
after what she did.

113
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,560
You blew up at her for me.

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,430
Yes.

115
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,800
I'll put my anger on display
while you calmly come up with a way.

116
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,970
I told the chairwoman...

117
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,840
that I'd take Eun Chong from her.

118
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,270
You will take advantage of him
for our revenge, right?

119
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,710
Of course.

120
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,450
I know my feelings
contradict each other.

121
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,580
I'm still unsure
of what exactly I'm feeling.

122
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,690
I'll think about Eun Chong
after I'm done with the revenge.

123
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,290
By then,
I'll know how I really feel.

124
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,190
What did she say
when you said you'd take him?

125
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,030
She said I'd never win against her.

126
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,600
And that made me
want to win even more.

127
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,970
How did you put up with her
until this day?

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,070
I would've shot her if I had a gun.

129
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,470
I would...

130
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,440
also love to end her life right now.

131
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,380
But we must get our revenge first.

132
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,980
We can end her life after that.

133
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,890
Okay.

134
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,160
What are we going to do
about Ji Eun and Ji Chang?

135
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,390
There's a way.

136
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,690
Really? What is it?

137
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:06,360
You need to give up
on getting Eun Chong's custody.

138
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,300
No, this is Auntie Ha Na
and my room.

139
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,170
Just zip it open.

140
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,640
No, only Auntie Ha Na can come in.

141
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,780
Do you want to play Jenga?
You love that game. Or with slimes?

142
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,720
Tell Chairwoman Shin that
you'll give up on his custody...

143
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:31,960
in return for wiping out
our siblings' contract.

144
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,790
- Will she accept it?
- She will.

145
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,360
You'll put her at ease,

146
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,430
then drop the news
on the fake pregnancy.

147
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,470
That'll stop Se Young from marrying,

148
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,370
which automatically cancels
Eun Chong's adoption.

149
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,700
We may end up killing
2 birds with 1 stone.

150
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,940
Se Young also asked you
to make me give up on his custody.

151
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,310
I already thought
of pretending to give up on it,

152
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,450
and she gave me
a perfect chance to do that.

153
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,280
You're right.
We're beating her at her own game.

154
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,750
If I tell her
I'll give up on his custody,

155
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,190
she'll make me sign
a written agreement...

156
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,990
with disastrous terms.

157
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,760
You need to offer the term first.

158
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,690
Such as?

159
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,330
I'll give up
on getting Eun Chong's custody.

160
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,000
Where did your fierce spirit go?

161
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,810
Is this under the condition that
I take care of your siblings' debt?

162
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,710
Yes, please retract the contract.

163
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,080
All things bow down to money.

164
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,220
You gave me a good lesson.

165
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,020
How am I supposed to take your words
and just save your siblings?

166
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,950
I'll never show up
before Eun Chong...

167
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,890
after he's adopted by Se Young.

168
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,060
You won't show up
after Se Young adopts him?

169
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,330
How am I going to believe that?

170
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,900
I'll sign a written agreement.

171
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,730
Why would I lie
if my siblings were at stake?

172
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,100
Then, help Se Young actively...

173
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,970
in the adoption process
until she gets married.

174
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,270
- Sure.
- In two days,

175
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,440
they'll practice the interview
for the adoption screening.

176
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,650
Make Eun Chong
tell the interviewer...

177
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,210
that he wants to be Se Young
and Jin Goo's son.

178
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,150
Then, I'll trust what you said.

179
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,820
I'll do that.

180
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:09,790
I told you, didn't I?

181
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,460
That you'll end up
groveling before me.

182
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,760
You came around
faster than I expected.

183
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,560
I'm not groveling before you yet.

184
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,400
The real game hasn't begun.

185
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,170
Ha Na gave up
on getting his custody?

186
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,580
Her stupid siblings have become
the worst burdens for Ha Na.

187
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:33,950
Should I thank them?

188
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,350
They're my siblings, too.
Can you not talk like that?

189
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,720
It's just a habit.

190
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,020
Anyway, I can avoid the custody war
thanks to your siblings.

191
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,760
What about the clearance
to the security server?

192
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,190
I'll meet you tomorrow
and hand it over.

193
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,230
Bye.

194
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,000
Did you give up
on getting his custody?

195
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,640
Yes, I'll help out
with the adoption process.

196
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,210
Really?

197
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,510
Something seems fishy.

198
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm doing this against my will
to save my siblings.

199
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,280
If you don't want
to believe it, don't.

200
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,090
I can't believe they didn't tell you
after taking that much money.

201
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,390
You should cut ties with them.

202
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,090
This is my advice for your own good.

203
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,190
Don't go around
giving ill-advised advice.

204
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,460
Do not say anything bad
about my siblings.

205
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,670
They aren't trashy enough
to take insults from you.

206
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,570
Does saying that
make you feel better?

207
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,470
You have no idea
how trashy you are, do you?

208
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:36,110
Don't you know
what trashy really means?

209
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:39,480
Just get ready for your wedding.
I'm looking forward to it.

210
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,750
Sure, it'll be much more than
anything you can imagine.

211
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,460
Everything went well.
You don't have to worry anymore.

212
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,730
- Really, Ji Seok?
- Really, Ji Seok?

213
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
So, those loan sharks will
never come to my business again?

214
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,370
No.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,900
From now on, don't take
whatever money that's offered.

216
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,740
You two aren't so young anymore.

217
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,940
You have to know how scary
the world and money can be.

218
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,210
I won't help you
if this happens again.

219
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,850
- Okay.
- Okay.

220
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,890
Anyway, how did you handle
such a big amount of money?

221
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,890
Did you and Ha Na take out loans?

222
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,260
Ha Na took care of it.

223
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,220
- She did?
- She did?

224
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,460
She didn't sell herself
to Chairwoman Shin, right?

225
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,200
You know, how Rapunzel's parents
gave up on her...

226
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,870
- Hey, stop joking around.
- I'm not joking.

227
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,070
It's not for you to worry,
so stop acting ridiculous...

228
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,470
and just run the business well.

229
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,810
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

230
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:46,210
Anyway, why did Chairwoman Shin
make us sign that contract?

231
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,250
Has she become our worst enemy?

232
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,380
You don't have to know.

233
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,980
Don't take even a cent from them
from now on.

234
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,250
Don't even associate with them.

235
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,120
So, we can't even meet Eun Chong?

236
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,390
Don't.

237
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

238
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,230
Ha Na gave up on his custody?

239
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,260
She didn't give up anything.
It was Aunt Yeo Jin's anyway.

240
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,940
Did she give up
because of her siblings?

241
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,900
After you two marry
and adopt Eun Chong,

242
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,340
she promised
never to appear before him again.

243
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,080
Make a sign an agreement
and get it notarized, too.

244
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,210
I did all that.

245
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:25,350
The home study evaluator
for the adoption will come tomorrow.

246
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,680
You need to practice with Eun Chong.

247
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,490
But he'll say...

248
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,990
he wants Ha Na as his mom,
so what do we do?

249
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:32,420
Ha Na will handle that.

250
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,430
- She will?
- She will?

251
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,900
She gave up on Eun Chong
and saved her siblings.

252
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,640
We ended up benefitting
from her stupid siblings.

253
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:54,410
We always have to play with money
to make the poor shut their mouth.

254
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,850
I'll soon marry and adopt Eun Chong,

255
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,050
so it'll be a matter of time
before Hyesung is mine.

256
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,720
Don't let your guard down
until he's your legal son.

257
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,590
Who knows
what Ha Na is scheming in secret?

258
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,130
She gave up on his custody,

259
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,560
so it'd mean she didn't know
about the fake pregnancy.

260
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,400
She wouldn't have given up
if she had known.

261
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,700
She could've exposed you
and resolved everything.

262
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,000
Did anything else seem suspicious
since that day?

263
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,540
- No.
- Okay, then.

264
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,840
While we're on the subject,
you need to wear your baby bump.

265
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,210
Bring it over.

266
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,550
It's so uncomfortable.

267
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,050
You have to get used to it.

268
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,320
You want to leave?

269
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,560
I believe I've done my best
to serve you, Ms. Chairwoman.

270
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,060
I want to put an end to my role
by marrying, adopting Eun Chong,

271
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,560
and raising him well.

272
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,460
Hyesung will be yours
as soon as you adopt Eun Chong,

273
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,570
yet you want to leave?

274
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:49,870
Se Young will do a great job.

275
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,000
What about Eun Chong?

276
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,110
Not only is he Hyesung's successor,
but he'll be your son.

277
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:58,210
Se Young will also do a better job than me
in that aspect, too.

278
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,080
And I'll also raise him well.

279
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,080
What's your plan?

280
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,620
I'll start thinking now.

281
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,120
What's the reason?

282
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,890
It's because you weren't someone
I thought I knew.

283
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,300
I was disappointed
in both you and me.

284
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,300
Is it because of Ha Na?

285
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,700
Because I was harsh on her?

286
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,000
Actually, I was
more disappointed in myself.

287
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Do you not want to take
Hyesung Group?

288
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,140
I joined Hyesung...

289
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,380
because I wanted to help you.

290
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,720
I don't want to bring
my personal ambition into this.

291
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,050
You have zero ambition.

292
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,620
What have you learned by my side
over all those years?

293
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,760
How are you less ambitious
than Se Young?

294
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,460
We'll talk again after the wedding.

295
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,860
Did you give up on
getting his custody...

296
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,030
because of your siblings?

297
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:25,760
- Yes.
- Did you also agree to help...

298
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,170
- Se Young and me adopt Eun Chong?
- Yes.

299
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,600
Why did you take it that far?

300
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,470
I had no other way
of saving my siblings.

301
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,340
I asked an attorney
to look over the contract.

302
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,880
It was unfair and could become void.
Please don't give up.

303
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,150
I'll help you.

304
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,920
I won't give up.

305
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,990
Please turn a blind eye
to this incident.

306
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,690
Can you live
without seeing Eun Chong?

307
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,630
He'll come to me.

308
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,030
We're going to practice
for the home study interview.

309
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,760
Did you agree
to help with that, too?

310
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,500
Yes, while we're on the subject,
I need to get Eun Chong ready.

311
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,600
You asked me
to help adopt Eun Chong.

312
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,370
Why won't you
give me a chance to help?

313
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,710
Later.

314
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:12,440
You'll have to help me later.

315
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,580
- When is that?
- Soon.

316
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:24,960
In two days,
they'll practice the interview...

317
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,990
for the adoption screening.

318
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:27,760
Make Eun Chong
tell the interviewer...

319
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,360
that he wants to be Se Young
and Jin Goo's son.

320
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,060
Then, I'll trust what you said.

321
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,470
Do you still want me
to be your mommy?

322
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,140
Yes.

323
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,280
There's a way for me to adopt you.

324
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,580
Instead of Mr. Hwang
and Auntie Se Young?

325
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,080
Yes.

326
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,020
This is a secret,

327
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,060
but Auntie Se Young
and Mr. Hwang can't get married.

328
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,860
So, they can't adopt you, either.

329
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,690
Really? Why not?

330
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,800
Shh. It's still a secret.

331
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,060
I'll tell you later.

332
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,770
Anyway, you have to tell a lie
if you want me to adopt you.

333
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,040
"A lie?"

334
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,480
Grandma is a liar, right?

335
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,850
So, I can't adopt you
while you're in this house.

336
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:25,050
We have to tell a lie
and escape from this house.

337
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,320
- "Escape?"
- Yes.

338
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,520
If we tell a good lie
and win against Grandma,

339
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,960
we can leave this house,

340
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,790
and then I'll get to adopt you.

341
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,630
Is this the game of lying?

342
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:40,060
Yes, this is a secret operation...

343
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,500
only between you and me.

344
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,670
A secret operation?

345
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,570
Gosh, this sounds fun.

346
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,910
Can you tell the lie I teach you...

347
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,270
without getting caught?

348
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,610
Eun Chong, you know
these two people will...

349
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,720
adopt you, right?

350
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:06,720
Yes, she's my mommy,
and he's my daddy.

351
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,000
Eun Chong, why do you want
Auntie Se Young to be your mommy?

352
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,730
Because she's nice to me,

353
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,270
and I like her, too.

354
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,500
How does she treat you nicely?

355
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,770
She was worried
I might fall off the bed in sleep,

356
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,140
so she gave me a big hug.

357
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,320
Auntie...

358
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,420
Instead of kicking him?

359
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,520
Once, I surprised her
with my toy caterpillar.

360
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,460
What is this?

361
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,900
It's a fake caterpillar.

362
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,030
Don't make me mad.

363
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,700
How dare you surprise me
with a toy like this?

364
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,700
But she didn't hit my head.

365
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,510
She patted my head
and called me cute.

366
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,710
Is this little kid
trying to humiliate me?

367
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:58,740
Or was he brainwashed by Ha Na?

368
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,410
He gave better answers
than how I heard he'd do.

369
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,280
At this point, there won't be a problem
with the evaluation.

370
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,720
Really?

371
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,620
It'll be even more advantageous
for the screening...

372
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,260
if you have photos
of you three at an outing.

373
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,060
Photos?

374
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,590
Eun Chong,
do you want to go camping?

375
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,900
- Let's go and take pictures.
- Okay.

376
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:29,210
She must've been determined
to reprogram Eun Chong...

377
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,910
to save her siblings.

378
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,280
What did she say to him?

379
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,350
She must've gaslighted him
day and night.

380
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,190
I could tell by the way
the evaluator responded...

381
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,450
that the adoption process
would go smoothly.

382
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,400
- Please enjoy.
- Here's your tteokbokki.

383
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,270
The more I think about it,
the more riled up I am.

384
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,400
Do we have to suffer like this?

385
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,810
Hey, I couldn't sleep
after how we were wronged.

386
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,010
How dare she repay kindness
with evil?

387
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,910
I need to go and nitpick over this.

388
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,850
Hey. I'm in.

389
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,250
Where are you going, Mr. Goo?

390
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,160
Ha Na's siblings are here.

391
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,660
Don't let them in.

392
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,530
- Darn it.
- Darn it. Come on!

393
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,300
Darn it.

394
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,670
I can't believe
she's ignoring us now.

395
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:39,410
Open the door,
you evil and manipulative fraud!

396
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,410
If you don't,
I'll destroy your door!

397
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,450
- Darn it.
- Darn it.

398
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,820
Do we really break it?

399
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,490
We'll go back for today.

400
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,530
Okay.

401
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,330
Here. That's the authorization key
for the security server.

402
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,870
Files related
to Eun Chong's adoption.

403
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,240
I won't need this.

404
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,180
I don't know how Ha Na trained him,

405
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,350
but she made him
turn over to our side.

406
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,650
Good for you. Congratulations.

407
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,780
- On his adoption?
- On your marriage.

408
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,990
Do you really mean that?

409
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,250
I'm going to be another man's wife.

410
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,720
It's a marriage
of convenience anyway.

411
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,990
You'll keep seeing me.

412
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,730
- Is the baby healthy?
- What?

413
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,570
Yes, of course.

414
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,970
Is it a boy or a girl?

415
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,570
I don't know the sex yet.

416
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,870
If the baby was fine
after you rolled down the stairs,

417
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,680
then it must be a brave boy.

418
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,310
Sure, I guess.

419
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,220
Stop it. The baby can sense this.

420
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,690
- "The baby?"
- Why did you chuckle?

421
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,160
What a smart child.

422
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,430
The baby knows...

423
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,600
their mommy is with another man
who isn't the daddy.

424
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,740
It's the authorization key
for the security server.

425
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,210
We need to find every document there is
from thirteen years ago...

426
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,680
on the loans my father's business,
Youngshin Fashion, took out...

427
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,750
until the point of its disposal.

428
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,580
Yes, sir.

429
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,650
It's a file on Dad's company.

430
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:33,690
It's a lot,
but you need to know this first.

431
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,230
These files must've been
well-thumbed by Dad.

432
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,500
We'll give you the next file
after you're done with that.

433
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,430
Yes, okay.

434
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,400
Mr. Han will get you the position
as the chief auditor.

435
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:50,570
An external audit team will
have everything done.

436
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,010
All you need to do is
go there as the chief auditor...

437
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,250
and ask questions
in the investigation room.

438
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,420
- We can rehearse that next time.
- Okay.

439
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:01,590
We can pressure Chairwoman Shin
with Hyesung Tour's disposal,

440
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,550
then use the fake daughter project
against Hwang Jin Goo...

441
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,320
and Yoon Se Young's power abuse
to put pressure on them.

442
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,290
- Do you have all the evidence?
- Yes.

443
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,060
I'll prepare the evidence
on Hwang Jin Goo and Yoon Se Young.

444
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,500
I have more than enough.

445
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,870
An external audit?

446
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,070
Yes, ma'am. An external auditor
was appointed as the chief...

447
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,170
to conduct an audit
regarding Hyesung Tour's disposal.

448
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,480
Who's behind this?
The board? The shareholders?

449
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm still figuring that out.

450
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,650
An audit just before
our 30th anniversary?

451
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:37,150
Hyesung Tour's disposal was the one
with Richard Han's involvement.

452
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,290
I'll check on that.

453
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,530
Find whatever
that can cause a problem,

454
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,300
share it with Jin Goo,
and handle it right away.

455
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,530
And don't let the corporate raids...

456
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,130
- get detected.
- No, ma'am.

457
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:51,570
Reconduct the investigation
from scratch...

458
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,870
on Richard Han and Director Goo,

459
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:57,440
and I especially need more details
on Mr. Goo's parents.

460
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,780
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,550
An external audit?

462
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,280
So, there was a problem
with Hyesung Tour's disposal?

463
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,690
Yes, I'll talk to you in the office.

464
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,230
The chairwoman conducted
Hyesung Tour's disposal.

465
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,960
If this external audit broke out
without her knowledge,

466
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,860
then was someone after her?

467
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,670
Who's behind this?

468
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,240
The man behind Goo Ji Seok,
Richard Han?

469
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,110
I just got a call
from the audit team.

470
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,780
Chairwoman Shin must've found out
about the audit.

471
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,280
But we still don't have decisive evidence
on my father's business.

472
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,050
We must hasten this.

473
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,790
Why don't we...

474
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,820
earn some time
by breaking the scandal...

475
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,390
of Yoon Se Young's power abuse?

476
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,760
I'll move quickly.

477
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,830
I'll continue to search
the security server.

478
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,860
All right.

479
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,530
- Put this on.
- Stop it.

480
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,630
It's for you, me, and Eun Chong.

481
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:59,240
We don't have to go this far.

482
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,300
Come on. Put this on.

483
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,840
I prepared it to take a family photo
while we camp.

484
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,950
My dear Star, I'll put one on you
after you come into this world.

485
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,850
You look great, Eun Chong.

486
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,260
We just need
Daddy to put it on, right?

487
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,530
Mr. Hwang, put it on already.
Let's go camping!

488
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,500
- Eun Chong, let's go downstairs.
- Okay.

489
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,510
Let me come with you.

490
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,540
Get changed and come down.

491
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,490
Gosh, look at how they're wearing
matching T-shirts.

492
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,160
You three look like a real family.

493
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,490
Have fun today, Eun Chong.

494
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,560
Okay.

495
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,160
Eun Chong, why don't you hold
Auntie Se Young's hand?

496
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,360
Right!

497
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,910
Take good pictures for them,
Ms. Goo.

498
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,510
I can just take selfies.

499
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,680
It's okay. I volunteered.

500
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,340
We're leaving, then.

501
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:15,880
Let's go.

502
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:28,990
(Camping Ground)

503
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,160
Here.

504
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:37,170
It's still hot,
so cool it down before you eat it.

505
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:40,500
Let me cool it down for you.

506
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,540
Auntie Ha Na, come and join us.

507
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,610
Okay. After I take some photos.

508
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,950
Look over here.

509
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,850
One, two, three.

510
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,420
Can you all get closer?

511
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:15,410
Can you do the cheek hearts?

512
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,230
Do you feel unwell?

513
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,330
No.

514
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,770
I need to use the ladies' room.

515
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:57,310
Here, Eun Chong.

516
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,180
Eat up.

517
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,070
I can't believe
I have to keep putting this on.

518
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,230
<i>Hula-hula</i>

519
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:43,590
- You're a good dancer.
- What was that?

00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,400
<i>Hula-hula</i>

521
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,800
<i>Hula-hula</i>

522
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,270
<i>- Hula-hula</i>
<i></i>- You're so cute.

523
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:55,310
- How funny. Do it again.
<i>- Hula-hula</i>

524
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,710
<i>Hula-hula</i>

525
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,980
You need to eat some rice, too.

526
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,700
Huh?
Your tummy looks thinner, Auntie.

527
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,100
No, it's the same.

528
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:29,410
You're right.
Is it a little different?

529
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,740
It looks the same.

530
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,510
These men need to check
their eyesight.

531
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,280
I have really good eyesight.

532
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,750
Auntie Ha Na,
I want to go to the restroom, too.

533
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,820
Do you want to go with me?

534
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,990
- You should go.
- Okay.

535
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,130
Let's go.

536
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,240
There's something I don't know,
isn't there?

537
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,810
You said you did this
for your siblings,

538
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,680
but you seemed odd.

539
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,110
I doubt you're genuinely trying hard
to let us adopt him.

540
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,980
How I really feel isn't important.

541
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,220
I'm just doing my job.

542
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,790
And the chairwoman
made you come here to take photos.

543
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,990
I don't understand
why she's doing this to you.

544
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,160
I'm fine.

545
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,430
The last laugh will be mine.

546
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,230
Sorry?

547
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,470
You can't marry Se Young...

548
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,540
or adopt Eun Chong.

549
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,650
What do you mean
I can't get married anyway?

550
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,020
What do you mean?

551
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,220
Say it again.

552
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,030
Did Auntie Ha Na say
Mr. Hwang and I couldn't marry?

553
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,660
Answer me.

554
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,470
Did Auntie Ha Na say
Mr. Hwang and I couldn't marry?

555
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,270
It looks like you have a plan...

556
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,680
with Eun Chong's adoption
after we marry.

557
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,080
Can you tell me what it is?

558
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,880
It won't happen after you marry.

559
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,150
You'll find out soon.

560
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,180
"Soon?"

561
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,390
Did you say that
Jin Goo and I couldn't get married?

562
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,900
What are you talking about?

563
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,060
Did you tell Eun Chong...

564
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,970
that Jin Goo
and I couldn't get married?

565
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,600
What was your ground in saying that?

566
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:37,990
(Cinderella Game)

567
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:41,330
I need to find out if Ha Na really knows
about the fake pregnancy.

568
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:44,470
On that note, let me get you
the bouquet for your wedding.

569
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,770
Chairwoman Shin and Hwang Jin Goo...

570
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,940
seemed to be suspicious that
we were behind the external audit.

571
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,140
Do not dream of appearing
before Eun Chong again.

572
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,240
- Did you just laugh?
- Why are you so insecure?

573
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,010
But Ji Seok, you have my heart.
You know that, right?

574
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:57,550
What will you do
if Se Young isn't pregnant?

575
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:58,610
You don’t mean...

576
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,980
Se Young...

577
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,720
isn't pregnant.
