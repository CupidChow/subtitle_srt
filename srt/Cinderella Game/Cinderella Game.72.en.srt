1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,610
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,750
(Episode 72)

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,920
You're here, Mother.

6
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,960
Is something going on?

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,460
Be honest.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,160
About what?

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,760
Are you seeing another man?

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,640
What are you talking about?

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
Answer me.
Are you seeing another man?

12
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,170
No, Mother.

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,510
There's no man other than Jin Goo.

14
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,550
He wanted to call off the engagement
because you had another man, right?

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,350
No, Mother.

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,020
Where did you hear this absurdity
to come and harass her?

17
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,590
Then, why did he
want to call it off?

18
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,090
I told you already.
He said he didn't love me.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,830
Why would you blame me
for how his feelings changed?

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:56,060
He doesn't change his mind
that frivolously.

21
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,530
But he must've changed his mind
because you had another man!

22
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,930
What about his feelings for Ha Na?

23
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,730
He was the one who cheated on her!

24
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,510
Who knows what
he has done with Goo Ha Na?

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,080
Did you have evidence
that I cheated on him?

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,450
If you do, show me.

27
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,720
I got...

28
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,990
this text message.

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,890
(Yoon Se Young is cheating.)

30
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,860
This is just slander.

31
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,700
- Who sent this to you?
- I don't know.

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,470
Are you slandering Se Young
with a text message...

33
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,210
sent to you from a random person?

34
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,070
Slandering?

35
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,910
This can't be used as evidence!

36
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,050
What if someone sent it to you
to hurt her?

37
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,480
I'll ask Jin Goo.

38
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,190
He doesn't know, Mother.

39
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,260
I never cheated on him,
so there would be no evidence.

40
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,560
Please don't be fooled
by something this ridiculous.

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,330
Did you rush over in anger
because of that stupid message?

42
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,900
My goodness.

43
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,270
I thought you had
some profound evidence.

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,770
There's no evidence,
but there's a witness.

45
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,480
- What?
- "A witness?"

46
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,110
I know...

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,050
the man Se Young is seeing.

48
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
- You do?
- Yes.

49
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,820
Hey.

50
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,360
- What?
- Do you have evidence?

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,520
I'm the evidence.

52
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,530
I heard you talking to him
on the phone,

53
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:37,700
and I saw you lying to Mr. Hwang
while you were seeing him.

54
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,900
Shut up!

55
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,000
Can you take responsibility
for what you just said?

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,240
Who's that man? Tell me.

57
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,740
Director Goo Ji Seok.

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,180
"Director Goo Ji Seok?"

59
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,910
Are you talking about that director
who took Jin Goo's spot,

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,180
your younger brother, Ms. Goo?

61
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,720
Yes.

62
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,390
Did you send her that text message?

63
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,330
It wasn't me.

64
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,800
What's going on?

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,510
Se Young says it's not true,
so please calm down...

66
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,880
and confirm this with Jin Goo, too.

67
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,250
Yes, I will.

68
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,250
Mother, this is a misunderstanding.

69
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,250
Then, why would Ms. Goo say that?

70
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,850
She holds a grudge against me.

71
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,660
She must want her brother
to get involved with me.

72
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,690
So, Ha Na is the problem again.

73
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,790
Exactly.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,530
It's all but a misunderstanding,
so let's register their marriage...

75
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,230
before the borough office closes.

76
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,000
Forget registering their marriage.

77
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,540
Please excuse me.

78
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,840
- Hey, Bang Ul...
- Mother.

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,740
Mother...

80
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,950
Goodness. Come on.

81
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,680
Who sent her that text message...

82
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,520
just before
we registered their marriage?

83
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,620
Doesn't it seem like
someone knew we'd do that?

84
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,960
Is something really going on
between Mr. Goo and Se Young?

85
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,830
They dated briefly back in America.

86
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,160
She broke up with him
before she returned to Korea.

87
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,800
Why did she take that the wrong way?

88
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,070
She took a taxi and left.

89
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,010
Do you have any idea
who could've sent that?

90
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,110
Hey, Mom.

91
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,710
Mother will also come
to the borough office at 2 p.m.?

92
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:37,050
I'll go there straight from work.

93
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:39,550
Okay. Bye.

94
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,820
Why are you going
to the borough office?

95
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,450
He thought
of marriage registration...

96
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,320
only after hearing that
I was going to the borough office?

97
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,830
Are Ji Seok and Ha Na
working together?

98
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:56,530
She's denying it until the end.

99
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,370
They just concluded that
you two dated briefly in America.

100
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,710
But thanks to that,
they failed to register their marriage.

101
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,540
Se Young must've flipped out.

102
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,710
- Are you concerned?
- No.

103
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,850
You should be careful.

104
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,620
The chairwoman already thinks
you've come to steal Eun Chong.

105
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,450
If she finds out you tried to stop
their marriage registration,

106
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,160
she won't just sit on her hands.

107
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,990
She'll try to find a way
to attack me.

108
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,890
Should I have a word
with Ji Eun and Ji Chang first?

109
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll meet with them.

110
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,630
Okay.

111
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,370
Bye.

112
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't you know how to knock?

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,040
Who were you on the phone with?
Ji Seok?

114
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,380
- What are you doing?
- You were talking to Ji Seok.

115
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,610
It was you who sent the message.

116
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,380
- Why would I do that?
- To stop the marriage registration!

117
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,450
I know you feel rushed,

118
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,360
but why would I care
about your marriage registration?

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,490
Because you thought
I'd end up adopting Eun Chong.

120
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,330
Go ahead and adopt him.
I don't care.

121
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,760
And it's true that you cheated.

122
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,500
- Why do you feel falsely blamed?
- You!

123
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,870
Be careful with your baby.

124
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,080
The chairwoman told them
to register my marriage first?

125
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,380
Is she trying
to rush the adoption...

126
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,590
because she thinks
Ha Na wants to take Eun Chong?

127
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,890
Chairwoman Shin wanted
to make me appear schizophrenic...

128
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,930
and planned to lock me up
at a mental institution.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,630
Is she trying to make
Ha Na's life difficult again?

130
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,370
Ms. Jang, may I ask you something?

131
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,250
Se Young was worried that
Ha Na was playing Eun Chong's mom.

132
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,050
Yes, the chairwoman was
greatly worried, too.

133
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,450
She's openly showing
a strong attachment to him,

134
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,890
to the point that we began to wonder
if she moved in to take his custody.

135
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,760
Does the chairwoman have a plan?

136
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,730
- What plan?
- She probably wants to find...

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,300
a way to separate
Ha Na and Eun Chong.

138
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,600
She's probably thinking,

139
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:11,000
but she hasn't said anything yet.

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,710
The chairwoman would
probably go for her weakness.

141
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,110
Her biggest weakness is her family.

142
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,740
It's her younger siblings.

143
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,420
(Stella Tteokbokki)

144
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,660
- Hey, Se Young.
- Hey.

145
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,760
Has Mother called?

146
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,660
No, why?

147
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,300
Someone sent her an anonymous text
about Director Goo and me.

148
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,500
What?

149
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,000
She must be in great shock.

150
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,010
- What did she say?
- She thought you tried...

151
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:52,280
to call our engagement off
because I had another man.

152
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,550
I denied it and said it was slander,
but she wouldn't believe me.

153
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,210
What do I do?

154
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,620
Who would send her that message?

155
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,920
I think it was Ha Na.

156
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,550
Why would she do that?

157
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,250
To stop me from adopting Eun Chong.

158
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,360
Mother seemed really angry.
What should I do?

159
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,490
I'll talk to her.

160
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:20,810
Mom.

161
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,180
You...

162
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,450
cannot lie to me.

163
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,260
You must be honest.

164
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,360
Did you call the engagement off...

165
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,260
because Se Young was seeing
another man?

166
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,770
- Answer me.
- I don't have the evidence.

167
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,700
There was a misunderstanding...

168
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:55,210
because they dated before in America
and began to cooperate at work.

169
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,880
Call the engagement off.

170
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,580
I know you.

171
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,520
You wouldn't bring that up
just because of a misunderstanding.

172
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,890
She was cheating on you.

173
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,390
I can't have
a daughter-in-law like that.

174
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,030
What about the baby?

175
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,730
Either we or Se Young can
raise the baby.

176
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,930
If you can't, I will.

177
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,630
You can call this marriage off.

178
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,770
I should've heard you out
before I came to a conclusion,

179
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,270
but I forced you into this instead.

180
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,080
I'm sorry.

181
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,510
I won't call it off.

182
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,450
I will marry her.

183
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,220
She cheated on you!

184
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,690
Is it because of the baby?

185
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,360
A few days ago,

186
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,330
I pulled myself together
as I listened to the baby's heartbeat.

187
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,740
My child is
about to come into this world.

188
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:04,240
It feels like a sin to let
him or her grow up without a dad.

189
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,480
My dad passed away early in my life,

190
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,180
so I had to grow up without him.

191
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:18,390
But you must be
all broken on the inside.

192
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,290
I had...

193
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,600
no idea she would do that to you.

194
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
How could she do this?

195
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,570
How could she see another man
while she was with you?

196
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,210
As you said before,

197
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,550
things would get better over time
as we raise the baby together.

198
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:48,250
Both Se Young and I will
do our best.

199
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,090
So, just let it go, Mom.

200
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,830
But you want to live
with the woman you like.

201
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,900
I'd be asking for too much.

202
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,370
How can I dare to want that?

203
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,910
I'm fine, Mom.

204
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,380
Eun Chong, take a look.

205
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,650
These are the things
your younger sibling will use.

206
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,490
Gosh, there are lots of stuff.

207
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,590
Right?

208
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,730
I lost my room because of somebody,

209
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,460
so I have to leave these
in the living room upstairs.

210
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,330
You never had a child,
so you wouldn't know, right?

211
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,400
I almost choked up
while putting all these...

212
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,070
into the shopping cart.

213
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,710
It's a wonderful thing
to become a mother.

214
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,780
I've used all these
while raising Eun Chong.

215
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,780
I've raised a child
much before you began.

216
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,350
But you never gave birth to one.

217
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,250
Sure, good for you
on getting pregnant.

218
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,760
What's this?

219
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,560
It's a chair that babies sit on
when they're fed.

220
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,300
I wonder what it'll feel like
to breastfeed the baby.

221
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,600
It's probably completely different
from feeding them formula.

222
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,140
It doesn't matter if you're
breastfeeding or giving formula.

223
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,740
All mothers feed their children
with their hearts full of love.

224
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,040
And some mothers
don't produce enough milk.

225
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,810
That may be your case.

226
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,410
What are you talking about?

227
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:24,580
Why wouldn't I produce enough milk?

228
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,320
Don't you know that
as a pregnant woman?

229
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,650
If you don't know,
at least read a book.

230
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,590
Let's go, Eun Chong.

231
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,330
How would I know? I'm not pregnant.

232
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,830
Aunt Yeo Jin should separate them.
Why did she put them together?

233
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,840
What do you mean?

234
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,810
I was curious if you were
involved in corporate raids.

235
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,940
Not at all.

236
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,050
Where did you hear this?

237
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,720
Did the people who slander me
try to give this story to you, too?

238
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,520
- They were the victims of...
- They'd say they were victims.

239
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,590
They've been claiming that
for a long time. What about that?

240
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:09,630
Then, does this have
nothing to do with you?

241
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,060
- No.
- I met with the man...

242
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,730
who made a scene
at Mr. Goo's inaugural ceremony.

243
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,600
That incident ended
as that man's groundless slander.

244
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,040
He had a different story to tell.

245
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,380
Just as he said at the ceremony,

246
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,210
he continued to say
he lost his business to you.

247
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,950
That's what they always say.

248
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,350
If they had been telling the truth,

249
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,090
I would've been separated
from the society already.

250
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,160
You just have to trust me...

251
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,690
as you have until now,
without getting shaken up.

252
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,000
Why do you let these rumors
continue to circulate?

253
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,070
Rumors will grow bigger
if you lay a hand on it.

254
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,000
Ignoring it is the best move.

255
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,870
If people who suffered
because of you came out,

256
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,840
would you apologize?

257
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:01,810
That won't happen.

258
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,320
Many people benefitted from me,

259
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,950
but no one suffered.

260
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:08,820
How can she show no remorse,

261
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,460
even though her victims are
still out there?

262
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,860
You don't have to worry.

263
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,760
I won't, ma'am.

264
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,330
I was worried about Eun Chong,
so I asked just in case.

265
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,900
You should stop by to see him.

266
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,170
Se Young seemed to be
putting up a fight all alone.

267
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,870
I'll stop by tonight.

268
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,740
I think Goo Ha Na is
trying to take Eun Chong.

269
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,710
- She wouldn't.
- His depression is just an excuse.

270
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,850
She came to take him from us.

271
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,030
So, Ha Na really came
to take Eun Chong from them?

272
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,770
But she talked as if
she'd never see him again.

273
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,640
Come in.

274
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,710
What did Mother say?

275
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,680
I said it was a misunderstanding,
but she still seemed heartbroken.

276
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,920
I'll visit her
and explain everything.

277
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,720
I said we should register our marriage
after the wedding.

278
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,390
Why did you do this behind my back?

279
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,260
I knew you'd be against this.

280
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,700
If you and I
don't agree on something,

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,160
will you still do everything
as you want?

282
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,630
That's not what I mean.

283
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,040
Aunt Yeo Jin also told me to do it quickly
and adopt Eun Chong.

284
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,940
Do you all think
Ha Na will take Eun Chong away?

285
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,940
Of course.

286
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,380
She sent that text message
and told everything to Mother...

287
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,080
to stop us from adopting Eun Chong.

288
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,710
You don't have evidence
that it's her.

289
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,850
Don't say it like it's the truth.

290
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,180
Are you her spokesperson?

291
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,590
How would I know you left
to register your marriage?

292
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,160
You heard I'd be meeting
my mother-in-law at 2 p.m...

293
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,400
in front of the borough office.

294
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,660
And I came up
with marriage registration...

295
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,170
after hearing that?

296
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,030
There's no other reason to meet
my mom and mother-in-law...

297
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,940
in front of the borough office
after leaving work early.

298
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,070
I wouldn't know.

299
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,410
- Se Young.
- You texted her about us...

300
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,010
and then Ha Na exposed you
as my other man.

301
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,850
Wasn't it the Goo siblings
who made up this scheme?

302
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,280
Why would I do that?

303
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,250
Did I ever stop you
from getting married?

304
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,750
You wanted to stop us
from adopting Eun Chong.

305
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,160
Why are you so sensitive?

306
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,590
I understand that
it's because of your pregnancy,

307
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,730
but this is just a delusion.

308
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,960
I don't trust you anymore.

309
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,870
I can't help you
with the security server clearance.

310
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,100
What do you want?

311
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,810
Help me adopt Eun Chong.

312
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,220
Jin Goo said
it was a misunderstanding, right?

313
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,820
They just dated briefly
back in America.

314
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,420
Just know that I'm doing my best
not to call this engagement off.

315
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,160
If you want to nitpick over this,
it's not like...

316
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,690
Jin Goo hasn't dated other women.

317
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,800
Se Young dated him in the past,
but Jin Goo's deal is still ongoing.

318
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,870
- What are you talking about?
- I mean Goo Ha Na!

319
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,670
Come to think of it,

320
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,210
the Goo siblings are always
the problem.

321
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,410
It's not like Jin Goo cheated on her
with Goo Ha Na!

322
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,640
Who knows?

323
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,180
There's no evidence in both cases.

324
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,150
I have a lot more to say,
but I won't.

325
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,790
Yes, Bang Ul.

326
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:32,160
Let's be wise and let it go quietly
for our grandchild's sake.

327
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,030
And let's register their marriage
since we couldn't do it yesterday.

328
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,430
- No.
- Why not?

329
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,830
I hear the trend is
to register the marriage...

330
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,230
after living together
for at least a year.

331
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,070
They need to adopt Eun Chong!

332
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,940
I'm not doing this for me.

333
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,710
It's for our children
and grandchild.

334
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,980
Forget it.
Jin Goo doesn't want to do it,

335
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,440
and I don't want it, either.

336
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,110
Will you go against
what the chairwoman wants?

337
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,350
You need to leave.
I have to lie down.

338
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,460
What can I do
to help Mother get over this?

339
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,960
I don't want to be
a daughter-in-law who cheated.

340
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:12,800
Your weapon is your pregnancy.

341
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,100
You need to use that.

342
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:16,970
How?

343
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,300
You can visit her after work...

344
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,540
and cry a river while denying this.

345
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,240
If that doesn't work,

346
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,410
- roll down the stairs.
- No.

347
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,280
You need to do something
to make her feel bad for you.

348
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,650
She won't say anything
if you say you almost lost the baby.

349
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,820
But you're telling me
to roll down the stairs.

350
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,090
What if I get hurt?

351
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:41,190
You have to handle it cleverly.

352
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,140
Come on.

353
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,380
Eun Chong, what's your hobby?

354
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,010
Playing with Auntie Ha Na.

355
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:05,780
What's your specialty?

356
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,150
Having lots of fun
with Auntie Ha Na.

357
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,020
Come on.

358
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,390
Your teacher might think
you were joking.

359
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,430
But I wasn't joking. It's true.

360
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:18,700
Hey, you.

361
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,630
Will you say that for everything?

362
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:23,000
What are you up to, Eun Chong?

363
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,940
You're here.

364
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,470
Hello.

365
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,310
"Home Survey?"

366
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,750
(Student Home Survey)

367
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,020
(Mother: Goo Ha Na)

368
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,450
I need to see you.

369
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,870
You need to let him write that
with Se Young, not you.

370
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,540
Why did you write down your name
as his mother?

371
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,940
I warned you
not to cross over the line.

372
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,970
Are you ignoring me?

373
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,280
Eun Chong wanted to do that,
so I told him to write it down.

374
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,450
Stop using him as an excuse.
This was what you wanted.

375
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:12,350
You came here
to treat him for his depression,

376
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,820
not to be his mom.

377
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,950
Know your place.

378
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:19,790
And did you tell him
that I was a liar?

379
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:20,860
No.

380
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,090
He has the ability
to come to his own conclusions.

381
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,660
You must've told a lie.

382
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,730
- What?
- You lied to him and said...

383
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,600
I was getting married.

384
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,140
I had to do that
to keep him with me.

385
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,410
At any rate, it was a lie.

386
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:42,280
Do not say anything to him
about me from now on.

387
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:45,620
If he starts to avoid me
or say negative things about me,

388
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,580
I'll think of you as the reason.

389
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:51,250
Then, you'll never see him again,
so you better watch out.

390
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,520
If you separate him
from me by force,

391
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,960
who do you think will suffer more?

392
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,030
You can't even handle
his depression.

393
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,860
Make sure you do your math right.

394
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,300
But you'd know better as
a corporate raider, Ms. Chairwoman.

395
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,400
Shut your mouth.

396
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,300
Do you have evidence?

397
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,740
Ji Seok, our parents, and I are...

398
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,040
the evidence.

399
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,980
If you'll be this reckless,
I don't need you to look after him.

400
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,280
Get out of my house now.

401
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,580
That's a breach of contract.

402
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,680
- Do you want compensation?
- What about Eun Chong?

403
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,890
If I leave,
can you take good care of him?

404
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,620
Do not use him to threaten me.

405
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:28,130
Using him as a means of threat
is your specialty.

406
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,190
Get out!

407
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,540
Grandma and Auntie,
are you two fighting?

408
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,200
Yes.

409
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,910
She did the wrong thing,

410
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,080
but she began to shout
and get mad at me.

411
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,080
She must be a liar and a bully.

412
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,620
No, we're just talking.

413
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:58,890
Grandma, don't yell at her.

414
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,430
I'll hate you
if you get mad at Auntie Ha Na.

415
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,070
Eun Chong, let's go back
to filling out the home survey.

416
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:15,210
That cunning and evil brat.

417
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,110
She ruined Eun Chong.

418
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,380
Ms. Jang.

419
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,620
Sign the contract
with Goo Ha Na's siblings now.

420
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,290
This is insane, right? Whoa!

421
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,260
Where have you been?

422
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
You left the business empty.

423
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,700
Hey, Ji Seok. You're here.

424
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,500
- We went out briefly.
- Yes.

425
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,540
You told us to take
whatever Chairwoman Shin offered.

426
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:54,810
And? Did you take something other
than the funds for this business?

427
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,910
- No!
- No!

428
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,720
Don't take any additional investment
even if she offers it.

429
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,790
Why not?

430
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,790
Is there a problem?

431
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,620
Don't. It's dangerous.

432
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,420
Remember that.

433
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,590
- Okay.
- Okay.

434
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,060
And call me if anything happens.

435
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,660
- Bye.
- Okay.

436
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,100
- Then, bye, Ji Seok.
- Bye.

437
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,640
But we already signed the contract.
What do we do?

438
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:27,780
What did he mean
when he said it was dangerous?

439
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:28,880
He's scaring us for no reason.

440
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,520
This is a secret between us.

441
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,090
Did you find the entry record...

442
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,890
- for Chairwoman Shin's husband?
- No, sir.

443
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,900
I thought he could've entered
under an alias.

444
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,100
He'd want to be near his grandson.

445
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,170
What do you think, Mr. Han?

446
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,540
That's true.

447
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,670
Even if he wasn't nearby,

448
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,840
he'd be near enough to see him
whenever he wanted.

449
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,640
Why don't you use Hwang Jin Goo?

450
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,650
- Hwang Jin Goo?
- He may be...

451
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,510
Chairwoman Shin's
most faithful associate,

452
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,780
but he's also the most upright.

453
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,550
He recently came and asked me
to share information...

454
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,020
on her corporate raids.

455
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,890
I turned him down for now,
but should I use him?

456
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,330
He'll be useful
as her most trusted associate.

457
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,930
But I wonder if he'll betray her.

458
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:26,100
I think there's a chance
if he came to see you.

459
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,540
I'll keep an eye on him.

460
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,120
I'm here to see Eun Chong.

461
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,520
He's in his playroom.

462
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,090
May I talk to you for a moment?

463
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:52,860
I heard you also knew
about Director Goo and Se Young.

464
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,500
I found out recently.

465
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,500
I must've seemed like a total fool.

466
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,810
You aren't the fool.

467
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,110
Se Young is at fault.

468
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,910
I heard you told my mom
about the relationship...

469
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,410
between Mr. Goo
and Se Young yesterday.

470
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,950
Why did you do that?

471
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,950
- Was that wrong?
- No.

472
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,190
I was wondering
if you had another intention.

473
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,520
"Another intention?"

474
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,560
Se Young thinks you're against
her adopting Eun Chong.

475
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,790
She's right.

476
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,000
I understood how she said
it was a misunderstanding and slander,

477
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,870
but she began
to shift the blame on you...

478
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,140
by saying nobody knew
what you and I did.

479
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,740
That was why.

480
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,880
I see.

481
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,680
Your mother seemed quite shocked.

482
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,750
How is she?

483
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,480
She told me
to call off the engagement.

484
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,250
I like you, Ha Na.

485
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,390
If I'm to marry anyone,
I want to marry you.

486
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,900
I'm not going to call it off.

487
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,130
I want to protect the child.

488
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,430
I see.

489
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,800
Take good care of Eun Chong
when you marry her.

490
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,680
By any chance, do you still
want to be Eun Chong's mom?

491
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,010
Why do you ask?

492
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:17,650
I want to know how you really feel.

493
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,650
Did Se Young make you ask?

494
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,450
- Or was it the chairwoman?
- I was curious.

495
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,790
If I say yes, will you help me?

496
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,100
Can you take my side?

497
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,400
Mother, please believe me.

498
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,140
I'm getting framed.

499
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,340
I would've called this off already
if it hadn't been for Jin Goo.

500
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:48,850
He wouldn't marry me
if I really cheated on him.

501
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,850
There was a misunderstanding
while we were working together.

502
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,520
I didn't cheat on him.

503
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,650
Do you swear
on the child you're pregnant with?

504
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,320
Of course, Mother.
I swear on my Star.

505
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,920
I began to get suspicious
of your child...

506
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,830
as soon as I heard
of your unfaithfulness.

507
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,730
Jin Goo isn't stupid.

508
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,730
He wouldn't be fooled
over something like this.

509
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,570
If anything, we can run
a parentage test after I give birth.

510
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,740
And it's really miserable
for Star and me...

511
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,770
to say something like this,

512
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,210
but I can do anything
to clear my name.

513
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,480
I have to go to my restaurant
for a group reservation at dinner.

514
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,750
Mother, so you believe me, right?

515
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,790
You need to go home.

516
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,520
I'll be outside.

517
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,440
Darn it. She can be stubborn
once she gets mad.

518
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,010
You need to do something
to make her feel bad for you.

519
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,180
She won't say anything
if you say you almost lost the baby.

520
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,020
Mom was right.

521
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:07,590
I'll roll down the stairs.

522
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,750
Goodness, Se Young! Oh, my.

523
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,390
Goodness, what happened? Hey.

524
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,990
I rolled down the stairs.

525
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,360
- My goodness.
- My baby.

526
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:44,960
My baby...

527
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:48,700
I don't think you're bleeding,

528
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,770
but you need to see a doctor.
Get up.

529
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,470
I can't walk, Mother.

530
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,940
I'll call my mom and my doctor here.

531
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,640
Goodness, but you can't sit here.

532
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,710
Get up. Lean on me.

533
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,880
Goodness, what do we do?

534
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,780
Hey, come on.

535
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:13,460
There's no bleeding or pain,
so this isn't a critical situation.

536
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,890
But she needs to rest
while we keep an eye on her.

537
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,230
You better take a few days off
and get some rest.

538
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,470
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

539
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,440
It's a huge relief
that the baby is fine.

540
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,970
Please come on out.

541
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,010
Thank you.

542
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,220
Mother, I'm sorry for the shock.

543
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,490
You don't have to apologize to me.

544
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,760
I was so worried something bad
might happen to you and the baby.

545
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,430
How did you end up
rolling down the stairs?

546
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,230
I was wondering what I could do
to undo her misunderstanding,

547
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,340
then I missed my footing.

548
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,340
My gosh. There's no elevator
in this building.

549
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,480
We almost lost our baby
because she came to see you.

550
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,750
But I guess this was a lucky kid.

551
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,720
The baby stuck around
without any trouble.

552
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,350
Yes, we were very lucky.

553
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,220
Why don't you have some porridge?

554
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,160
You said
you had to go to the restaurant.

555
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,860
I'll get some food for her.

556
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,990
Just wait.

557
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,440
Your mother-in-law is
in total shock.

558
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,710
She'll stop talking about
how you cheated.

559
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,440
The floor was so cold.

560
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,510
I'm aching all over.

561
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,110
Good work.

562
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,220
Auntie Ha Na, let's play
hide-and-seek with Mr. Hwang.

563
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,650
He's talking to Grandma.

564
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:51,820
We can start first.

565
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,120
- Let's stay on the second floor.
- Okay.

566
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,090
- Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

567
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,400
I won!

568
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,530
Then, I'm it. Okay.

569
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,110
<i>You better hide well</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

570
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,440
<i>You better hide well</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

571
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,180
Are you ready?

572
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,120
It's the baby tummy.

573
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,390
<i>You better hide well</i>
<i>I'm coming for you</i>

574
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,130
Auntie Ha Na.

575
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:35,870
Why didn't you hide?

576
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,670
This is the baby tummy.

577
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,670
"The baby tummy?"

578
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:43,640
What's this?

579
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,240
Where did you find this?

580
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,810
In Little Grandma's room.

581
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,480
"Little Grandma's room?"

582
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,350
But your baby fell.

583
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,990
What?

584
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:00,320
Eun Chong, last time,
you said the baby fell.

585
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,790
How did the baby fall?

586
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,830
Auntie Se Young
had this around her tummy,

587
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,130
then she dropped it when I saw her.

588
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,310
Wait, is Se Young...

589
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,250
faking her pregnancy?

590
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,790
What are you up to?

591
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,830
What's that?

592
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,080
(Cinderella Game)

593
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,320
Did you forget that I was his mom?

594
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,920
Are you doing this
to rub it into my face?

595
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,320
Don't register your marriage.

596
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,620
What do you get
from stressing me out?

597
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,660
Do you want the worst
to happen to the baby?

598
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,400
- Did you just laugh?
- Se Young and Eun Chong will...

599
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,630
share a room starting today.

600
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:49,230
I don't want to.
You're really bad, Grandma!

601
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,370
Eun Chong turned into
Goo Ha Na's toy.

602
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,270
- Set up everything.
- She's faking her pregnancy?

603
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:56,040
Both the marriage
and the adoption are over.

604
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,910
A woman who got married
by faking her pregnancy.

605
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,740
Se Young's life will be over, too.

606
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,310
I'll buy you an herbal tonic
that's great for pregnant women.

607
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,680
Mom, please save me from here.

608
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,150
She won't get to leave in one piece
after messing with me under my roof.

609
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,350
- Then, what?
- It's your choice.

610
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:12,920
How do you call yourself human?
