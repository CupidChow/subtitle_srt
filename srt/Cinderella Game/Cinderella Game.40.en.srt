00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,468
(Episode 40)

2
00:00:06,469 --> 00:00:07,728
My gosh.

3
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:11,239
Welcome, Eun Chong.

4
00:00:11,368 --> 00:00:13,239
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

5
00:00:13,739 --> 00:00:15,669
You should call me Grandma from now on.

6
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:17,438
Okay, Grandma.

7
00:00:17,978 --> 00:00:20,379
- Auntie Ha Na, I have to pee. - I see.

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:21,779
Come with me.

9
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:33,029
Welcome home, Yu Jin.

10
00:00:37,959 --> 00:00:39,469
Thank you for coming.

11
00:00:43,268 --> 00:00:45,838
Is Yu Jin here?

12
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:47,438
Oh, my.

13
00:00:48,868 --> 00:00:51,179
Let me see you, Yu Jin.

14
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,879
You should meet your aunt.

15
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,358
Hello.

16
00:01:04,289 --> 00:01:05,358
What?

17
00:01:06,728 --> 00:01:08,558
You're...

18
00:01:09,858 --> 00:01:11,799
You're Head Director Goo's...

19
00:01:12,998 --> 00:01:15,228
It's nice to see you, Yoon Se Young.

20
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:17,838
You're...

21
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:21,269
Yu Jin?

22
00:01:21,608 --> 00:01:22,778
You're Yu Jin?

23
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,307
My goodness!

24
00:01:25,308 --> 00:01:28,549
Se Young.

25
00:01:31,819 --> 00:01:33,149
- My goodness. - Se Young.

26
00:01:34,918 --> 00:01:37,088
Se Young, are you okay?

27
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,429
Are you okay, Ms. Yoon?

28
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:46,599
Se Young.

29
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:49,799
It's okay. I'm here.

30
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:52,439
No.

31
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,808
Goodness, she's still not herself.

32
00:01:55,978 --> 00:01:58,738
Yeo Jin, let me take her to the room.

33
00:01:59,349 --> 00:02:00,448
Sure.

34
00:02:23,898 --> 00:02:26,138
Are you okay? Have you come to yourself?

35
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:28,369
- No. - Se Young.

36
00:02:32,648 --> 00:02:34,708
- You may leave. - I'll stay.

37
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,518
Just go see the chairwoman.

38
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,418
Let me know if you need me.

39
00:02:47,289 --> 00:02:48,488
That jerk.

40
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:51,398
He should've tipped us off.

41
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,029
Mom.

42
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:55,529
This is a dream, right?

43
00:02:57,768 --> 00:02:59,469
Please tell me that it's a dream.

44
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:04,809
It's a dream.

45
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:07,279
It's a dream that'll shatter in a short while.

46
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,249
I never expected that brat to come in.

47
00:03:13,619 --> 00:03:14,948
This is beyond imagination.

48
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,888
Why did it have to be that brat?

49
00:03:20,388 --> 00:03:24,797
Mom, is Goo Ha Na really Yu Jin?

50
00:03:24,798 --> 00:03:26,928
No, that brat is a fraud!

51
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,499
It doesn't matter who Yu Jin is.

52
00:03:32,499 --> 00:03:33,569
It doesn't matter who comes.

53
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:35,978
It'll be fine as long as nothing happens.

54
00:03:36,809 --> 00:03:38,608
How can Goo Ha Na be...

55
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,678
I just want to kill myself.

56
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:46,948
That brat doesn't remember anything.

57
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:50,559
You have to pull yourself together and get ready to fight.

58
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:53,559
Will you let her steal everything?

59
00:03:54,328 --> 00:03:57,198
No, I don't want that.

60
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,828
So, you need to pull yourself together quickly.

61
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,339
She must've come in knowing that she's a fake.

62
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:07,408
You shouldn't have moved in.

63
00:04:10,078 --> 00:04:11,708
Ms. Yoon...

64
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:15,479
Se Young must've been really shocked.

65
00:04:16,619 --> 00:04:20,048
Even so, the fact that you're Yu Jin isn't something to faint over.

66
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,489
We've had quite a history, so it must be shocking for her.

67
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:27,189
That lady is marrying Mr. Hwang, right?

68
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:28,758
How did you know?

69
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,129
Ms. Bang Ul told me.

70
00:04:32,158 --> 00:04:35,569
But I said you were prettier, Auntie Ha Na.

71
00:04:43,038 --> 00:04:45,278
So, how's Se Young?

72
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:47,708
Well, she seemed rather startled.

73
00:04:48,249 --> 00:04:49,979
She'll be fine after getting some rest.

74
00:04:50,379 --> 00:04:51,479
All right.

75
00:04:52,989 --> 00:04:55,017
You know we'll keep your identity...

76
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,788
as my daughter a secret at work for a while, right?

77
00:04:59,218 --> 00:05:02,798
Tell Se Young not to make a mistake at work.

78
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:03,898
Yes.

79
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:06,129
- You can do things as usual. - Yes.

80
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:09,798
Ha Na, why don't I call you Yu Jin when we're at home?

81
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:11,838
- Is that okay? - It is.

82
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:14,538
Why is your name Yu Jin?

83
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,078
My childhood name was Yoon Yu Jin.

84
00:05:19,239 --> 00:05:20,609
Yoon Yu Jin.

85
00:05:22,648 --> 00:05:25,179
Eun Chong, do you want to come and sit next to me?

86
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,588
This will be your home from now on.

87
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,488
You can tell me...

88
00:05:35,489 --> 00:05:37,498
everything you want to do, everything you want to have,

89
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:39,598
and everything you want to eat.

90
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:42,299
Can I do that, Auntie Ha Na?

91
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,239
If I say it's fine, then it means it is.

92
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:52,278
Yes.

93
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,049
Where's Auntie Ha Na and my room?

94
00:05:58,148 --> 00:06:01,819
Gosh. How am I going to associate with Goo Ha Na from now on?

95
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:04,119
Think of yourself as an actor.

96
00:06:04,559 --> 00:06:06,929
You've rehearsed this role over and over again,

97
00:06:07,828 --> 00:06:09,428
and you finally got to perform it on stage.

98
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:12,527
Goo Ha Na is the princess, and I'm her lady-in-waiting?

99
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:13,869
What's so bad about playing her lady-in-waiting?

100
00:06:14,268 --> 00:06:16,169
Hyesung Group is about to become yours.

101
00:06:16,768 --> 00:06:18,669
I can even sell my soul.

102
00:06:19,768 --> 00:06:21,038
Just put up a good act.

103
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:23,578
Then, you'll always be the princess, right now...

104
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:26,578
and even in the future.

105
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,309
I still don't want to do that.

106
00:06:29,448 --> 00:06:31,979
I just want everything to be a nightmare.

107
00:06:33,749 --> 00:06:35,287
Stop acting so weak.

108
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:37,088
Would you want to live if you were in my shoes?

109
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,457
It's not just anyone. It's Goo Ha Na!

110
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,328
- I really want to kill myself! - Then, kill yourself!

111
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:45,729
What a great idea. I wanted to kill myself, too.

112
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,739
It'd be so simple and easy if we died on the same day.

113
00:06:50,138 --> 00:06:51,369
No one will find out...

114
00:06:51,698 --> 00:06:54,138
you were the reason why we lost Yu Jin.

115
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:56,479
We won't get kicked out...

116
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,239
and have to live as homeless people and fugitives.

117
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,609
And, of course, we won't go to prison.

118
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:05,679
All I ever do is clean up after you,

119
00:07:06,588 --> 00:07:08,919
yet you always shudder when you hear Yu Jin's name.

120
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,759
I'm tired of this, too.

121
00:07:13,989 --> 00:07:15,859
All right. Let's die.

122
00:07:17,359 --> 00:07:18,499
We'll kill ourselves.

123
00:07:18,658 --> 00:07:20,098
Mom.

124
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:24,668
Now that you brought it up, we should do it tonight.

125
00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:26,368
What's wrong with you, Mom?

126
00:07:26,369 --> 00:07:27,739
I'm sick and tired of this, too!

127
00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:30,038
I'm tired of this, too.

128
00:07:30,778 --> 00:07:32,038
You said you wanted to die.

129
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:34,078
Make your choice.

130
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,318
Will it be tonight or tomorrow night?

131
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,347
No, why should I die?

132
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:39,887
If anyone should die, it should be Goo Ha Na!

133
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:43,319
How will you win against Goo Ha Na with this kind of attitude?

134
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:45,319
I lived my life...

135
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:48,129
just for you.

136
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:51,957
Do you know what I had to do just because I wanted to leave...

137
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,598
Hyesung Group to you?

138
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:57,138
If this is all you can do,

139
00:07:58,398 --> 00:08:00,707
then let Goo Ha Na have it all and end everything here.

140
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:01,809
I don't want that!

141
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:04,408
I won't let her steal anything.

142
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:07,049
I'm going to take everything.

143
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:12,888
I'm sorry, Mom.

144
00:08:13,718 --> 00:08:15,448
Mom, I'm sorry.

145
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,729
I'm sorry, Mom.

146
00:08:23,898 --> 00:08:25,359
Will you pull yourself together?

147
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:28,199
Then, what should you do?

148
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:31,568
I need to do...

149
00:08:32,908 --> 00:08:34,067
as you say.

150
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,209
Wipe your tears.

151
00:08:37,538 --> 00:08:38,678
And don't shed them anymore.

152
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:47,349
But Goo Ha Na is Aunt Yeo Jin's daughter.

153
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:50,859
How can I push her out...

154
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,828
and take her position?

155
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,729
You did it 20 years ago.

156
00:08:57,298 --> 00:08:58,428
You can do it again.

157
00:09:03,869 --> 00:09:05,839
The silent war begins now.

158
00:09:06,239 --> 00:09:08,408
This war will never stop...

159
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,808
before someone dies in this house.

160
00:09:12,308 --> 00:09:13,879
Then, who should die?

161
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:15,908
Of course, it's Goo Ha Na.

162
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:21,888
Gosh, it's a bed!

163
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:27,028
Gosh.

164
00:09:31,298 --> 00:09:32,729
Do you like it, Yu Jin?

165
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,969
Yes, I love it.

166
00:09:37,499 --> 00:09:38,599
Thank you.

167
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:41,709
- May I climb on the bed? - Yes.

168
00:09:41,808 --> 00:09:42,869
Of course.

169
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:51,178
Gosh, it's a piano.

170
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:54,418
- Do you want to play the piano? - Yes.

171
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,619
You can teach him.

172
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,028
She doesn't play the piano.

173
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:03,298
She used to play it often as a kid. Did you stop when you grew up?

174
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:05,358
Yes.

175
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:07,298
But you even participated in competitions. Why is that?

176
00:10:10,999 --> 00:10:12,599
Eun Chong, do you want to try playing it?

177
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:15,538
That's the piano your mommy used to play.

178
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:29,818
Eun Chong, stop it.

179
00:10:31,359 --> 00:10:32,459
Okay.

180
00:10:33,188 --> 00:10:34,329
What's wrong?

181
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,459
It's nothing.

182
00:10:54,178 --> 00:10:55,278
It's okay.

183
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:57,018
I can do this.

184
00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:02,619
Yu Jin.

185
00:11:09,359 --> 00:11:10,428
It's okay.

186
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:13,068
I have to do this.

187
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:17,839
The silent war begins now.

188
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:21,138
This war will never stop before someone dies in this house.

189
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:31,418
Fine. It's all or nothing. I've been cornered.

190
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:34,048
I won't let Goo Ha Na take anything.

191
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:35,888
Everything will be mine.

192
00:11:48,329 --> 00:11:51,568
Eun Chong, this was your mommy's room...

193
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:54,339
when she was about your age.

194
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,047
I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

195
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:02,979
Se Young feels better now.

196
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:05,277
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

197
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:06,918
You must've been surprised.

198
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,219
I'm glad you're fine.

199
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,989
Yeo Jin, are you crying?

200
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:17,699
It feels like a dream to stand in this room with Yu Jin.

201
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,298
It's been 20 years.

202
00:12:24,469 --> 00:12:26,709
- Mom... - I'm just that happy.

203
00:12:28,109 --> 00:12:30,308
Are they putting on an act because we're here?

204
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:33,808
Goo Ha Na is something, too.

205
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:37,548
Of course, you'll feel that way.

206
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,688
Seeing her here...

207
00:12:41,989 --> 00:12:43,318
makes me choke up, too.

208
00:12:46,388 --> 00:12:47,427
Yu Jin.

209
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:49,489
I'm not such a bad actor myself.

210
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:52,298
I had no idea you were Yu Jin.

211
00:12:53,798 --> 00:12:55,599
I'm sorry for treating you so harshly.

212
00:12:57,398 --> 00:12:58,798
I felt so ashamed and sorry...

213
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:02,668
for everything I did, even though I was your aunt.

214
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:05,379
You didn't know it was me.

215
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:09,048
Yu Jin, I'm sorry, too.

216
00:13:09,678 --> 00:13:12,318
I've been too immature to this day.

217
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:13,918
I apologize sincerely.

218
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:17,719
But I'll be good to you from now on.

219
00:13:18,119 --> 00:13:19,589
We'll talk later.

220
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,958
Okay.

221
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,829
She's already in high spirits.

222
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:27,369
This fake girl is so brazen.

223
00:13:27,999 --> 00:13:31,098
Se Young, you should apologize if you mistreated her in any way...

224
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:33,568
- in the meantime. - Yes, Aunt Yeo Jin.

225
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:36,609
Yes, of course, she will.

226
00:13:36,908 --> 00:13:38,538
They're like sisters.

227
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,178
They shouldn't leave misunderstandings.

228
00:13:41,979 --> 00:13:44,619
Se Young, you should help her unpack.

229
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:45,818
Of course.

230
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:49,187
Eun Chong, do you want a tour of the house?

231
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:50,288
Yes.

232
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:52,318
Let's go.

233
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:04,998
So, Mr. Goo's father's business definitely isn't on the list?

234
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:08,368
No, but many businesses back then changed their names...

235
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,208
from So-and-So Distribution to Logistics and Company...

236
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:12,009
to take out more loans,

237
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:15,509
so I looked through every single one and found nothing.

238
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:16,778
That's a relief.

239
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,918
If Mr. Goo really holds a grudge against Hyesung,

240
00:14:20,188 --> 00:14:24,018
it'll be so tragic for Ms. Goo and Eun Chong.

241
00:14:29,188 --> 00:14:30,398
- Please take your call. - Thanks.

242
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,398
- Yes, Mom. - Has her daughter arrived?

243
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:35,598
Yes.

244
00:14:35,599 --> 00:14:38,668
What's she like? I'm dying to find out.

245
00:14:39,568 --> 00:14:42,068
Can you at least take a picture of her and show me?

246
00:14:42,138 --> 00:14:44,407
You'd be surprised to see her.

247
00:14:44,408 --> 00:14:46,648
Why? Is she that pretty?

248
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:48,408
Yes, she is.

249
00:14:48,479 --> 00:14:51,849
She's the chairwoman's daughter, so of course, she's pretty.

250
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,387
What's her personality like?

251
00:14:53,388 --> 00:14:54,749
She's healthy and bright.

252
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:57,588
If she was pretty and good-natured,

253
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,018
she must've grown very well.

254
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,658
Mom, let's talk at home.

255
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,028
I'll be there before dinner.

256
00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:04,928
Okay.

257
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:16,209
I must've seemed like a joke...

258
00:15:16,609 --> 00:15:18,538
while she hid her identity as Yu Jin.

259
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:22,879
You can leave if you feel uncomfortable.

260
00:15:24,018 --> 00:15:25,079
What?

261
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:27,018
Why are you nibbling on your nails?

262
00:15:27,449 --> 00:15:28,818
You look really nervous.

263
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:32,589
No, it's nothing. It was a habit I got as a child...

264
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:39,027
Did you accept my apology or not?

265
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:41,229
Would you have apologized...

266
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:42,829
if I weren't Yu Jin?

267
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,099
I wouldn't have.

268
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,239
I apologized because you were Yu Jin.

269
00:15:46,398 --> 00:15:48,709
So, because you were her, I meant what I said.

270
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:53,038
I don't know if that makes sense, but that's honesty.

271
00:15:53,808 --> 00:15:56,918
You apologized because I was Yu Jin and not Goo Ha Na?

272
00:15:57,579 --> 00:15:58,718
That was something you'd say.

273
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,048
So, are you accepting it or not?

274
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:06,959
If you were offended, I apologize.

275
00:16:07,489 --> 00:16:09,187
What can I do to make you feel better?

276
00:16:09,188 --> 00:16:12,057
I'm really unsure, so please tell me.

277
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:13,668
If I tell you, will you do everything?

278
00:16:14,469 --> 00:16:15,629
I'll do my best.

279
00:16:18,768 --> 00:16:22,068
Do you want to get along with me in the future?

280
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:26,109
- Of course. - If you want us to get along now,

281
00:16:26,638 --> 00:16:28,849
then we need to settle our past first.

282
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:30,718
"Settle our past?"

283
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,548
Yes, or you can call it settling our account.

284
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:36,188
You aren't going to just say sorry...

285
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,288
for everything you did wrong to me, are you?

286
00:16:40,888 --> 00:16:43,729
First, you slapped me twice.

287
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:46,657
Physical assault, workplace harassment,

288
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,199
and psychological abuse.

289
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:50,768
I've been so patient.

290
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,338
Why was I so patient like a fool?

291
00:16:53,739 --> 00:16:56,739
Even you asked how long I was going to be patient.

292
00:16:57,209 --> 00:17:00,909
Right, didn't you also call me pathetically patient?

293
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,348
- It's... - I told you, didn't I?

294
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:05,219
That I'd only be patient until that day.

295
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,389
- Do you remember? - Yes.

296
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:11,218
You won't have to be patient from now on.

297
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:12,219
That's my job now.

298
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,729
So? How do you want to settle our history?

299
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:20,328
I have to think about it.

300
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,899
So, you know that you're the top dog now?

301
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:26,538
All right. Think about it and let me know.

302
00:17:29,639 --> 00:17:30,709
What's this?

303
00:17:31,338 --> 00:17:32,479
Those are Eun Chong's things.

304
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,909
Why did you bring your nephew's stuff?

305
00:17:36,449 --> 00:17:39,048
Wait, is he going to live here, too?

306
00:17:41,048 --> 00:17:42,919
Gosh, are these all mine?

307
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:46,517
I didn't know what you'd like, so I got this and that.

308
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:47,959
- Do you like them? - Yes.

309
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:49,659
Hey, it's Lego.

310
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:53,729
Do you like to play with Lego?

311
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:57,538
Your mommy loved Lego, too.

312
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:00,608
- Grandma, can you open this? - Sure.

313
00:18:01,068 --> 00:18:03,638
Have you built lots of Lego?

314
00:18:03,639 --> 00:18:06,509
Auntie Ha Na bought some for me in the secondhand market.

315
00:18:06,739 --> 00:18:07,877
"Secondhand market?"

316
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,308
That's the cheapest place.

317
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:12,377
Is that a market near your place?

318
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:14,419
It's an online market for used products.

319
00:18:15,088 --> 00:18:17,488
I'm sure your neighborhood has one, too.

320
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:18,788
"A market for used products?"

321
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:21,527
A place where people sell the things they've used?

322
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:24,199
Yes, Ms. Bang Ul is good at it, too.

323
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:27,828
She said it was rather fun to sell things there.

324
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:29,567
I see.

325
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,568
I'll teach you how to do it later.

326
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:35,469
Hey, that was the sticker I put on you.

327
00:18:35,568 --> 00:18:38,338
Yes, you're right. You put it on me.

328
00:18:38,578 --> 00:18:39,838
What's that?

329
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,149
This? It's a massage bed for when you're tired.

330
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:47,048
Gosh. I used to give massages to Auntie Ha Na when she was tired.

331
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:48,787
How do you use this?

332
00:18:48,788 --> 00:18:49,889
Do you want to see it?

333
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:58,459
You lie down...

334
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,499
like this and get massages.

335
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,538
When you're done, it keeps you relaxed as you come up.

336
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:15,378
- Gosh, does it feel good, Grandma? - Yes.

337
00:19:15,808 --> 00:19:17,848
It melts my stress away.

338
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,078
My gosh.

339
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:22,689
- Do you want to try it? - Yes.

340
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:27,889
Do you really have no memories of your childhood?

341
00:19:28,088 --> 00:19:30,399
- Why? - I'm just asking.

342
00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:33,828
You never ask questions without a reason.

343
00:19:34,628 --> 00:19:37,168
If you want an answer from me, ask me exactly that.

344
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,267
Stop beating around the bush, feeling me out,

345
00:19:39,268 --> 00:19:40,409
or trying to read my mind.

346
00:19:40,608 --> 00:19:41,909
I hate it when people do that.

347
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:43,939
Hey, Goo Ha Na.

348
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,778
I get that you're Yu Jin, but you aren't even a big deal!

349
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:50,009
No, Yoon Se Young! I am a big deal.

350
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,518
My mom is Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin.

351
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:55,248
You're just here to live off my mom.

352
00:19:55,249 --> 00:19:56,989
How dare you treat me with disdain and look down on me?

353
00:19:57,219 --> 00:20:00,659
I'd make you pay for what you did for a very long time.

354
00:20:09,729 --> 00:20:12,838
If you remember, say yes, and if you don't, say no.

355
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,509
You don't have to make it difficult.

356
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:16,409
No, not at all.

357
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,139
Really?

358
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,278
Do I have to remember something?

359
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,318
No.

360
00:20:32,459 --> 00:20:34,958
How was it? Did you do well?

361
00:20:34,959 --> 00:20:37,558
Yes, she doesn't remember anything from her childhood.

362
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,229
I told you so.

363
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:42,768
No one will find out as long as we do everything right.

364
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,469
Even if she remembers something,

365
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:49,669
how can anyone believe her?

366
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:52,338
- She can't prove it. - You're right.

367
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:57,618
Right. Her nephew is also moving in.

368
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,117
What?

369
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:01,088
She packed all his stuff, too.

370
00:21:01,189 --> 00:21:02,749
She must be out of her mind.

371
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:06,318
A fake daughter with a kid?

372
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:09,828
What if her siblings all barge in, too?

373
00:21:14,128 --> 00:21:16,828
I can't believe I get to see you and own you in real life.

374
00:21:17,538 --> 00:21:19,038
How moving is this?

375
00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:25,108
No one buys things with such a huge logo now.

376
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:26,938
Everyone is dropping the logo.

377
00:21:26,939 --> 00:21:28,278
Quiet luxury.

378
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:30,748
Hey, why do you think people put on luxury goods?

379
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:33,378
If no one knows what it is, who cares if it's a luxury brand?

380
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:36,818
Gosh, I knew you were old-fashioned and tacky.

381
00:21:38,419 --> 00:21:41,127
Today, I shopped. Tomorrow, a fine dining restaurant.

382
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:42,688
In two days, I'm going to a spa and seeing a dermatologist!

383
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:46,498
Hey, maybe I should buy a car.

384
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:49,728
Hey, at this rate, she'll give us cars soon.

385
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:51,837
- Just stick around. - Are you serious?

386
00:21:51,838 --> 00:21:54,838
Hey, what if she gives us each an apartment unit?

387
00:21:57,878 --> 00:21:59,277
Hey, I'm feeling great.

388
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,108
For the sake of my babies, I forgive you for the immoral act...

389
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:05,818
of pulling my hair out.

390
00:22:06,278 --> 00:22:09,449
All right. As a member of the Hyesung family,

391
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:11,889
I will show dignity and forgive you.

392
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,088
- "A member of the Hyesung family?" - Yes.

393
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:18,327
Ha Na is the heiress of Hyesung Group,

394
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,159
so that automatically makes us a part of the family.

395
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:22,499
Of course!

396
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:27,138
Right. I'll leave these in Ha Na's room, so don't touch it.

397
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,338
Are you going to live here?

398
00:22:28,969 --> 00:22:31,108
No, I have to keep this a secret from Ji Seok.

399
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,878
He told us not to take even a penny.

400
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:35,979
It's his loss if he doesn't want to take it.

401
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:39,518
Anyway, keep it a secret from Ji Seok.

402
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,588
My gosh.

403
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,018
Mom, Dad.

404
00:22:46,489 --> 00:22:49,159
Our troubles are now over, so don't worry about us.

405
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:53,328
We're now a part of the Hyesung family.

406
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:55,028
Mom, Dad.

407
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:58,399
Do something about Ji Seok.

408
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:00,808
I just don't get it.

409
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:04,138
It's a relief that many businesses were named Youngshin...

410
00:23:04,139 --> 00:23:05,408
on the list of borrowers.

411
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:08,808
Back then, just about every business went through Hyesung Finance.

412
00:23:08,878 --> 00:23:10,678
But still, it could be dangerous.

413
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,179
Why did you call it Youngshin Distribution?

414
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,189
Your father's Youngshin Fashion could've been exposed.

415
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:20,018
I didn't want to change the name of his business.

416
00:23:21,929 --> 00:23:23,899
Today, your sister moved into Chairwoman Shin's place, right?

417
00:23:24,229 --> 00:23:25,258
Yes.

418
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,128
Will you keep it a secret from your siblings?

419
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,568
They'll only get in the way of my revenge if they find out.

420
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:32,838
It will be tough to accept that Ha Na is our enemy's daughter.

421
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,538
And they will get hurt once again.

422
00:23:36,608 --> 00:23:38,777
But you're hurt, too.

423
00:23:38,778 --> 00:23:40,509
It's better that I take the blow alone.

424
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:43,409
You'd be less troubled if you shared it with your siblings.

425
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:46,548
That's harder for me.

426
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:50,689
I hope you like it.

427
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:53,758
I put a lot of thought into everything.

428
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,028
It's delicious.

429
00:23:55,689 --> 00:23:56,889
Isn't it good, Eun Chong?

430
00:23:57,459 --> 00:23:59,729
Yes, it tastes fantastic.

431
00:24:01,068 --> 00:24:03,229
- Take your time and eat up. - Okay.

432
00:24:06,538 --> 00:24:09,068
You may incur suspicion if you show interest in Eun Chong...

433
00:24:09,209 --> 00:24:10,639
from the very beginning.

434
00:24:11,108 --> 00:24:12,808
You should pay more attention to Ms. Goo...

435
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:14,778
and treat her warmly.

436
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:19,018
Eat up.

437
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:22,689
Your aunt prepared everything, especially for you.

438
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:25,759
Yes, everything is good.

439
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:27,429
Thank you.

440
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:30,659
Goodness. You can skip that when you're with family.

441
00:24:30,729 --> 00:24:34,199
Yes, everything here is yours, so enjoy them in peace.

442
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,699
Okay.

443
00:24:35,798 --> 00:24:38,399
You can ask me if you have any questions.

444
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,838
Okay.

445
00:24:45,338 --> 00:24:47,709
She seemed so pleased as she looked at her.

446
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:50,449
Who would believe she was her fake daughter?

447
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:53,348
Wait, was she conned?

448
00:24:54,649 --> 00:24:58,459
Right. I heard her nephew would move in, too.

449
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:02,588
He's just like Yu Jin's son, so he has to move in with her.

450
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,827
You know how they are just like real mom and son, right?

451
00:25:06,828 --> 00:25:10,368
Of course. He's just like a son to Yu Jin.

452
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:11,969
Welcome, Eun Chong.

453
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,067
Okay...

454
00:25:14,068 --> 00:25:15,509
You can call her Auntie Se Young.

455
00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:17,439
The chairwoman is your grandma,

456
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:21,479
so you can call her Little Grandma.

457
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,078
Did I suddenly become a grandma?

458
00:25:24,348 --> 00:25:26,649
This is kind of unfair, Yeo Jin.

459
00:25:27,389 --> 00:25:29,719
We're both getting old. Don't feel sour.

460
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,358
Big Grandma, Little Grandma.

461
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:36,759
You're right.

462
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,959
Look how happy everyone is.

463
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:42,527
What time are we taking the family portrait?

464
00:25:42,528 --> 00:25:43,628
In two hours.

465
00:25:43,699 --> 00:25:45,669
You can get ready after the meal.

466
00:25:46,469 --> 00:25:49,308
Chairwoman Shin will bring her daughter up...

467
00:25:49,538 --> 00:25:50,979
as a warrior, not a princess.

468
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:54,009
I hope Eun Chong and Ms. Goo are happy.

469
00:25:54,878 --> 00:25:56,479
I hope they don't get caught.

470
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:00,078
Sir? Is something troubling you?

471
00:26:00,249 --> 00:26:01,749
What? No.

472
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:03,488
I'm sorry. What did you say?

473
00:26:03,489 --> 00:26:05,888
That Chairwoman Shin will bring her daughter up as a warrior.

474
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:07,018
"A warrior?"

475
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:10,527
Do you mean she will become a corporate raider like her mother?

476
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,598
Yes.

477
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:17,568
Then, you'll end up fighting your sister head-on.

478
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:19,469
Are you sure about this?

479
00:26:19,739 --> 00:26:21,669
Shouldn't you stop here?

480
00:26:22,368 --> 00:26:24,209
I risked my life to come to this moment.

481
00:26:24,608 --> 00:26:26,378
I do not intend to stop in any way.

482
00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:29,949
Fighting isn't the only way to win a war.

483
00:26:30,209 --> 00:26:32,749
There will be ways to win this without fighting your sister.

484
00:26:32,818 --> 00:26:36,047
Are you saying we can cause her to fall on her own?

485
00:26:36,048 --> 00:26:38,159
Yes, so let's not rush it,

486
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:39,688
and find the way first.

487
00:26:39,689 --> 00:26:41,389
I'll look for a way, too, Mr. Goo.

488
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,699
Were you still convinced Chairwoman Shin was scheduled...

489
00:26:45,259 --> 00:26:47,568
- to meet her husband yesterday? - Yes.

490
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:49,127
They didn't meet yesterday,

491
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:51,338
but they would meet soon since she found their daughter.

492
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:53,699
Could the appearance of her husband be...

493
00:26:54,969 --> 00:26:56,368
disadvantageous for her?

494
00:26:56,439 --> 00:26:58,578
We'll have to wait and see...

495
00:26:58,778 --> 00:27:00,578
if he'll benefit or harm her.

496
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,048
All right.

497
00:27:07,518 --> 00:27:09,489
This is my home now.

498
00:27:10,219 --> 00:27:11,389
My mom's home.

499
00:27:16,588 --> 00:27:17,729
That cursed brat.

500
00:27:18,628 --> 00:27:21,068
What kind of a plan has she made with Yeo Jin?

501
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:31,538
Se Young.

502
00:27:32,808 --> 00:27:33,939
Can we talk?

503
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:36,408
Did you have fun stabbing me in the back?

504
00:27:36,409 --> 00:27:37,848
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

505
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:40,278
Se Young.

506
00:27:42,949 --> 00:27:44,058
Let's talk later.

507
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:50,659
Yu Jin, did you unpack everything?

508
00:27:52,358 --> 00:27:54,368
- Yes. - Do you need something?

509
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:56,669
I wanted to use the wireless vacuum cleaner.

510
00:27:56,768 --> 00:27:58,067
"Wireless vacuum cleaner?"

511
00:27:58,068 --> 00:28:00,068
It got really dusty after unpacking.

512
00:28:00,568 --> 00:28:01,668
I wanted to vacuum the room.

513
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:02,939
You don't have to do that.

514
00:28:03,338 --> 00:28:05,739
There's a helper who cleans the place.

515
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:08,548
I should do the things I can.

516
00:28:08,778 --> 00:28:09,878
It won't take long.

517
00:28:10,479 --> 00:28:13,848
Yu Jin, I get it because this is your first day.

518
00:28:14,118 --> 00:28:15,818
But you're Aunt Yeo Jin's daughter.

519
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,347
Everything here is yours.

520
00:28:17,348 --> 00:28:18,759
You should learn to enjoy these.

521
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:21,527
How long will you live like Goo Ha Na?

522
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:22,628
Who cares?

523
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:25,828
I enjoyed my life as Goo Ha Na.

524
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:27,928
But of course, this is great, too.

525
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:30,798
You can take your time to settle in.

526
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,699
Let me know if you have any questions.

527
00:28:33,999 --> 00:28:35,808
And let today be the last day you use the vacuum cleaner.

528
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:42,078
I knew it. You fit more perfectly as Goo Ha Na.

529
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:43,749
I'll make it happen.

530
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:50,219
Please relax.

531
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:53,787
Please make me look natural.

532
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:55,328
Let me use a highlighter on you.

533
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:56,759
You're the star today.

534
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:00,558
"The star?" Okay.

535
00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:09,868
You took one in the morning.

536
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:12,209
Did it wear off already?

537
00:29:12,338 --> 00:29:13,479
These are health supplements.

538
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:15,548
When is the designer coming?

539
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,348
She'll come after she's done with Yu Jin.

540
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:20,118
She's the star.

541
00:29:20,249 --> 00:29:23,288
Let her play the star all she wants while she can.

542
00:29:25,318 --> 00:29:27,989
Keep up the good work.

543
00:29:28,189 --> 00:29:29,888
You just have to act like...

544
00:29:29,889 --> 00:29:31,999
you're sincerely thrilled about her return.

545
00:29:33,128 --> 00:29:36,628
After some time, Yu Jin will have disappeared.

546
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:38,899
All right.

547
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,139
Please get ready.

548
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,348
I can't believe we're taking a new family portrait with Yu Jin.

549
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:54,719
Yeo Jin, this day finally came.

550
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:56,788
It did.

551
00:30:05,328 --> 00:30:07,228
It'll seem suspicious if you took a photo...

552
00:30:07,229 --> 00:30:08,768
with just Eun Chong.

553
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:11,598
First, you should take one with Ms. Ha Na.

554
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:15,939
I'll ask the photographer to take one of you and Eun Chong.

555
00:30:17,268 --> 00:30:18,679
Please look over here.

556
00:30:19,878 --> 00:30:21,009
Wait.

557
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:25,778
I'm sorry, but can Eun Chong take it with us?

558
00:30:27,018 --> 00:30:29,048
Right. Should we do that?

559
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,219
I should've thought about that.

560
00:30:31,358 --> 00:30:32,919
Eun Chong, come over here.

561
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:40,097
All right. Looking great. I'll take the photo now.

562
00:30:40,098 --> 00:30:41,499
One, two.

563
00:30:48,568 --> 00:30:51,679
Can we have the young gentleman sit on the chairwoman's lap?

564
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:53,439
Should we do that?

565
00:30:54,348 --> 00:30:55,378
All right.

566
00:30:56,709 --> 00:30:59,048
All right. Everything looks great. I'll take one now.

567
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,488
All right. We're all done.

568
00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:08,928
May we wrap up?

569
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:10,159
Wait, one moment.

570
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:14,598
Se Young and Yu Jin should take one as sisters.

571
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,067
Yes, okay.

572
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:19,038
Let's go over here.

573
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:21,509
Yu Jin, let's take one together.

574
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:23,409
Okay.

575
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:28,179
Gosh, look how beautiful they are.

576
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:39,818
Yu Jin, life as Goo Ha Na fits you better.

577
00:31:40,219 --> 00:31:41,788
Go back to your place.

578
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,098
You said you'd look forward to it...

579
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,128
when I said I wouldn't be patient anymore.

580
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:52,639
All right, then. Look forward to it, Se Young.

581
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,797
(Cinderella Game)

582
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:56,199
How can you do this to me?

583
00:32:56,598 --> 00:32:59,238
You should repay her for every moment she harassed you.

584
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:00,838
At this rate, will you actually get married?

585
00:33:01,068 --> 00:33:02,968
You have a lot of interest in Ms. Yoon.

586
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:05,178
I need to find out what the deal is...

587
00:33:05,179 --> 00:33:07,408
to find an excuse to kick her out.

588
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:08,979
It won't be that easy to kick her out.

589
00:33:09,308 --> 00:33:10,678
That brat won't last long.

590
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:12,077
You have such a weak heart.

591
00:33:12,078 --> 00:33:14,449
How are you going to survive life with Goo Ha Na?

592
00:33:16,489 --> 00:33:17,818
What happened to Eun Chong's face?

593
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:19,588
What did you do to this kid?
