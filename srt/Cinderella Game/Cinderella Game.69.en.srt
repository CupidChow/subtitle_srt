1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,780
(Episode 69)

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,380
It even feels like real skin.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,050
I'll actually look pregnant
if I put this on my stomach.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,960
Is this big enough
to look like I'm at four months?

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,330
Once your stomach gets bigger,
begin to walk lopsided.

9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,100
And watch other pregnant women...

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,000
- to learn how to act.
- Fine.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,140
My baby, Mommy will keep you safe.

12
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,300
Jeez.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,350
What is it, Eun Chong?
Do you need something?

14
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:49,990
Hey, Eun Chong.
If you don't need anything,

15
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,120
you can go to your room and play.
Okay?

16
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,230
That's it. Bye.

17
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,860
- He surprised me.
- He wouldn't know, would he?

18
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,530
He wouldn't.

19
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,240
The baby fell.

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,510
Kongkong, let's find Auntie Ha Na.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,770
Se Young, was Eun Chong here?

22
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,170
No, why?

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,440
I don't see Eun Chong here.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,510
What do you mean?

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:42,770
Is he not home?

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,680
I'll go and search the neighborhood,
so look around at home.

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,810
- And take that thing off.
- Yes, okay.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,520
I don't have any money.

29
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,700
Mister.

30
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:10,270
- Me?
- Can you please call my auntie?

31
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,210
Did you date Se Young
as a part of your revenge?

32
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,380
I was wondering if you
approached her intentionally...

33
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,080
when you were in America
to get revenge.

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,620
You're still seeing her, right?

35
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,920
Yes, I'm seeing her
to use her for my revenge.

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
You've put in your entire life
into getting this revenge.

37
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,590
I wouldn't have started
without such determination.

38
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,330
Don't worry.
I'm not the old Ji Seok.

39
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,000
I now have power and money.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,130
- And above all...
- You aren't alone.

41
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,210
Let me do it with you, Ji Seok.

42
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,840
- Do what?
- This revenge you're getting.

43
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,110
I want to join you.

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,950
I also want to put my entire life
into getting this revenge.

45
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,090
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

46
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,860
Getting revenge isn't for everyone.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,130
You can't do something like this.

48
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:11,260
Why not? I can do it, too.

49
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,860
I understand how you feel,

50
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,900
but leave the revenge to me.

51
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,000
Just go live your life.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,040
You can't draw this line
to get revenge for our parents.

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,440
I already felt heartbroken to know
you did this alone to this day.

54
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,080
Are you telling me
to just sit and watch this?

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,410
I'm their child, too.

56
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,880
You'd be helping me more
if you went and lived your life.

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,480
Go out and date someone
and travel like other women.

58
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,320
Learn what you want to learn
and do whatever you want.

59
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,860
I want to see you live like that.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,990
I'll do that
after we get the revenge.

61
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,730
I didn't tell you
to make you do this.

62
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,730
Why do you try
to take on the burden yourself?

63
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,870
I promised our parents today...

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,870
that I wouldn't let you
bear this by yourself.

65
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,510
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

66
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,580
Ha Na, can you
cut Eun Chong off right now?

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,250
If Eun Chong shows up right now,

68
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,120
can you sit there
and not move an inch?

69
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,560
You need to be ready to use him
if you must. That's revenge.

70
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,130
You must be ready to use
the ones you love.

71
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,730
Can you take advantage of Eun Chong?

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,400
She won't pick up.

73
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,010
Really?

74
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,270
Are you lost? Where do you live?

75
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,680
Eunha-gu, Ilsin, Gyeonggi Province.

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,610
How did you come this far?

77
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,710
I was at Grandma's house.

78
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,020
Where does she live?

79
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,390
Over there.

80
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,190
There? Where?

81
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,700
Where?

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,130
Wait, what?

83
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,240
Jeez.

84
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,340
(Sandbox)

85
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:07,280
Getting revenge will
crush Eun Chong's heart...

86
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,350
and destroy his future, too.

87
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,220
You can't do this.

88
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,260
Just give me your encouragement
and support from the back.

89
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,460
That's all I need.

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,760
It's one thing not to know,

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,330
but now that I know,
you can't tell me to stay oblivious.

92
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,130
Will you make a fool out of me?

93
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,900
If you don't let me join you,

94
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,140
I'll do this myself.

95
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:36,570
Then, come back when you're ready
to take advantage of Eun Chong.

96
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,610
In this state,

97
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,410
it'd be faster
if he took advantage of you.

98
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,690
We told the police,
so we'd find him, right?

99
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,160
We have to. He's our lifeline.

100
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,730
Yeo Jin will make a big scene
if she finds out.

101
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,500
What do we do?

102
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,800
What if she calls the adoption off
for not keeping an eye on him?

103
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,540
Gosh, where did this kid go?

104
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,210
Wait, he must've gone
to Goo Ha Na's place.

105
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,610
- Call her.
- Okay.

106
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,820
You're home, Yeo Jin.

107
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,520
Where's Eun Chong?

108
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,260
Yeo Jin, don't be alarmed.

109
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,520
Is something going on?

110
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,430
Eun Chong left by himself.

111
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,560
What are you talking about?
Where did he go?

112
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
He was asleep by himself,

113
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
so I was in Se Young's room.

114
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:40,170
Then, he was gone
by the time I opened the door again.

115
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,810
He isn't anywhere home,
and his shoes are gone, too.

116
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,410
I already reported
his disappearance to the police.

117
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,010
"Disappearance?"

118
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,010
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Yeo Jin.

119
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,850
How long has it been since he left?

120
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,390
About an hour or so.

121
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,720
It had been 20 minutes
since I called the police,

122
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,820
and they said they'd look through
all the CCTV footage nearby.

123
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,660
We'll find him soon, Yeo Jin.

124
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,990
I have to find him.

125
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,330
Goodness, Yeo Jin.

126
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,960
Mom!

127
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,370
You need to stay home.

128
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,240
You will let me join you
in getting this revenge...

129
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,080
if I can take advantage
of Eun Chong, right?

130
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,650
- It's Chairwoman Shin.
- Don't pick it up.

131
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,890
Why is she calling me?

132
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,450
Probably because of Eun Chong.

133
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
- Hello?
- Where are you, Ha Na?

134
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm at Ji Seok's place.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Eun Chong is gone.

136
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,000
Eun Chong is gone?

137
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,640
He left home by himself.

138
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,040
The chairwoman called and said
he must've come to our place.

139
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,480
- What do we do, Ha Na?
- I'll go back home now.

140
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,210
Bye.

141
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,020
See?

142
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,990
You can't cut him off.

143
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,820
He disappeared,
so I should find him first.

144
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,000
Where could he have gone alone?

145
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,970
He probably left to go see Ha Na.

146
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,900
I'll visit her place first.

147
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,040
Call me.

148
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,980
How can that little boy
come here all alone?

149
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,750
Goodness. What if he gets lost?

150
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,250
Eun Chong!

151
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,920
Did Eun Chong come here?

152
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,820
Did he say he'd come?

153
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,320
No, I heard he left home all alone.

154
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,660
It seemed like he left to see me.

155
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,730
All by himself?

156
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,500
Are you all right?

157
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,500
Yes.

158
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,240
Ha Na, where's Eun Chong?

159
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,470
He didn't come here.

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,810
He could be on his way here,
so let's search the neighborhood.

161
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:57,910
Okay.

162
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,050
Mr. Han, please stay home
and call me if he comes.

163
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,110
Okay.

164
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,660
Eun Chong,
you can't come here all alone.

165
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,260
What if you get lost?

166
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,200
Eun Chong.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Eun Chong!

168
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,940
Eun Chong.

169
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,840
Hello.

170
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,810
Have you seen an eight-year-old boy
about this tall?

171
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,510
I haven't seen a boy here.

172
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,380
Thank you.

173
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:42,050
I'm sorry, but have you seen
a little boy about this big?

174
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,490
No, I haven't.

175
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,960
Okay. Thank you.

176
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,260
Eun Chong.

177
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,130
I'm looking
for an eight-year-old boy.

178
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,260
He's about this tall.
Have you seen him?

179
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,970
Thank you.

180
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,470
Eun Chong.

181
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,340
Eun Chong.

182
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:03,810
Eun Chong.

183
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,310
Eun Chong.

184
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,680
Eun Chong.

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,390
Eun Chong!

186
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,290
I'm sorry to ask,
but have you seen a boy this big?

187
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,630
No.

188
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,440
Where did he go?

189
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,550
It's that trampoline!

190
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,990
Jump!

191
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,990
All right!

192
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,060
All right!

193
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,230
Auntie Ha Na...

194
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,910
Excuse me.
Have you seen a boy this big?

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,210
- No.
- No.

196
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,720
Eun Chong...

197
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,060
He's the blood of your enemy!

198
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,470
Ha Na, can you
cut Eun Chong off right now?

199
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,780
You need to be ready
to use him if you must.

200
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,750
That's revenge.

201
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

202
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,260
I found Eun Chong.

203
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,270
He's at the playground
with the trampoline.

204
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:48,340
Hey, Ha Na found him safe and sound
at a playground.

205
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,910
He wasn't hurt at all.

206
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,240
She must've cried a river
over him...

207
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,580
and made a huge scene.

208
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,680
No, she called Hwang Jin Goo
and told him to pick him up.

209
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,320
She seemed determined
about not meeting him.

210
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,300
Eun Chong, how can you
come this far by yourself?

211
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,430
I'm going to go to Auntie Ha Na!

212
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,970
All right. Fine. I'll call her.

213
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,510
Eun Chong.

214
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,810
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na!

215
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,510
All right. Eun Chong.

216
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,520
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na!

217
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,220
All right. I understand.

218
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,990
- So, you can come with me...
- I want to go to Auntie Ha Na!

219
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,560
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na!

220
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

221
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,440
Eun Chong.

222
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,910
Eun Chong.

223
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,310
Eun Chong, open the door.

224
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:00,710
Did he lock the door?

225
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,710
- Bring me the key to this room.
- Okay.

226
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,120
Eun Chong...

227
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,690
- Eun Chong?
- Eun Chong.

228
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,230
Where did he go?

229
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,970
Oh, my. Eun Chong.

230
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,100
You were here?

231
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,140
Eun Chong, come on out.

232
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,840
Eun Chong,
your grandma is calling you.

233
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:37,050
Eun Chong, come on out.

234
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,290
My goodness. That hurt.

235
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,960
Ji Seok is right.

236
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,570
How can someone like me get revenge?

237
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,270
My heart races
at the sound of Eun Chong's name.

238
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,040
Instead of using him,

239
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,680
I'll end up
getting used by Chairwoman Shin.

240
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:09,680
Leave the revenge to Ji Seok.

241
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,580
I don't deserve to be...

242
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,980
an older sister or a daughter.

243
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,620
You and Eun Chong spent many years
as a mom and her son.

244
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,430
You can't just
cut someone out of your life...

245
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,800
with a simple decision.

246
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,670
You don't have to rush it.
Why don't you give it some time?

247
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,670
But Ji Seok is
still on this tough journey alone.

248
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,310
What should I do?

249
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,940
Do you want to help him...

250
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,840
even if it means
you'll take advantage of Eun Chong?

251
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,180
Yes, if it's possible
to take advantage of him.

252
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:51,860
What do you think is...

253
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,130
Chairwoman Shin's biggest weakness?

254
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,360
Chairwoman Shin's
biggest weakness is...

255
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,000
probably Eun Chong.

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,630
There may be a way...

257
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,340
for you to take advantage of him
in a way only you can.

258
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,440
In a way only I can?

259
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,980
Taking advantage of him
in a way only I can?

260
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,990
Eun Chong, how can you
come this far by yourself?

261
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,490
I'm going to go to Auntie Ha Na!

262
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,700
All right. Fine. I'll call her.

263
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,670
The tears she shed for her blood
must be true.

264
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,840
In what way
can I take advantage of him?

265
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,880
How could you not know
he was leaving while you were home?

266
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,320
What were you two adults doing...

267
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,880
to have no idea the boy left?

268
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,390
Se Young collapsed due to anemia,
so I was busy...

269
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,990
looking after her.

270
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,720
Is that your excuse?

271
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,060
Did you say you ignored Eun Chong
because you had to take care of her?

272
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,230
I didn't ignore him!

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,770
I thought he was asleep.

274
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,040
No, never mind.

275
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,270
It doesn't matter
what the reason is. I'm at fault.

276
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,940
It's my fault, Yeo Jin.

277
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,780
It's all my fault, Aunt Yeo Jin.

278
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,240
If you're like this now,

279
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,850
you won't give Eun Chong
any interest once the baby is born.

280
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,080
You'd be busy raising that kid.

281
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,180
No, Yeo Jin.

282
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:29,220
Eun Chong will always be
our priority.

283
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,620
I'll pay more attention
to Eun Chong, Aunt Yeo Jin.

284
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:34,190
I was already mortified
and stunned after losing Yu Jin.

285
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:36,360
Why did you let this happen to him?

286
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,260
I don't need a guardian
who puts him in danger.

287
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:43,200
You should
just raise your own child, Se Young.

288
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,570
The adoption is off.

289
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,340
- Yeo Jin.
- Aunt Yeo Jin.

290
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,040
I'm so sorry, Yeo Jin.

291
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,440
Please forgive me.

292
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,710
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.
I won't let this happen again.

293
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:59,080
I'll pay more attention.
This will never happen again.

294
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,350
I'm sorry.

295
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,950
I'll buy him a kids' phone...

296
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,790
and install a location-tracking app.

297
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,260
I'll get the phone tomorrow.

298
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,630
If this happens again,

299
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,070
the adoption is off.

300
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,330
Of course.

301
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,240
Yes, Aunt Yeo Jin.

302
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
Was everything taken already?

303
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,490
Yes, I left those out
to discard them.

304
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,190
Ha Na.

305
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,200
Eun Chong went home safely.

306
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:53,940
Will you really not see him anymore?

307
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:58,710
I heard it from Director Goo,
but I wanted to hear it from you.

308
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,380
No, I won't see him anymore.

309
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:04,250
- Why not?
- I got used as a fake daughter,

310
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,450
got separated from Eun Chong,

311
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,550
and found out about her plan...

312
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,620
to send me to a mental institution
to stop me from seeing him.

313
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,420
I can't meet him anymore.

314
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,130
"A mental institution?"

315
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:18,260
Chairwoman Shin wanted
to make me appear schizophrenic...

316
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,530
and planned to lock me up
at a mental institution.

317
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:23,230
Are you serious?

318
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,270
I thought my life
would fall into danger...

319
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,910
if I continuously got involved
with that family, so I cut him off.

320
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,940
So, please stop talking to me
about him.

321
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,510
And stop using him as an excuse
to come over.

322
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,680
I even decided to get married...

323
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,320
to let you and Eun Chong meet.

324
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,920
Who cares about some marriage?

325
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,590
My entire life was played with
and taken advantage of.

326
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,430
If you can't handle her later,
just get divorced.

327
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,530
What's the big deal?

328
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,130
I'm sorry.

329
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,940
I wasn't complaining.

330
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,610
I just felt bad for you two.

331
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,380
I know how much you two miss each other.

332
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,180
- Why do you deny that...
- How do you know how I feel?

333
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:12,520
Am I an idiot
who always has to put up with...

334
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,080
all kinds of harassment?

335
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,120
Did I have to see him at the cost
of getting locked up at a hospital?

336
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:20,960
Why should I?

337
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:26,430
I'm sick of how that family
looks down on everyone...

338
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,300
and uses them.

339
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,470
And that includes you.

340
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,830
The chairwoman tried to lock up Ha Na
at a mental institution?

341
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,540
Chairwoman Shin blamed her
for the fake daughter scheme.

342
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,040
She claimed Ha Na forged
her identity as her daughter...

343
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,910
and approached her first.

344
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,080
Everything was
staged by the chairwoman?

345
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,390
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

346
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,790
Shin Yeo Jin!
How can you call yourself human?

347
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,420
Bring my business...

348
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,690
and my family back!

349
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:29,990
An empty death portrait?

350
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,000
- You didn't know?
- Not at all.

351
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,300
Who was it from?

352
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,230
Was it those who wanted to harm you,

353
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,930
like the man
at the inaugural ceremony?

354
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,440
Who knows?

355
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,800
You don't know the reason yet,
do you?

356
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,840
On the surface, she said
it was because of the investment.

357
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,840
But I think there's another reason.

358
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,550
Do you think someone holds a weakness
against the chairwoman?

359
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,050
A weakness?

360
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,980
Did you hear something?

361
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,550
No, I was just wondering.

362
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,750
Do I know...

363
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,660
who the chairwoman really is?

364
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,680
I won't see Eun Chong anymore.

365
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,880
- Please leave.
- I can offer you more money.

366
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,980
You lived as his mother until now,
and I told you that he was unwell.

367
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,690
Yes, I lived like an idiot,
acting as his mother.

368
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,320
I finally realized it.

369
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:33,760
Meeting Du Na
and raising Eun Chong was...

370
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,860
the biggest misfortune of my life.

371
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,330
Stop messing with me...

372
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,070
if you want to keep Eun Chong safe.

373
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,400
I already paid her for raising him.

374
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:48,070
How dare she use him to threaten me?

375
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,440
How dare you reject him?

376
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,010
I'll use your siblings...

377
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,580
to make you meet him.

378
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,150
Do you know why your sister is
suddenly refusing to meet Eun Chong?

379
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:05,090
We don't understand, either.

380
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,760
I think there's something
only Ha Na and Ji Seok know.

381
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,230
What could it be?

382
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:17,100
Eun Chong needs to meet her
to find his calm,

383
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,000
but Ha Na refuses to meet him.

384
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,010
That was why I called you for help.

385
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,740
So, you just need us
to make her meet Eun Chong?

386
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,180
Yes.

387
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
I have a good idea.

388
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,420
Uncle Ji Chang! Auntie Ji Eun!

389
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,850
- Eun Chong.
- Hey.

390
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,260
Eun Chong, it's too dangerous
for you to come to our place alone.

391
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,430
If you get lost,
you'll never see Auntie Ha Na again.

392
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,140
Eun Chong,
let's go and meet Auntie Ha Na.

393
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,400
Really?

394
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,140
(Age 3)

395
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:59,140
(Age 5, Age 6)

396
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,580
(Age 7)

397
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,620
(Age 5, Age 6)

398
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,780
(Age 7)

399
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,670
What's the revenge...

400
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,710
only I can get by using Eun Chong?

401
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,320
Hey, what's up?

402
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,550
- Hey, come to Ji Chang's place now.
- I'm busy.

403
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:47,060
I know you're busy
and unemployed, but stop by.

404
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,160
I can't go.

405
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,360
We're really busy right now.
Can you help us out?

406
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,760
Yes, an order of three fritters.

407
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,000
- Is Auntie Ha Na coming?
- Yes.

408
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,970
She didn't abandon me, did she?

409
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,480
Hey, she can't even throw out
socks with holes in them.

410
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:09,210
Hey, how can you compare him
to a sock with a hole?

411
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,980
Gosh, but what's going on
with Ha Na and Ji Seok?

412
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,720
No idea.
She must've caught something he has.

413
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,760
No, contaminated. Infected?
What's the right word?

414
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,860
She'll come while you eat this.

415
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,010
Why is Eun Chong here?

416
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:41,180
Gosh, Ji Eun and Ji Chang. Come on.

417
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,620
It's Auntie Ha Na.

418
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,470
Auntie.

419
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,180
Auntie.

420
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,280
Auntie Ha Na.

421
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,250
Auntie. Auntie Ha Na.

422
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,890
Auntie Ha Na!

423
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:25,920
Eun Chong!

424
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,190
- Eun Chong!
- Hey, Eun Chong!

425
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,310
Are you okay, Eun Chong?

426
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,450
What's wrong with you two?

427
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,850
You need to keep my grandson safe
while he's with you.

428
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,120
He almost got run over by a car!

429
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,790
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

430
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,160
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie.

431
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,190
Eun Chong...

432
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,030
Auntie.

433
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,070
Auntie, will you look at me?

434
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,040
He's the blood of your enemy!

435
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,750
Our enemy who killed our parents!

436
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,460
Eun Chong.

437
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,230
We can't meet anymore...

438
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,630
even if you come for me.

439
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,630
Are you going somewhere?

440
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,370
Overseas.

441
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,210
That's way too far.

442
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:58,650
Don't go, Auntie Ha Na.

443
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,210
We need to talk.

444
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,890
You're the very person...

445
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,260
who killed my parents
and destroyed my family's happiness.

446
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,230
Ms. Goo, you are
rather harsh and cold-hearted.

447
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,330
You pretended that
you thought of Eun Chong as your own,

448
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,240
like you'd do anything for him,

449
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,870
but you turned away from him
right before his eyes.

450
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:59,910
He's in grave condition
because of you.

451
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,040
Because of me?

452
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,680
He left home...

453
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,780
because you refused to meet him.

454
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:08,050
Even now, he almost got into an accident
trying to follow you.

455
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,120
How will you take responsibility?

456
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:13,460
Not only do you frame me
for the fake daughter scheme,

457
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,690
but you also blame me
for Eun Chong leaving home...

458
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,500
and following me.

459
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,170
Are you not at fault in any way?

460
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:26,340
You stopped him from seeing me...

461
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,240
when he came to my place.

462
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,510
And you turned me away every time...

463
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,080
when I went over to meet him.

464
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:37,450
I gave you what you wanted.
Do you not like it?

465
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:40,080
Is this your revenge or something?

466
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,950
You don't know
what real revenge looks like.

467
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,890
You'll find out soon,
so look forward to it.

468
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,290
You'll regret this.

469
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,160
No, you'll regret this.

470
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,870
Do you have to do this to Eun Chong
only because of the mental hospital?

471
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,630
- "Only because?"
- I could've gotten rid of you...

472
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,200
a long time ago.

473
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,170
What's the big deal
about a mental institution?

474
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,080
- So, you must even kill people.
- Shut up.

475
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,380
How dare you slander me?

476
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,680
"Slander?" You killed my parents.

477
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,480
Do you think you're something
just because Eun Chong wants you?

478
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,550
How long do you think
he'll want you?

479
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,960
He thinks of you as his mom now,

480
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,120
but once he grows up,

481
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,860
he'll forget all about you.

482
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,260
Are you anxious
because I may really become his mother?

483
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,670
What is this nonsense?

484
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,900
That place is not for anyone.

485
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,840
You can't be his mother,
not even in your next life.

486
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,880
Did you say the biggest misfortune
of your life was...

487
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,180
meeting Du Na and raising Eun Chong?

488
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,320
I'll make that come true.

489
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,120
You'll end up groveling before me.

490
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,890
You're someone who cannot be
Eun Chong's grandmother.

491
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,930
There may be a way...

492
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,460
for you to take advantage of him
in a way only you can.

493
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,370
Fine.

494
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,200
I'll take advantage of Eun Chong
in a way only I can.

495
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:09,810
The one thing
that'll hurt you the most.

496
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,340
The one thing you'll mourn over the most
when you lose it.

497
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,880
I'll take that from you.

498
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,620
I don't want to go to school.

499
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,790
Then, what else are you going to do?

500
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,930
I'm going to go to Auntie Ha Na!

501
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,260
She went abroad.

502
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,130
Eun Chong, today is
the first day of school.

503
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,900
You'll have so much fun
meeting new friends there.

504
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:40,400
No, I don't want any friends.

505
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,310
You'll have fun
when you meet new friends there.

506
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,980
Yes, Eun Chong.

507
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,180
Let's go to school
in this awesome uniform.

508
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,220
Who is it?

509
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,390
Ms. Goo Ha Na.

510
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,520
Auntie Ha Na?

511
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,430
Open the door.

512
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:36,530
Are you really Auntie Ha Na?

513
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,860
Yes, it's me.

514
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,370
Auntie Ha Na!

515
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,770
He's the blood of your enemy!

516
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,670
What brings you here?

517
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,280
Today is his first day of school.

518
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,450
- Let's go to school, Eun Chong.
- Okay.

519
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,680
(Cinderella Game)

520
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,790
What's Goo Ha Na's plan?

521
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,890
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.
I need to use you.

522
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,520
I just need Auntie Ha Na.

523
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,920
The security heightened
with the server.

524
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,690
Let's wait for Se Young
to bring us the master key.

525
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,130
I hate you, Grandma.

526
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,760
I'll offer to work
as a live-in babysitter.

527
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,500
I'll treat him for depression
within a month.

528
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,440
- What are your terms?
- This doesn't feel right.

529
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,910
If need be, I'll send her away
to a mental institution or wherever.

530
00:34:29,910 --> 00:34:31,570
- Yes, come in.
- Is someone coming?
