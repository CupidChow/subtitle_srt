1
00:00:00,789 --> 00:00:03,090
Se Na must be anxious to fly.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:06,159
It can fly around freely starting today.

3
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:11,429
You're leaving, and Se Na's leaving, too.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,069
We'll continue to meet, though.

5
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:18,740
I hope Se Na will go somewhere nice and meet great friends.

6
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,979
- Just like us. - Yes.

7
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,479
Should we open it now?

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:27,849
- I'm nervous. - Me, too.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,559
Bye, Se Na.

10
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,360
Goodbye, Se Na.

11
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:56,980
You can have this.

12
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,149
But it's from those two.

13
00:00:59,509 --> 00:01:00,679
Are you sure?

14
00:01:00,819 --> 00:01:01,980
It's all right.

15
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:04,019
It looks much better on you.

16
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,019
This is a new hat, and you can have it.

17
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:11,390
It's my present.

18
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,030
Can I really have it?

19
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,569
I think I've seen this hat before.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,940
Who's that girl?

21
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:29,239
"That girl?" Do you remember something?

22
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,649
I gave the same hat...

23
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,349
to this girl.

24
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:39,349
Who was that girl?

25
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:40,590
Try to remember.

26
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,360
Bumping your head on the wall must've worked.

27
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,190
Do you remember anything else?

28
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,609
You're stopping the search?

29
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,810
You don't have the right to stop searching for my daughter.

30
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,409
You already finished talking to my husband?

31
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Don't listen to him. You must listen to me.

32
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,520
You need to resume the search!

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,919
We aren't stopping the search for your daughter.

34
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,720
Another missing case occurred, so we had to reduce the staff.

35
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,220
Why would you reduce the staff?

36
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,430
You need to find Yu Jin, not anybody else!

37
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,930
Who's going to look for my daughter if you people give up?

38
00:02:54,229 --> 00:02:56,199
Hey!

39
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,009
Sung Ho...

40
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,609
When did my husband leave?

41
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:12,250
Well, I also didn't see him leave.

42
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:15,050
There's a note on his desk, Ms. Chairwoman.

43
00:03:21,859 --> 00:03:23,159
I'm sorry, honey.

44
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,030
That's all I can say to you.

45
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,470
Please don't look for me.

46
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,909
(I'm sorry, honey. Please don't look for me.)

47
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,620
Carefully.

48
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:54,889
Ta-da!

49
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,229
Do you like it?

50
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,940
Yes, it's so pretty.

51
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:17,250
Is this really my room?

52
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,279
Of course.

53
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,649
Mommy put so much thought into decorating it.

54
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,079
I'm glad you like it.

55
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:26,120
- Thank you, Moth... - You can take your time.

56
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:29,160
And I prefer Mom instead of Mother.

57
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay.

58
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,699
Gosh, it's so pretty.

59
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,329
It looked like a room I always dreamed about.

60
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,269
My gosh, I have a plant, too.

61
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,040
- Did you leave it here? - No.

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,540
It was Ji Seok.

63
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,139
Ji Seok.

64
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:55,719
"No rain, no flowers?"

65
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:59,420
That's our family motto. "No rain, no flowers."

66
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:02,560
- If it doesn't rain... - Flowers don't bloom, either.

67
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,060
It means good days will come if you endure bad days.

68
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,430
Remember those words whenever you face trouble.

69
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,930
Okay.

70
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,240
"No rain, no flowers."

71
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:28,719
Dad, come quickly.

72
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:32,420
- All right. My goodness. - Show a big smile.

73
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,219
One, two, three.

74
00:05:34,219 --> 00:05:35,690
- Say cheese! - Say cheese!

75
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,209
Dad, Ji Seok, Ji Eun.

76
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,379
- Let's go, Ji Seok. - All right!

77
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,850
You don't have to do something like this anymore.

78
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,620
If you do this one more time, I'll get mad at you.

79
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:10,219
Just until today.

80
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,930
I'll tell Mom that you won't listen.

81
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,230
You can leave the chores up to adults.

82
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,440
All you have to do is play and do whatever you want,

83
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,600
like other kids your age.

84
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,199
Okay.

85
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:29,480
Ji Eun, you won't grow taller if you eat just what you like.

86
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,050
You said you wanted to be a model.

87
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,050
You can't be one if you're short.

88
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm going to be an actor.

89
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,719
You changed your mind again?

90
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,920
Actors have to be tall, too.

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,050
Right, Dad?

92
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,160
Models and actors all should be tall.

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,560
I'm pretty.

94
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,060
- Yes, you're the best. - That's true.

95
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,300
Ji Eun, you're the prettiest.

96
00:06:53,269 --> 00:06:55,639
- Ha Na, you should eat first. - I'll just do this.

97
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,540
Let's eat, Ji Chang.

98
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,879
You're so silly.

99
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,550
He'd stop crying and smile whenever he heard your voice.

100
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:13,319
He tortured me through the night when he slept next to me,

101
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,120
but he'd continue to sleep until the morning next to you.

102
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,560
Some may think you two are the mother and the son.

103
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,860
Let's eat.

104
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,699
Mom, do you know why infants don't shed tears?

105
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,339
- Is this a riddle? - Yes.

106
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,069
You can try to guess until I come back from school.

107
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,440
And don't do the dishes.

108
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,810
I'll do it after school.

109
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,980
Stop it. People may think I'm an evil stepmother.

110
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,009
Dad will get mad at you, too.

111
00:07:40,149 --> 00:07:42,420
- And have some seaweed soup. - Okay.

112
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,949
And keep your socks on.

113
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:46,290
- That's enough. - What else?

114
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,019
Don't put your hands into cold water.

115
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:53,160
Why is a kid like you acting like an adult?

116
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,259
Ha Na!

117
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,399
Have a great day today, Ji Chang.

118
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,639
She must be so used to doing chores.

119
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,509
Isn't that so, Ji Chang?

120
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,089
- Du Na. - Yes, Reverend Mother.

121
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,790
I heard you were visiting Ha Na's place on the weekend.

122
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,199
Yes, she told me to come and see the baby.

123
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,300
She said he was really cute.

124
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:35,069
She said his fingers and toes were so soft...

125
00:08:35,069 --> 00:08:36,170
that they felt like gummy candy.

126
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,440
Is that so?

127
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:46,249
Do you remember...

128
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:49,880
the businessman couple from Seoul?

129
00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:53,959
They want to adopt you, Du Na.

130
00:09:05,869 --> 00:09:06,999
Mommy.

131
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,199
Mommy, are you sick?

132
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,569
I'm just tired.

133
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,609
You must be tired from working so much.

134
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:16,479
Let me massage your arms.

135
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,520
Yu Jin's hands are like medicine

136
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:23,479
Get well soon, Mommy.

137
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,790
You'll feel better soon.

138
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,020
Thanks, my girl.

139
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:34,199
Where's Daddy?

140
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,030
Yu Jin.

141
00:09:46,609 --> 00:09:47,709
Yu Jin.

142
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:49,910
Yu Jin?

143
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:20,780
It's all your fault.

144
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,880
I tried so hard to stop you from going.

145
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,249
We wouldn't have lost her if you had listened to me.

146
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,050
I wouldn't have lost her...

147
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,949
if you came with us.

148
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,920
She begged you so much to come along.

149
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,589
Are you blaming me right now?

150
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,630
If my death will bring Yu Jin back,

151
00:10:40,829 --> 00:10:42,800
I can die right here.

152
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,170
If your death can...

153
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,999
bring Yu Jin back,

154
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:49,839
then please die.

155
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:58,280
Yeo Jin.

156
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,920
I made some mung bean porridge. Have some.

157
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:08,660
Well, are you not going to look for Sung Ho?

158
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:10,520
He told me not to.

159
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,760
But you should still find out where he is.

160
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,369
I'll take the porridge to the master bedroom.

161
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:18,699
Have some before it turns cold.

162
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:55,239
You aren't so bad, Ha Na.

163
00:11:55,239 --> 00:11:57,140
Du Na taught me at church.

164
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,239
She's really good at playing the piano.

165
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,339
She must still remember how to play the piano.

166
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,079
But she can't remember anything else?

167
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,550
No, I hope she does.

168
00:12:08,449 --> 00:12:11,690
Right, Du Na will meet her foster parents today.

169
00:12:19,359 --> 00:12:22,900
The reverend mother said you liked science.

170
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,530
Have you been to the science museum?

171
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:25,670
No.

172
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:27,739
You'd love it there.

173
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:29,800
You should go with her sometime.

174
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,810
- Sure. Let's find a date. - All right.

175
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,380
What's your dream, Du Na?

176
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,440
What do you want to do when you grow up?

177
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,079
I haven't thought about it.

178
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:41,719
If you like science, you can be a doctor.

179
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,589
Not only are you a good student, but you're smart, too.

180
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,349
Don't give her so much pressure.

181
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,160
You heard from the reverend mother, right?

182
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,290
We're emigrating to America soon.

183
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:53,390
- You know where America is, right? - Yes.

184
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,229
I heard it was a far country...

185
00:12:56,229 --> 00:12:57,900
that took 13 hours by plane.

186
00:12:58,829 --> 00:13:01,440
You'd also love it there, Du Na.

187
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,839
Do you remember anything from your past?

188
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,010
No.

189
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:16,349
I know you're my girl, but you're a real masterpiece.

190
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:21,520
You look so luxurious from head to toe.

191
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,930
Why did you forget your Band-Aid again?

192
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:30,430
- It felt irritating. - Goodness.

193
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,469
It may feel irritating, but keep it on until you get surgery.

194
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,410
- Your value can... - My value can change completely...

195
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,709
depending on one little flaw?

196
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:45,010
My gosh. You knew that already.

197
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,349
- Remember that. - Okay.

198
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,880
Who are we meeting today?

199
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:56,390
You don't have to know. We'll just go and have a meal.

200
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:59,829
It's probably be some steak.

201
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,030
But you like steak.

202
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,430
I'm sick of meat.

203
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:10,199
You also look so luxurious from head to toe.

204
00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:13,640
Of course. I'm your mommy.

205
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,040
Yeo Jin.

206
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:20,050
Do you feel all right?

207
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,619
Let's go.

208
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:29,319
Yeo Jin, you should go inside.

209
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,890
I need to go to the restroom.

210
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,630
All right. Let's go.

211
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,640
- Are you enjoying it? - Yes.

212
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:52,010
Eat up.

213
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,130
Do you want to go to the restroom?

214
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,280
- Go inside. - Okay.

215
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:36,190
- You dropped this. - Right.

216
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,229
Your lipstick got smudged.

217
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,760
Yes, right.

218
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:45,969
Hey, Sung Hee.

219
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:49,869
Wait, what did I just see?

220
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,469
Was that a girl who looked like Yu Jin?

221
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:56,140
No, she couldn't look that similar.

222
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,219
But why doesn't she recognize me?

223
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
(Occupied, Vacant)

224
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:35,780
I have high hopes for you, Jin Goo.

225
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,119
You've become healthy now, so keep studying hard.

226
00:16:39,219 --> 00:16:40,449
Yes, Chairwoman Shin.

227
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,160
And you should be good friends with Jin Goo.

228
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,199
Okay.

229
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,229
Which school do you go to?

230
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,930
Seorim.

231
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:54,170
Do you have a lot of friends?

232
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:55,870
Not really.

233
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,969
Mommy.

234
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,279
Can you come with us?

235
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:04,779
I have to work.

236
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:08,580
Put the motion sickness patch on before you get on the ship.

237
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,519
Don't walk around alone, and always hold your daddy's hand.

238
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:12,890
Okay?

239
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:21,299
Have some, Chairwoman Shin.

240
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,699
Oh, my. Chairwoman Shin.

241
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:28,840
My goodness.

242
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:41,549
Ma'am, there's no toilet paper.

243
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,650
"Ma'am?"

244
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:50,989
I'm eating dinner with my husband and a potential adoptee.

245
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,489
"Adoptee?"

246
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,090
She doesn't remember anything.

247
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:55,430
She didn't even know her parents,

248
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:57,430
so she wouldn't remember where she was born and raised.

249
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,130
She doesn't remember?

250
00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:01,600
So, she has amnesia?

251
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,309
Was that why she didn't recognize me?

252
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,309
There was a rumour that her mother left her at her grandfather's place,

253
00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:12,309
- but that wasn't definite. - What grandfather?

254
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:15,650
It might be better not to remember if the memories weren't good.

255
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:18,150
The girl's pretty, kind, and smart.

256
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,820
Things have been so hectic trying to do all the paperwork...

257
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,360
to emigrate and adopt her.

258
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,489
"Emigrate?"

259
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:26,059
So, she's emigrating...

260
00:18:26,459 --> 00:18:28,660
- after adopting Yu Jin? - Yes, okay. Talk to you later.

261
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:32,930
Excuse me.

262
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:38,309
Jin Goo's dad will finally rest in peace.

263
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,370
He was only worried about Jin Goo...

264
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,279
while he was at the hospital.

265
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,150
I'll serve you like a deity from now on, Chairman Shin.

266
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:51,850
Once again, thank you so much.

267
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:00,930
You have to use the smallest fork for the salad.

268
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,229
Really?

269
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:04,769
There are too many forks for no reason.

270
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:09,400
You can use whatever you like.

271
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:10,840
Okay.

272
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:13,870
Do you also do extracurricular activities?

273
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,410
What do you do?

274
00:19:16,979 --> 00:19:19,049
Calligraphy? Arts?

275
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:20,449
Piano?

276
00:19:21,719 --> 00:19:23,150
Will you be quiet?

277
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,219
Where are your table manners?

278
00:19:26,289 --> 00:19:27,420
Sorry.

279
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:31,630
That little girl has a sharp temper, just like her mother.

280
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,499
- Hello. - Hey.

281
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,499
You should eat before the food gets cold.

282
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,039
Yeo Jin, I'm sorry.

283
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,850
I didn't see Yu Jin.

284
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,080
I also don't know that she's moving to America with her foster parents.

285
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,479
I don't know anything.

286
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:59,890
Where and how did you adopt her?

287
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:05,430
I was also interested in adopting a child.

288
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:08,529
I met her at a children's home through an adoption agency.

289
00:20:08,699 --> 00:20:10,600
Which children's home was it?

290
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,130
Se Young will have nightmares every day...

291
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,870
and live in total anxiety...

292
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,969
if she finds out Yu Jin is alive.

293
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,340
Se Young will...

294
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,080
lose her chance at a good life if Yu Jin comes back.

295
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,180
She doesn't remember anything.

296
00:20:28,749 --> 00:20:29,920
She didn't even know her parents,

297
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,749
so she wouldn't remember where she was born and raised.

298
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:35,660
I hope she moves to America and never returns.

299
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,190
She must never regain her memories.

300
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,499
Why aren't you eating?

301
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,029
Do you feel unwell?

302
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,340
What's wrong, Myung Ji?

303
00:20:50,969 --> 00:20:52,070
What?

304
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:55,239
Why? What's wrong, Yeo Jin?

305
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:57,110
Why did you look so dazed?

306
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,949
You're right. You look deadly pale.

307
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:04,789
No, it's not a big deal. It was constipation.

308
00:21:09,989 --> 00:21:11,690
Please excuse me for a moment.

309
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,630
Where are you going, Yeo Jin?

310
00:21:14,029 --> 00:21:16,699
I'll go with you.

311
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,529
I have to make a call. You should eat.

312
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,969
No, I'm not feeling well,

313
00:21:20,969 --> 00:21:22,299
so I can't eat more.

314
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,400
I need to use the restroom again, too.

315
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,340
She must have to go again.

316
00:21:43,259 --> 00:21:46,690
Yeo Jin, that side is quieter.

317
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:48,860
Yes.

318
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,749
She thought her mother left her at her grandfather's home,

319
00:22:09,749 --> 00:22:11,350
so the police took her?

320
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:14,860
And then?

321
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:18,529
Find out where she went to. Please find the girl first.

322
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:22,499
Keep updating the flyers and the missing child campaign.

323
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,209
Myung Ji.

324
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:41,380
Yes?

325
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:45,590
Yes, are you done talking?

326
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:47,390
A girl who looked like Yu Jin...

327
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:49,120
What?

328
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:58,870
What about Yu Jin?

329
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,330
Later.

330
00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:09,640
I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

331
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,110
I was also a mother,

332
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,820
so I had to do this for Se Young's sake.

333
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm sorry, Yu Jin.

334
00:23:21,959 --> 00:23:23,719
Please forgive your aunt.

335
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,229
You met great foster parents,

336
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:28,930
so live a good life.

337
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,830
And don't ever return to Korea.

338
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:42,279
America is really far, isn't it?

339
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:43,340
Yes.

340
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:46,910
But we can meet in about a day if you get on a plane.

341
00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:51,420
When will we meet again?

342
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:53,320
When we become grownups.

343
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,959
Let's visit the Niagara Falls when we grow up.

344
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,360
This waterfall is 1 of the 3 famous waterfalls in the world,

345
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,630
and it sits between America and Canada.

346
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:07,170
Isn't it awesome?

347
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,269
Gosh, it's huge.

348
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,769
Let's promise. We'll go here together, okay?

349
00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:15,580
It's a promise.

350
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,650
Hey, you're still wearing this bracelet.

351
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:25,049
Oh, the boy who gave this to me said he was getting surgery.

352
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,249
I hope it went well.

353
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,059
He was a nice boy, so it must've gone well.

354
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,229
Please look here.

355
00:24:36,229 --> 00:24:37,830
- What are you doing, Ji Seok? - What are you doing, Ji Seok?

356
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,070
I'll take a photo on the count of three.

357
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:42,299
- What? - What?

358
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,140
My gosh.

359
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,440
One, two, three. Say cheese!

360
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:06,529
(Goo Ha Na)

361
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:20,539
You need to accent that part a little more.

362
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,640
- You were still here? - What?

363
00:25:26,479 --> 00:25:28,479
I was reading a book and lost track of time.

364
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,949
(2011)

365
00:25:30,949 --> 00:25:33,150
You were supposed to rest the day before the competition.

366
00:25:33,749 --> 00:25:35,719
You should play the piano, not me.

367
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,690
You have such good ears.

368
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,430
Keep your hands warm before you go to sleep.

369
00:25:42,729 --> 00:25:44,630
How can you play well tomorrow with those hands?

370
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:52,539
Thank you.

371
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,499
(Yoon Se Young)

372
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:25,640
She was first place during the preliminaries.

373
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,539
She's not so bad for a first-timer.

374
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,880
But you'll still win first place, Se Young.

375
00:26:41,489 --> 00:26:42,590
Do you need more time?

376
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,890
I'll be ready after I put on these earrings.

377
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,229
You said you'd be ready after putting on clothes.

378
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:50,529
I'll really be ready after I put on this scarf.

379
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:54,900
Give it a good thought now. Don't make me turn around.

380
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,469
Flowers for Ha Na.

381
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,570
I got them.

382
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,479
What else do we have to take?

383
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,249
Yes, right. My husband.

384
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,249
Your husband has been on standby for a while now, madam.

385
00:27:11,249 --> 00:27:13,390
- Let us go now. - Let's go.

386
00:27:18,729 --> 00:27:20,360
It's raining heavily.

387
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,529
It is.

388
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,799
I'll escort you safely to the concert hall.

389
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:29,870
- It's General Manager Lee. - I see.

390
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:32,709
Hey, Mr. Lee. What happened?

391
00:27:32,969 --> 00:27:35,309
The bank won't wait anymore, CEO Goo.

392
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:37,110
They wanted this handled within the day.

393
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,479
I still had a month more. Why are they doing this?

394
00:27:40,449 --> 00:27:42,350
Tell them I'll be at the bank tomorrow.

395
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,680
Nothing will happen, so reassure our customers, too.

396
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:46,620
Goodbye.

397
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:50,219
Is this something serious?

398
00:27:50,219 --> 00:27:52,630
They're suddenly giving me pressure to pay the loan back.

399
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,830
I'll have a talk with them tomorrow.

400
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:57,729
It'll be fine.

401
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,670
I should let Se Young study business management at university.

402
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:09,180
She must've taken after my brains.

403
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,680
Her grades are too good to let her study music.

404
00:28:12,309 --> 00:28:14,749
She can always play the piano as a hobby.

405
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,719
She could be helpful...

406
00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:20,390
for your business if she studies business management.

407
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:22,090
Did she say she wanted to do that?

408
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,430
Se Young would say yes if you told her to do that.

409
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:29,529
She played the piano for you...

410
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,160
and ended up here.

411
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:32,999
Chairman Shin.

412
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:36,799
CEO Goo Young Min of Youngshin Fashion will visit...

413
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,199
the bank tomorrow.

414
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:39,769
What did the bank say?

415
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:41,440
They're waiting for your permission.

416
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:46,249
- Give them the approval. - I'll do that.

417
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,979
Someone must be going bankrupt again.

418
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,620
Hello, Chairman Shin.

419
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,090
(Hwang Jin Goo)

420
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,259
Hello.

421
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,489
What brings you here, Jin Goo?

422
00:28:57,489 --> 00:28:58,630
I invited him.

423
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:00,860
- Let's go. - Yes.

424
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,529
- Have you eaten? - Of course.

425
00:29:04,529 --> 00:29:06,430
- What did you eat? - I had...

426
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,330
What's going on between them?

427
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:13,039
Is she trying to set him up with Se Young?

428
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,380
No. Never.

429
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,880
Next, number nine, Goo Ha Na from Hanyoung Girls' High School.

430
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,090
(The 35th Yeohwa University Piano Competition...)

431
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,519
(for High School Students)

432
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:09,130
(The 35th Yeohwa University Piano Competition...)

433
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,459
(for High School Students)

434
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,239
What? What are you talking about?

435
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,249
I'll be at the bank tomorrow.

436
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:28,749
If you break the promise like this,

437
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:30,920
how is anyone going to trust the bank and take out a loan?

438
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:33,789
Where's Chairwoman Shin now? I'll meet her and...

439
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,289
Hello?

440
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,430
Are we going to lose our factory?

441
00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:48,430
That won't happen.

442
00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:51,840
I need to meet Chairwoman Shin.

443
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:54,009
I'll drop you in front of the concert hall,

444
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,140
so please explain this to Ha Na for me.

445
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,809
Hello? Chairwoman Shin?

446
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,630
How can this happen?

447
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:18,229
There must be some confusion at the bank.

448
00:31:18,229 --> 00:31:19,469
I'll be there now, so...

449
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,729
No, you don't need to come.

450
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,469
Sorry? What do you mean?

451
00:31:24,469 --> 00:31:27,410
You've done good work, CEO Goo.

452
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,289
- Honey! - No!

453
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,440
(Cinderella Game)

454
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:12,779
He was speeding?

455
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:16,320
Mr. Young Jae said our mom and dad died.

456
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,120
Have we become orphans?

457
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:20,049
The bank came for confiscation.

458
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,059
Bring Mom and Dad back!

459
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,219
Bring my mom and dad back!

460
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,360
Please let us keep our dad's factory.

461
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,199
Your aunt has her eyes on Jin Goo.

462
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,229
She wouldn't do that even for her own.

463
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:34,199
We're total strangers anyway.

464
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:36,340
Mom and Dad aren't here anymore, so let's go on our own way.

465
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,910
I'm the head of this family without Mom and Dad.

466
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:40,670
I don't want that!
