1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,040
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,820
Do you not remember anything
about your fall?

5
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:14,220
My fall?

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,290
You collapsed at home,
lost consciousness,

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:18,890
and were brought to the hospital.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,060
Choi Myung Ji was there with you.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,530
Do you not remember anything?

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
I collapsed at home?

11
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,930
Choi Myung Ji...

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,410
The notebook.

13
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,040
The notebook?

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,620
What notebook?

15
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,520
That evil brat.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,060
That evil brat?

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,700
Who?

18
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,350
It seemed like someone was here.

19
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,920
- What's wrong?
- I thought someone had come by.

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,260
We should check the CCTV footage
of the corridor.

21
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,000
Why is that girl still here?

22
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,780
Is she trying to stick around
to make Yeo Jin remember?

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,790
It's Choi Myung Ji.

24
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,220
Do you think
she called her the evil brat?

25
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,790
She tried to come in,
then suddenly hid herself.

26
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,460
She must've heard
about the notebook.

27
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,260
Let's think about the correlation...

28
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,630
between the notebook,
Choi Myung Ji, and Yeo Jin's fall.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,970
Myung Ji and the notebook...

31
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,800
must've been there
when she collapsed.

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,270
The notebook must be
an important lead.

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,470
Do you think they got into a fight
because of the notebook?

34
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,280
That sounds plausible.

35
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,780
Was there a notebook
Yeo Jin had used?

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,810
She doesn't use a notebook.

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,050
Then, there's a high possibility...

38
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,950
- that it belongs to Choi Myung Ji.
- Yes.

39
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:30,120
I'll go to her place
and look for the notebook.

40
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,760
Then, there's a high possibility
that it belongs to Choi Myung Ji.

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,330
Yes.

42
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,230
I'll go to her place
and look for the notebook.

43
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,940
Search my home all you want.

44
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,970
You won't find it there.

45
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,640
Give me that.

46
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,050
Give it back.

47
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,480
- Let go of me!
- Give it back!

48
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,720
Why did you steal my notebook?

49
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,760
You caused Yu Jin's
hit-and-run accident...

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,120
and killed her!
Everything is in here!

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,860
You're over.

52
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,140
Even if she remembers that,

53
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,100
I'll be fine
if the notebook doesn't exist.

54
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:24,610
I should burn it or something.

55
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,320
What brings you here?

56
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,650
Oh, I was looking for something.

57
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,890
What?

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,560
By any chance, have you seen
a notebook around here?

59
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,990
A notebook?

60
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,660
What notebook?

61
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,260
Never mind.

62
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:28,340
Why was she looking for a notebook
on the second floor?

63
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,290
(Cho Byung Jin: October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

64
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,330
Should I destroy the original
and make a copy?

65
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,500
There's no guarantee...

66
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,710
that Detective Cho won't betray me.

67
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,550
Did you see Myung Ji's notebook?

68
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,320
Tell Yu Jin to come.

69
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,550
She went home.

70
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,360
Do you not remember
what was in the notebook?

71
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,360
I want to talk to Yu Jin.

72
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:25,400
She has to go to work.

73
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,330
She can't come here often.

74
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,170
I'll talk to Yu Jin.

75
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,300
But you don't want to talk to me?

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,980
You're here.
Have you found the notebook?

77
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,590
It wasn't there.

78
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,720
I don't think Choi Myung Ji
would've left it home.

79
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,120
That's true.

80
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,130
Did the chairwoman
remember anything else?

81
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,260
She won't talk to me.

82
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,600
She'll only talk to Yu Jin.

83
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,340
She seems to trust
and depend on her daughter the most.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,570
It looks like Ms. Goo has the key
to finding her memories.

85
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,480
She'll only talk to me?

86
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,920
Why is she doing this?

87
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,420
All right. Goodbye, then.

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,060
What is it?

89
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,100
Mr. Yoon asked the chairwoman
about Choi Myung Ji's notebook,

90
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,100
but she stayed silent
and said she'd only talk to me.

91
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,470
Did he ask you to come?

92
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,970
He didn't say that,
but he probably meant it.

93
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,910
I'm kind of curious to find out
what she'll talk about.

94
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,480
I'm thinking about...

95
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,150
visiting her every day
starting tomorrow.

96
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,520
You're concerned.

97
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,850
She needs to regain her memories...

98
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,390
to punish Choi Myung Ji,
ensure Eun Chong's safety,

99
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,320
and right the wrong
for the injustice done to Du Na.

100
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,190
I want to expose...

101
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,000
the hit-and-run accident
before it's too late.

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
Will you act as her daughter
and help her find her memories?

103
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,500
I dread acting like Du Na,

104
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,440
but it's not a big problem
if I think of this as helping her...

105
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,940
find memories for Eun Chong.

106
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,880
I have no reason to stop you
if that's what you want.

107
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,850
Is there anything else you need?

108
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,950
The place is packed.

109
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,760
Mom, join us.

110
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,460
Yes, you should join us.

111
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,060
I'll eat later with my staff.

112
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,830
Anyway, is the chairwoman
slowly regaining her memories?

113
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,100
Yes.

114
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
Gosh, I'm happy for her.
I hope she gets well soon.

115
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,640
Did the chairwoman
remember anything else?

116
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,950
She won't talk to me.

117
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,780
She'll only talk to Yu Jin.

118
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:02,290
She seems to trust
and depend on her daughter the most.

119
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,920
It looks like Ms. Goo has the key
to finding her memories.

120
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,530
She'll only talk to Ha Na?

121
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,440
I have to make sure
she doesn't meet Yeo Jin.

122
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,280
Detective Cho, I need some thugs.

123
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,250
I'll send you a photo of Goo Ha Na.

124
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,420
Break her leg...

125
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,950
so that she'll be in a cast
for about a month.

126
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,290
Let me know.

127
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,130
- Mom.
- My goodness. You surprised me.

128
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,760
You need to knock.

129
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,700
You never knock on my door, either.

130
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,900
What about the bugging device?
Have you listened to it?

131
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,170
There was nothing much.

132
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,440
Ms. Jang came by
to look for a notebook.

133
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,180
Did she say anything to you?

134
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,150
To me? No.

135
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,250
Why? Do you know
about this notebook, too?

136
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,520
How would I know?

137
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,420
But why was she upstairs?

138
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,490
She must've gone through my room.

139
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,060
No one uses notebooks these days.

140
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,330
You'll make Chairwoman Shin remember
to disclose Choi Myung Ji's crimes?

141
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,130
Yes, that's the only way
Eun Chong will be safe.

142
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,300
After all,
it's because of Eun Chong.

143
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,200
I can't deny that.

144
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,110
But I also want to find the truth
and bring justice, too.

145
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,740
I have to catch the driver
for Du Na's accident...

146
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,950
and the one
who took our parents' lives.

147
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,280
Okay.

148
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,750
Anyway, I have to act
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter,

149
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,720
so I wanted to let you know.

150
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,690
Don't tell Ji Eun or Ji Chang.

151
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,160
I won't.

152
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,690
You should help out if you can.

153
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,330
We have to expose
Choi Myung Ji's crimes.

154
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,460
I'll dig up everything.

155
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:55,600
The notebook probably isn't home.

156
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,640
She would've left it
in a personal safe.

157
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:59,140
That's true.

158
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,870
Se Young wouldn't know the passcode
to her mom's safe, right?

159
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,320
What brings you here?

160
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,050
Ms. Goo asked me
to bring things like...

161
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,620
family photo albums
and the chairwoman's perfume.

162
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:20,620
She said it'd help with finding
the chairwoman's memories.

163
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,190
Why would she ask for those?

164
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,900
Ms. Goo agreed
to act as her daughter.

165
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,840
What's wrong with that girl?

166
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:44,850
Detective Cho, did you find thugs
for the thing I mentioned yesterday?

167
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:49,420
Then, do it tonight.

168
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,790
Ha Na will act as Yu Jin?

169
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,860
If she sticks around
and helps find her memories,

170
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,090
it'll be over.

171
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,600
She'll find out I framed her
for my embezzlement...

172
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,500
if she gets her memories back.

173
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,700
Bye.

174
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,380
I heard you'll act as Yu Jin...

175
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,140
- by my aunt's side.
- Yes.

176
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,180
She took advantage of you
as her fake daughter.

177
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,750
Why do you want to be that again?

178
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,620
I want her to get her memories back.

179
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,120
Why would you want that?

180
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,190
I think that'll open up
the Pandora's box.

181
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,190
What do you mean by Pandora's box?

182
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,100
Are you curious?

183
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,030
Come and talk to me
whenever you want to.

184
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,710
Don't work too hard
trying to look after her.

185
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:48,780
Keep it moderate.

186
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,050
You should look after yourself.

187
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,720
I'll just sit there and chat.
There's nothing hard about that.

188
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,450
But I'll be careful.

189
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,160
It's still a shame
that I can't see you at work.

190
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,830
Wait, there's something
in your hair.

191
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,540
Bye.

192
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,470
Bye.

193
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,990
Can we talk?

194
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,630
- Are you dating Ha Na?
- Yes.

195
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,390
So, things came down to that.

196
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,630
I should've broken off
our engagement long ago.

197
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,130
Let's not talk about the past.

198
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,400
Then, let's talk about the present.

199
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,200
What is it?

200
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,770
When the chairwoman collapsed,

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,670
- you called 911, right?
- Yes.

202
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,610
Can you tell me
what the situation was like?

203
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:50,840
Why?

204
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,710
Did you find another circumstance
that makes my mom suspicious?

205
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,780
Se Young, what would you do
if your mother...

206
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,750
committed a crime?

207
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,620
Do you have evidence
she did that to my aunt?

208
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,290
No.

209
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,190
Are you telling me...

210
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,590
to be suspicious of her
without any evidence?

211
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,460
- She told lots of lies.
- What lies?

212
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,200
I trust my mom,

213
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,800
not anything you and Ha Na say.

214
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,600
She knew where Yu Jin was...

215
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,440
after she disappeared,
but she had kept it quiet.

216
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,210
What do you mean?

217
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:31,420
She knew where Yu Jin was,
yet she kept it quiet?

218
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,320
- Yes.
- Says who?

219
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,420
Ha Na and Yu Jin were
from the same children's home.

220
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,520
The reverend mother there
remembered your mother.

221
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,530
How can you believe that nun?

222
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,560
What if Ha Na bought her out?

223
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,660
That's for you to decide.

224
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,070
I won't believe anything
unless you bring hard proof.

225
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,900
Stop insulting my mom.

226
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,170
It means you're also humiliating me.

227
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,010
Se Young.

228
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,580
It's about time you found out.

229
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,760
She knew where Yu Jin was?

230
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,770
Yet she kept it to herself
for 20 years?

231
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,640
That's crazy.

232
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,640
She knew I had a hard time
because of Yu Jin's disappearance.

233
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,170
My mom wouldn't lie.

234
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,590
Do you remember these pictures?

235
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,890
These were the good times.

236
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,200
Do you know who this boy is?

237
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,570
He's...

238
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,040
Grandma!

239
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,440
Grandma, do you remember this?

240
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,730
Is this yours?

241
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,800
Grandma. I mean, Ms. Chairwoman.

242
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,640
This is my present.

243
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,380
Eun Chong.

244
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,110
Grandma, do you remember me now?

245
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,820
Yes, I remember you, Eun Chong.

246
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,690
Do you really remember him?

247
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,090
Yes.

248
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:56,630
He's your son.

249
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,070
Did she remember Eun Chong?

250
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,270
Yes.

251
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:12,110
That means
she'll remember me soon, too.

252
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,120
So, where's Sung Ho?

253
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,620
He went to the police station.

254
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,590
It looks like he'll get acquitted.

255
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:25,920
What kind of an evil person
would make a false report like that?

256
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,730
She's saying that to my face
on purpose.

257
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,130
Can I talk to you?

258
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,670
Let me go first.

259
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,470
How can you send Eun Chong
to study abroad without telling me?

260
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,710
You even lied and told me
to meet him on the weekend.

261
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,880
You would've stopped me
if you found out.

262
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,650
You're too brazen.

263
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,350
You're no longer his guardian,

264
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:58,260
so stop minding him.

265
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,790
Say what you want to say.

266
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:06,830
It's better that I help Yeo Jin
get her memories back,

267
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,330
so you can leave.

268
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,830
What do you mean by better?

269
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,170
She and I lived together
for the last 20 years.

270
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,010
- You've only known her for...
- How is that important?

271
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:19,340
- I'm Yu Jin, and that's important.
- What?

272
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,980
The chairwoman wants me.

273
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,120
She'll refuse to talk to you.

274
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,380
She called you an evil brat.

275
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,220
- What?
- You heard her yesterday.

276
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,220
I could tell everything
by those two words.

277
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,160
Hey, how are you going to believe
someone who has amnesia...

278
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
She may not remember in her head,

279
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,730
but her feelings do.

280
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm here,
so it'll be better if you stay away.

281
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,780
Is that so?

282
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,280
If I can't come,

283
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,620
I'll make sure you can't come,
either.

284
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:11,360
Hey, what does this mean?

285
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,460
What is it?

286
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,000
"Goo Ha Na is currently
attending to Shin Yeo Jin."

287
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,200
"Visit Room 1105
at Hanguk Hospital."

288
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
What? Why is she
looking after Chairwoman Shin?

289
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,480
This is crazy.
Someone must be slandering her.

290
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,080
Wait, do you think
she's really looking after her?

291
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,350
Should we go and check?

292
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,880
Let's call her first.

293
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,260
Why won't she pick up? Is this true?

294
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,260
Let's ask Ji Seok.

295
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,800
Goodness. What's with her?

296
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,300
I'm glad Mr. Yoon was acquitted.

297
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,540
Yes.

298
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,670
Chairwoman Shin is slowly
remembering one thing after another.

299
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,870
Ha Na told me.

300
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,320
Hey, what is it?

301
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,290
Ji Seok, is Ha Na
looking after Chairwoman Shin?

302
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,450
Who told you that nonsense?

303
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,690
Darn it. Right?

304
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:15,090
Someone texted Ji Chang...

305
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,090
and said
Ha Na was looking after her.

306
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,730
She's not. Bye.

307
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,570
Who would be displeased...

308
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,970
about Ha Na looking after
Chairwoman Shin?

309
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,510
Choi Myung Ji.

310
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,380
What a diligent woman.

311
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,190
After I lost you,

312
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,960
your dad left home.

313
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,260
I had to live a tough life
all by myself.

314
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,000
Do you remember those days?

315
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:57,940
I looked everywhere,
but I still couldn't find you.

316
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:02,870
No matter how long I waited,
your dad never reached out.

317
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,810
I felt like I was
thrown into this world all alone.

318
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,820
When you took advantage of me
as a fake daughter,

319
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,990
I also felt like
I was abandoned by this world.

320
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,730
Back then,
expanding my business was...

321
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,230
the only thing that kept me going.

322
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,770
I would've fallen apart
if I didn't have that.

323
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,740
I lost myself in work
and making money...

324
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,810
and did the worst of things.

325
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,880
I didn't even know
how evil those things were.

326
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,350
I was such a fool.

327
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,620
Maybe I continued to live...

328
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,590
because I was so foolish.

329
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,790
Otherwise,

330
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,360
I would've gone to the sea
where I lost you and...

331
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,670
I won't forgive you...

332
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,870
just because
you're ranting like this.

333
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,410
You may have lived
because of your foolishness,

334
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,510
but my parents and we...

335
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,490
Ha Na.

336
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,330
You're here.

337
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,990
Congratulations
on getting acquitted.

338
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,560
It's all thanks to your help.

339
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:36,870
Se Young came to see you.

340
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,600
Se Young?

341
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,980
You want to know
about the Pandora's box?

342
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,510
You told me to come to you
if I wanted to know.

343
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:53,080
Did my mom visit the children's home
where you and Yu Jin lived?

344
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,390
- How did you know?
- Answer me.

345
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,620
When did she go there, and why?

346
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,990
Around when we were 10 or 11.

347
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,530
It was when Yu Jin was adopted
and about to emigrate.

348
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,800
Is there...

349
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,730
any other evidence other than
how the nun remembers her?

350
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,340
- Not yet.
- Can you find the evidence?

351
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,940
- Your mom's confession.
- "Confession?"

352
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,010
You've become suspicious of her
without hard evidence.

353
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,580
You can be suspicious of someone
based on circumstances.

354
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,620
You're free to make the decision.

355
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,160
She would've kept track
of Du Na since that day.

356
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,120
She must've known...

357
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,090
Du Na was adopted
and had emigrated to America.

358
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,330
She kept tracking her
even after she went to America?

359
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:44,530
Then, she must've known
Du Na was in Korea seven years ago.

360
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,940
She knew everything,
yet she kept it...

361
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,470
from Chairwoman Shin and you
for 20 years.

362
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,040
What do you think is the reason?

363
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,210
Because of Hyesung Group?

364
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,950
And for your information,

365
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,850
she's probably
tracking your phone, too.

366
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,880
What is this nonsense?

367
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,080
Look on your phone.

368
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,220
And find out what else...

369
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,290
your mother is hiding.

370
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,000
They narrowed down the suspect
for the hit-and-run case to five?

371
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
Then, he'll get caught soon!

372
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,070
I already handled them with money.

373
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,000
They won't talk about you
even if they get caught.

374
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,040
Are you sure I can trust you?

375
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:26,510
Don't trust people. Trust money.

376
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,940
Darn it.

377
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:31,210
Money is literally
the only thing I can trust.

378
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,690
I need to get my hands
on her trust fund to do something.

379
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:39,860
This was why I wanted
to send him abroad long ago.

380
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,460
He has a fear of heights
and can't fly.

381
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,530
What can I do?

382
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,130
Make sure you lie low, too.

383
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,900
Don't go around making trouble.

384
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,700
When do you think
you'll specify the culprit?

385
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,440
We plan to investigate
the five suspects in detail.

386
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,540
All right.

387
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,510
Let me know if you have an update.

388
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,410
Goodbye.

389
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,120
Ha Na, the police just called.

390
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:15,330
They narrowed down the suspects
for the hit-and-run case to five.

391
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,660
That's great news.
I'll tell Mr. Yoon.

392
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,970
Oh, and he was acquitted.

393
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,130
I heard.

394
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,100
We heard two great news today.

395
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,500
No, three.

396
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,640
You didn't forget
about dinner, right?

397
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
No, I'll see you later.

398
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,880
How could she install
a location tracking app on my phone?

399
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,720
And find out what else
your mother is hiding.

400
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,290
She must've hidden
important things outside...

401
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,460
in her personal safe.

402
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,360
First, I need to find out
where her safe is.

403
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,300
You're there already?

404
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,070
I'm almost there, too.

405
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,070
I'll come for you.

406
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,370
It's okay. I'll be there soon.

407
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,870
- I want to see you quickly.
- Fine.

408
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:53,920
Can we talk?

409
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,230
Talk about what?

410
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,160
Who are you?

411
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,370
Don't come near me.

412
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,240
I'll scream.

413
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,950
Come on, man.

414
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,720
Why are you doing this? Stop it.

415
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,020
- Don't come near me!
- Shut your mouth!

416
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,830
Hey, hold her.

417
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,700
No.

418
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,560
Let go of me!

419
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,400
Ha Na, are you okay?

420
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,670
- Jin Goo...
- Get up.

421
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,010
Who are you? Some delinquents?

422
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,310
"Delinquents?"

423
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,710
Do you think we're a joke, you punk?

424
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,320
Stay still!

425
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,590
Hey, you punk!

426
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,760
You.

427
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,860
- Jin Goo...
- Darn it.

428
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,500
- Hey.
- Get her.

429
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,200
- Stop it!
- Ha Na!

430
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,370
You punk.

431
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,540
- Let go of me!
- Ha Na!

432
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,570
- Let go of me!
- Stop messing with my sister!

433
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,280
Ji Chang!

434
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,610
You.

435
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,850
Darn it.

436
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,950
Ha Na, run!

437
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,050
Ji Chang! You, too!

438
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,560
What? They failed?

439
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
Why couldn't you hurt
just some girl...

440
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,040
Did you use delinquent kids
instead of actual gangsters?

441
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:48,410
Darn it. I'm hanging up!

442
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,610
This punk...

443
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,020
Mom always knew where Yu Jin was,
but she kept it a secret?

444
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,090
Why did she hide it from me?

445
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,130
What makes you so sure
that it's not?

446
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,430
Yu Jin came back in the end too.

447
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:14,730
You're right. Yu Jin came back.

448
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,730
But what?
Does that affect you at all?

449
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,900
- It doesn't yet.
- Why doesn't it?

450
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,410
I've become a servant girl now.

451
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,440
Consider the long run.

452
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,180
The person who's laughing in the end
is the winner.

453
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,820
She will never remember
what happened that day.

454
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,190
She always knew Ha Na was a fake?

455
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:40,690
But we're here already.
Let's find out who she's with.

456
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:43,860
Who did she have to meet
immediately...

457
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,800
as soon as her video call
got postponed?

458
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,970
Why are you so sure
that it's not about Yu Jin?

459
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:52,240
I know that instinctively.

460
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,470
Did she already know
Yu Jin was dead?

461
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,410
Your aunt and uncle's DNAs were
contaminated a long time ago.

462
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:04,480
The DNA
will never help her find Yu Jin.

463
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,820
Wait.

464
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,720
Did she also contaminate...

465
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,120
their DNA samples?

466
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,670
When Yeo Jin remembers everything,

467
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,510
she won't care about the evidence
and kick me out right away.

468
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,810
I have to grab
whatever that's worth money.

469
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,750
Hey, what is it?

470
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,260
Have you found anything
by tapping the room?

471
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeo Jin remembered Eun Chong.

472
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,330
Will it be the end of us
when she remembers everything,

473
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,000
just as you said?

474
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,670
What do you mean, the end?

475
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,510
She'll just kick us out
like last time.

476
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,080
You said it'd be the end of us.

477
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,310
Please be honest.
Will it be our demise?

478
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,420
I said no.

479
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,890
Just take my word for it
when I say no.

480
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,660
When was the first time
you heard about Yu Jin?

481
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,760
I told you that I found out
because of the fake daughter thing.

482
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,260
Have you heard of St. Paul's Home?

483
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:31,100
No, I've never heard of it.

484
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,440
Stop lying.

485
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,540
How would I know that place?

486
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,270
That's the children's home
Yu Jin lived at.

487
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,340
You didn't know she lived there?

488
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,980
How would I know?

489
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,350
- How do you know?
- Ha Na told me.

490
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,420
She was adopted at 11
and had emigrated.

491
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,020
She told me...

492
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,490
you knew where she was
since that day,

493
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,590
about her move abroad
and how she returned seven years ago.

494
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,790
- What?
- Why did you deceive me?

495
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,760
Why did you lie
to Aunt Yeo Jin and me?

496
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,600
Why did you deceive me
for the last 20 years?

497
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,000
Because of you.

498
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,270
Because of me?

499
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,140
Why would I do that
if it weren't for you?

500
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,280
Do you have any other questions?

501
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,120
Are you hiding...

502
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:24,050
- anything else?
- No.

503
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,260
Did you also contaminate
my aunt and uncle's...

504
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,560
DNA?

505
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,830
Did you make my aunt...

506
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,800
- fall into a coma?
- What are you talking about?

507
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,630
Did you put my aunt
off her respirator?

508
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,670
- Tell me! Did you do that?
- Yes!

509
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,370
I did that!

510
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,770
Happy now?

511
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,940
(Cinderella Game)

512
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,510
I feel oddly offended
whenever I see you.

513
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,870
Who could've put this here?

514
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,480
You were everything in my life.
I always looked up to you.

515
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,110
You want to see me go down, right?

516
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,880
Everything was
written in that notebook.

517
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,880
I heard Shin Yeo Jin was
getting discharged.

518
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,220
Did she remember everything?

519
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,750
Have you seen a notebook at home?

520
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:06,290
Why did you call me an evil brat?

521
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,220
She's a scary woman. Be careful.

522
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,090
You're the evil brat, Yeo Jin.
