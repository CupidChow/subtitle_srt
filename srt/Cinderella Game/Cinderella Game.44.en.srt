1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,069
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,609
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,309
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,619
(Episode 44)

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,119
A genetic test?

6
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,699
Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na.

7
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,829
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na
are blood-related.)

8
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:26,160
They are blood-related?

9
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,699
What a meticulously forged document.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,840
Why is she keeping it?
Hasn't it been put to use?

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,950
What are you doing?

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:42,880
What?

13
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:47,549
Did you just go through my room?

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,759
That's nonsense.

15
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,490
I was looking for your lost photo...

16
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,259
to prove Se Young's innocence.

17
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,469
Why do you treasure it so much?

18
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,170
The document scientifically proves
Mom and I are biologically related.

19
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,680
- It's only right to cherish it.
- What?

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,010
"Biologically related?"

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,379
What is it?

22
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:20,519
Do you truly believe you're Yu Jin?

23
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,760
Are you being deceived as well?

24
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,560
Is there anything you want to say?

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,159
Well...

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,629
How did you feel
when you heard about the result...

27
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,239
of that genetic test?

28
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,370
We often see such moments in dramas,

29
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,709
so what's it like in real life?

30
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,180
I couldn't believe it
and felt dumbfounded.

31
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:47,980
Yes, of course.

32
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:52,620
I would've felt the same way
if the chairwoman were my mom.

33
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:57,659
Gosh, I'm sorry for barging in
without you here.

34
00:01:58,989 --> 00:02:02,560
From now on, please refrain
from entering my room...

35
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,560
while I'm away.

36
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,230
I'll do that.

37
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,439
Why did she go through my room?

38
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,110
She's so weird.

39
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,990
I have a favor to ask of you.

40
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:31,189
Yu Jin was traumatized
at the time of her disappearance...

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,530
and didn't remember
anything about her childhood.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,000
Please refrain from mentioning anything
about her childhood...

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,030
and whatever happened
before her disappearance.

44
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,300
It's awful that
she's still struggling with that.

45
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,500
I don't really know
since I can't remember.

46
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,569
A memory from when she was
seven years old...

47
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:47,740
should be gone by now.

48
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:52,740
That was why Yeo Jin stopped us
from talking about her childhood.

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,949
But why did Yeo Jin
even deceive that girl...

50
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,020
to turn her into a fake daughter?

51
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,159
Hello, Ms. Jang.
What about the adoption files?

52
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:09,930
I just texted you
the list of files you'll need.

53
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,599
Okay. I'll check, get those ready,
and get back to you.

54
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,969
Thank you. Goodbye.

55
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,370
(Draw Your Beloved Family,
Volunteer Teacher: Mr. Han Min Su)

56
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,860
Eun Chong, is everything great
at your bestie granny's place?

57
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,199
Yes, her place is huge.

58
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,969
She has lots of rooms...

59
00:03:50,969 --> 00:03:54,569
- and delicious food in the fridge.
- Is that so?

60
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:57,009
And Auntie Ha Na will adopt me!

61
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,979
I see. That's great news.

62
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:04,780
Do you think
the wish kite reached my mommy?

63
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:06,449
It must have.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,889
Is Auntie Ha Na also happy?

65
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:14,330
Yes, she also said she was happy.

66
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,930
I'll introduce you
to my bestie granny later.

67
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,269
Okay.

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,149
Wait, she deceived that brat, too?

69
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,149
It'd be a tough game to pull
even if they did this together.

70
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,350
Chairwoman Shin is something.

71
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,750
Why did it have to be that girl?

72
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,259
What does she have?

73
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,889
Her assets and bank account
didn't show any changes.

74
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,300
It didn't seem like
she became her fake daughter...

75
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
because of money.

76
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,970
The only thing she had in common
with dead Yu Jin was...

77
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,509
that they grew up
in the same children's home.

78
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,879
Do a little digging
at the children's home...

79
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:07,180
regarding Lee Du Na and Goo Ha Na.

80
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,850
She went by Lee Ha Na there, right?

81
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,319
Lee Du Na, Lee Ha Na.

82
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,589
Make sure to move quietly.

83
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,860
I'll look into Goo Ha Na's siblings.

84
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,889
Could her sibling, that director,
know something?

85
00:05:22,329 --> 00:05:23,560
Goo Ji Seok?

86
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,529
He cut ties with his sister
after this incident.

87
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,639
It seemed like he was deceived, too.

88
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,939
Should I comb through her home?

89
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:38,379
I'll get her siblings out,

90
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,209
so search through her place.

91
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:42,649
Hello, Attorney Ko.

92
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,680
What did you say?

93
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,920
A man came to the children's home...

94
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,350
and asked
about Lee Du Na and Lee Ha Na.

95
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:53,459
About Yu Jin and Ms. Goo Ha Na?

96
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,060
Gosh, it looks wonderful.

97
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,500
I should've brought Kongkong
into the picture.

98
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,269
Let's take one
with Kongkong next time.

99
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,040
Is he fine now?

100
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,540
Yes, Auntie Ha Na stitched him up.

101
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,910
I'll keep him safe from now on.

102
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,009
May I take a look?

103
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,550
- Auntie, I need to pee.
- Okay. Go ahead.

104
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:24,220
He made a mini photo frame
of you and Eun Chong.

105
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,360
What should I do with this?

106
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,860
I see.

107
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,730
I'll leave it in my room,
next to our picture.

108
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,470
Okay.

109
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,300
How did Eun Chong's mom
get into an accident like that?

110
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,170
She said it seemed like
she found her mother,

111
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,279
that she was going to meet
the landlady.

112
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,850
- "The landlady?"
- Yes.

113
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,250
She was so excited
about meeting her,

114
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,050
but she got into that accident
on that day.

115
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,689
The phone wasn't at the scene,
so no one found out who she met...

116
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,759
or who the driver was.
It was unresolved.

117
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,529
Was it really an accident?

118
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:06,660
I was suspicious of that, too.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,000
But there was no evidence or lead.

120
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:12,500
I was too busy making a living,
so I couldn't keep track of it.

121
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,870
I see.

122
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,870
Where did she say was
her mother's place?

123
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,540
I really regret
not asking her for the neighborhood.

124
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,350
The accident broke out
near Siwang Intersection,

125
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,980
so I thought it was somewhere there.

126
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,980
"Siwang Intersection?"

127
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,250
It's the opposite of my neighborhood,
and it's quite far.

128
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,259
Who was that landlady?

129
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,060
Yu Jin,
when are you going back to work?

130
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,569
In two days.

131
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:43,699
Is that so?
Then, let's invite your siblings home.

132
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,040
How does dinner tomorrow
work for you, Yeo Jin?

133
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,810
That sounds hasty.

134
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,740
We should do these things promptly.

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,680
It'd be better to invite them
while Yu Jin was on a leave.

136
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,850
Tell them to come over
right after work.

137
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,680
- Go ahead and do that.
- Okay. I'll call them.

138
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:02,420
Today, I met with some people...

139
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,319
and heard about how they made it big
by starting a small business.

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
Someone I met today made it
by selling spicy stir-fried chicken,

141
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,500
and that life story was
like an epic drama.

142
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,899
Is that so?

143
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:17,199
First, the person went bankrupt
because of a corporate raider.

144
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,769
The family became homeless and began
to hop from one sauna to another.

145
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,610
Then, the family met
a philanthropist,

146
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,139
started a new business,
and got a big break.

147
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,879
Right. I see.

148
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,180
That philanthropist gives out grants
to start businesses...

149
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:33,519
and business consultations
for victims of corporate raiders.

150
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,019
Is that so?

151
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,519
I may not be a victim
of a corporate raider,

152
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,860
but I want a consultation
from that philanthropist.

153
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,100
But the one I met today
didn't have the contact...

154
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:47,000
because that philanthropist
didn't like to be made known.

155
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:50,399
I mean, why hide
after doing all that good work?

156
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,269
We should tell the whole world.

157
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:55,570
But I'm here for you
instead of that person.

158
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:59,240
Right. Mr. Han,
you definitely measure up.

159
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,179
One moment.

160
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,250
It's Ha Na.

161
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,549
Yes, my lady.

162
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,220
What? You're inviting me
for dinner tomorrow?

163
00:09:13,789 --> 00:09:15,090
Of course, I can.

164
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:18,200
Then, I should go to the sauna
and get a haircut, too.

165
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,830
But still, I want to look good
as a part of the Hyesung family.

166
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,500
I can pull off a rich grandson style
if I put my mind to it,

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,070
but I'm worried about Ji Eun.

168
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,610
I got invited
to a conglomerate's house?

169
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,179
I'm so nervous.

170
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,639
What's the dress code?

171
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,450
There's nothing like that.
Whatever that looks neat is fine.

172
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,419
I look like I belong in rich towns
no matter what I wear,

173
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,990
but I'm worried about Ji Chang.

174
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,559
Aunt Myung Ji told me...

175
00:09:50,929 --> 00:09:52,730
that you also had a tough time...

176
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:55,070
- on the day I went missing...
- Stop.

177
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,470
Please don't bring that up again.

178
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:05,340
- I'm back now, so...
- That's enough.

179
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,649
Good luck with Aunt Yeo Jin.

180
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,519
If anything happens, I'll take over
Hyesung Group with your brother.

181
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,519
What's going on this time?

182
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,059
It's nothing.

183
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,240
It'd be game over
if she found out she was a fake.

184
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,009
But I can't be the one to tell her.

185
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:39,539
How am I going to do this?

186
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:56,759
What are you doing?
This is just awful.

187
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,730
Why did you put this here?

188
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,669
You have to look at her often
to become immune...

189
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,799
and used to that face.

190
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,600
That family photo in the living room
is more than enough.

191
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:08,269
Put it away.

192
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,809
Just think of it as a prop
for your act.

193
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,179
You can turn it away from your eyes,
just like this.

194
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,179
Is Jin Goo looking for the evidence?

195
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,950
He's doing his best, but who knows?

196
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:24,360
You talk as if
it's someone else's business.

197
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,460
You have to get information
from Ji Seok...

198
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,090
and hand it over to Jin Goo.

199
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,429
I'm trying
to wrap my brain around this, too.

200
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:34,330
Ji Seok isn't an easy fight.

201
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,309
The person you have reached is
unavailable. Please...

202
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,809
The owner of the rent-a-car business
has been out of reach for an hour.

203
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,179
Was there a change of heart?

204
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,730
Please come in.

205
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,200
Thank you for coming.

206
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,100
Is something good going on?

207
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,110
You look great.

208
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,740
Is something bad going on?

209
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,409
You don't look good.

210
00:12:56,049 --> 00:12:58,179
I got stood up by the owner
of a rent-a-car business.

211
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,620
I heard that you were behind
canceling our contract,

212
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,190
but I failed to record it.

213
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:06,820
I was supposed to record
his testimony and get evidence,

214
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,529
but he went out of touch
right before the meeting.

215
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,460
You should've kept things
more confidential...

216
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,960
before you blamed the man
who didn't show up.

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,029
You're right.

218
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:19,269
Where could that information
have leaked from?

219
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,110
You won't get the answer
by asking me.

220
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,710
I wasn't expecting an answer.

221
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,879
Good luck.

222
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,580
I haven't heard that in a while.

223
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,080
You also said that...

224
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,679
about my wedding.

225
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,220
I meant to show my support.

226
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,289
Why does it sound like
the exact opposite to me?

227
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:38,690
You must want to hear it like that.

228
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:42,429
No, it sounded like you wanted
this marriage to go haywire.

229
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,139
The information was leaked?

230
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,139
Only you, me,
and Mr. Yoon knew about this.

231
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,139
How could it have leaked?

232
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,940
- Could it be Mr. Yoon?
- It wasn't him.

233
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:00,779
You never know
what a person is thinking.

234
00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:03,909
- Are you saying it's me?
- It's not you, either.

235
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,990
Instead of the information leaking,
maybe the owner changed his mind.

236
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,990
Mr. Goo made him change his mind.

237
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,690
But how did he know about this
and meet the owner at that hour?

238
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,429
Did he say he met the owner?

239
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
He said I should've kept things
more confidential...

240
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,700
before I blamed the man
who didn't show up.

241
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,669
Do you have a way around this
if you don't find any evidence?

242
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:28,870
I'd first find out
where the information leaked from.

243
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,110
You can't.

244
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,110
That's the price you'll pay
for lying to me all along.

245
00:14:34,909 --> 00:14:36,549
Is there anything I can do to help?

246
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:37,879
You're with the hotel now.

247
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,019
I don't want Goo Ji Seok
to be harsh on you again.

248
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,019
I can put up with that.

249
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,759
I heard your family invited
Ms. Goo's siblings home tonight.

250
00:14:46,389 --> 00:14:48,389
- You can go home.
- That's not important.

251
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,629
Let me know anytime
if you need help.

252
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,049
Hey, what is this?
You aren't going on a blind date.

253
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:16,289
Speak for yourself.
A suit doesn't suit you.

254
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:17,350
Darn it, you.

255
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,789
Anyway, how do you tie a tie?

256
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:21,460
Let me help you.

257
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:35,409
It's like seeing a dad doing this
for a son on his first day of work.

258
00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:37,909
- Thank you.
- You look great.

259
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,509
I can look sharper than anyone
when I decide to.

260
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,850
Right. What did you get
as a present?

261
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,679
- It's nothing lousy, right?
- I never do anything lousy.

262
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,789
I prepared something
beyond your imagination.

263
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,389
What did you get?

264
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,960
Me? Something perfect
for the chairwoman.

265
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:55,730
She'd go, "Oh, my.
I thought it was already mine."

266
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,100
- Anyway, are we taking the bus?
- We can't do that in these clothes.

267
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,529
We'll call a cab.

268
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,940
And don't say anything to Ji Seok.

269
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:06,899
He wouldn't even care.

270
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,169
Have fun.

271
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,309
- Okay!
- Okay!

272
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,580
We have to put in lots of sauce
to make it more delicious.

273
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,750
It looks so good.

274
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,419
All right. Can you give it a taste?

275
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:24,720
Okay.

276
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,490
It looks so good.

277
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,669
It's good.

278
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,700
You should try some, too, Ms. Sim.

279
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,740
- One moment. Here.
- Goodness. Okay.

280
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:41,340
- I got it.
- Okay.

281
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,340
Let me try it.

282
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,450
Should I put in more sesame oil?

283
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,679
- Sure. Let me do it.
- Okay.

284
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,250
Okay. That's enough.

285
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,590
The chairwoman won't like it
if she sees you in the kitchen.

286
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,789
It's all right.

287
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,460
I'm sorry for giving you more work
because of my siblings.

288
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,630
It's not a big deal to cook
for just two more people.

289
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,539
You should finish up and go home.

290
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,970
That must be my siblings.

291
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,750
- Guys!
- Ha Na! I missed you so much!

292
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:32,319
Without you, I feel like
a smartphone without wifi.

293
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,359
Didn't you miss me?

294
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,789
Enough is enough.

295
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,759
Don't be such a kid
when you're in such a nice suit.

296
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,700
The chairwoman will be here soon.

297
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,200
You're here.

298
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,500
I'll go, then.

299
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,670
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

300
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,109
Hello.
Why is Mr. Hwang's mother here?

301
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,039
What? She must be the helper.

302
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,509
- Goodbye, then.
- Goodbye.

303
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,180
That's kind of weird.

304
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,849
Uncle Ji Chang! Auntie Ji Eun!

305
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,460
- Hey, Eun Chong!
- Hey, Eun Chong!

306
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,829
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

307
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:11,359
- Welcome.
- Thank you for inviting us.

308
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,630
The flowers look
as beautiful as you.

309
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,799
Thank you.

310
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,440
They're Yu Jin's aunt and cousin.

311
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,940
- Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,009
Welcome.

313
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,740
Nice to meet you.

314
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:31,519
It's not much, but this is my present,
Ms. Chairwoman.

315
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,119
You didn't have to do this.

316
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,890
That's a thick envelope.
Is that money?

317
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,359
No, it's my token of appreciation.
Please open it.

318
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,029
(Tteokbokki Voucher, 30 dollars)

319
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,329
Tteokbokki vouchers?

320
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,099
Tteokbokki?

321
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:51,069
I'm about to open
that tteokbokki business.

322
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,839
I remembered how you seemed...

323
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,470
- to enjoy it a lot recently.
- Goo Ji...

324
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,839
A lifetime supply of tteokbokki
is all on me.

325
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,509
That's funny. Thank you.

326
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:04,549
Yeo Jin, you laid down many things
to put on this fake daughter act.

327
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,119
Please take my present, too.

328
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,789
Thank you.

329
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,529
Even Yoon Se Young
can't say anything about this.

330
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,359
She's a little better.

331
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:22,269
My gosh, a scarf?

332
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:25,000
I thought
it'd look wonderful on you.

333
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:30,369
- You look gorgeous.
- It looks good on you, Mom.

334
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,779
It's pretty, Grandma.

335
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,539
Is that so?

336
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,549
How did she know you liked scarves?

337
00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:38,019
You made a great choice.

338
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:41,619
Aunt Yeo Jin,
may I have that for a moment?

339
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,059
Don't you want it, too?

340
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,559
This is a knockoff.

341
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:54,299
My gosh.

342
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,099
What do you mean?
It's the real thing.

343
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,599
Did you get it
at a department store?

344
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,200
No, right?

345
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:02,910
I bought it from an online luxury store
I frequented at.

346
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,539
I confirmed that it was genuine.

347
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,009
Why would I buy a knockoff
when I paid for it with the credit card...

348
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,009
she gave me?

349
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:16,849
Yeo Jin, you even gave credit cards
to Yu Jin's siblings.

350
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,289
Then, you should've bought
the real one.

351
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,460
I'm sorry, Ms. Chairwoman.

352
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,230
I'll return it and get the real one.

353
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:28,670
It's all right.
It's the thought that counts.

354
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,799
You can't even tell.

355
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry, Mom.

356
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,700
My sister must've been deceived
into buying it.

357
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,369
It's okay, really.

358
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,240
Everyone will think it's real
when I put it on.

359
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,309
You're right.

360
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,960
Eat up.

361
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,059
So? Is everything good?

362
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:02,230
Yes, the best chef out there
must've made these.

363
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,299
The side dishes and even rice...

364
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,140
all taste wonderful.

365
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:08,569
Ms. Bang Ul made these.

366
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,740
- "Ms. Bang Ul?"
- "Ms. Bang Ul?"

367
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,109
Mr. Hwang's mommy.

368
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:15,450
Will you talk
after you swallow everything?

369
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:17,880
Right. I'm sorry.

370
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,390
Hey, it's all right.
It's nice to see him eat well.

371
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,589
Anyway, can you tell us
about Yu Jin's days in school?

372
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,900
We only knew her as a child
and didn't see her grow up.

373
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:33,859
I was curious to find out...

374
00:21:34,059 --> 00:21:36,670
what she was like as a student
and what she liked.

375
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,769
- When she was a student?
- Yes! I know that better than him.

376
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:43,869
He was a little kid
throughout her adolescence.

377
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,240
As a fellow woman,

378
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:50,509
she and I were such close sisters,
sharing all our secrets.

379
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,519
"Such close sisters?"

380
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:56,319
Right! This happened once.

381
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,490
Ha Na ate just about everything,
which was her strong suit,

382
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:02,930
so she even chugged spoiled milk
that was still left in the fridge.

383
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:07,029
But she didn't get sick.
She was completely fine,

384
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:10,869
so she made
all of our family shocked.

385
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:15,710
Wait, Yu Jin drank spoiled milk?

386
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,609
That's impossible. How odd.

387
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,680
Yu Jin was lactose-intolerant,

388
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,650
so she only had lactose-free milk.

389
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:26,920
Isn't that so, Yeo Jin?

390
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,190
You're right.
I think I remember that, too.

391
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:31,920
No, you're not remembering it right.

392
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,089
Yu Jin could drink regular milk.

393
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:36,630
Is that so?

394
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,670
Then, how did she
become a tour guide?

395
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,970
She used to love
sitting at home and reading books.

396
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,009
Her personality must've changed
as she grew up.

397
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:52,480
Why don't you ask questions
after our meal?

398
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,180
I thought
you'd be curious, too, Yeo Jin.

399
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,119
Why? Do you feel uncomfortable?

400
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,789
I must figure out
why you had to deceive...

401
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,990
even Goo Ha Na.

402
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,140
If he wasn't caught on the CCTV,

403
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,970
then it'd be impossible
to find out who he was.

404
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,779
If I make a rash move right now,
I'll end up getting caught.

405
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:28,980
One moment, please.

406
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,250
Are they already back from dinner?

407
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,950
- Move.
- Goodness!

408
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,789
Who are you?

409
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,400
He seemed like a young man.

410
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,700
Was he a thief?

411
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,539
Why did he
only go through this room?

412
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,609
A man came to the children's home...

413
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,079
and asked
about Lee Du Na and Lee Ha Na.

414
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,250
Was it the man
who visited the children's home?

415
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,390
What was he trying to find
in Ms. Goo's home?

416
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,890
Someone came into her place?

417
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,200
That place was supposed to be empty!

418
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,869
It was an older male.

419
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,130
"An older male?"

420
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,970
They don't have any parents!

421
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,710
So? You couldn't find anything?

422
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,279
So, you found nothing at her place
or the children's home?

423
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,049
I needed to know the link
between Goo Ha Na and Yu Jin...

424
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:44,019
to find out why she deceived her
and brought her home.

425
00:24:45,289 --> 00:24:46,559
Find another way!

426
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,390
My gosh.

427
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:52,160
This is Auntie Ha Na and my room.

428
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:54,559
Hey, nice.

429
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:57,130
My gosh.

430
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:01,140
Excuse me.

431
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:05,380
Does Yu Jin have any friends?

432
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,980
She was the same age as Se Young,

433
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,950
so I thought it'd be nice
for all of them to know each other.

434
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:14,380
I don't think her friends
and your daughter will hit it off.

435
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,390
Don't try to get to her.

436
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,259
Who knows?

437
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,130
Who's her best friend?

438
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,359
This girl named Du Na.

439
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:25,529
Oh, I see.

440
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,099
But sadly, she passed away.

441
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,930
Goodness, what happened?
She must be still young.

442
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:33,269
Right? What an unlucky woman.

443
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:36,670
- Her husband died, and...
- Even her husband died?

444
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,210
Yes, on top of that...

445
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,980
Wait, there's more?

446
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,680
Hey! Our place got robbed!

447
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,380
What? Are you serious? Darn it.

448
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:53,019
The part after her husband's death
was more important.

449
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:55,789
(Police)

450
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:56,990
Darn it! No!

451
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,500
I thought I had lost everything
when I heard we were robbed.

452
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,269
- Do you have everything?
- Yes.

453
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,400
The thief didn't know
what these were worth.

454
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:10,970
All my luxury goods are there, too.

455
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,779
What the heck
did this stupid thief take?

456
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,410
The thief only went through
my drawers.

457
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:18,250
Was it really a simple theft?

458
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,319
I'm suspicious of that, too.

459
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,849
Was there anything
you noticed in particular?

460
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,690
He must've come in
thinking the place was empty,

461
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,759
so he seemed flustered
when he ran away after I walked in.

462
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,529
How did he know the place was empty?

463
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,329
Was it someone who knew we were invited
to Ha Na's for dinner?

464
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,500
Was this planned?

465
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,329
The thief
only combed through this place,

466
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,670
so he could've been
looking for something specific.

467
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,339
I recently moved,

468
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,670
so there wasn't anything left here.

469
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,579
We'll report
and investigate this case.

470
00:26:45,579 --> 00:26:47,980
Then, we'll reach out
if we have any updates.

471
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,289
- Mom.
- Hey.

472
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,819
You're back.

473
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,559
Did anything go missing?

474
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,400
No, it seemed like a simple theft,

475
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,630
but he probably
didn't find anything worth taking.

476
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,130
He made a mess out of the room
and ran away.

477
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:11,230
The police will investigate
and get back to me.

478
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,339
Wait, you called the police?

479
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:16,809
- Did you find a lead on the thief?
- No.

480
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,710
- I'm glad it wasn't worse.
- Right.

481
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,779
Where's Eun Chong?

482
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:24,009
He fell asleep in my room
after playing.

483
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:27,079
You should get some rest
before you go to work tomorrow.

484
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,849
Okay. Get a good rest, Mom.

485
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:40,099
What was he trying to take
from my room?

486
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,329
The thief knew our place was empty?

487
00:27:46,069 --> 00:27:48,609
Did he know
about the dinner invitation?

488
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,339
Only my siblings
and my family here know that.

489
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:10,390
The shoes.
I said I didn't want these.

490
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,000
Can't you just take those?

491
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,299
I'm doing my best
to get along with you,

492
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,930
but you always ignore
all my efforts.

493
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,940
- Do you really want to get along?
- Don't you believe me?

494
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,769
If you meant it,
then I thought I'd give you a tip.

495
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:26,210
- What tip?
- If you want to get along with me,

496
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,079
I don't need
expensive presents like these.

497
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,480
Show your respect
to people who are dear to me.

498
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,819
- What are you talking about?
- You looked down on my siblings.

499
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:36,250
It could've seemed like
a knockoff to you,

500
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,619
but how could you make her feel
that awkward to her face?

501
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:39,990
After all, she was a guest.

502
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,390
I was stating the facts.

503
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,730
Do facts come before people to you?

504
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:47,130
If you really wanted
to get along with me,

505
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,069
you couldn't have treated them
like you did today.

506
00:28:49,069 --> 00:28:50,799
When we had dinner,
you told my brother off...

507
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,039
and told him to talk
after he was done chewing.

508
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,670
You're nitpicking over nothing.

509
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,069
My brother could've come off
as unpleasant in your eyes.

510
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,380
But that doesn't give you the right
to treat him like a nobody.

511
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,880
Who talks like that to a guest?

512
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:07,119
Apologize to my siblings.

513
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,650
You're really twisted.

514
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,019
I'm twisted?

515
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,190
You wouldn't even think
about what you did...

516
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,289
All right. I must've made a mistake.

517
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:18,289
I was also a bit flustered because
I had never seen anything like that.

518
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,299
It was such a relief
I didn't get sick after dinner.

519
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,130
You're talking to Yoon Yu Jin.

520
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:26,440
I know you're Yoon Yu Jin.

521
00:29:28,069 --> 00:29:31,039
What's with you two?
Your aunt is downstairs.

522
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,579
All right, Yu Jin.
I must've crossed the line.

523
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,380
What can I do?
We're from such different backgrounds.

524
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,150
I'll show my respect
to your siblings from now on.

525
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,789
Goodness.

526
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,099
How dare those punks
come in a group and tell me off?

527
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,670
What's going on?
Aunt Yeo Jin will get mad at you again!

528
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,769
I have no idea!

529
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,799
She told me to respect her siblings
because I looked down on them!

530
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,970
Then, how is it respect
to return my present?

531
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,170
Wait, why? She won't take the shoes?

532
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,509
She wants respect for her siblings
instead of these presents.

533
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,180
How dare she...

534
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,009
When will you get rid of that toy?

535
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,950
She's only been here for a few days.

536
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:17,390
She wouldn't last
if she found out she was a fake.

537
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,289
It'll end things
between her and Yeo Jin, too.

538
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:23,529
Should I leak that she was a fake...

539
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,960
and put Yeo Jin
through a shock treatment?

540
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,910
Why are you scanning me?

541
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,079
I'm your image consultant.

542
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:50,250
The staff will get suspicious
if you suddenly come in luxury clothes.

543
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:51,650
I'll manage.

544
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,690
You're Goo Ha Na
the moment you step into the office,

545
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,390
not Yoon Yu Jin.

546
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,130
You know that, right?

547
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,200
You're my subordinate.

548
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,029
You work for the hotel,
and I'm with the travel agency.

549
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,369
We're in the same office.

550
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:07,039
Make sure you behave
while other staff members are watching.

551
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,390
- Auntie!
- Hey.

552
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:26,220
- Have fun at the kindergarten.
- Okay.

553
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:33,859
It's so wonderful to see Yu Jin
and Se Young go to work together,

554
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:38,200
the two female CEOs
who'll lead Hyesung in the future.

555
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,369
We're keeping your identity
as my daughter a secret,

556
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,309
so don't make a mistake at work.

557
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,839
Don't worry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

558
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,910
She'll be Goo Ha Na at work
and Yoon Yu Jin at home.

559
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,210
- I'll lead her.
- Good.

560
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,650
Make sure you cooperate
when you're at work.

561
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,680
- Yes, Mom.
- Okay, Aunt Yeo Jin.

562
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,890
- I'll take that.
- Sure.

563
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,819
Hello?

564
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:02,089
Is this Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin's home?

565
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:03,460
Yes, that's right.

566
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,960
Who are you?

567
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,799
Well, who's calling?

568
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,069
- You should take that.
- Sure.

569
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,839
There was a rumor that
the chairwoman's lost daughter died,

570
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:14,839
so I called to confirm the facts.

571
00:32:16,609 --> 00:32:17,740
What did you say?

572
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,009
Chairwoman Shin's lost daughter...

573
00:32:22,509 --> 00:32:23,809
died?

574
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:22,710
(Cinderella Game)

575
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,380
She seems like a knockoff.

576
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,750
There was another person
who knew your daughter had passed.

577
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:31,549
I'm not ready yet.

578
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:33,920
What if
the death certificate is real?

579
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,119
The fact a rumor like that emerged
felt ominous.

580
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:38,119
- An anonymous report?
- I was told not to mind it,

581
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:39,220
but it didn't sit right with me.

582
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,390
Keep work separated
from personal life.

583
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,519
I don't want to.

584
00:33:41,589 --> 00:33:43,160
You may be the top dog at home,

585
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,890
but that changes when we're at work.

586
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:48,259
Sorry.
