1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,110
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,110 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,510
Why did you deceive me?

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,520
Why did you lie
to Aunt Yeo Jin and me?

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,590
Why did you deceive me
for the last 20 years?

7
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,650
Because of you.

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,360
Because of me?

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,660
Why would I do that
if it weren't for you?

10
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,530
Do you have any other questions?

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,300
Are you hiding...

12
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,300
- anything else?
- No.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,570
Did you also contaminate
my aunt and uncle's...

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,870
DNA?

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,540
Did you make my aunt...

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,110
- fall into a coma?
- What are you talking about?

17
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,950
Did you take my aunt
off her respirator?

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,220
Tell me! Did you do that?

19
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,350
Yes! I did that!

20
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,450
Happy now?

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,430
How can you do that?

22
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,760
Mom, it means you tried to kill her!

23
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:01,300
Wait.

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,300
Did you also frame Uncle Sung Ho...

25
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,110
for what you did?

26
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:13,310
- Mom!
- I just...

27
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,350
I just wanted to scare them.

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,680
Your aunt didn't die,

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,150
and your uncle
wasn't charged for murder.

30
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,920
Nothing happened.

31
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,330
I had to make those choices
to help us survive.

32
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,700
You just have to do as I tell you.

33
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,670
Why can't my aunt wake up?

34
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:43,410
What did she say
to make you want to kill her?

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,940
You already know why.

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,110
It's all to get Hyesung Group!

37
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,410
You knew Yu Jin had died,
didn't you?

38
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,820
How did you find out?

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,550
Because I kept my eyes on her
and put a tail on her.

40
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,750
Don't lie to me
and tell me the truth.

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,120
You always knew where she was,
so why didn't you tell me?

42
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,530
You always knew she was why I had
a hard time, so why did you keep it?

43
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,400
If I told you,

44
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,740
would you have wanted her
to be found?

45
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,380
Think about your state back then.

46
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,080
You were always anxious
that Yu Jin would show up.

47
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,880
I could see that you got anxious
to the point of death...

48
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,120
whenever someone
brought up that day.

49
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,780
I couldn't be honest with you!

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,450
You still should've told me!

51
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,060
You could've kept it from my aunt,
but not me!

52
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,160
I would've preferred to know
where she was and what she was doing...

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,760
than always feeling anxious
about when she would turn up!

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you think
that wouldn't have made you anxious?

55
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,270
You would've been the same
either way!

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,700
You can't do anything without me.
What would you have done?

57
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,010
Did you ask why I didn't tell you?

58
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,710
If I did,

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,010
you couldn't have taken it
with that feeble mindset.

60
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,820
You should be grateful
I kept it quiet to this day.

61
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,130
I did all this for you.

62
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,530
Don't say that it was for me.

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,900
I never asked you for this.

64
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,640
Stop using me as an excuse
to satisfy your greed!

65
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,470
What an ungrateful brat.

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:25,740
Do you think I brought you up to this day
to hear you say that?

67
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,680
You should've also gone missing...

68
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,650
with Yu Jin
on that day 20 years ago.

69
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,620
How...

70
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,760
How can you say that to me...

71
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,300
as a mother?

72
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,170
What about you?
How can you say that as a daughter?

73
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,560
You should've also gone missing...

74
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,560
with Yu Jin
on that day 20 years ago.

75
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,580
You never lied. Do you understand?

76
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,380
Do everything as I say from now on.

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,420
Even if Yu Jin comes back
and tells the truth,

78
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,690
you have to keep saying
it isn't true.

79
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,990
You did not put her hat on,

80
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,760
and you did not get on the boat
with her.

81
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,160
That's the only way we'll be fine.

82
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,530
It'd be the end of us
if Aunt Yeo Jin found out.

83
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,770
Do you...

84
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,840
understand what I mean?

85
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,040
That was when my nightmares began.

86
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,250
I was just a ten-year-old girl,

87
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,020
so why did my mom ask that of me?

88
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,820
Was she worried...

89
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,650
about her life instead of me?

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,210
She didn't seem to know
about the hit-and-run accident yet.

91
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,110
She absolutely
cannot find out about that.

92
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,150
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

93
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,720
Gosh. Look at this scratch
on this beautiful hand.

94
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,020
I don't need to see a doctor
for bruises and scratches.

95
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,890
Why did I fall down right then?

96
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,360
I used to be a good runner.

97
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,300
You still were.

98
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,070
I'm glad you didn't see me fall.

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,140
You must have
an excellent sixth sense.

100
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,040
You showed up with perfect timing
and saved me.

101
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,510
Thanks.

102
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,750
- I thought it was me.
- I saved her.

103
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,520
Ha... Gosh. Ha Na, you tell me.
Who saved you?

104
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,490
Both of you. It was 50-50.

105
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,850
You can't split this.
It's not a check.

106
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,920
Anyway, why are you acting
so friendly with Mr. Hwang?

107
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,760
- Are you two dating?
- What?

108
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,800
Yes, we are.

109
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,030
- No way!
- No way!

110
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,440
I think my jaw almost dropped.

111
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,170
- I can't believe this.
- Jeez.

112
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,810
What?

113
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,460
You would've been the same
either way!

114
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,760
You can't do anything without me.
What would you have done?

115
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,730
Did you ask why I didn't tell you?
If I did,

116
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,330
you couldn't have taken it
with that feeble mindset.

117
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,380
She's right.

118
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,250
I couldn't have done anything
without her.

119
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,530
- Hello?
- Where are you?

120
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,270
Home.

121
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,640
Okay. Get a good rest.

122
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,240
Are you drinking?

123
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,010
Where are you?

124
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,240
Drink it slowly.

125
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,980
You're here.

126
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,680
May I have a glass?

127
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,380
Is something going on?

128
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,150
You told me...

129
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:38,390
to live my life as Yoon Se Young
and not as Choi Myung Ji's daughter.

130
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,460
But I don't know
what that life is like,

131
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,830
although I'm me.

132
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,270
If I don't know what it's like
to live as Yoon Se Young,

133
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,240
how am I supposed to live?

134
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,210
Did my identity form around my mom?

135
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,050
You're you.

136
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,710
You can find yourself starting now.

137
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,820
Where am I going to go to find that?

138
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:10,450
She was everything in my life,
and I always looked up to her.

139
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,260
How do you think you'd feel
if she completely fell apart?

140
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,660
I'm not even sure
if it's better to face the truth...

141
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,400
or if it's better
not to know anything...

142
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,240
for life.

143
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,240
You should still get a chance
to face the truth,

144
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,510
even if you end up ignoring it
after finding out.

145
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,450
Even if I ignore it?

146
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,320
Did you fight with your mom?

147
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,950
I kept talking to her
like she was a bad person, too.

148
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,260
So, I asked her.

149
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,630
It's not true.

150
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,470
You, Jin Goo, and Ha Na are
all misunderstanding.

151
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,440
I'm her daughter,

152
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,570
so I should trust her.

153
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,240
I will.

154
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,850
I believed that I was loved.

155
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:14,250
I thought she raised me like that...

156
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,520
for my sake.

157
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,690
But I'm not sure anymore.

158
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,460
I don't understand
what love is to her.

159
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,830
I don't know
who I am to her, either.

160
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,110
You want to see me go down, right?

161
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,280
You'll get to see it soon.

162
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,840
- The person you have reached...
- Jeez.

163
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,910
It's after midnight,
and she won't pick up. Where is she?

164
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,780
Is she with that punk?

165
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,220
Why did she come with him?

166
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,370
What are you doing?
Get a grip on yourself.

167
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:41,570
This face, this voice,

168
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,080
and these clothes are...

169
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,650
- all yours, Mom.
- Come on.

170
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,250
Did I ever choose anything myself?

171
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,590
No, I never had the chance.

172
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,760
What are you talking about?

173
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,160
Hey, don't touch her.

174
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:03,630
Are you trying
to get your hands on Se Young?

175
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,530
I'm sick and tired
of you and your sister.

176
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:09,170
Se Young was rather distraught.

177
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,240
It's because you two slandered
and framed me without evidence.

178
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,610
You should also check on her
and see how she really feels.

179
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,080
I'll manage my daughter.

180
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,510
Go, now.

181
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,950
Pull yourself together.

182
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,620
My goodness. Go upstairs.

183
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,460
Gosh, I can see why
Ji Eun strongly recommended this.

184
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,430
Gosh.

185
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,140
It feels so clean and nice.

186
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,640
Ha Na.

187
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,450
Jin Goo, you got here early.

188
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,960
Do you have something to say?

189
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,360
- No.
- Sit here and wait a second.

190
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,530
Let me just dry my hair.

191
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,970
How's your wound from yesterday?

192
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:24,340
My bruise spread a little,
and it throbs a bit, but I'm okay.

193
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,980
Let me dry your hair
and let your arm rest.

194
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,150
- Really?
- Make use of your boyfriend.

195
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,350
Yes, okay. Here.

196
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,810
All done.

197
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,310
Ha Na, you have such soft hair.

198
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,780
And you have lots of volume, too.
It makes you look so beautiful.

199
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,850
My hair began to look better
after I started using this shampoo.

200
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,550
Yes, you should take one.

201
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,220
It's a present.

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,490
My mom will be happy.

203
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,000
You're so pathetic.

204
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,400
You returned home in Ji Seok's arms.

205
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,430
Do you have any idea
when you returned home?

206
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,170
Just be grateful I came back alive.

207
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,340
Jeez.

208
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,370
Why do you keep seeing him?

209
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,510
Don't you have
anyone better to date?

210
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,510
He's the second son
of Jeongil Group.

211
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,020
You'll meet him this weekend.

212
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,920
He's not my type.

213
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,490
You can't afford
to find someone your type.

214
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,060
Just meet him.

215
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,760
Why? Do you want to sell me off
to a rich family?

216
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:52,300
I told you to just meet him,
not marry him.

217
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,900
I'll text you the place and time.

218
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,440
Don't ever install a location tracking app
on my phone again.

219
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,040
How did she know?

220
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,650
Why are they so quiet?

221
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,720
Is no one in her room?

222
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,260
I hope she remembers something
other than the notebook.

223
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,970
She may suddenly get
her memories back all at once.

224
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,750
What's wrong?

225
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,950
(There's a bugging device!)

226
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,170
Who could've put this here?

227
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,940
Myung Ji, obviously.

228
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,440
Should we report her to the police?

229
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,540
We can use this in a fun way.

230
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,840
"In a fun way?"

231
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,520
What is this?

232
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,330
Darn it. They found out.

233
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,000
Why did they leave it
in the restroom of all places?

234
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,770
I'd be their number one suspect.

235
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,410
I'll feign ignorance and go check.

236
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,650
Don't let Choi Myung Ji know
that we know she tapped us.

237
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,220
Well, she won't say anything anyway.

238
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,960
I won't.

239
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
Have a great time on your stroll,
Ms. Chairwoman.

240
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,890
I'm leaving.

241
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,300
Sure. Goodbye.

242
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,500
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

243
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:21,350
Did you say
Hwang Jin Goo was like my son?

244
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,650
Yes, he said you saved his life,

245
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,750
his second mother
who gave him a heart.

246
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,620
His second mother?

247
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,860
Why don't we try
to find your memories?

248
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,770
Do you not remember anything...

249
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,910
you saw in the notebook?

250
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,810
"The notebook?"

251
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,340
Did you fight Choi Myung Ji
over the notebook before you fell?

252
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,880
Choi Myung Ji...

253
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,450
Se Young's mom,

254
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,720
your sister-in-law.

255
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,320
I need Ms. Shin Yeo Jin's guardian!

256
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,260
Yes?

257
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,360
One moment, please.

258
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,670
Choi Myung Ji...

259
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,800
Yeo Jin.

260
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,410
Why are you here alone?
It's dangerous.

261
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,410
Yeo Jin,
let me take you on a stroll.

262
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,220
Yeo Jin,
you don't remember me yet, do you?

263
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,360
You and I lived
under the same roof for 20 years...

264
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,060
like we were real sisters.

265
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,470
- For 20 years?
- Yes.

266
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:55,170
Sung Ho left home 20 years ago...

267
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,810
and left you alone until recently.

268
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,110
But he suddenly pretended like
he was the best husband...

269
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,110
as soon as you collapsed,
coveting after your fortune.

270
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:08,950
I felt terrible
to see you go through this.

271
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,990
You also don't remember
going off your respirator, do you?

272
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,690
Someone made a report
and said it was Sung Ho,

273
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,330
but he was acquitted
due to lack of evidence.

274
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,340
Anyway, I hope
you remember everything soon...

275
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,840
and return everything
back to its place.

276
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,250
Where did she go?

277
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,520
Did she leave alone?

278
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,100
Anyway, Yeo Jin.
Why did you call me an evil brat?

279
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,930
I don't know why.

280
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:00,240
No, there must be a reason.

281
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,140
I feel oddly offended
whenever I see you.

282
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,980
I served you and tended to you
for the last 20 years.

283
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,950
I know you can't remember,
but that was pretty harsh.

284
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,790
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,320
You're the evil brat, Yeo Jin.

286
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:21,290
You didn't even leave me a penny
after living together for 20 years.

287
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,400
That makes you an evil brat
who deserves to die.

288
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:25,690
What do you think you're doing?
That was dangerous!

289
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,490
You were the one
who put her in danger.

290
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,090
Where have you been,
leaving her all alone?

291
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,460
She almost fell down the stairs!

292
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,670
Why are you worried?
I was watching her.

293
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:41,240
Did you find that bugging device
and put it in the restroom?

294
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,540
Do not lay a finger
on her wheelchair...

295
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,410
from now on.

296
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,480
Are you having fun
acting as her fake daughter?

297
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,680
This is taking a toll on her,
so go back to her room.

298
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,480
Stop going out and about.

299
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:59,660
Yeo Jin, I'm leaving.

300
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,060
I'll be back.

301
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,630
Choi Myung Ji...

302
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,880
Yeo Jin.

303
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,250
Choi Myung Ji...

304
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,750
Yeo Jin.

305
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,690
Are you all right?

306
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,990
Are you in pain?

307
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,560
Yu Jin...

308
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,730
Why did you steal my notebook?

309
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,300
- Let go of me!
- Give it back!

310
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,300
Let go of me!

311
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,870
You caused Yu Jin's
hit-and-run accident and killed her!

312
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:50,240
Everything is in here!

313
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,420
I saw that notebook.

314
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,860
Everything was
written in that notebook.

315
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,530
Do you remember what was written?

316
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,000
My Yu Jin...

317
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,480
Did Choi Myung Ji
hurt Yu Jin in any way?

318
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,690
Ms. Goo.

319
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,090
Do you remember me, too?

320
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,890
I remember everything.

321
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,760
Everything.

322
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,410
Myung Ji didn't just kill Yu Jin.

323
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,140
She tried to kill me, too.

324
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm going to kill her right now.

325
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,780
Yeo Jin.

326
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,680
Yes, we will kill her
just as you said. We will.

327
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,520
But before we do that,
tell me everything you know.

328
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,690
Everything was in that notebook.

329
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,130
Yu Jin's whereabouts
before she left...

330
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,270
until the day she died.

331
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,670
Did she keep her eyes on Yu Jin
and put a tail on her all along?

332
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,240
Yes.

333
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,110
That woman...

334
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,210
instigated
Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident...

335
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,150
and killed her.

336
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:44,090
Was she really behind that accident?

337
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,290
Yes.

338
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,360
How can she do this to us?

339
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,460
How can she...

340
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,370
do such a thing to Yu Jin
as a human?

341
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,040
What else did you see?

342
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,550
Money transactions between her...

343
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,880
and Detective Cho Byung Jin.

344
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,920
He got about two million dollars.

345
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,120
We have to get him.

346
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,160
We were tailing him,
but he suddenly disappeared.

347
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,130
We'll resume the search immediately.

348
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,560
I want to go home.
I'll go home, find that notebook,

349
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,130
and take Myung Ji down.

350
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,030
- I don't think it's at home.
- What?

351
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,840
I conducted a search,
but it wasn't there.

352
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,040
She wouldn't have kept it home
after you found out about it.

353
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:39,480
She must've left it in a safe outside
or destroyed it altogether.

354
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
It had a transaction history,
so she wouldn't destroy it.

355
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,790
I have to find that notebook
to have her arrested.

356
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,860
Why don't we make her lead us...

357
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
to where the notebook is?

358
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,030
You all know we'll begin...

359
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,800
the mother-daughter therapy tour promotion
this coming May, right?

360
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,170
- Yes.
- Yes.

361
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,540
Ha Na should be here to take charge,
but she's on leave.

362
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,710
Right? I wonder when she'll return.

363
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,580
Ms. Yoon, do you have
any other ideas?

364
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,250
What an ungrateful brat.

365
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,420
Do you think I brought you up
to this day to hear you say that?

366
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,060
You should've also gone missing...

367
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,160
with Yu Jin
on that day 20 years ago.

368
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,300
- Ms. Yoon?
- Yes?

369
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:36,770
Is something going on?

370
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,800
You don't look so well, either.

371
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,540
No, you can continue without me.

372
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,650
I think something is going on.

373
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:52,780
Jeez.

374
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,120
Can I ask you something?

375
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,090
Have you seen a notebook at home?

376
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,600
Last time, Ms. Jang was
looking for that, too.

377
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:08,630
Is it a secret ledger or something?

378
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:12,140
The chairwoman remembered seeing
a notebook before she collapsed.

379
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,540
When Aunt Yeo Jin collapsed?

380
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,170
Mom said she put her in a coma.

381
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,980
I haven't seen any notebook,
so don't ask me.

382
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,990
A secret ledger?

383
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,090
Why don't you keep
regaining your memories a secret...

384
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,160
from Choi Myung Ji?

385
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,730
That sounds like a good idea.

386
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:44,930
We need to take advantage of her
to find evidence.

387
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,670
She may try to destroy the evidence
if she finds out about this.

388
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,110
I'll set up everything
to ensure your safety at home.

389
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,750
Yes, I can't give Myung Ji
a chance to escape.

390
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,650
I must take advantage of her, too.

391
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,450
Get the doctor.

392
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,990
Do you remember everything?

393
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,030
Yes, I remember everything.

394
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,760
Your memories returned naturally.

395
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,000
Everything looked fine
on the MRI scan.

396
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,100
She can be discharged.

397
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,200
Doctor, I have a favor to ask you.

398
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,140
Can you keep her memory recovery a secret
for a while?

399
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,780
Please do that.

400
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,980
I'll do that. Excuse me.

401
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,650
- Goodness.
- Hello.

402
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,920
Come on in.

403
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,420
- So, you're his English teacher?
- Yes.

404
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,090
It's been a while, Eun Chong.

405
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,360
Hello.

406
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,760
Please have a seat. Yes.

407
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:48,570
- Let's go back to studying hard.
- Okay.

408
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,940
What did you eat for lunch?

409
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,140
Tteokbokki.

410
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,040
Really? Me, too.

411
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,310
There's a famous tteokbokki place
in this neighborhood.

412
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,950
What? That's my uncle's snack bar.

413
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,050
Really? We should
go there together next time.

414
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,120
Okay.

415
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,920
Eun Chong, you learned words
related to spring last time.

416
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,320
Can you tell me what those were?

417
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,060
Spring, flower, butterfly.

418
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,630
Is someone here?

419
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,670
Oh, hello.

420
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,470
What's going on?

421
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:28,510
I want to set up safety devices
before the chairwoman returns.

422
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,240
"Safety devices?"

423
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,410
The chairwoman feels anxious
and scared without her memories,

424
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,750
so just in case when she's alone.

425
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:38,850
- Is she returning home?
- Yes.

426
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,620
She decided to be discharged.

427
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,150
- When?
- She's getting discharged now.

428
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,550
Right now?

429
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
I just went to see her,
and she didn't say anything.

430
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:52,330
- Wait, did her memories return?
- No.

431
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,370
Did she realize
I tried to push her down the stairs?

432
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,470
Or is it
because of the bugging device?

433
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,340
There wasn't much to do
at the hospital,

434
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,310
so she'd feel much better
if she returned home.

435
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,440
I see.

436
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,750
That's true.

437
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,890
May I come here for a break?

438
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,360
As you wish.

439
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,390
- Do you feel okay?
- I heard you dropped me off.

440
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,000
My mom must've been harsh on you.

441
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,570
What did I say yesterday?

442
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,300
I don't remember much.

443
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,140
You wanted to live as Se Young
and not as your mom's daughter,

444
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,370
but you didn't know how.

445
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:42,510
To do that, I have to start
by not listening to my mom.

446
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:45,350
Haven't you begun already,
starting yesterday?

447
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,780
I don't know.

448
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,720
One second.

449
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,460
Yes?

450
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,300
Aunt Yeo Jin got discharged?

451
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,570
Does she remember everything?

452
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:07,900
That's not the case.
Take an early leave and come home.

453
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:11,940
- You should be here when she comes.
- I don't want to.

454
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,480
Do you expect me
to sit and watch your pretense?

455
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,450
You're asking me
to put on an act with you.

456
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,750
- What's so bad about that?
- Forget it. Bye.

457
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,420
Pretend like you didn't hear that.

458
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,460
You're good
at not listening to your mom.

459
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,400
Is the chairwoman
getting discharged?

460
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,530
Yes.

461
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:41,140
I don't think I can face my aunt
in my sober mind.

462
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,510
Why not?

463
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,580
My mom did
lots of evil things to her.

464
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,750
I wonder...

465
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,220
how Myung Ji would act
if I didn't tell her about my memories.

466
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,020
She's a scary woman. Be careful.

467
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,890
I won't let her
make me suffer anymore.

468
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,860
I need to find...

469
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,630
either the driver
of the hit-and-run case...

470
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,900
or the notebook to catch her.

471
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,070
I'm going to hack into her phone.

472
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:16,110
Then, we might find text messages
about the notebook or her safe.

473
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,550
Come on in, Yeo Jin.

474
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,090
Welcome back.

475
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,860
You should've died at the hospital.
Why did you return?

476
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,300
You'll only get in trouble again.

477
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,770
I came to get you.

478
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,140
I'll find the evidence and kill you.

479
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,100
(Cinderella Game)

480
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,370
So, she's living with Choi Myung Ji?

481
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,970
Is it okay to live with her enemy?

482
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,710
Yeo Jin, how much do you remember?

483
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,640
What was that notebook?

484
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,440
How come I remembered that?

485
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,610
Mom, did Yu Jin die
in a hit-and-run accident?

486
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:03,710
What do you mean?

487
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,850
- Then, someone must be behind it.
- My goodness.

488
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,320
- Did you know about this?
- Se Young.

489
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,150
You killed my daughter
and called it a mistake?

490
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,560
I need to see the culprit
who killed Yu Jin.
