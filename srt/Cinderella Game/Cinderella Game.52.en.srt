00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,069
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:07,280
(Episode 52)

5
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:12,050
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:15,490
Du Na?

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,359
They're the same person.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,030
How can this happen?

9
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:22,829
How can this be real?

10
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,699
So, everything was...

11
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,409
staged by Chairwoman Shin
and Hwang Jin Goo.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,020
I guess so. Yes.

13
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,530
Mr. Goo.

14
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:55,890
I was on my way to say hello
as this was day one...

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,759
of our new department...

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,170
as General Manager Hwang Jin Goo
of the Travel Service Department.

17
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:18,920
I'm going to kill you.

18
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,060
Why did you just punch me?

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,829
Ji Seok, no. Don't do this.

20
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,329
You can't do this at work.

21
00:01:31,329 --> 00:01:33,599
- Ji Seok, let go of him.
- Mr. Goo, no.

22
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:34,700
You must hold yourself back.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,969
You'll find out the reason
very soon.

24
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:41,370
And once you find out,
it won't feel so unfair.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,730
My gosh.

26
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:11,699
(Head Director's Office)

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,469
Please leave.

28
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,449
Let him stay.
He must have something to say.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,150
Was this your revenge
for my punch last time?

30
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,990
We exchanged a blow each,
so let's call it even.

31
00:02:30,189 --> 00:02:31,789
But I need to know why you hit me.

32
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,330
I have zero idea.

33
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,199
- It's as if you'll hit me again.
- Wait.

34
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll reveal
your hideous true nature very soon.

35
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:49,469
Everything you did to my sister.

36
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,110
My hideous true nature?

37
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,409
What is that?

38
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,479
Mr. Hwang, please leave.

39
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,319
Well, you said I'd find out soon.

40
00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:03,919
Once I find out,

41
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,389
I'll come by
to protest or apologize.

42
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,259
I'll see you again then.

43
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:23,939
Mr. Goo, you must act reasonably.

44
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,580
That's the only way
you can carry out your plan.

45
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:29,810
I couldn't contain my temper
the moment I saw his face.

46
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,219
How could he smile at Ha Na...

47
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,219
even after what he did?

48
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,030
President Hwang... No.

49
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,530
Mr. Hwang was beaten up by Mr. Goo?

50
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,530
My gosh. What's happening
on day one of our new team?

51
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,500
If anything,
Mr. Hwang should punch him.

52
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:51,770
Anyway, why did he punch him?

53
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,909
Could it be because of that rumor?

54
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:57,080
- "That rumor?"
- "That rumor?"

55
00:03:58,509 --> 00:04:02,009
There's a rumor at work
about Ms. Goo and President Hwang...

56
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,379
No, I mean, General Manager Hwang.

57
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,219
They once worked overtime alone
while we put...

58
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,520
- the shredded file together.
- Yes.

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,090
The office was pitch dark,

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,159
and the two were under the desk...

61
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,360
Who did what with whom?

62
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:27,540
Wait.

63
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,079
I'll reveal
your hideous true nature very soon.

64
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:33,980
I'm going to kill you.

65
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,980
Did he find out
that Ms. Goo was a fake daughter?

66
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:41,990
Have you found the source
of the rumor...

67
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,550
of the death
of Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

68
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,120
It was a groundless rumor.

69
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,029
Then, you could've ignored it.

70
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:48,629
Why are you
looking for the reporter?

71
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,129
What do you plan to do?

72
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,769
He couldn't have found out she was
a fake daughter through that.

73
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,610
I heard Mr. Goo punched you.

74
00:05:03,209 --> 00:05:04,540
It was a rough hazing ritual.

75
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:06,540
I don't even know why he punched me.

76
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,810
You don't know the reason?

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,579
He said he'd reveal
my hideous true nature or something.

78
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,019
It must be because of the rumor.

79
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,689
I heard you two hid down here
while working overtime.

80
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,959
I was banned from the office,
so I couldn't get caught.

81
00:05:22,829 --> 00:05:24,829
It must've been
suffocating and nerve-racking...

82
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,860
for the two of you
to hide in that tiny little space.

83
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,370
It must've been exciting
to hide there,

84
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,699
wondering if you'd be caught.

85
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:33,000
- What are you thinking?
- Am I overthinking?

86
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,040
Imagine if I was hiding under here
with another man.

87
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,439
What would you imagine?

88
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:42,579
So? Do you think Mr. Goo hit me
because of that rumor?

89
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,850
How did you get the idea
to get under the desk...

90
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,649
with a female employee
in the dead of night?

91
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,389
You two could've done anything.

92
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,689
Nothing happened.

93
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,959
I don't know what you two are up to,

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,790
but don't let me catch you.

95
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:59,730
It's disgusting to hear my name
in this disgusting rumor.

96
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,639
I was punched because of that rumor?

97
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,350
You'll find out the reason
very soon.

98
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:18,420
And once you find out,
it won't feel so unfair.

99
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,600
Should I have been angrier?

100
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,069
Well, he's done something,
so he won't get suspicious of me.

101
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,339
Is that for Mr. Hwang?

102
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:48,079
Well, yes.
There was no ointment in the office.

103
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:50,110
You can give it to him.

104
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,089
Enough is enough.

105
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,850
I warned you.

106
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,019
Do not get me involved
in these dirty rumors.

107
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,730
Why did you throw it down?

108
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:03,899
I got it
as one of his staff members.

109
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,959
I heard you two hid under his desk
while working overtime.

110
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:10,029
You two must've been
right next to each other.

111
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,569
Did you like that?

112
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,269
He was banned from the office,
so he couldn't get caught.

113
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,610
I asked if you liked that.

114
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,110
Should I say yes or not?

115
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,449
You wouldn't like
either answer anyway.

116
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,480
You should find out
how you really feel...

117
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,550
before you ask me
such a weird question.

118
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:32,459
Don't you feel guilty
about anything with Mr. Hwang?

119
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,660
What are you talking about?
"Feel guilty?"

120
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,199
You lied to him.

121
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,000
Like what?

122
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,829
How did I lie to him?

123
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,199
You have another man.

124
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:48,170
Stop jumping to a conclusion
if you can't say anything.

125
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,439
How dare you say I'm telling a lie?

126
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,680
Should I just tell him everything?

127
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:01,519
You should put the ointment on.

128
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,860
I got it
as one of your staff members.

129
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:07,459
Thank you.

130
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,290
Do you have a mirror here?

131
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,300
I don't need a mirror.
I'll just put it on.

132
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:15,029
No, a bit more to your left.

133
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,470
- Here?
- A little more.

134
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:18,600
No. More.

135
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,399
Yes, right there.

136
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,750
(Travel Service Department
General Manager Hwang Jin Goo)

137
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,129
I should
get rid of that desk or something.

138
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,330
The desk didn't do anything wrong.

139
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:50,370
I heard Mr. Goo punched me
because of that rumor.

140
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:51,840
That's probably not true, right?

141
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,240
He's not someone who'd punch you
over that kind of matter.

142
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,509
Was there anything
you could think of?

143
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,139
No.

144
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,850
He said I'd find out soon,
so I'll wait.

145
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,320
But I have no idea what I did wrong.

146
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,889
It was embarrassing
to get punched before your eyes.

147
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,120
The same thing happened to me
when I was much younger.

148
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,690
Come to think of it,
we said we'd be friends back then.

149
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,190
Should we do that
when we're out of the office?

150
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,259
Okay.

151
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:22,529
I always wondered
how you were doing...

152
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,399
after we said goodbye
at the hospital.

153
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,370
I didn't know your name,
your contact information,

154
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,769
or where you lived.

155
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,909
I always prayed you'd be happy...

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,779
no matter where you were...

157
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,750
whenever I thought of you.

158
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,690
And thanks to you, I'm living
this healthy and happy life.

159
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,230
Thanks a lot, friend.

160
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,830
Hey, we're still at work.

161
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,429
Thank you, Ms. Goo.

162
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,039
Will you tell your sister
that she's a fake?

163
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:10,279
What do you think may be
the best move for Ha Na?

164
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,289
It's even tough for me
to accept this situation.

165
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,950
If Ha Na finds out...

166
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,990
Why don't you talk to Mr. Han?

167
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,159
He'll tell me
to turn a blind eye to this.

168
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,799
Because Ha Na will be hurt...

169
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,929
the most deeply.

170
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,100
I need to wait
for the right time and decide...

171
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,840
if it'll be better
for me to spill the truth...

172
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,340
or if I'll wait
until things escalate at that house.

173
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,610
If we found out,
others would soon find out, too.

174
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:44,450
If there's a way to put this off,
I want to do that as long as I can.

175
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:46,879
You can tell Mr. Han...

176
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:49,620
we don't need to find evidence
of her daughter's death.

177
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,659
I already know how Yoon Yu Jin died.

178
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,230
How did she die?

179
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,600
She passed away six years ago
in a hit-and-run accident.

180
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:01,000
We never found the culprit.
The case was unresolved.

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Could it be a coincidence?

182
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,269
Chairwoman Shin
probably had the same thought.

183
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,240
She'll want to reopen the case.

184
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:09,840
Let's keep an eye on it.

185
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:16,309
Do it like this.
Look how happy you are.

186
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,080
Yu Jin, why did you leave
so many things behind?

187
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,789
Your phone, your son,
and your friend.

188
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,190
Give it back to me now.

189
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:27,889
What? Yes, right.

190
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,690
Here.

191
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:39,100
I need to reveal Goo Ha Na as
a fake daughter and kick her out...

192
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,039
to control this kid however I like.

193
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,210
Should I use that photo?

194
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,110
Eun Chong,
do you want to play treasure hunt?

195
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,480
- "Treasure hunt?"
- Yes.

196
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,590
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

197
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,289
Whoever has parental rights
and custody has the most power.

198
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,799
There's no legal problem
even if she refuses...

199
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:08,330
to show her son to his grandmother.

200
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,740
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

201
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:22,679
It's Eun Chong's adoption.

202
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,220
I trust Ms. Goo,
but you never know what will happen.

203
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,620
You should take your time
if this concerns you.

204
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:33,860
Should I postpone
the agency's visit home?

205
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,830
I want to stay with you, too,
Auntie Ha Na!

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,330
Yes, please let us stay together.

207
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,480
We can go ahead
and let them visit for now.

208
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,879
I wonder what kind of excuse...

209
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,049
Yeo Jin will make
once this photo is found here.

210
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:04,220
Even Goo Ha Na will think
something is strange about her.

211
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:12,700
Little Grandma, did you hide it?

212
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,870
Yes, I hid it.

213
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,330
- Should I begin?
- Yes.

214
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,340
When you find the pieces of paper,

215
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:22,240
I'll buy everything
written down on it.

216
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,610
Gosh. I'll start with the kitchen.

217
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,710
Okay.

218
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,620
Where did she hide it?

219
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:40,690
- Do you want a hint?
- Yes!

220
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,490
Look on the kitchen table.

221
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,370
I found it!

222
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,769
Gosh, you found it already.

223
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:55,740
It says, "a transforming robot."

224
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,940
Eun Chong, I'll buy you that.

225
00:13:59,409 --> 00:14:02,409
Now, let's go
to your big grandma's room.

226
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,950
- Okay!
- Let's go.

227
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:09,019
Gosh, it'll be harder
to find something here.

228
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,860
No, it won't be hard.

229
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,759
Yes, keep opening those drawers.

230
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:22,200
I found it!

231
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,629
Yes!

232
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:28,039
I found the photo of me,
my mommy, and Auntie Ha Na.

233
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:32,539
Wait, was that the photo
she had lost last time?

234
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,610
Yes!

235
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,549
You found the photo? Where was it?

236
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,190
In Big Grandma's room.

237
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:46,120
"Big Grandma's room?"

238
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,330
Yes, it was in her drawer.

239
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:50,759
Why was that photo in Mom's room?

240
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,500
What photo?

241
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:56,000
Hey. Okay, Eun Chong.

242
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,399
See you at home.

243
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,409
The photo that went missing
from my room.

244
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,110
He found it in my mom's room.

245
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,779
What? So, Aunt Yeo Jin took it?

246
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,720
She didn't say anything
while I was unfairly accused?

247
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,429
Anyway, why did she take that photo?

248
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:23,190
I don't know.

249
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,409
I was on my way to see you.

250
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,649
Why did you punch Mr. Hwang
back then?

251
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,419
His crime is turning you
into a fake daughter...

252
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,389
and handing you over
to Chairwoman Shin as an offering.

253
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,159
Yet he dared
to stand before you with a smile.

254
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,559
It's between me and him.
It's not your business.

255
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,830
Don't get too close
to Hwang Jin Goo.

256
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,539
Don't be deceived
by the kindness he shows.

257
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:08,009
Everything is fake.

258
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,909
That's between me and Mr. Hwang,
so I'll manage.

259
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:15,649
You said you'd adopt Eun Chong...

260
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,279
after moving
into Chairwoman Shin's place.

261
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,519
Are you going to tell me
not to adopt him?

262
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,980
Did Chairwoman Shin
allow it quietly?

263
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,450
She's actively helping me.

264
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,460
That selfish woman...

265
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,659
would let Ha Na adopt her grandson?

266
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,929
She's actively helping you
become a single mother?

267
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,600
Yes, unlike others,

268
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,899
she's a woman of great character.

269
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,840
Don't sneer at me.

270
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,309
Make sure you adopt Eun Chong.

271
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,970
I hope Chairwoman Shin
doesn't change her mind.

272
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:46,909
Why would she change her mind?

273
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:51,350
She's sincerely good
to both Eun Chong and me.

274
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:52,649
I hope that's true.

275
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,549
She gave her credit cards
to Ji Eun and Ji Chang...

276
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,250
and even helped Ji Chang
open his business.

277
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,289
I was grateful.

278
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,629
Do you mean that?
Or are you mocking me?

279
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,960
I mean it.

280
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,859
Please take good care
of our siblings from now on.

281
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,730
Chairwoman Shin...

282
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:11,799
would be able to help them
more effectively on a larger scale.

283
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,809
Why are you suddenly like this?

284
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,109
This was what you wanted.

285
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,980
You wanted to be accepted
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

286
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,710
I accept it.

287
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,019
Enjoy your happiness
while you can...

288
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,750
before anyone else finds out.

289
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,190
This happiness is terminal,

290
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,089
and it can always turn into misery.

291
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,960
Is something going on?

292
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:44,970
I must be growing up.

293
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,069
Bye.

294
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,650
"Growing up?"

295
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,490
Then, why did he punch Mr. Hwang?

296
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,589
- Come again.
- Come again.

297
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,630
Hey, that's all for me today.

298
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,099
I can't come anymore.

299
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,369
Thank you. I'll wire your pay.

300
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,400
- Hello...
- Hello...

301
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,039
You can't save just yourself.

302
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,609
We have to keep this business.

303
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,180
What if he breaks everything?

304
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,049
Give me some tteokbokki.

305
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,450
- Why won't you take the order?
- Please use the kiosk to order...

306
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:39,519
Bring him some tteokbokki.

307
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,740
How is it, Ji Seok? Is it good?

308
00:18:56,339 --> 00:18:57,440
It's good.

309
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,440
What's with him?

310
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:03,049
Ha Na helped him open this business.

311
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,750
Wasn't it Chairwoman Shin?

312
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:10,789
Her money is
Ms. Chairwoman's money, but...

313
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:13,859
Why didn't you ask her
to get you a bigger store...

314
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,059
in a better location
with a bigger floating population?

315
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,160
She wasn't as generous as I thought.

316
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,430
I'm sorry, Ji Seok.
We weren't trying to deceive you.

317
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:25,799
Why do you care?

318
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,569
We cut our ties, so stop minding me.

319
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,009
I'm happy for you.

320
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,509
- What?
- What?

321
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,079
I was glad you opened this business.

322
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,809
If she offers her help
even in the future, take it.

323
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,420
- You got a credit card, too, right?
- Well...

324
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:42,420
You should take it
if she offered it.

325
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,059
Do you mean it?

326
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,160
Then, can I continue
to do the tteokbokki business?

327
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,299
Good luck. Thanks for the food.

328
00:19:57,099 --> 00:19:58,200
That's for the tteokbokki.

329
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,440
Ji Seok, see you at home!

330
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,349
No way. He just had
the most expensive tteokbokki.

331
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,859
What is this? I'm scared.

332
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,890
That's mine. Come on.

333
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:23,329
Get back to work.

334
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,230
I'm done.

335
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,069
Yes, ma'am. I'll take care of it.

336
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,849
- Are you leaving, Ms. Chairwoman?
- Yes.

337
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,089
Thank you.

338
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:52,220
I heard you funded
my brother's new business.

339
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:54,490
And you gave them credit cards, too.

340
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,460
Of course,
I should do my part to help.

341
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,359
It wasn't a big deal.
You don't have to feel any pressure.

342
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,099
I won't. My siblings were thrilled.

343
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,869
- Please do look after them.
- Sure.

344
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:07,970
- And Ha Na.
- Of course.

345
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:11,779
This is all too sudden.

346
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:13,109
I thought you cut ties with her.

347
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,380
Back then, I was too narrow-minded.

348
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,380
I ask for your understanding.

349
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:22,890
It's nice to hear you'll open up
at this point in time.

350
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,990
Yu Jin will be happy.

351
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,890
And she'll be able
to adopt Eun Chong, right?

352
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,829
Yes. Goodbye.

353
00:21:35,269 --> 00:21:36,369
Goodbye.

354
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,440
What's with him?

355
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:45,440
He recently threatened me
with my corporate raiding business.

356
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:46,980
I'm not sure.

357
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,950
I'll humor you in this fake act...

358
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,519
however you want me to...

359
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,019
and play this deadly game.

360
00:22:07,299 --> 00:22:08,500
Grandma.

361
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,470
Hey, Eun Chong. How's your hand?

362
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,640
It feels better than this morning.

363
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,470
Little Grandma put medicine on it.

364
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,079
Did she?

365
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,640
Thank you for your help.
It must've been tough.

366
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,180
Goodness, hardly.

367
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,109
Eun Chong and I had so much fun.

368
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,950
- Isn't that so?
- Yes!

369
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,250
We played a treasure hunt.

370
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,720
Did you?

371
00:22:30,789 --> 00:22:33,420
Do you want to see
the treasures I found?

372
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:39,529
A transforming robot toy,
a dinosaur figurine,

373
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:41,799
and some slime.

374
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:44,269
I found all these.

375
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,599
Little Grandma will
buy all these for me.

376
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,940
Goodness, you did a great job.

377
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:51,480
But the real treasure was
something else.

378
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,480
Look!

379
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,480
What about this photo?

380
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,519
This photo went missing
from my auntie's room.

381
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,559
Where did you find this?

382
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:09,230
In your vanity table drawer.

383
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,660
In my vanity table drawer?

384
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,529
Wait, what's going on?

385
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,470
What was that in there?

386
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,069
Wait, you didn't know, either?

387
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,640
I thought you took it.

388
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:27,680
Why would I take this?

389
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,309
Right?
That wasn't a photo of just Yu Jin.

390
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,250
Did you do the treasure hunt
in my room?

391
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,660
I said I'd hide those
on the first floor,

392
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:40,890
and he asked me
to hide those in your room.

393
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,390
- Right, Eun Chong?
- Yes.

394
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,269
Why, Yeo Jin?
Did you feel guilty on the inside?

395
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:59,410
Ha Na may get suspicious of me
because of that photo.

396
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,650
Pretending like you don't know
will be the best move.

397
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,380
You'll end up making mistakes
trying to make excuses.

398
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:09,690
Why is this happening?

399
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,049
I have a bad feeling about this.

400
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,359
Did Ms. Choi know something
when she did this?

401
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,660
It was odd how she did
the treasure hunt in your room,

402
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,670
and it was an odd coincidence
that he found that photo.

403
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,869
She said Eun Chong asked her
to hide those in my room.

404
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,940
She doesn't know
what Yu Jin looks like.

405
00:24:30,109 --> 00:24:32,509
Eun Chong must've found it
by coincidence.

406
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:36,009
But you should still be careful.

407
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,420
I should.

408
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:44,619
How did this end up in your room?

409
00:24:45,019 --> 00:24:47,859
I have no idea. It's really odd.

410
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,329
Did someone put it there on purpose?

411
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,259
Probably.

412
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,970
Why would anyone
leave that photo in my room?

413
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,009
But I was so glad
Eun Chong helped you find it.

414
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,579
I hope you don't mind it.
Get some rest.

415
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,380
- Okay. Get some rest, Mom.
- Okay.

416
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,720
That was so weird.

417
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:23,029
Du Na, why would anyone do this?

418
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,329
It must've been
someone in my family.

419
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,369
It wasn't Mom or me,

420
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:34,339
so was it Se Young or Aunt Myung Ji?

421
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:42,880
Hey, Ji Eun.

422
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,480
Ji Seok was at the tteokbokki place?

423
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,220
Yes, he came and had tteokbokki.

424
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,950
Ji Seok has changed completely.

425
00:25:50,789 --> 00:25:52,720
He once told us
not to receive a dime from her,

426
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,960
but now, he said we should take
all kinds of help she offered.

427
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,960
He also told me
to make sure I adopt Eun Chong.

428
00:25:58,529 --> 00:25:59,630
Really?

429
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,829
Is something going on?

430
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,430
You should ask. Bye.

431
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,440
There must be a reason...

432
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,509
behind Ji Seok's change.

433
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,779
Mom, Dad.

434
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,849
Ha Na wasn't
Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

435
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,660
Chairwoman Shin
took advantage of her...

436
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,730
after what they did to you two.

437
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,200
I can never forgive her,

438
00:26:36,599 --> 00:26:37,769
but for now,

439
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,710
I'm just happy to know...

440
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:45,079
that Ha Na isn't her daughter.

441
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,650
Your brother came?

442
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,549
Yes, I was scared that
he'd turn the place upside down,

443
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,319
but he had tteokbokki,
gave me money,

444
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,720
and even his blessing.

445
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,329
I'm glad.

446
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:05,630
It's good news,
but what's the reason?

447
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,759
He even ruined
our parents' memorial service...

448
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,829
because of the chairwoman.

449
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:10,930
I wonder.

450
00:27:12,069 --> 00:27:14,200
Ji Seok had come home, too.

451
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:16,369
Something must be going on.

452
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,349
First, I should tell my customers
about the soup.

453
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:31,450
There are five different soups,
so they can have whatever they want.

454
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,890
We have a mild flavor
and a spicy one, too.

455
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,400
- I'm home.
- You're back, Jin Goo.

456
00:27:42,069 --> 00:27:43,900
What happened to your lips?

457
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,369
Did you get into a fight?

458
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,339
A fight? I'm too old to do that.

459
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,170
- I got scratched.
- What happened?

460
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,440
While working out.

461
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,839
I put ointment on it,
so I'll be fine.

462
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:56,079
What are you up to?

463
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:59,450
It's not so easy
to own a small business.

464
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,180
I have to study a lot, too.

465
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:03,190
You're studying hard, Mom.

466
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,890
I wonder if the chairwoman found
a new housekeeper.

467
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,259
I haven't reached out.

468
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:11,460
You don't have to mind them.

469
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:14,430
You'll be busy from now on
as a business owner.

470
00:28:16,269 --> 00:28:18,329
It's so odd to hear
that I'll own a business.

471
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:28,180
I'm home...

472
00:28:28,849 --> 00:28:29,980
What is this?

473
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,990
It's a fake caterpillar.

474
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,289
"Fake?"

475
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,029
Don't make me mad.

476
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,759
How dare you surprise me
with a toy like this?

477
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:49,829
What are you doing? Hey.

478
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,400
Are you okay, Eun Chong? Goodness.

479
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,839
Why did you knuckle him
after getting surprised by a toy?

480
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,069
- Mom!
- Go upstairs.

481
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,809
- Are you okay, Eun Chong?
- Yes.

482
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:04,950
Little Grandma will
have a talk with Auntie Se Young.

483
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:07,650
All right.

484
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,119
Why are you crying, Eun Chong?

485
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:13,390
- Auntie Ha Na...
- There, there.

486
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,130
Auntie Se Young...

487
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,259
Se Young was surprised...

488
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,660
to see a toy caterpillar.

489
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,430
Eun Chong, come with me...

490
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,940
to buy the treasures you found.

491
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,339
Okay.

492
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,640
You must've had a tough day.
Thank you.

493
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:33,740
Goodness. We aren't strangers.

494
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,009
Yu Jin, if he's your son,

495
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:39,450
he's like my grandson, too.

496
00:29:39,579 --> 00:29:42,119
Once you adopt him,
he'll be a real grandson.

497
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:44,750
Yes.

498
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,690
Right. The adoption agency will
stop by on the weekend...

499
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,390
regarding his adoption.

500
00:29:52,029 --> 00:29:54,200
Things are moving fast.

501
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,630
Everything we do will...

502
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:59,539
have an impact on the evaluation,
so be extra careful.

503
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,440
Please do us a favor, Aunt Myung Ji.

504
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,009
- And you, Se Young.
- Of course, we'll cooperate.

505
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,609
Is there anything
we need to prepare?

506
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:07,839
No.

507
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:09,880
Good for you, Eun Chong.

508
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,750
Auntie Yu Jin will
become your mommy.

509
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,519
Yes, it was my wish.

510
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,990
I hope it goes well.

511
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,089
Yes, thank you.

512
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,829
Here. Chew well.

513
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:29,299
I need to do whatever I can
to stop the adoption.

514
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,980
Will Yeo Jin give up
parental rights and custody?

515
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,150
She enjoyed life
with her grandson so much...

516
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,250
that her sense of judgment
got clouded.

517
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,160
Detective Cho, the adoption agency
will visit our home...

518
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,630
for that kid's adoption.

519
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:00,099
Find a way to stop that.

520
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:06,099
You can give honest answers
to all the questions.

521
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,470
You've done this often,
so you'll do a great job.

522
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,170
Yes, I can do a great job!

523
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,640
Hey, the person must be here.

524
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,880
Auntie, we can do it!

525
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,380
Eun Chong, we can do it!

526
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,079
We can do it!

527
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:20,519
Let's do a great job.

528
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,059
- Hello.
- Please excuse me.

529
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,890
You must be Eun Chong.

530
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,500
Hello. My name is Lee Eun Chong
of Chamsae Class...

531
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,829
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

532
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:35,970
Hello.

533
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,529
Are you Ms. Goo Ha Na,
his foster mother?

534
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,099
Yes, I'm his auntie.

535
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:45,069
This is nothing difficult.
You can just do things as usual.

536
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,039
You must be Eun Chong's family.

537
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,910
Yes, I'm his grandmother.

538
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,819
And I'm the second grandmother.

539
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,150
I'm his aunt.

540
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,349
Then, we'll do the interview later.

541
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,319
Let me take a look
at his home environment.

542
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,430
Where's Eun Chong's room?

543
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,069
Who is it?

544
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,069
Hello, we're the police.

545
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,740
"The police?"

546
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,440
"The police?"

547
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,250
What brings you here?

548
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,250
We received a report
on child abuse in this home.

549
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,089
- "Child abuse?"
- "Child abuse?"

550
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,720
(Cinderella Game)

551
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,250
Who made the report?

552
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,519
Catch that punk
and lock him up for calumny!

553
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,819
Child abuse?
What are you talking about?

554
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:40,559
I have to kick out
that fake daughter...

555
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,390
before she moves further
in the adoption process.

556
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,630
Things aren't working out,
so we'll have to live separately.

557
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:47,099
- Is today day one, then?
- Sure.

558
00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:48,930
You still care very much
about your older sister.

559
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:51,299
Did something happen
at the time of my disappearance?

560
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:53,500
She's acting like she doesn't know
even though she does.

561
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,470
I don't know about others,
but you can't do this to me.

562
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:59,579
You were with me when I disappeared.
