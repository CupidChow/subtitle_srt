1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,980
Aunt Yeo Jin!

5
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:12,250
Congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.

6
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:15,019
Thank you, Se Young.

7
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:21,129
When will Yu Jin come home?
When can we meet her?

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,500
We have to keep quiet
about finding her for a while.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,129
Things could become rowdy
once her identity gets exposed.

10
00:00:27,129 --> 00:00:29,370
You'll meet her when she comes home.
You understand, right?

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,170
Yes.

12
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,469
I look forward to seeing
this fake daughter or fraud.

13
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:39,979
I know how hard you helped
by my side until this day.

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,280
That was how I could find her.

15
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,320
Don't say that
like we're some strangers.

16
00:00:47,189 --> 00:00:50,390
Yu Jin and I grew up
like we were real sisters.

17
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,189
Things would be the same as then
even if we met now.

18
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:54,960
Yes.

19
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,859
I have a favor to ask of you.

20
00:01:00,369 --> 00:01:03,369
Yu Jin was traumatized
at the time of her disappearance...

21
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,640
and didn't remember
anything about her childhood.

22
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,609
Please refrain from mentioning
anything about her childhood...

23
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:11,640
and whatever happened
before her disappearance.

24
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:15,980
The doctor said
her condition could worsen...

25
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,250
if we tried
to force her memories to return.

26
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,250
Goodness, of course.

27
00:01:22,489 --> 00:01:25,019
We'll let her remember naturally.

28
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,359
I'll do that, Aunt Yeo Jin.

29
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:29,730
And keep it a secret
from anyone outside.

30
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,400
Yes, we'll do that.

31
00:01:32,629 --> 00:01:36,329
My goodness.
How could we have known...

32
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:38,040
Yu Jin was so close by?

33
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:56,489
Take your medicine.

34
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,790
Everything will be over
if she sees...

35
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,359
how you're trembling.

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,870
It's such a relief
she doesn't remember her childhood.

37
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,240
She may not remember it now,

38
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,409
but what if she remembers
getting on the boat with me?

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,379
She'll never remember.

40
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:25,150
Mom, where do you get the confidence
to be so composed?

41
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,379
Lower your voice!

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,650
You said she died.

43
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,189
You paid all those shamans,
and it ended up like...

44
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,389
What will you do
if you don't trust me?

45
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,060
What can you do alone without me?

46
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,900
If you can do something, do it.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,939
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,439
You just need to trust me
and follow my lead.

49
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,310
I can still keep you safe...

50
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,639
even if Yu Jin comes here.

51
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,610
Do you mean it?

52
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,250
Of course.

53
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,979
Of course.

54
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,650
Wait, could she be
the Yu Jin she found?

55
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:04,759
Did you go out for a walk?

56
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,560
- Please have dinner with us.
- Sure.

57
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:09,030
I wasn't trying to eavesdrop,

58
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,599
but did you find your birth mother?

59
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,729
Please keep it a secret
from my siblings.

60
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,500
Why? It's great news.

61
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:22,139
She said she'd come home
and tell them herself.

62
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:23,710
By any chance,

63
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,639
was she the one you met
a few days ago,

64
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,280
the chairwoman of your workplace?

65
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,319
How did you know?

66
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,490
It's a secret.

67
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:37,990
All right.

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,430
Yeo Jin is her birth mother?

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,770
Yeo Jin, what have you done?

70
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:53,300
Did you turn Ms. Goo into Yu Jin
to keep Eun Chong safe?

71
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:57,979
The chairwoman and I are besties.

72
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,349
So, I told her to come over.

73
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,949
Hey, the chairwoman
doesn't have that much time.

74
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,819
She wouldn't be at this humble home
just because you were her bestie.

75
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,219
If you really are her bestie,

76
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:12,659
get me the highest position
at the cafeteria.

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,430
Ha Na, I think
Eun Chong needs to see a doctor.

78
00:04:21,069 --> 00:04:23,370
He said the chairwoman would
come over to our place.

79
00:04:24,069 --> 00:04:25,240
She will.

80
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,269
Tell Ji Eun to come on the weekend.

81
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:29,310
No way. Are you serious?

82
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,579
Wait, why would she come here?

83
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,709
She'll come and tell you.

84
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,410
I got chills.

85
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,519
What's going on? You're scaring me.

86
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,389
Did you do something?

87
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,360
Yes, I did something.

88
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,889
Something huge.

89
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:47,329
Wait.

90
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:49,990
Is she our new landlady?

91
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,399
She turned Ms. Goo
into your daughter?

92
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:58,439
She couldn't tell others
that Eun Chong was her grandson,

93
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,170
so she must've turned Ms. Goo
into Yu Jin.

94
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,879
The two must've had an agreement.

95
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:07,649
Well, yes. Of course.

96
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,279
It'd be impossible to do
without her permission.

97
00:05:10,279 --> 00:05:11,980
If she becomes Yu Jin,

98
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,490
Eun Chong will be her friend's son
and remain safe.

99
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:18,519
She made a fake daughter
to protect Eun Chong?

100
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,129
She seemed to have found
the best way out.

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,899
Ms. Goo is like Cinderella,

102
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,470
while Eun Chong is
the hidden seven-year-old successor.

103
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,339
Thanks to this act,
she'll get to live with him.

104
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,269
Is there another problem?

105
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:39,079
Ms. Goo is unaware of the history
between the two families.

106
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,449
What if she finds out Eun Chong is
the blood of her worst enemy?

107
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,720
I didn't expect her
to do something like this...

108
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,050
to protect Eun Chong.

109
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,689
How long can she keep doing
this fake daughter thing?

110
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,660
We'll leave that up to fate.

111
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,560
She must have another plan
in case they get exposed.

112
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,509
Yoon Yu Jin?

113
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,839
Yoon Yu Jin.

114
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,480
That was my real name.

115
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:17,480
Do you know who Yoon Yu Jin is?

116
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:22,050
It was the name
Ji Seok asked me about.

117
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,790
Why did he ask me
about my childhood name?

118
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,829
Because it was the name
of the chairwoman's daughter?

119
00:06:36,829 --> 00:06:40,040
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

120
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,269
Look at Yali.

121
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,209
Gosh, she's so cute.

122
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,149
Whoa, a cat.

123
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,509
Look. Isn't Yali cute?

124
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,920
Gosh, it's called Yali?

125
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,319
Where is Yali?

126
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,019
She's at Mr. Hwang's place.

127
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,220
Gosh, can we go see her?

128
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,790
I want to see Ms. Bang Ul, too.

129
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,730
I'll ask him.

130
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
Gosh, she's so cute.

131
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:12,970
Sleep well.

132
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,639
- Mr. Hwang said, "Sleep well."
- What?

133
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,579
Yali looks so happy
as she's sleeping.

134
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,779
It's such a heartwarming night.
Goodnight, Mr. Hwang.

135
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,860
Goodnight.

136
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:40,160
What are you doing, Eun Chong?

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,069
I just texted Mr. Hwang.

138
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,199
I said, "I want to see you."

139
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,670
What? What am I going to do?

140
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,370
No, he read it.

141
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,009
I want to see you.

142
00:07:57,149 --> 00:07:58,220
- My gosh!
- Whoa.

143
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,120
(Yali)

144
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,259
She wants to see Yali?

145
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,959
I'm sorry, Mr. Hwang.
Eun Chong just sent those.

146
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,699
You can't text him and say
you want to see him.

147
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:18,970
He'll take it the wrong way.

148
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,069
I meant that I wanted to see Yali.

149
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,509
Yali?

150
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,120
Goodness. Lee Eun Chong!
You're so mischievous!

151
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
You're such a troublemaker. Hey.

152
00:08:36,389 --> 00:08:38,620
Goodness, Eun Chong.

153
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:42,259
If Ms. Goo chose this
for the other two's happiness,

154
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,460
should I also show my support
and keep an eye on everything?

155
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,289
No, don't come.

156
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,929
Don't come. Don't.

157
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,159
Go away!

158
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:23,200
Go away!

159
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:26,840
What's wrong? Did you have a dream?

160
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,110
Over there. Yu Jin is there.

161
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,710
Yu Jin...

162
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:36,110
It was just a dream.
Yu Jin isn't here.

163
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,080
Come here.

164
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:40,919
It's all right.

165
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,220
No one is here.

166
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,860
I'm scared.

167
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,730
Don't be scared. I'm here with you.

168
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,730
It's all right. Nothing will happen.

169
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,250
I can't believe
I'm Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

170
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,019
Eun Chong.

171
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:19,289
I met my birth mother.

172
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:22,789
I still can't believe it.

173
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:24,399
I can't,

174
00:10:25,529 --> 00:10:26,700
but I love it.

175
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,139
I would've met her even sooner
if I had registered my DNA...

176
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,440
when your mother told me to.

177
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,409
I must be getting blessed...

178
00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:42,350
for living so diligently.

179
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:47,320
Do you also want to know
what she's like?

180
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,049
She's a big deal.

181
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:55,429
You'd be really surprised
if you found out.

182
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,509
I'm the daughter
of this company's owner?

183
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,250
It still doesn't feel real.

184
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,850
Gosh, I hope
I don't become a nuisance.

185
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:28,960
I haven't even started.
Let's not get scared.

186
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,929
When did you know she found Yu Jin?

187
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,070
I found out yesterday.

188
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,039
She only shared this with Ms. Jang
and kept it from you, too?

189
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,940
Have you heard anything about her?

190
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,779
Where does she live?
What does she do?

191
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:52,279
She wouldn't tell me,
so I didn't want to pry.

192
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,820
We'll find out soon enough,
so let's wait.

193
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,519
How do you honestly feel?

194
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:00,220
If she comes back,
she may steal our positions.

195
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,860
I wouldn't use the word "steal."

196
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:03,990
It was hers to begin with.

197
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,600
Don't you have any ambition?

198
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,269
Think of everything
you have done by her side.

199
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,570
Don't you want to be her successor?

200
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:13,639
I started working here
to repay her kindness.

201
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:18,309
If her daughter shows up,
I must help her.

202
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,549
Everyone will call you pretentious
if you say that.

203
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,909
You already know people think...

204
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:27,649
we're in a win-win relationship
because we're both halfsies.

205
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:30,649
Why do you care
about what others think?

206
00:12:31,059 --> 00:12:32,159
We're just us.

207
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,259
Are you also marrying me...

208
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:36,929
to repay Aunt Yeo Jin's kindness?

209
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:38,000
What are you talking about?

210
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,470
Am I the kind of man...

211
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,970
who'll marry someone I don't love
just to repay her kindness?

212
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,039
Who knows?

213
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,009
Your priority is my aunt, not me.

214
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,070
Do you even love me?

215
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:54,450
I recently began to wonder
if I really were your fiancée.

216
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,120
I'm sorry.
I'll be more attentive from now on.

217
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,320
Do you want to eat dinner today?

218
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,850
It doesn't feel great
to force you to do things.

219
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,320
Se Young.

220
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,649
I made a mistake yesterday.

221
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,389
- Please forget it.
- "Mistake?"

222
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:39,590
Why would you make such a mistake?

223
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,259
Because Yoon Yu Jin showed up?

224
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,200
You shuddered
after getting that phone call...

225
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,960
because the substitution
would be thrown out...

226
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,970
as soon as the real deal showed up.

227
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,639
Shut up. That won't happen.

228
00:13:57,039 --> 00:13:58,039
(Jin Goo)

229
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,509
You should've chosen me,
not Hwang Jin Goo.

230
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,610
It's still not too late.

231
00:14:03,649 --> 00:14:06,120
You're a better match with me
than Hwang Jin Goo.

232
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,450
What do you want, then?

233
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,220
- For me to break off my engagement?
- Can you?

234
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,629
Then, prove that you're serious.

235
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,159
I need to do the math and see...

236
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,970
if I can switch over to you.

237
00:14:21,169 --> 00:14:22,299
Can you prove it?

238
00:14:24,269 --> 00:14:27,200
If you trust me.

239
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,370
You don't trust me, either.

240
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,740
Mutual trust is
absolutely necessary in a contract.

241
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,279
I guess this one will take a while.

242
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,350
You're about to go down,
so you need to hold tightly...

243
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,750
to whatever lifeline you can find
with all your might.

244
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,250
Trust, my foot.

245
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,059
I was told not to grab
a decaying lifeline.

246
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,759
Anyway,
I'll keep your offer in my mind.

247
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,340
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

248
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:02,809
Am I the kind of man...

249
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,539
who'll marry someone I don't love
just to repay her kindness?

250
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,009
Your priority is my aunt, not me.

251
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,620
Do you even love me?

252
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,850
"Love?"

253
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:18,490
Come in.

254
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:28,169
Mr. Hwang, I revised the details
for the mother-daughter therapy tour.

255
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,269
Good work.

256
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,710
I want to see you.

257
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,080
Mr. Hwang?

258
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,519
Eun Chong must want to see
Yali a lot.

259
00:15:47,789 --> 00:15:49,049
You should bring him over sometime.

260
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:53,159
Your mother would
find us uncomfortable.

261
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,529
She adores Eun Chong, too.

262
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,429
If you still feel uneasy,
then just send Eun Chong over.

263
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,830
He'd be thrilled.

264
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,269
The first thing he did this morning
was to look at Yali's photos.

265
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,440
It's hard to go back
once you become a cat lover.

266
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:11,639
One moment.

267
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,740
You've reached Hwang Jin Goo.

268
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,919
The official document from Dubai
was forged?

269
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:20,980
Are you sure?

270
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:23,490
All right.
Thank you for your hard work.

271
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,490
The document that proved...

272
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,830
their suspension of three months
was fake?

273
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,860
Yes.

274
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,259
The form was different
from what they usually used.

275
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:36,370
Also, the Dubaian travel agency is
business as usual in Dubai.

276
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,570
We were stabbed in the back, then.

277
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Why would Hassan lie to us?

278
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,009
That's what we need to find out.

279
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,440
Let's keep
the forged document a secret...

280
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,549
until we find evidence.

281
00:16:48,909 --> 00:16:50,509
Let's find out who's behind Hassan.

282
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:55,289
You believe it was
Head Director Goo Ji Seok, right?

283
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,419
I don't have hard evidence, though.

284
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,690
What do I have to do
in the middle...

285
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:02,590
if Ji Seok becomes
the chairwoman's enemy?

286
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,460
You want to keep an eye on her?

287
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,130
She hasn't announced
finding her daughter,

288
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:11,740
and things at her business
are quiet, too.

289
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,740
She'll probably keep her hidden
for a while.

290
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,509
We must find out who she is
before she goes public...

291
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,539
and come up with countermeasures.

292
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,349
The succession may change
depending on her position...

293
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,210
Sir?

294
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,650
Your daughter
became Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

295
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,950
What if you found out?

296
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,549
Sir?

297
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,559
- Yes?
- Do you feel unwell?

298
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,259
You don't look so well.

299
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,529
I'm fine.

300
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,930
Here's how I expect
everything to unfold.

301
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,230
She'll keep her daughter hidden
and teach her as a successor.

302
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,440
Hwang Jin Goo and Yoon Se Young will
get married in that while.

303
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,269
The two will remain
as her potential successors...

304
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:48,740
until her daughter
comes to the front.

305
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,140
Would those two do
as Chairwoman Shin wants...

306
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,839
while her daughter gets trained
as the actual successor?

307
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,079
I doubt that.
And that's when we come in.

308
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,849
In order to do that,

309
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,049
we must finish putting Hyesung Tour down,
according to our plan.

310
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm afraid this will...

311
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,930
harm you and your sister
in the gravest way.

312
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:13,660
If...

313
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:18,140
Chairwoman Shin apologizes
and seeks forgiveness right now,

314
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,140
will you be willing
to stop your revenge?

315
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,180
No, if she was capable of that,
I wouldn't be here today.

316
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,809
Is something going on?

317
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:31,720
No.

318
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,220
Let me know
if anything troubles you.

319
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:35,690
Getting your revenge is important,

320
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,019
but nothing is more important
than your family and those you love.

321
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:40,460
Now that I look back,

322
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:43,259
the people in my life were
the most precious to me.

323
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,599
I can't do that anymore,
but I hope you live that life.

324
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:49,630
Yes, sir.

325
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,670
Chairwoman Shin postponed
the video call,

326
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,569
so let me call it off altogether.

327
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,769
Tell her Richard Han is returning
to Korea at the end of this month.

328
00:18:58,309 --> 00:18:59,539
Are you sure?

329
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,549
It was about time
I made my entrance.

330
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,259
- Please try again.
- Gosh.

331
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,490
(Goo Ji Seok)

332
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,960
What?

333
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,559
- You should go through.
- Thank you.

334
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,240
Do you still run coffee errands?

335
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:37,009
It wasn't an errand.
I lost a ghost leg game.

336
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,920
Here. It's decaf.

337
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,450
- I'm fine.
- I have mine, so drink it.

338
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,619
Those who do the coffee run
get to drink two cups of coffee.

339
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,099
Do you remember?

340
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,569
We always played
the ghost leg game as kids...

341
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,869
because we hated cleaning the house.

342
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,509
I always lost back then,
and I still do now.

343
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,140
Back then, you lost on purpose
not to let our siblings...

344
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,779
or me do it.

345
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,450
Don't let others win anymore.

346
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,279
You knew that?

347
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,819
Gosh, you're such a softie
on the inside.

348
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,420
I said I'd destroy Hyesung Tour.

349
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,759
I'm promoting a business
with an investor I met in America,

350
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,259
and our goal is Hyesung Group.

351
00:20:23,329 --> 00:20:26,230
Chairwoman Shin and I are
technically enemies.

352
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,369
I didn't want her
to be involved with our family.

353
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,539
Would Ji Seok change his mind
if he found out...

354
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,880
the chairwoman was my birth mother?

355
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:42,680
You asked me if I knew
someone named Yoon Yu Jin...

356
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,019
from my children's home, right?

357
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,920
Do you remember her?

358
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:51,319
I wanted to share the news
with your siblings myself.

359
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,859
No, I was just curious
because you had asked.

360
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,970
You're about to go down,
so you need to hold tightly...

361
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,640
to whatever lifeline you can find
with all your might.

362
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,980
Trust, my foot.

363
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,450
Do you think I'll back off
just because Yu Jin is here now?

364
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,160
You were still stuck
in your childhood.

365
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:38,470
Think of everything that
makes you afraid as a toy.

366
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,869
It doesn't matter if the toy
opens its eyes and walks around.

367
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,009
You're the owner of that room
as long as you keep this talisman.

368
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,250
Yes, Yoon Yu Jin.

369
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,349
You're just a toy.

370
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,559
Thank you.

371
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:04,660
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

372
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,799
Here's your coffee.

373
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,339
Oh, no!

374
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,170
A talisman?

375
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:17,309
- What's wrong?
- Are you okay?

376
00:22:17,309 --> 00:22:18,380
Did you spill the coffee?

377
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:21,650
- What? Is this a talisman?
- What?

378
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,549
Darn it.

379
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:28,950
You spilled coffee on your talisman?

380
00:22:29,089 --> 00:22:30,920
Why couldn't you stick that
while it was dry?

381
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,660
I don't know.
It's all Goo Ha Na's fault.

382
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:35,890
She left the coffee on my desk
to make me spill it on purpose.

383
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,630
It was that brat again?

384
00:22:39,259 --> 00:22:41,230
That unlucky girl is
always getting in your way.

385
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,869
You should stick that talisman
on that brat!

386
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,440
Keep your distance from her
to keep bad luck away.

387
00:22:47,569 --> 00:22:48,910
Could it have bad luck now?

388
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,710
We can always get another talisman,

389
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:52,779
so just stop minding
that petty girl.

390
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:00,819
All right. Bye.

391
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,460
Someone who might be my birth mother
suddenly showed up.

392
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,500
Did you meet that woman
who could be your birth mother?

393
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,970
- So, was she?
- Yes.

394
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,440
She must've heard that
the chairwoman found her daughter.

395
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,440
Does this mean Yoon Se Young
and I will become cousins?

396
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,410
Did you run a parentage test?

397
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:29,579
Yes.

398
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,380
What kind of a face will she make...

399
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,680
when she finds out
that I'm the chairwoman's daughter?

400
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,759
How does it feel when a stranger
suddenly shows up as your mom?

401
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,359
It seemed like...

402
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,930
you weren't too glad
or moved to meet her.

403
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,769
I'm not so sure.

404
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:51,869
It doesn't feel real yet.
I felt bewildered.

405
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,099
What does she do?

406
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:54,539
Is she well-off?

407
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,339
Why do you want to know that?

408
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,809
It reminded me
of a third-rate drama.

409
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,309
This is when a rich mom comes in
and changes the whole landscape.

410
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,849
It's so tacky.

411
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,490
Why won't she answer me?

412
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:10,420
Tell me no.

413
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,930
What am I imagining?

414
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:17,329
A girl like Goo Ha Na can't be her.

415
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,630
So, she made a fake daughter...

416
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,569
because she didn't want
to leave the company to Se Young?

417
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,410
If so, she would've put on a show
long ago.

418
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,609
Why would she do that now?

419
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,579
Did she find out
that her daughter died?

420
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:34,210
If she found out,
she would've lost her mind by now...

421
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,220
Wait.

422
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:42,619
She once collapsed at work...

423
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,119
and was brought home on a gurney.

424
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,559
Yes, since that day,

425
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:51,089
things began to feel quite eerie.

426
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,700
- Yes.
- That file was around then, too.

427
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,529
She'd quickly hide the files
she was looking at when I walked in.

428
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:00,170
So, I opened her safe
and found nothing.

429
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,740
She found out
that her daughter died.

430
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,109
How would she know?

431
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,240
Only you and I know that.

432
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,279
Who knows? I did my part
and cleaned up everything.

433
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,349
If she found out
about her daughter's death,

434
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,650
she must've found out
about the hit-and-run accident.

435
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,960
Then, she probably got
suspicious of the driver.

436
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,019
She must be suspicious of you, too.

437
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,900
- Me?
- You and your daughter...

438
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,869
would suffer the most
if her daughter came back.

439
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,500
Is she testing you
and your daughter...

440
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,799
by making that fake daughter?

441
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,509
She's suspicious of me?

442
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,480
No.

443
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,079
She may not trust me,
but she won't be suspicious of me.

444
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,849
A woman in her early thirties
will use this room.

445
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:50,789
Please make it look
simple and modern.

446
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,019
But Eun Chong will
stay in this room with her.

447
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,890
He should stay with me in my room.

448
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,000
It's more natural for him to stay
with Ms. Goo in the beginning.

449
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,029
You must keep your distance
from Eun Chong.

450
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,200
Then, decorate the room...

451
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,869
for a mom in her thirties
and her seven-year-old son.

452
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,079
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,339
Please pick up what you'll keep
and leave what you'll throw out.

454
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,349
We'll tear it down
starting tomorrow.

455
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,700
Please have it done within a week.

456
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,700
Yes, of course. I'll stay in touch.

457
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,700
Why is she suddenly redecorating
her daughter's room?

458
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,140
I guess
Mr. Hwang hasn't told you yet.

459
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,710
She found her daughter.

460
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,339
Oh, my. Are you serious?

461
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:59,960
Ms. Chairwoman, you should pick out
the things to throw out...

462
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:01,960
"Throw out?"

463
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,359
All these belonged to Yu Jin.

464
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,599
How can you tell me
to throw these out?

465
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:07,359
You found your daughter now,
so you must do it.

466
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,730
You also found your grandson.

467
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,269
I did find Yu Jin.

468
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,240
And Eun Chong.

469
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:25,619
Is it finally time to let Yu Jin go?

470
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,150
You must make the decision
for Eun Chong's sake.

471
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,420
Yes. I'll only think of Eun Chong.

472
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,630
Your bestie lady is
coming over on the weekend?

473
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:40,559
Yes, I invited her.

474
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,599
Auntie Ji Eun will also come.

475
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:47,869
Grandpa, how high can a kite fly?

476
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,710
Well, very high.

477
00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:54,440
Will it reach my mommy?

478
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:55,809
Of course.

479
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:59,049
I hope she reads this
and grants my wish.

480
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,319
- Did you decide on a wish?
- Yes.

481
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,190
I want all my family to be happy.

482
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,589
All right.
Let's write down our wishes...

483
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,259
and go fly the kites.

484
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,170
Yeo Jin will be here tomorrow?

485
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,769
Then, Ji Seok will find out
very soon.

486
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:26,079
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

487
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:28,710
Here. It's decaf.

488
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,109
Do you remember?

489
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,519
We always played
the ghost leg game as kids...

490
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,950
because we hated cleaning the house.

491
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,730
Director Goo,
the accident with Ms. Yoon's car...

492
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,569
will be handled quietly
by the insurance company.

493
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,329
Things must've been hectic...

494
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:52,500
since the chairwoman's daughter
appeared.

495
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,569
- That's great.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,240
Wait.

497
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,009
Can you find a robot vacuum cleaner?

498
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,109
Is it for you?

499
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,549
It's for my older sister.

500
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:09,849
It's so much easier
to clean the place now.

501
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,019
We now have a bidet
and a robot vacuum cleaner.

502
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,089
We're pretty well-off, too.

503
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,430
Uncle Ji Seok is awesome!

504
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,460
What about me?

505
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,630
I'm here with you,
so you should be good to me.

506
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,940
- Grandpa.
- Hey.

507
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,039
I'll introduce you
to my best friend later.

508
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,039
I'm sorry.

509
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,549
I have to go out and do something.

510
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:41,049
Are you giving us privacy
on purpose?

511
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,019
No, I had a previous engagement.

512
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,819
The unemployed are
always the busiest.

513
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,460
Hey.

514
00:29:52,359 --> 00:29:53,529
Hey, Ji Seok. You're here.

515
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:55,470
I made salad,
so you could have that.

516
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,329
Are you going to work?

517
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,869
No, I'm going to Ha Na's place.

518
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:00,000
Wait, you haven't heard, right?

519
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,140
The chairwoman is
coming to her place today.

520
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,809
What do you mean?
You mean Chairwoman Shin?

521
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:07,180
She must be her new landlady...

522
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:08,809
if she's coming there herself.

523
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,779
I'll use this chance to make sure
she knows who I am.

524
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,779
- "Landlady?"
- Bye, then.

525
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,589
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

526
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:24,990
Hi, Eun Chong.

527
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:27,730
Thank you for inviting me.

528
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,069
Have a seat, Ms. Chairwoman.

529
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:32,940
Thank you.

530
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,170
I'll get some tea.

531
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,480
Well, if I may ask,

532
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,220
are you here to ask us
for a rent increase...

533
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,420
or for us to move?

534
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,750
Hey, that's not it.

535
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,049
Then, what is it?

536
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,119
Isn't she the landlady?

537
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,559
Actually, I recently found...

538
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,700
my lost daughter.

539
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,559
- Really?
- Really?

540
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,769
Congratulations, Ms. Chairwoman.
Oh, my.

541
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:06,700
Yes, congratulations, ma'am.

542
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,069
- You lost your daughter?
- Yes.

543
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:13,309
But I found her now,
so I was very thrilled.

544
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,210
Who's your daughter?

545
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,750
So, what does
finding your daughter...

546
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,650
have to do with our family?

547
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:27,619
- Ha Na!
- My gosh!

548
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,230
Where's your class?

549
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:30,990
Gosh, I'm sorry.

550
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,859
Are you...

551
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:35,630
No, right?

552
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,940
Gosh, what am I imagining?

553
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,009
How can you be...

554
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,039
Gosh, that makes no sense.

555
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
Yes, you're taking things too far.

556
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,680
We're sorry.
Please don't take it the wrong way.

557
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,079
You didn't get it wrong.

558
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,019
- Sorry?
- What?

559
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:58,819
Ms. Goo was my lost daughter.

560
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:14,769
I am Ha Na's birth mother.

561
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:22,549
You're the chairwoman's daughter?

562
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,240
(Cinderella Game)

563
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,509
I want to live with you
as soon as possible.

564
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,569
This is going to be really fun.

565
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,710
When did everything go wrong?

566
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,910
Is there a reason why she can't be
the chairwoman's daughter?

567
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,049
Please show some respect.
She's my birth mother.

568
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:32,779
You need to run
the parentage test again.

569
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,819
Please keep it a secret for a while.

570
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:36,789
Everything went as you hoped,
Yeo Jin.

571
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:38,049
Please be happy.

572
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,289
Think of everything I went through
to be here right now.

573
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,089
No!
