1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,420
(Episode 81)

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,120
- Is everything true?
- I don't know.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,490
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin,
as of this hour,

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,960
you are under emergency arrest
for violating the Capital Markets Act.

8
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,500
You have the right
to consult an attorney...

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,130
and choose to remain silent.

10
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,370
Let go of me.
How dare you do this without evidence?

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,670
You can't lay a finger on me...

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,540
even if you bring
hundreds of those reports.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,810
Bring me the decisive evidence.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,180
(Request of Compulsory Auction
of Real Estate Property)

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,250
Here's the decisive evidence.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,820
How did you get this?

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,130
Admit to everything,
just as you promised.

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,960
Ms. Shin Yeo Jin,
the corporate raider.

19
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,980
Everything was manipulated,
and this is a fraud.

20
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,450
Don't believe for a second...

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,850
that I'll forgive you for everything
just because you raised Eun Chong.

22
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,420
Forgiveness is something
the victim gives to the perpetrator.

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,990
What makes you the worst is...

24
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,490
that hurting me wasn't enough,
so you even hurt...

25
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,830
that young boy.

26
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,870
Come with us.

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,480
- What is this?
- It was that bad?

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,980
I wonder.

29
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,850
What will happen now?

30
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,120
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,

31
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,090
- step down from your office!
- Step down!

32
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,420
Shin Yeo Jin, face your victims...

33
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,620
- and apologize!
- Apologize!

34
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,860
Shin Yeo Jin, face your victims...

35
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,790
- and apologize!
- Apologize!

36
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,960
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,

37
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,070
- step down from your office!
- Step down!

38
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,370
Shin Yeo Jin, face your victims...

39
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,300
- and apologize!
- Apologize!

40
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,510
Shin Yeo Jin!
How do you call yourself human?

41
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,240
Bring my business back!

42
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:17,910
Apologize now. Apologize!

43
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,480
Darn it.

44
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,550
- Give my money back!
- Mine, too!

45
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,550
- You're a piece of trash!
- Apologize!

46
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,120
- Apologize to me!
- You're a scumbag!

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,950
- You're a corporate raider!
- How will you compensate us?

48
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:31,760
- Bring my business back!
- Apologize!

49
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,320
Give my money back!

50
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,330
(Step down, Shin Yeo Jin!
Apologize and compensate right now!)

51
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,530
- Step down!
- Apologize!

52
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,030
- Apologize!
- You have to apologize!

53
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,130
- Let's go.
- Apologize!

54
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,270
Apologize to us!

55
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,770
- Let's go, Ms. Chairwoman.
- Apologize before you go!

56
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,270
- Do not leave!
- You!

57
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,310
- Stop right there, Shin!
- Hey!

58
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,940
Give my money back!

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,410
Stop right there!

60
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,950
- Apologize before you go!
- You!

61
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:57,220
I really hope
she admits to her crimes.

62
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,780
Is she capable
of finding such courage?

63
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,120
- Stop her!
- Chairwoman Shin!

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,620
Get her!

65
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,260
Do you admit to illegally raising
the interest rate...

66
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,760
for Youngshin Fashion's loan
during your Hyesung Finance years...

67
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,860
and pressuring them for recovery?

68
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,730
Do you also acknowledge that
you acquired Youngshin Fashion...

69
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,070
by significantly undervaluing its assets
through false disclosures...

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,640
at the time of its sale?

71
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,540
Then, this woman knew
Yu Jin was adopted...

72
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,880
and emigrated to America?

73
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,150
Yes.

74
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,650
She must've kept an eye
on her whereabouts since that time.

75
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,690
Yes, she must've known...

76
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,590
Yu Jin was back in Korea
seven years ago.

77
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,570
Du Na knew she had been
followed and watched in America,

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,070
so she returned secretly
while pregnant with Eun Chong.

79
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,340
I thought it was odd
that she was followed and watched.

80
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,370
Could all this be a coincidence?

81
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,140
That was why she couldn't add him
to her family register...

82
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:02,110
even after she gave birth.

83
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,080
Then, she got into
that hit-and-run accident.

84
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,590
- Reverend Mother.
- Yes?

85
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,760
Please...

86
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:17,960
do not share this with anyone
for a while,

87
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,300
not even with Ha Na.

88
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,870
I have no evidence that she was
involved in Yu Jin's accident,

89
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,640
so I must tread cautiously.

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,940
But I must share this with my wife.

91
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,520
Yeo Jin, I have something to say.

92
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,590
What? You're why I'm here right now.

93
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,130
It's about Yu Jin.

94
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,470
What are you trying to say
by bringing her into this?

95
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,330
I don't believe anything you say.

96
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,740
Don't ever let me see you again.

97
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,740
Please hear me out just this once.

98
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,570
Yu Jin was...

99
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,580
Sung Ho?

100
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,550
Are you okay, Yeo Jin?

101
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,320
What did they say?

102
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,990
The head of the legal team
will handle this.

103
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,260
Why did they make you suffer
for nothing?

104
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,830
Yeo Jin, we must be the first...

105
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,890
to put the Goo siblings
and Richard Han behind bars.

106
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,960
Let's go, Yeo Jin.

107
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,140
When did you meet Sung Ho?

108
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,310
Have you been seeing him all along?

109
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,550
I met him only recently.

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,050
Why didn't you tell me?

111
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,250
He wasn't someone
we'd be happy to see.

112
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,250
What had he been doing, and where?

113
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,060
Will he not come home?

114
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,130
Sung Ho can be very cold.

115
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,830
Anyway, how did he know
you were under investigation...

116
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,270
and found you at the police station?

117
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,810
Word must've gotten out.

118
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,770
Today's the founding anniversary,

119
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,480
so he must've seen everything
after coming to the hotel to visit her.

120
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,680
How can that warm-hearted man
change that coldly?

121
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,420
This is why we can't trust anyone.

122
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,890
Jin Goo wasn't
at the police station, either.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,350
He has changed.

124
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,490
He left me. He won't come anymore.

125
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,190
- Are you serious?
- Are you serious?

126
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,560
Only because you framed him
for the trouble at the audit?

127
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,000
But still, he should've been there.

128
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,970
What a disloyal punk.

129
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,470
You and Se Young are
the only ones left in my life.

130
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,610
It's the same for us, Yeo Jin.

131
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,540
No men had ever helped us anyway.

132
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:50,250
Yeo Jin is left with only us.

133
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,520
It's Uncle Sung Ho.

134
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,030
What should we do?

135
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,500
Don't let him in.

136
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,180
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please...

137
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,220
Yeo Jin, please hear me out.

138
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,360
Myung Ji might have been involved
in Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.

139
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,190
(Myung Ji might have been involved
in Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.)

140
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,770
Why does he want to talk to you?

141
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:43,430
He even came all the way
to the police station.

142
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,300
He wanted to talk about Yu Jin.

143
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,970
What about her?

144
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,170
She's probably an excuse...

145
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,380
to make me apologize
and reflect on myself.

146
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,710
I don't believe anything he says.

147
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,580
He's worse than strangers.

148
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,520
Does he know that
she died six years ago?

149
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,150
He does.

150
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,690
Did you tell him?

151
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,090
The hit-and-run accident is
the only thing he can talk about.

152
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,130
How did she get
to the security server?

153
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,770
It's protected
by two-factor authentication.

154
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,370
How did she get through
and take the confidential files?

155
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,710
It had to be an insider.

156
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,340
It must be Jin Goo.

157
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,450
He had been odd lately,

158
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,720
treating us like his enemies
since the wedding got called off.

159
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,350
Ha Na could've asked him for help.

160
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,350
I need to find out
who's behind this.

161
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,090
Of course.

162
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,160
Think of all the hard work
you put into Hyesung.

163
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,630
Nothing like this can
undermine your business.

164
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,030
Yeo Jin,
you must stay confident and brave,

165
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,260
especially in these times.

166
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,400
Yes, thank you.

167
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,770
Tell Ms. Jang to get ready to film
to express my position.

168
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,940
Okay.

169
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,610
Hello?

170
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,510
No.

171
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,980
It was a newspaper reporter.

172
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,960
Hello?

173
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,590
No one like that lives here.

174
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,800
Another reporter.

175
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,800
The phone will ring nonstop.

176
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,330
Pull the landline out.

177
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,870
Sung Ho showed up
at the police station after 20 years...

178
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,540
and said he had to talk to her
about Yu Jin.

179
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,610
This is an emergency.

180
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:32,210
Did he find out something
about the hit-and-run accident?

181
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,010
I didn't hear anything
about reinvestigating.

182
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,080
- Are you sure?
- I am, but let me check again.

183
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,150
Keep an eye on it.

184
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,520
I have a bad feeling about this.

185
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,660
We cannot let them meet.

186
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,920
Thankfully, Yeo Jin detests him.

187
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,190
He came home to see her,
but she didn't let him in...

188
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,460
and even turned her phone off.

189
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,230
First, take her phone away.

190
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,870
That's just a temporary measure.

191
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,270
We have to prevent them
from meeting and stall for time.

192
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,710
And in that while,
we'll come up with a countermeasure.

193
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,240
Okay.

194
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,480
Her corporate raiding activities are
a fact with clear evidence.

195
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,050
Will you sit around and allow
the top management...

196
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,520
to plunge Hyesung Group's image?

197
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,460
The stock prices are
already dropping.

198
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:24,360
This is the written demand
for her resignation.

199
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,470
If you give me your consent,
I will share our position...

200
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,230
with the press.

201
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,500
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin conducted
corporate raiding schemes...

202
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,770
from the past until this day
using tricky methods.

203
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,510
The number of her victims
continues to increase as we speak.

204
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,810
What does the victims' alliance want
from Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin?

205
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,950
We demand her immediate resignation,

206
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:46,880
an apology to the victims,
and compensation.

207
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,250
How much compensation do you expect?

208
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,020
A hundred million dollars
sounds reasonable.

209
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,790
On what ground
did you come to that amount?

210
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,160
Compared to the financial
and psychological torture...

211
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,530
the victims went through
until this day,

212
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,700
a hundred million dollars
didn't sound enough.

213
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,320
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

214
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,330
People are siding with you
after that interview.

215
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,570
I hope to keep this going
to punish the chairwoman...

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,070
and make her apologize
to the victims.

217
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,180
You must feel awful
when you think of her.

218
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,710
Honestly speaking, yes.

219
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,550
But I don't regret it.

220
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,280
I believe I did what I had to do.

221
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,880
I owe you everything.

222
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,590
She often uses
something meaningful to her...

223
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,460
or makes abbreviations.

224
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,560
Something meaningful?

225
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,500
The most significant thing
in her life now must be Eun Chong.

226
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,400
Right?

227
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,540
- Could it be that?
- What?

228
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:17,310
The present
your parents left behind.

229
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,980
The present my parents left behind?

230
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,510
I heard Eun Chong kept saying that thing
after you left...

231
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:26,350
because it helped him live in peace.

232
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,350
And the chairwoman
also liked that saying.

233
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,890
No rain, no flowers?

234
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,560
Yes.

235
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,610
Hey.

236
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:51,840
We got in.

237
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,610
I don't think it was me.

238
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,920
Your parents must've helped you.

239
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,420
- My parents?
- Everything will go well.

240
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:06,990
Yes.

241
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,090
One second.

242
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,130
Yes, sir. I'm at work.

243
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,000
Right now?

244
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,540
If that's true, we could question
if Se Young's mom was...

245
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,850
involved
in your daughter's accident.

246
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,680
Yes, so I went to the police station
to talk to Yeo Jin,

247
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,350
but I couldn't do it
because Myung Ji was there.

248
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,890
She wouldn't open the door for me
even when I went home,

249
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,590
and she wouldn't read texts
or take calls.

250
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,960
I'll talk to her.

251
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,690
Thank you.

252
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,830
There's no evidence,

253
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,370
but both Eun Chong
and Yeo Jin can fall into danger...

254
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,840
if this turns out to be true.

255
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,840
So, I want to keep this between us.

256
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,680
Will you keep this from Ha Na, too?

257
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,310
Yes, until I find the evidence.

258
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,150
Okay. Let me call her first.

259
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,660
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

260
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,790
It's turned off.

261
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,660
I'll call Ms. Jang.

262
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,300
She won't pick up.

263
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:25,500
I'll visit her at home...

264
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,100
and get back to you.

265
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,470
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin
of Hyesung Group...

266
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,280
was charged
with corporate raiding...

267
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,010
and was immediately arrested
at their 30th-anniversary event.

268
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,280
The chairwoman was
immediately arrested?

269
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,150
Her victims' interviews were played
during the anniversary event,

270
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:44,420
exposing every detail
of her past corporate raiding attempts...

271
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,890
and putting many people in shock.

272
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,030
- My gosh. That's the chairwoman.
- However, Hyesung Group is...

273
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,960
denying all charges.

274
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,270
The authenticity of the evidence
turned in by the victims...

275
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,700
would likely become
the key issue of this investigation.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
My goodness. Is that Jin Goo?

277
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
- Step down!
- Step down!

278
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,110
I'm now standing
in front of Hyesung Group,

279
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,680
where corporate raid victims
are protesting.

280
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
(Chairwoman Shin Arrested
Amidst the Victims' Protest)

281
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,510
Chairwoman Shin was...

282
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,150
even showered with eggs
during her arrest.

283
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,180
Look at Mr. Hwang
trying to protect her.

284
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,050
I can't believe
she was a corporate raider.

285
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:19,560
My sweet little business
almost suffered like them.

286
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,360
- Should we go and protest?
- Yes!

287
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,400
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin conducted...

288
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,630
- corporate raiding schemes...
- What?

289
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,800
- It's Ha Na.
- from the past until this day...

290
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,000
using tricky methods.

291
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:33,170
The number of her victims
continues to increase as we speak.

292
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,710
- What? Why is she the head...
- We demand...

293
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,210
- of the victims' alliance?
- her immediate resignation,

294
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,680
- I wonder.
- apology to the victims,

295
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:39,180
- What is this situation?
- and compensation.

296
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,680
How much compensation do you expect?

297
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,280
A hundred million dollars
sounds reasonable.

298
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,680
"A hundred million dollars?"

299
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,890
Mr. Goo is meeting
with the directors...

300
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,160
and trying to demand
your resignation.

301
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,160
How are things with the board?

302
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,090
They do not seem shaken up,

303
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,030
but the public sentiment
will play a significant role.

304
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,330
I'll upload your video statement
as soon as it's edited...

305
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,100
so it distracts the public.

306
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:06,440
How did she get the password
and get her hands on the files?

307
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,240
Who told her?

308
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:15,280
Yeo Jin, reporters are flooding
the front of our home.

309
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,150
Things are becoming uncomfortable.

310
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,650
Has the head of the legal team come?

311
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,390
The investigation
must be taking a while.

312
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,690
Where have you been?

313
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,960
I went out and met Director Choi.

314
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,530
We have to keep the directors in line
just in case.

315
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,730
Mr. Goo had already made his move.

316
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,170
- Keep an eye on the directors.
- Yes, ma'am.

317
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,170
Eun Chong is coming home
from his camp today.

318
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,640
How will he get in
with all those reporters?

319
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,840
- Make sure he's not seen.
- Yes, ma'am.

320
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,310
Mr. Kim, the driver,
will escort him through the back.

321
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:51,550
I need to take her phone away first.

322
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,530
It's Jin Goo.

323
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,830
I don't want to meet anybody.

324
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,100
The chairwoman
doesn't wish to meet anyone.

325
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,310
- Go home.
- Please open the door.

326
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,610
This is important.

327
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,180
What is it?

328
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,310
Is it about work?

329
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,920
Tell me. I'll relay it to her.

330
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,420
No.

331
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,250
He sounds suspicious, too.

332
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,990
What's something important
he can't share with me?

333
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,660
I can't let both Sung Ho
and Jin Goo keep calling her.

334
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,570
It's powered off.

335
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,110
Did Sung Ho send Jin Goo here?

336
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,650
Is this really
about the hit-and-run accident?

337
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,490
Ms. Jang,
are you with the chairwoman?

338
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,790
Please let me speak to her.

339
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,560
It's something important
about her daughter.

340
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,800
One second.

341
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,700
It's Mr. Hwang.

342
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,900
He has important information
about your daughter.

343
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,140
What is it?

344
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,310
Mr. Yoon heard an update
on Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.

345
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,580
I don't believe him.

346
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,280
He was the reason
for my humiliation today.

347
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,150
Tell him...

348
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,990
never to call me again.

349
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,760
The director nun
returned from Canada,

350
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,760
and he heard it from her.

351
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,530
You need to meet Mr. Yoon soon.

352
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,430
Eun Chong may fall into danger.

353
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,130
What about him?

354
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,530
You should hear it from him.

355
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,370
And do not share this with anyone...

356
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,840
other than Ms. Jang.

357
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,510
We were victims
of her corporate raid?

358
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,020
Yes.

359
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,750
She bankrupted Dad's business
and took it from him.

360
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,890
- What?
- What?

361
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,990
We went under because of her?

362
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,130
All that trouble
we went through as children...

363
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,230
was because of her?

364
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,760
- Yes.
- No way.

365
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,100
I can't believe this.

366
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,600
Did she really do that to Dad's...

367
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,970
Was that why you two
got revenge on her?

368
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,840
I found out just recently.

369
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,410
Ji Seok had gone through a lot
trying to avenge them alone.

370
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,750
- Ji Seok...
- What is this twisted fate?

371
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,220
This means she's our worst enemy.

372
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,920
What does that make Eun Chong?

373
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,790
Have we been raising
our enemy's blood?

374
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,790
Ha Na, if Eun Chong's grandma
took our dad's business,

375
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,730
it'd make him our enemy, too.

376
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,430
What are you going to do?

377
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,800
I couldn't believe it, either.

378
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,130
I didn't want to.

379
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,640
I'll think about him
after I get my revenge.

380
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,810
Think about what?
He's our enemy's blood.

381
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,940
Cut ties with him right away.

382
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,910
Don't do anything stupid again.

383
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,510
That was why
you kept telling her to let him go.

384
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,420
- He was our enemy's blood.
- Yes.

385
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
What kind of awful situation
is this?

386
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,390
She wasn't just repaying
kindness with evil.

387
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,490
This kind of insanity is
beyond imagination!

388
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,930
It must've felt so unfair
to our parents.

389
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,500
Then, did our parents
get into that accident...

390
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,430
because of the shock
after hearing what she did?

391
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,910
Yes, right.

392
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,620
I couldn't bring up...

393
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,990
that their accident was
also rigged...

394
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,320
by the chairwoman.

395
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,990
We can find
a chance to tell them later.

396
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,030
How's the board responding?

397
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,130
It's 50-50.

398
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:35,630
But what she did was serious,
so she'd resign soon.

399
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,070
Nice job with the interview.

400
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,770
I somehow ended up
as the head of the victims' alliance.

401
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,680
You seemed trustworthy.

402
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,210
Thank you.

403
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,280
Yes, I'll wait. Bye.

404
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,820
Mr. Han, where have you been?

405
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,150
I saw the article
on their anniversary event.

406
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,820
- Did everything go as planned?
- Yes.

407
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,090
Ha Na, Ji Seok.
You have to see this.

408
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,660
This crazy hag is pure evil.

409
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:09,700
The claim that Hyesung Group
expanded our business...

410
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,440
through illegal
corporate raids is...

411
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,070
not the truth.

412
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,740
This kind of slander
doesn't just affect me,

413
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,940
but it tarnishes and damages...

414
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,750
the pride and hard work
of every staff of Hyesung.

415
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,280
As the chairwoman of Hyesung Group,

416
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,050
I stand here to protect
the honor of all staff.

417
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:33,160
I wish to sue the group...

418
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,730
that slanders Hyesung Group
for defamation.

419
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,700
"Slander? Defamation?"

420
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,300
She's now suing the victims
on top of everything?

421
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,200
I didn't expect her to do this.

422
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,470
The comments are worse.

423
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,070
"Chairwoman Shin seems
more down-to-earth than I thought."

424
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,140
"Someone like her
wouldn't do corporate raids."

425
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,150
My gosh. "Ms. Chairwoman,
you're gorgeous. Stay strong."

426
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,420
"The chairwoman looks stunning
even in this situation."

427
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,190
Have they all gone mad?

428
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:05,460
They've paid people
to write these comments!

429
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,260
How can she not show remorse
even after seeing the evidence?

430
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:11,500
This is her way of saying
she'll fight until the end.

431
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,500
The public sentiment will turn over.

432
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,470
- What should we do?
- If I could do as I please,

433
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,470
I want to kidnap Eun Chong
and get our revenge on her.

434
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:28,450
Grandma, there are
so many people in front of our home.

435
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,620
- Did they see you?
- No.

436
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,590
Mr. Kim held me in his arms
and came in through the back door.

437
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,950
Good.

438
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,660
- Did you have fun at the camp?
- Yes.

439
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,530
One of the instructors
looked just like my mommy.

440
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,130
Your mommy?

441
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,330
Yes, she also had very long hair...

442
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,730
and huge eyes.

443
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,140
I see.

444
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:57,310
Auntie Ha Na said
my mommy was good at English,

445
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,880
and she was good at it, too.

446
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,780
I see.

447
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,420
Yeo Jin, I have something to say.

448
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,220
It's about Yu Jin.

449
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,690
Please hear me out just this once.

450
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,490
Yu Jin was...

451
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,720
Mr. Yoon heard an update
on Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.

452
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,930
You need to meet Mr. Yoon soon.

453
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,100
Eun Chong may fall into danger.

454
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,100
Eun Chong, you should get changed.

455
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,300
- Do you want to wash up with me?
- Okay.

456
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,540
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

457
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,840
Come this way.

458
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,980
Let's go.

459
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,720
Ms. Chairwoman,
it's the head of the legal team.

460
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,620
What if it goes over
to the prosecution?

461
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,890
The files they have as evidence
are mostly old,

462
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,360
so you should cooperate,

463
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,990
but it's more advantageous
to stay silent.

464
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,330
I'll try to end this
with a probation.

465
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,800
What about the company?

466
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,800
The public responded positively
after your statement.

467
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,570
The security team
already handled the protesters,

468
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:00,200
and the stock price is
slowly recovering, too.

469
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,180
How dare they try to topple me over?

470
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,880
Director Goo is trying to persuade
shareholders and the board,

471
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,180
but I haven't spotted
any unusual movements.

472
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,050
The public will stand with you...

473
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,190
as long as you cooperate
with the prosecution investigation.

474
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,690
Good.

475
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,190
The claim that Hyesung Group
expanded our business...

476
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:25,260
through illegal corporate raids
is not the truth.

477
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,930
If you look at this video,

478
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,270
- it seems like she was...
- This kind of slander...

479
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,400
- falsely charged.
- doesn't just affect me,

480
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,600
- Who's telling the truth?
- but it tarnishes and damages...

481
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,600
- She conducted those raids.
- the pride and hard work...

482
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,870
- And Ha Na's family was the victim.
- of every staff of Hyesung.

483
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,980
- Fate can be so cruel.
- As the chairwoman of Hyesung,

484
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,610
- But people who don't know that...
- I stand here...

485
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,250
- will probably believe her.
- to protect...

486
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,250
- She's a good actor.
- the honor of all staff.

487
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,850
I wish to sue the group
that slanders...

488
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,590
- Why has she changed like this?
- Hyesung Group for defamation.

489
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,860
She wasn't like this
before she lost her daughter.

490
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,760
Did she just feel empty?

491
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,560
I stormed out of her place...

492
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,700
like I'd never see her again.

493
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,870
But I feel bad
to see her in this awful scandal.

494
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,970
This is worse for her.

495
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,710
She should admit to her crimes
and apologize quickly.

496
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,080
You're right.

497
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,810
It's better to deal
with your mistakes early on.

498
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,480
I think the public is with my aunt.

499
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,820
We have to keep an eye
on the board and shareholders, too.

500
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,260
It would've been a perfect chance...

501
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,120
to place you in her position
if she stepped down.

502
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,790
Me?

503
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,800
You're the only one left
of the owner's family.

504
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,070
Eun Chong can't do this. He's eight.

505
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,130
I would've driven her out
and placed you there...

506
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,900
if you weren't disciplined.

507
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,940
Really? Gosh, what a shame.

508
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,280
Anyway, I doubt
Aunt Yeo Jin will step down.

509
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,180
She'll step down someday.

510
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,160
My phone is gone.

511
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,770
Are you sure
you left it in your room?

512
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:13,070
I thought it was in my bag,
but it wasn't there.

513
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,480
Call Jin Goo
and get Sung Ho's number.

514
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,780
Will you meet him?

515
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,650
I should.

516
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,360
Thank you for coming.

517
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,160
What's the update on Yu Jin?

518
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,610
So, Myung Ji already knew
about Yu Jin's adoption...

519
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,340
and her move to America?

520
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:53,980
She knew everything,

521
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,110
yet she kept it from me?

522
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Yes, and she probably
tracked her down...

523
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,720
even after Yu Jin went to America.

524
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,890
She probably knew Yu Jin was
back in Korea seven years ago.

525
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,910
Are you okay?

526
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,040
Everything...

527
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,610
- you just said was true, right?
- Yes.

528
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,620
The director nun from Canada
confirmed that it was Myung Ji.

529
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,790
Why did she interfere
with my search for Yu Jin?

530
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,230
She looked for her
as desperately as I did.

531
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,700
So, everything was a lie?

532
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,770
Se Young could've been involved
in Yu Jin's disappearance,

533
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,240
or she would've wanted
Hyesung Group.

534
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,110
Without Yu Jin,
it could go to Se Young.

535
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,280
I must
kick them out of my house now.

536
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,380
No, Yeo Jin.
You must keep your cool.

537
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,550
We don't know anything for sure.

538
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,820
She deceived and betrayed us
for the last 20 years.

539
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,990
How can I just let her go on?

540
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,420
We need to find the evidence.

541
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,890
Eun Chong may fall into danger...

542
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,890
if we attack her
without preparation.

543
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,260
What about him?

544
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,900
This is just a supposition,

545
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,970
but we must consider
the possibility...

546
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,470
that Myung Ji was involved
in Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident.

547
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,040
Even Yu Jin's accident?

548
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,710
We must be open
to every possibility.

549
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,560
Right before her death,

550
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,230
Yu Jin had said she felt like
she had found her mother's home.

551
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,600
- Really?
- She got into that car accident...

552
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,870
on her way to meet the landlady.

553
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,740
Do you think...

554
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,280
that landlady could be...

555
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,750
It could be Myung Ji.

556
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:15,290
But we don't have the evidence yet,
so don't show these feelings.

557
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,750
These circumstances are
more than enough.

558
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:20,190
I can't forgive her.
I'm kicking her out right away.

559
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,760
Eun Chong will fall into danger
if she notices your suspicion.

560
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,000
Keep your cool
until we find the evidence.

561
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,560
You have to.

562
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,620
I'll bring warm water
and a calming pill.

563
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,830
Did she really deceive me
for the last 20 years?

564
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,470
The way she desperately
looked for Yu Jin was...

565
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,230
nothing but an act?

566
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,580
Yeo Jin, did you go out?

567
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,780
I met with some reporters
with the press.

568
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,860
Yeo Jin.

569
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,600
You knew about Yu Jin's adoption...

570
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,370
and her move to America.
Why did you keep it from me?

571
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,140
Why did you deceive me? Why?

572
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,090
(Cinderella Game)

573
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,700
She was the thief.

574
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,200
Se Young and her mother told Ha Na
about the fake daughter project.

575
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,700
She was after Hyesung.

576
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,940
I must kick her out immediately.

577
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,210
I need to consider that last move
as the final resort.

578
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,970
And why don't you resign
for Eun Chong's sake?

579
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,510
Everything came down to this,
so hold onto Ji Seok.

580
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,810
I hear you'll be the next CEO.

581
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:59,520
You are the worst.

582
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,990
You'll pay for everything you did
before your death.
