1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,180
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,650
(Episode 67)

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,650
Do you...

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,920
really want me to marry Se Young?

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,320
Yes.

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:16,820
I...

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,290
like you, Ha Na.

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,230
If possible,

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,870
I want to marry you.

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,840
You're the one I have feelings for.

13
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,370
I'm not trying
to put pressure on you.

14
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,870
But I...

15
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,140
wanted to share
my feelings with you.

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,480
Do you really want me to marry...

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,950
Se Young?

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,460
Yes, marry her.

19
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,460
That's what I want.

20
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,950
Ha Na.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,980
Is there another reason...

22
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,790
why I must marry Se Young?

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,990
Can you unmake me
as her fake daughter?

24
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:29,360
Can you bring Eun Chong back to me?

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,400
I'll do it.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,470
I told the chairwoman
I was also responsible...

27
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:34,930
for what happened to you two.

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,370
And I said I'd let you two meet.

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,870
Will she allow it?

30
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,010
It'd be much faster
for you to marry Se Young.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,550
I heard you'd adopt Eun Chong
once you married her.

32
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,420
Then, you can show him to me...

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:56,620
as his dad.

34
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,990
Just do that for me.

35
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,330
I don't want anything else.

36
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,350
I met Mr. Hwang
and told him to marry you.

37
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,890
- What did he say?
- You can get the answer yourself.

38
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,790
I did my best.
You better keep your promise, too.

39
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,430
All right.

40
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,300
Goo Ha Na said she told him.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,570
I think it went well.

42
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,700
Yes, it needs to go well.

43
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:02,920
Do you really want me
to marry Se Young?

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,560
Yes, marry her.

45
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,630
That's what I want.

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,330
I heard you'd adopt Eun Chong
once you married her.

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,040
Then, you can show him to me
as his dad.

48
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,380
He'll have new parents,

49
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,590
so it's better
to cut his ties with Goo Ha Na.

50
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,660
Eun Chong thinks of Ms. Goo
as his mother.

51
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,630
How can you separate him
from his mom for a new mother?

52
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,630
She didn't start off as his mother.

53
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,300
Se Young will do a great job, too.

54
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,130
Do you trust her and her mother?

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,000
Those two stayed by my side
in that house...

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,440
after you and Yu Jin left me.

57
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,040
Why won't you ever consider
how I feel,

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,210
both 20 years ago and right now?

59
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,650
My heart still aches...

60
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,990
whenever I think of Yu Jin.

61
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:10,250
I finally managed
to keep Eun Chong by my side,

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,460
yet you wanted me to let him go?

63
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,320
It's just your obsession.

64
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,630
- It just moved on from Yu Jin to...
- That's enough.

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,800
It may seem like that to you,
but that's love for me.

66
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,570
If you were
such a noble and loving man,

67
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,640
how could you abandon me
and wander for the last 20 years?

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,210
If you have time
to tell me this nonsense,

69
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:31,540
find out why Yu Jin died
in a hit-and-run accident.

70
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,580
That's the least you can do for her.

71
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,950
Yes, I'll find out the truth
behind her death.

72
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,750
I've been looking into it.

73
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,620
What have you found out?

74
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,030
There was no lead
in the police case file.

75
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,230
I think the police are involved.

76
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,130
The contaminated DNA
led me to that conclusion, too.

77
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,070
You thought
the police might be involved?

78
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:01,910
The culprit may come after Eun Chong
if a reinvestigation opens,

79
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,080
so we have to move quietly...

80
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,340
until we find a new lead
or evidence.

81
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,980
Can you find a new lead?

82
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,150
If this was someone who knew Yu Jin,

83
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,020
the culprit must've gone to
the children's home she grew up in.

84
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,650
I plan to look
for the staff members...

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,720
who were there with Yu Jin.

86
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,030
First, find the director nun
who lives in Canada.

87
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,230
I couldn't reach her.

88
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,330
I've been looking into it.

89
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,400
I'll look into Yu Jin's accident,

90
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,630
so please do not sin anymore.

91
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,840
I didn't sin in any way!

92
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,240
You forcibly separated
Eun Chong from Ms. Goo.

93
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,780
And you still raid businesses
and trample on the weak.

94
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,180
Is it a sin to protect my grandson?

95
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,710
Please stop hurting others...

96
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,150
for Eun Chong's sake.

97
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,720
Why won't you ever take my side?

98
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,590
You're still the same
as you were 13 years ago.

99
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,760
Is it that hard to tell me
a single warm-hearted remark?

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,130
I was a fool for coming here,
expecting you would've changed.

101
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,240
Yeo Jin.

102
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,010
When will you and I...

103
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,980
sit across from each other
and smile in peace?

104
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,130
Jin Goo, come and sit with me.

105
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,510
Hey, have you been drinking?

106
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,670
Just one drink.

107
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,580
- Mom.
- Jin Goo.

108
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,380
It's my desperate wish.

109
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:52,680
Can you please give up on this idea?

110
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,590
If you call
the engagement off like this,

111
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,820
people will say you're leaving
your pregnant fiancée...

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,960
and breaking off the engagement
because of another woman.

113
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,960
This must be my punishment.

114
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,370
I was already troubled
for doing this to Ha Na,

115
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,570
but I felt even worse
to see her so miserable.

116
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,770
So, what will you do?

117
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:19,080
Will you marry her or not?

118
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,590
I like you, Ha Na.

119
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,290
If possible,

120
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,990
I want to marry you.

121
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,800
Do you really want me
to marry Se Young?

122
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,870
I didn't hear anything.
It was nonsense.

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,940
Just forget it.

124
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,160
Ha Na.

125
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,730
I'll keep my promise.

126
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,740
Returning Eun Chong to you
will be...

127
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:24,940
my mission.

128
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,490
- You'll marry her?
- Yes.

129
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,390
Why did you change your mind?

130
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,690
If I adopt Eun Chong,

131
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,130
I'll have his custody
and rights as his dad, right?

132
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,570
Yes.

133
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,400
Then, I have a term
as Eun Chong's future father.

134
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,010
I'll let him meet...

135
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,740
with Ha Na once a week
for his happiness.

136
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,940
You can't do that.

137
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:01,210
If you won't let me do that
even though I'll be his dad,

138
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,250
it sounds like
you want me to be a puppet.

139
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,690
- Once a month.
- That's for his high school years.

140
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,660
I'll let them meet today.

141
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:15,490
Are you marrying her for Goo Ha Na?

142
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,660
Please think of this as something
for Eun Chong and Ha Na.

143
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,880
He took back his words.
You're getting married!

144
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,660
Se Young.

145
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,440
Why are you here?

146
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,270
Did you come to stress me out?

147
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,110
I heard you couldn't eat anything
because of morning sickness.

148
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,510
Why do you care?

149
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,510
Let's get married.

150
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,150
Are you serious?

151
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,220
I told the chairwoman
and your mother.

152
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,330
Why are you crying?

153
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,930
Do I have to thank you...

154
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
for saving me
from a failed engagement?

155
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,370
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,380
I feel so miserable.

157
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,280
Our baby must feel the same way.

158
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:47,280
I'll do my best
as a dad and a husband.

159
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,920
Can I take your word for it?

160
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,220
Yes.

161
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:54,990
I'll also do my best as a mom...

162
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,530
and a wife.

163
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,230
Give me a hug.

164
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,340
No?

165
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,750
We should move up the wedding.

166
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,820
Se Young needs to be in her gown
before her stomach gets bigger.

167
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,690
You can talk to Jin Goo
and make a decision.

168
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,190
Okay.

169
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,070
We were talking
about moving up the wedding.

170
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,930
You two should have it...

171
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,140
before Se Young's stomach
gets bigger.

172
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,770
Let's do that, Jin Goo.

173
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,740
We just have to move it up
by a month.

174
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,610
I'll talk to your mother.

175
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:48,450
Okay. I'm going out with Eun Chong.

176
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
- Are you taking him to Goo Ha Na?
- Yes.

177
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,680
Please let him go, Yeo Jin.

178
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,520
It'll help
with Eun Chong's treatment.

179
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,750
You should do that, Yeo Jin.

180
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,090
It has been a while
since we heard him laugh.

181
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,490
We should let him do that
so he can laugh again.

182
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,000
- Don't stay out too late.
- I won't.

183
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,900
When are you seeing the doctor?
I'll go with you.

184
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,440
What? Sure. Okay.

185
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,390
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

186
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,700
Are you all right?

187
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,800
I heard you were quite unwell.

188
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,870
- I'm sorry.
- I'm fine now.

189
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm here with you.

190
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,240
Let's have so much fun today. Okay?

191
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,310
Okay.

192
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,210
Jump!

193
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,880
- My gosh.
- You're going up too high!

194
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,250
That was awesome.

195
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,590
- Are you okay?
- That hurt.

196
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,990
Eun Chong, jump higher!

197
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,130
- Higher. Even higher!
- Yes!

198
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,270
I already bribed a doctor.

199
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,300
You'll get regular updates
on the sonogram, too.

200
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,970
Yes, you can go with Jin Goo.

201
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,440
He won't stay
for the ultrasound, right?

202
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,010
I doubt it.

203
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,910
If he wants to go to another clinic,

204
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,220
tell him that this clinic
lets your doctor...

205
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,350
- also oversee the delivery.
- Okay.

206
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,590
Read some books
on childbirth, too.

207
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,860
Fine.

208
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,630
Eun Chong is at a kids' cafe, right?

209
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,560
You should go there, too.

210
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm too tired, and I'm pregnant.

211
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,730
You have to be his mom.

212
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,500
Will you let Goo Ha Na do it?

213
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,710
You won't let her
continue to meet him, right?

214
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,980
I'll come up with an excuse
to stop her from seeing him...

215
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,640
after you two marry.

216
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:05,120
Do not forget that you're pregnant.

217
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:08,490
You cannot drink coffee or alcohol.

218
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,620
Fine.

219
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,920
Go, now.

220
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,700
- Hey! Someone get Eun Chong!
- Stop it!

221
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,800
Get Eun Chong!

222
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,030
Eun Chong, I'm coming for you!

223
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,840
I'll get you!

224
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,440
Come here.

225
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,150
My gosh.

226
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,050
Are you okay?

227
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,760
Take this!

228
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,670
Hey, you!

229
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,640
Come here.

230
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,970
Hey, come back here.

231
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,940
"Goo Ha Na has schizophrenia
and delusional disorder?"

232
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,480
It was found on the computer
the head of the legal team used.

233
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,710
"Goo Ha Na believed
she was Lee Du Na,"

234
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,180
"Hyesung's daughter,
and raised Lee Eun Chong."

235
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,850
"She approached
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin..."

236
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,090
"to turn this delusion
into reality..."

237
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,960
"by fabricating
the parentage test result."

238
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,260
Chairwoman Shin...

239
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,270
made Ha Na look schizophrenic?

240
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,370
Yes, she must've had that ready to
put her in a mental institution...

241
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,810
in case she insisted
on keeping his custody.

242
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,880
Shin Yeo Jin.

243
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:50,250
Hey! No!

244
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,660
Eun Chong has
such an energetic laugh.

245
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,630
Yes, he's such a happy and fun kid.

246
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,670
What do you think you're doing?

247
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,370
You continue to show
this rude behavior.

248
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,710
Why are you here?

249
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,840
- You may leave.
- Yes, ma'am.

250
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,380
I warned you.

251
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,990
I wouldn't hold myself back
if you messed with Ha Na again.

252
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,060
That if we got into a fight,

253
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,230
you'd have much more to lose.

254
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,700
You planned to stash her
into a mental institution...

255
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,000
by making her appear schizophrenic.

256
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,640
I did?

257
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,710
That's news to me.

258
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,610
She raised your grandson
like he was her own...

259
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,920
when he was left alone
after your daughter died.

260
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,620
Wasn't it enough to use her
and abandon her as a fake daughter?

261
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,320
She abandoned me and Eun Chong.

262
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,360
She walked out of my place.
How is that me abandoning her?

263
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:05,530
Aren't you human?

264
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,370
Then, act like one!

265
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,140
Do not mess with Ha Na anymore...

266
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,380
unless you wish
to kill your grandson yourself.

267
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,380
Shut up!

268
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,550
How dare you say that
about my grandson?

269
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,520
Did you think you'd survive here
at Hyesung after saying those words?

270
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,990
Go ahead and kick me out, then.

271
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:32,190
You brutally trampled all over
someone who raised your grandson.

272
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,030
You'd treat a mere investor like me
like I was a piece of trash.

273
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,190
Get out of here. Now.

274
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:40,260
You'd never be forgiven...

275
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,070
by my family,

276
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,600
Du Na, and even Eun Chong!

277
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,040
In the end, you'll always be alone.

278
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,140
You won't get to see
Eun Chong again.

279
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,810
You won't be able to reach him...

280
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,280
or get an answer when you call him.
You will lose...

281
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,190
what's the most precious to you...

282
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,920
and end up alone.

283
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,360
Just like the time...

284
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,960
when you lost your daughter
and were left alone.

285
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,240
Shut your mouth.

286
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,040
Who cares if you have
millions of dollars?

287
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:26,080
What you deem as precious...

288
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,580
will never remain in your life.

289
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,450
I will witness...

290
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:37,190
your miserable end...

291
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,460
with my own eyes.

292
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:00,810
Ms. Chairwoman!

293
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,820
Director Goo...

294
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,120
found out about
Goo Ha Na's psychiatric diagnosis.

295
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,590
What?

296
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,020
Only the head of the legal team
and we know about that.

297
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,530
Did he hack his computer?

298
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,960
The mastermind behind him,
Richard Han, is my biggest risk.

299
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,770
He found out
about my corporate raids, too.

300
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
That's why he's acting up like that.

301
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,680
I'll see if there's an update
on Richard Han.

302
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,390
Eun Chong,
why don't you sit next to me?

303
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,430
I want to sit next to Auntie Ha Na.

304
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,830
I see.

305
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,570
Here.

306
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:01,840
Eun Chong, why don't you try
sitting next to Auntie Se Young?

307
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,380
You love all these, Eun Chong.

308
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,160
Do you feel unwell?

309
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,290
I'm fine.

310
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,760
Eat up, Eun Chong.

311
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,640
I can do this from now on.

312
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,410
Eun Chong, look at me.

313
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,120
They'll be good parents...

314
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,690
when they adopt Eun Chong, right?

315
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,530
What's wrong?

316
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,930
I want to sit with Auntie Ha Na.

317
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:11,740
Oh, my. Look at the time.

318
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,680
It's the first day, so my aunt will
be happy if he comes home on time.

319
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,250
Right?

320
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,280
- Okay.
- It's a shame,

321
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,720
but you'll see him next week.

322
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:23,390
Let's do that, Eun Chong.

323
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,020
No, I want to hang out some more
with Auntie Ha Na.

324
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,060
Can I sleep over at your house?

325
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,100
You can sleep over next time
after you get permission...

326
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,370
from your grandmother.

327
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,340
I don't want to go home.

328
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,470
You'll meet her again
after six days.

329
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,880
This isn't going to work.
You should go first.

330
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,550
Okay.

331
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,620
Bye, now.

332
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,820
Auntie Ha Na...

333
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,190
No rain, no flowers.

334
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,000
"No rain, no flowers?"

335
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,800
Go now.

336
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,500
I'll see you again after six days.

337
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,480
- Auntie Ha Na...
- Get him.

338
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,580
Auntie Ha Na...

339
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,860
Auntie Ha Na...

340
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,490
Let's have even more fun
when you meet her next week.

341
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,830
Okay?

342
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,860
- Auntie Ha Na...
- It's okay.

343
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,800
Auntie Ha Na...

344
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,900
Just be quiet.

345
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,600
It wasn't like
they were separated forever.

346
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,100
Auntie Ha Na...

347
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,140
Yoon Se Young's mom
and Hwang Jin Goo's mom came?

348
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,840
Yes, and Yoon Se Young's mom
poured water on her,

349
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,010
but Ha Na did the same to her.
Isn't that great?

350
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,510
Why didn't you tell me?

351
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,120
She told me not to.

352
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,750
Where is she right now?

353
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,790
She's out with Eun Chong.

354
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,760
She went to see Eun Chong?

355
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,090
Hwang Jin Goo let her see him.

356
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:12,300
Why won't any of you listen to me?

357
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,140
What's with him?

358
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,340
Hey, what are you doing
to Eun Chong's stuff?

359
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,480
You also need to get over him...

360
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,780
unless you want to regret it later.

361
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,820
What are you doing?

362
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,690
You have to throw these out.

363
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,390
Why are you throwing out
Eun Chong's stuff?

364
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,160
I heard Yoon Se Young's mom
harassed you again.

365
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,230
Yet you were out
with Eun Chong again?

366
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,900
- Give that to me.
- Let it go.

367
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,000
- Give it back!
- Let it go!

368
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,100
Give it back!

369
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,480
What are you doing?

370
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,920
I should've separated you from him
when Lee Du Na died.

371
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,250
Stop it.

372
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,120
- What am I going to do?
- Do you know who he is?

373
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,990
He's my son! Happy now?

374
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,600
Your son? My foot.

375
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,530
Throw out everything
that belongs to Eun Chong...

376
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,500
unless you want to regret everything
before our parents.

377
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,370
That's enough, Ji Seok.

378
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,970
Yes, stop it, Ji Seok.

379
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,970
Do not get involved with them
ever again!

380
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:34,140
Don't go to their place,
and stop seeing Eun Chong, too.

381
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,350
If you see him again, then...

382
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,670
Why is he doing this
to Eun Chong and me?

383
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,250
That wasn't like you.

384
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,050
Is something going on?

385
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,590
Chairwoman Shin...

386
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,990
has a plan
to make her appear schizophrenic...

387
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,600
and send her
to a mental institution.

388
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:28,100
Are you serious?

389
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,530
I just can't forgive that woman.

390
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,270
I don't get it.

391
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,070
Why would she do this
to someone who raised her grandson?

392
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,640
This woman can make
even someone like you mad.

393
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,580
If she got caught doing this,

394
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,720
- she'd come up with plan B.
- Yes.

395
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,120
I won't sit around...

396
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,360
and let her meet Eun Chong
for her safety.

397
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,430
I'll stop her.

398
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,730
You had a lot of fun today,

399
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,200
so you'd sleep very well, Eun Chong.

400
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,700
I'll meet her again...

401
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,070
after six days.

402
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,580
Can I sleep over...

403
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,250
at my auntie's place
when I meet her next time?

404
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,120
I can't?

405
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,560
Let him continue to meet Ms. Goo
even if you raise him.

406
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,190
That way,
he'll grow up as a healthier boy.

407
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,530
What if his depression worsens?

408
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,830
He lost his mother overnight.

409
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,970
He has the psychology
of a missing child.

410
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,210
Then, can you eat well,

411
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,410
sleep well, and listen to me...

412
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,910
until you meet Auntie Ha Na?

413
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,910
Yes, I promise.

414
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,350
It's a promise.

415
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,950
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

416
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,120
- Okay.
- Good.

417
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,670
Eun Chong is coming over tomorrow,

418
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,900
and he's craving gimbap.

419
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
Ji Chang will bring tteokbokki
and fried chicken.

420
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:19,310
How did that evil witch
come to this decision?

421
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,180
Let's keep it quiet from Ji Seok.

422
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,650
He might run over again.

423
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:29,020
Oh, right. I heard Yoon Se Young was
marrying Hwang Jin Goo next month.

424
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,190
She got pregnant.

425
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,720
They must be rushing it
before her tummy gets bigger.

426
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,970
You're the one I have feelings for.

427
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,940
I'm not trying
to put pressure on you.

428
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,670
But I wanted to share
my feelings with you.

429
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,610
He's Eun Chong's dad now.

430
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,780
Nothing more, nothing less.

431
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:09,560
What is this?

432
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,530
- A wedding invitation?
- I'm getting married.

433
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,510
I thought it was called off.
What happened?

434
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,040
I'm pregnant.

435
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,650
It's been two months.

436
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,150
You aren't the dad, so don't worry.

437
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:34,420
The baby came in perfect timing.
What a great child.

438
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,820
So, you won't need me anymore
after you marry?

439
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,820
I do.

440
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,030
You never know
what will happen in life.

441
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,360
Right. I found out who has access
to the security server.

442
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,070
- Who?
- Ms. Jang and Director Choi.

443
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,570
I don't think
I can convince Ms. Jang,

444
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,440
but I'm acquainted with Mr. Choi.

445
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,080
It won't be easy,
but I'll make it happen.

446
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,640
That's great.
Let me know how it goes.

447
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
Good for you, Eun Chong.

448
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,150
You'll sleep over
at your auntie's place.

449
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,420
Yes.

450
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,090
After I drop him off,

451
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,720
- we can go to the wedding shop.
- Okay.

452
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,660
Have fun.

453
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,360
I'll be back.

454
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,060
Let's go, Eun Chong.

455
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:19,160
- Have fun.
- Okay.

456
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,830
Be careful.

457
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,340
Goodness.

458
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,250
Do you know who he is?

459
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,350
He's my son! Happy now?

460
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:40,720
Your son? My foot.

461
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,650
Throw out everything
that belongs to Eun Chong...

462
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,520
unless you want to regret everything
before our parents.

463
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,460
Why did he say
I'd regret it before our parents?

464
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,930
You should be getting ready
for your wedding. Why did you call?

465
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,830
I'm going to a wedding shop.

466
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:02,770
- Did you catch a cold?
- It's my allergy.

467
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,310
I'll be fine
once I take my medicine.

468
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,110
Good for Goo Ha Na.

469
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,980
She gets to meet Eun Chong,
the love of her life.

470
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:12,350
- They're going to meet?
- Did I forget to mention?

471
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,020
Hwang Jin Goo's term
for this marriage was...

472
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,090
letting Eun Chong and Ha Na meet
at least once a week.

473
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,460
He just took him to Ha Na's place.

474
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,130
Right now?

475
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,840
Auntie Ha Na.

476
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,540
Uncle Ji Seok...

477
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,580
Ha Na and Eun Chong are
meeting today.

478
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,950
Wait here.

479
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,790
Ji Seok, what brings you here?

480
00:30:58,600 --> 00:30:59,800
Are you going out to meet Eun Chong?

481
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,070
How did you know?

482
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:03,770
He said he'd be here.

483
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,300
He must be here.

484
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,280
- What are you doing?
- You can't meet him.

485
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:13,980
You need to stop!

486
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
No, you need to stop!

487
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,450
Do you know
what Chairwoman Shin is like?

488
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,680
She didn't just frame you
for the fake daughter scheme...

489
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,950
even though you raised her grandson.

490
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,990
She also tried
to make you appear schizophrenic...

491
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:26,060
and lock you up
at a mental institution.

492
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,560
And Eun Chong is her blood.

493
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,260
What? She wouldn't do that.

494
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,700
Even if that was true,
Eun Chong didn't do anything wrong.

495
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,040
His sin is that
he is Chairwoman Shin's grandson!

496
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,170
No, he's not at fault.

497
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,240
- Don't go.
- Let go of me!

498
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,010
He's the blood of your enemy!

499
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,110
Yes, the chairwoman is
like my enemy.

500
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,980
- But Eun Chong is...
- He's the blood of our enemy...

501
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,450
who killed our parents!

502
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,430
What are you talking about?

503
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,030
Is she not picking up?

504
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,870
Auntie Ha Na!

505
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,280
"The enemy who killed our parents?"

506
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,310
Why did you think...

507
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,980
I cut ties with you
when you said you were her daughter?

508
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,220
Why did you think...

509
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,650
I sold off Hyesung Tour
and tried to take the group over?

510
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,090
You wanted to know, didn't you?

511
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,760
That's why.

512
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,600
Mom and Dad were killed...

513
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,070
by Chairwoman Shin?

514
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,870
Yes, the enemy who killed
our parents 13 years ago was...

515
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,610
Chairwoman Shin?

516
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,780
And Eun Chong is her blood.

517
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,740
(Cinderella Game)

518
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,280
She cut all ties with Hyesung Group,
even with Eun Chong.

519
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,510
- That's impossible.
- What do you know about her?

520
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:04,650
Chairwoman Shin is still doing that.

521
00:34:04,650 --> 00:34:07,350
She's someone
who'll reach her goal by any means.

522
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,650
I wanted to come and apologize.

523
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,150
I finally realized it.

524
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:13,060
Raising Eun Chong was
the biggest misfortune of my life.

525
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,560
What can I do
to make you believe me?

526
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,390
I'm done living my life like a fool.

527
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,560
The Goo Ha Na of the past
is now gone.
