1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,609
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,009 --> 00:00:07,480
(Episode 27)

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,619
What is this, Yeo Jin?

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:15,650
It must mean you should put
your death portrait in here.

7
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,760
What kind of a lunatic
would send something like this?

8
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,429
There's a note, too.

9
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,100
"Shin Yeo Jin. Did you remember..."

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,840
"the excruciating pain you caused
to many families?"

11
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:43,149
"It's now your turn
to feel that excruciating pain."

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,950
This had died down for a while,
but the blackmailing began again.

13
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,729
The item has been received
by Chairwoman Shin.

14
00:00:56,429 --> 00:00:58,100
What you sent
wasn't shocking enough.

15
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,829
She wouldn't be shaken up
over something like that.

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,739
Think of it like a jab.

17
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,540
Or a light appetizer.

18
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:12,280
The main dish will be
rough, spiteful, and shocking.

19
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,790
It must've been
someone like that man...

20
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,290
who made a scene
at the inaugural ceremony.

21
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:28,129
Their failure ruined their business.
Why are they blaming you?

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,859
Get rid of this.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,329
And keep it quiet,
even from Se Young.

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,069
Of course.

25
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:38,000
We still need to find the sender,

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,540
so I'll check the CCTV footage.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,640
Why is she telling me
to get rid of this ominous thing?

28
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,250
Goodness gracious.

29
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,549
Ms. Jang, please get rid of this.

30
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,189
What's that picture frame?

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:59,959
Someone sent her a frame
adorned like a death portrait.

32
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,859
They're wishing for her death.

33
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,379
Ms. Chairwoman.

34
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,780
Are you all right?

35
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:27,520
No, I'm not all right.

36
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,689
I never cared about such threatening
gestures, but not anymore.

37
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,629
Why did someone send me that
as soon as I found Eun Chong?

38
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:41,330
Did you think those
who held a grudge against me...

39
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,740
contaminated the DNA...

40
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,969
to prevent me from finding Yu Jin
and caused the hit-and-run accident?

41
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,080
Ms. Chairwoman,
we haven't found any evidence yet.

42
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,979
What if they sent me
that threatening letter...

43
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,419
because they knew about Eun Chong?

44
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:01,289
Nobody knows that
Eun Chong is your grandson,

45
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:03,620
and you can
continue to keep it that way.

46
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,889
Yes, I'll keep it that way.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,259
It's too dangerous
to keep Eun Chong out there.

48
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:15,870
I need him here to keep him safe.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,409
Yeo Jin, I checked the CCTV footage.

50
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,580
But just as I expected,
the culprit wasn't caught.

51
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:28,080
Are you in shock?
You don't look so well.

52
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,780
I'm fine.

53
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,849
Well, you won't report this
to the police, will you?

54
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,889
You have to uphold an image,
so these threats should be kept...

55
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:39,990
We'll keep this between us.

56
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,330
Of course.

57
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,229
She never even flinched
whenever someone threatened her.

58
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,069
Why does she
suddenly seem concerned?

59
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:52,469
What happened at your parents'
memorial service must concern you.

60
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:56,469
I knew you told me not to bring
personal feelings into work, but...

61
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,710
You can talk to me.

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,080
You seem like a winter tree,
only full of bare branches.

63
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,520
Why don't you
tell the truth to your family?

64
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,590
You've put
too much burden on yourself.

65
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:10,759
People only believe what they see.

66
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,159
They think
a winter tree is dying all alone...

67
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,029
and pity it.

68
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,329
But that winter tree
may not be alone.

69
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,639
That tree knows...

70
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:25,970
that the wind and the sunlight...

71
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,139
continuously come to bother it.

72
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,139
That's why it can...

73
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,310
continue to stay strong.

74
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,199
I like it.

75
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,870
The wine is called Vernus.
People usually have it to celebrate.

76
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,600
Everything will go well.

77
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,800
I have
such a wonderful drinking buddy.

78
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,009
It still wasn't right to punch
your older brother in the face.

79
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,779
I didn't think it was wrong.

80
00:05:06,009 --> 00:05:09,579
Hey, Eun Chong.
Am I at fault? Or is it Ji Seok?

81
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:10,879
You two are the same.

82
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,480
We aren't the same!

83
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:15,290
Right.
But it's worse to use violence.

84
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,720
Ruining that table is also violence.
He's the same as me.

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,459
You two are the same.

86
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:23,230
Two uncles got into a fight
in front of their young nephew.

87
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,000
Eun Chong was so shocked
that he wet his...

88
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,600
And you're proud of that?

89
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,540
Eun Chong, I'm sorry.

90
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,009
Then, you should
make up with Uncle Ji Seok.

91
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:35,910
Why should I do that first?

92
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,939
Do I have to apologize first
just because I'm younger?

93
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,709
Yes, Ji Seok was a hundred,
no, a thousand times worse.

94
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,279
Even so, you can't hit him.

95
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:45,250
He shouldn't have done what he did
to deserve the beating!

96
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,319
Did you ask him why?

97
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,589
Is the chairwoman his mortal enemy?

98
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,689
Anyway, you will apologize first.

99
00:05:54,829 --> 00:05:56,089
I won't mention this again.

100
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,560
Gosh, come on. This is so annoying.

101
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,529
Why are you adding to this?

102
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,240
You rude punk.

103
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,040
Did you tell him
to apologize to Ji Seok?

104
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,040
I did, but he won't listen.

105
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,509
That little punk.

106
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,680
Are you all right?

107
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,579
Did you wet your pants
in your sleep last night?

108
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,490
I never wet my pants!

109
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,120
Why are you here?

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,759
May I borrow your dress this week?

111
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,360
I have
a series of important meetings.

112
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,560
You should've taken it yesterday.

113
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,459
I forgot
after that huge mess broke out.

114
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,629
Yes, right. I have huge news.

115
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:38,000
Ji Seok is seeing a woman.

116
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:39,800
He is?

117
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:42,069
Is Aunt Yeo Jin unwell?

118
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,339
I guess. She seemed a bit tired.

119
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,009
She's getting old, too.

120
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,949
She wasn't like how she used to be.

121
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,180
She looks perfectly well to me.

122
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,819
I'm opening the safe tomorrow.

123
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,220
Really?

124
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,490
She's going to the general assembly
for the Business Federation.

125
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:02,759
I'll open it while she's gone.

126
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,269
I'm looking forward to finding out
what's inside.

127
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:10,329
I was so scared
we'd find files related to Yu Jin.

128
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,199
Don't be scared.

129
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,209
We have to know beforehand
to either defend or attack first.

130
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,240
Did you sit around in the dark
only to get backstabbed?

131
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,139
I'll put my faith in you, Mom.

132
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,509
Goodness.

133
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,550
Mom, can you please
just buy something like this?

134
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,860
You have bad wrists, too.

135
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,220
I can do this much.

136
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,430
Then, make sure you take this.

137
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,370
You keep massaging yourself
after doing chores around the house.

138
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:48,569
By the time you're my age,
all your joints will begin to ache.

139
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,839
I get to live in good health
thanks to my great son.

140
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:55,279
I'm an awful son.

141
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,620
I have a wonderful son.
Stop badmouthing him.

142
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,459
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

143
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:10,800
I have to bring Eun Chong home
as soon as possible.

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,129
Is something going on?

145
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,930
I had to let Yu Jin go in vain.

146
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,240
I felt anxious something might
happen to Eun Chong, too.

147
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,970
Ms. Chairwoman, please relax.

148
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,639
We haven't found a lead
on your daughter's accident,

149
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,050
- and Eun Chong wouldn't...
- All right.

150
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,050
Come to my office
as soon as you're at work tomorrow.

151
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,080
Yes, goodbye.

152
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,789
Did something happen to her?

153
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,789
She doesn't seem like herself.

154
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,370
Shin Yeo Jin. Did you remember...

155
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,539
the excruciating pain you caused
to many families?

156
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,169
It's now your turn
to feel that excruciating pain.

157
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:00,750
No, that won't happen. Never.

158
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,850
Come in.

159
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,750
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Yes, Jin Goo.

160
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:14,889
I gave this a thought.

161
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,629
If you take Ms. Goo in
as your stepdaughter,

162
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,899
people will find out
about your daughter's death.

163
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,870
If you said she was
a distant relative,

164
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:24,740
Se Young's family
wouldn't believe it.

165
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,269
It doesn't look easy.

166
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,669
I had such thoughts, too.
I seemed to be out of options.

167
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,080
You might be able to find a way
if you talked to Ms. Goo.

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,580
Why don't you set up a meeting
with her and...

169
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,320
You must trust her a lot.

170
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:41,090
From what I've seen,
she loves Eun Chong more than anyone.

171
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:44,690
Yes, but she's not alone.

172
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,659
Her siblings would
have to keep the secret, too.

173
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,889
That's too dangerous,
and I don't trust them.

174
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,559
Then, why don't you give it time
and try to find another way?

175
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,899
Eun Chong will remain safe
if he continues to stay with Ms. Goo.

176
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,840
The new landlord said we could stay?

177
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,440
Yes, only the name
on the deed will change.

178
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,710
He'll keep the rent the same, too.

179
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,049
He won't even raise the rent?
Are you serious?

180
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,379
Yes, you were truly blessed, Ha Na.

181
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:16,049
Well, the house was a bit old,

182
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:18,720
but my tenant kept the place
neat and tidy.

183
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,789
- I like it.
- I see.

184
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:22,360
Feel free to take a look around.

185
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,399
Hey, Ha Na.

186
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,929
May I have
the new landlord's contact?

187
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,299
He'll contact you later.

188
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:30,600
I have to go now, Ha Na.

189
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:32,639
Okay. Thank you.

190
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,909
I really have been blessed.

191
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,480
You can continue to express
your feelings for Eun Chong...

192
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,480
even as he stays with Ms. Goo.

193
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,490
I spent 20 years
after I lost Yu Jin.

194
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,720
I wanted to reunite with her
on this earth, but I couldn't.

195
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,360
Do you expect me
to live as strangers...

196
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,259
with Yu Jin's only blood
while he's right in front of me?

197
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:57,159
How can you say that?

198
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,929
You know how I feel
better than anybody.

199
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,769
Of course, I know it very well.

200
00:11:01,169 --> 00:11:04,639
But if you want to bring Eun Chong,
you must trust Ms. Goo.

201
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,340
No, I cannot tell anyone
that Eun Chong is my grandson,

202
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,539
even to Ms. Goo.

203
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,080
I have to bring them both...

204
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,279
while hiding the fact that
Eun Chong is my grandson.

205
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,919
You won't tell Ms. Goo that
Eun Chong is your grandson?

206
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,190
- That's impossible, ma'am.
- There has to be a way.

207
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,889
I'll find it.

208
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,129
Ms. Chairwoman.

209
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:34,330
Business Federation's general assembly
may be postponed.

210
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,929
The chairman of Daejin Group
suddenly had to leave the country,

211
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:39,799
so key personnel already announced
their absence.

212
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:43,309
Is that so?
Tell them I also won't attend.

213
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,279
Let's go see Eun Chong.

214
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:47,980
Ms. Chairwoman,
that could be dangerous...

215
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,980
Was I not allowed to meet
my own grandson?

216
00:11:50,049 --> 00:11:51,279
How can I consider myself
his grandmother...

217
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,080
if I'm worse off than a stranger?

218
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,090
Goodness.

219
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,600
"Title: 'Lee Ha Na,
Lee Du Na, Lee Se Na'?"

220
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:16,240
- You can go home.
- Already?

221
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,840
Yeo Jin will be late,
so you don't have to make dinner.

222
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,909
- You can go.
- I'll finish mopping.

223
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:26,779
No, you can just go. Now.

224
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:29,289
Well, it's great for me
to get off early.

225
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,320
- Come on. Go now, Bang Ul.
- What's with you?

226
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,490
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

227
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,159
Goodness.

228
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,259
Good grief.

229
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,769
Gosh, she's so clumsy.

230
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,149
Yes, are you on standby
near my place?

231
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,980
You can come in 20 minutes.

232
00:13:05,289 --> 00:13:08,830
Anyway, what's that picture frame
wrapped in paper?

233
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,659
I saw funeral ribbons on it, too.

234
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:11,960
You saw that?

235
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:14,299
Some crazy punk
sent that to Yeo Jin...

236
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:16,230
That was for the chairwoman?

237
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,669
Who would do
something evil like that?

238
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,169
It must've been shocking.

239
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:24,440
Pretend like you never saw it
and just go home.

240
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,509
Go now.

241
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,279
My gosh.

242
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,019
He teased him for not having a mom?

243
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,750
Yes, Eun Chong has
a good relationship with his peers,

244
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:38,960
but there's one boy who often teases him
for not having a mother.

245
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,490
They've been in a few fights
because of that.

246
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:43,960
It must've been sad and miserable
not to have a mom,

247
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,960
but that young boy
had to put up with that, too?

248
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,700
It must've hurt him so much.

249
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,139
Thankfully, he seems to be
brave and strong.

250
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:55,610
How brave and strong
could a seven-year-old be?

251
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,980
Oh, the kids are walking out.

252
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,879
Hold each other's hand.

253
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,179
Let's go.

254
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,419
Oh, no!

255
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,090
- Eun Chong!
- No, Ms. Chairwoman!

256
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,070
Grandpa Beard.

257
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,970
You should be careful, Eun Chong.

258
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,399
Are you all right?

259
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:29,840
Eun Chong, are you okay?

260
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,009
Eun Chong, are you okay?

261
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:35,580
- Eun Chong, are you okay?
- Eun Chong, are you okay?

262
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,950
Is he all right?

263
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,919
- Is he hurt?
- No, ma'am.

264
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,580
Thankfully, he seems fine.

265
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,750
Check with the kindergarten...

266
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,590
and see if he was hurt
even a little bit.

267
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,490
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,600
Was he in shock?

269
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:56,830
He went through
a shocking event a few days ago.

270
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,070
All right, then. Goodbye.

271
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,210
Did your nephew
get in trouble again?

272
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,909
I told you to refrain
from taking personal calls at work.

273
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,909
It was from the kindergarten.

274
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,419
I'm sorry, but I ask for your
understanding in this aspect.

275
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,919
How long will you say sorry?

276
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,250
How much longer
do I have to understand?

277
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,590
You need to do your job right
before you ask for a favor.

278
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:25,029
I told you to bring me a list
of 100 vendors. Why is it still short?

279
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,960
I thought that would be enough...

280
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,169
"Enough?"
Why do you make that decision?

281
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,799
You aren't the president
or the team leader!

282
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,100
Who do you think you are
to judge and decide?

283
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,809
Bring me 100 vendors
before you go home today.

284
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,639
May I do it until tomorrow morning?

285
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,379
My nephew almost got in an accident,
so I had to pick him up...

286
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:43,710
Stop using him as an excuse!

287
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,350
Yes, Mom.

288
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,889
The general assembly
for Business Federation got canceled.

289
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,799
Is your aunt at work or not?

290
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,799
She just left with Ms. Jang.

291
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,669
Good grief. I'm hanging up.

292
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,740
- How much longer will it take?
- The digital keypad was unlocked,

293
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,409
but the mechanical dial was...

294
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,110
a bit difficult to deal with.

295
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:13,509
You need to hurry.

296
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:15,149
The first number is...

297
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,879
I found it.

298
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,120
That was so shocking.

299
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,720
What a relief
that Eun Chong wasn't hurt.

300
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,090
Yes.

301
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,059
Thankfully, that volunteer
at the kindergarten was nearby.

302
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,629
Was that motorcycle
going after Eun Chong?

303
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,870
Could it be the one
who sent that picture frame?

304
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,039
No, Ms. Chairwoman.

305
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,610
He was a deliveryman passing by.

306
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
I must be too paranoid.

307
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,690
Wait, hey. You need to stop.

308
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,659
Hey, you have to come out.
The chairwoman is here.

309
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:00,559
I already unlocked it.

310
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,690
- It's opened?
- Yes.

311
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,960
Goodness. Let me see it.

312
00:17:06,529 --> 00:17:08,329
Wait, what?

313
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,240
Why is it empty?

314
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,650
Yeo Jin, I heard the assembly
for the federation was canceled.

315
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,619
He's here to read the gas meter.

316
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,519
- Thank you.
- Sure.

317
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,519
You should have a cup of tea
before you go inside.

318
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:38,259
That sly old woman.

319
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:41,099
Where did she put the files?

320
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:50,369
What's wrong, Ms. Chairwoman?

321
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,849
Yeo Jin, it's the chairman
of Daejin Group.

322
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:00,019
Did you know
why he suddenly went to America?

323
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,819
Their eldest son
wasn't really his son!

324
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,089
What do you mean?

325
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:07,119
I thought he had lost him,
then found him.

326
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,789
Everyone thought so.

327
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,200
But his real son died,

328
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,130
so that man isn't his real son.

329
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,369
The chairman's younger brother ran
the parentage test and found out.

330
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,339
So, the chairman also knew?

331
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:22,970
Yes, the two
staged everything together.

332
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,109
He asked that man to be his son.

333
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,579
He only had one son,
so I understood why he did that.

334
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:34,019
But still, he deceived everyone
for 20 years.

335
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,519
There will be a bloodbath
in that family.

336
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,490
I expected her
to come to the kindergarten.

337
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:44,029
But I'm afraid
she'll try to take Eun Chong.

338
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:45,829
Will she do anything
that'll make her grandson dangerous?

339
00:18:45,829 --> 00:18:47,700
At first, I also thought so.

340
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:50,069
But I have a feeling
she'll somehow find a way.

341
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,769
I don't know
how I'm going to make her give up.

342
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:58,240
It won't be easy
for her to bring her grandson home.

343
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,480
Let's keep an eye on her
for a while.

344
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:05,180
"Grandpa Beard?"

345
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,750
Yes, he was the Santa who gave us presents
at the kindergarten.

346
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:11,289
I've seen him, too.

347
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:13,589
Does he live around here?

348
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,789
Let me know
when you see him next time.

349
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,500
And from now on,
don't jump into the street...

350
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,769
no matter what you drop.

351
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,299
What if you get hurt?

352
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,470
A little boy like you
tried to be a man...

353
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,839
and risked your life
to grab your girlfriend's key chain?

354
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,109
Hey, who's more important?
Your girlfriend or Auntie Ha Na?

355
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,950
Who'd be sadder if you got hurt?
Your girlfriend or Auntie Ha Na?

356
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,380
Auntie Ha Na.

357
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm sorry, Auntie.

358
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:42,119
I won't do that again.

359
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,789
- It's a promise.
- It's a promise.

360
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:49,359
Should we rent out
Auntie Ji Eun's room?

361
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,589
Yes!

362
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,299
How much can we get?

363
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,259
Do you also think
it's okay to rent it out?

364
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:56,470
Yes, we'll have a new family!

365
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,839
Be honest. You're happy
because we'll get money.

366
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,599
Well, that, too.

367
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,869
It'll be great if we have
a grandpa and a grandma.

368
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,640
No, we'll pick a girl.

369
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,180
I don't think we can do that
with you around.

370
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,049
What? What's so bad about me?

371
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,450
You punk.

372
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:14,950
You punk.

373
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,720
- Stop it. Cut it out!
- Come here!

374
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:31,470
You have to be careful, pumpkin.
What if you got hurt?

375
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,200
I have to bring you home soon.

376
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:38,109
What can I do
to bring you home safely?

377
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,019
What's she looking at
with such loving eyes?

378
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,950
Is she looking at the file
she pulled out of her safe?

379
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,390
What are you looking at
with such loving eyes?

380
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,259
What loving eyes?

381
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,900
It's the stock market.
It's not a lot of fun.

382
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:00,829
I'm home.

383
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,269
Come on in.

384
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,529
Let me get changed and come,
Aunt Yeo Jin.

385
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:05,539
Sure.

386
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,180
You opened the safe,
but nothing was in there?

387
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:15,109
It was completely empty.

388
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:16,809
She must've taken it elsewhere.

389
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,720
Jin Goo must know everything,
but he'll keep his mouth shut.

390
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,349
His priority is
Aunt Yeo Jin, not me.

391
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,819
He's only marrying me
to repay her kindness.

392
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,690
That's nothing new.

393
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,960
It's a win-win situation
for both of you.

394
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,160
Is it really a win-win situation?

395
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,299
What's wrong? Is something going on?

396
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,230
No.

397
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,039
Did you give up
on tracking his location?

398
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,440
Yes, they sent him the web address
on a burner phone,

399
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,910
but he wouldn't open it.

400
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:47,309
You'll either have to find out
his password and install it...

401
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,410
or send him the address
on Bang Ul's phone.

402
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,380
He'll open the website
if it's from his mother.

403
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,950
What if we got caught?

404
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,789
I'll manage.

405
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,789
An empty death portrait?

406
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,930
Yes, it's like
telling the receiver to die.

407
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:10,029
The chairwoman
must've been in shock.

408
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,440
Something like that must happen a lot
when you run a huge business.

409
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,569
Who was it from?

410
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:17,670
If she knew,
she would've caught them already.

411
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,779
Was that why she became too anxious
about Eun Chong's matter?

412
00:22:23,609 --> 00:22:24,779
Yeo Jin.

413
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,880
Eun Chong's safety is
the most important to us.

414
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,890
I understand how you want
to keep him by your side.

415
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,730
But the truth behind Yu Jin's death
hasn't been revealed yet,

416
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:37,529
so it'll be dangerous
if you get too close to Eun Chong.

417
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,400
Please hang in there
until I return to Korea.

418
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:41,900
Please.

419
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,069
You've sent me just an e-mail,
not even a call?

420
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,339
So? When will you return?

421
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:51,240
You find other things more important
than Eun Chong's safety.

422
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:55,650
If I were you, I would've returned
immediately just to see him.

423
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,980
I don't need someone like you,

424
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,950
so don't ever show up again.

425
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:08,890
"An empty death portrait?"

426
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,990
- You didn't know?
- Not at all.

427
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,599
Why didn't my mom tell me?

428
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,970
Mom, did someone send
an empty death portrait to Aunt Yeo Jin?

429
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,940
How did you know?

430
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,240
- Was it Jin Goo?
- Who was it from?

431
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,309
Give it to me.

432
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,680
Mother, it's me.

433
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,220
Who sent that, and why?

434
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,450
Who do you think?
It must be those lunatics...

435
00:23:37,789 --> 00:23:39,920
who enjoy harassing rich families.

436
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,130
Have you reported it to the police?

437
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,200
No, that will only start rumors
around the neighborhood.

438
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,529
Just pretend like
you don't know about this.

439
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,130
Goodbye.

440
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,400
Bang Ul must've told him.

441
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,640
I can't let the kids find out.

442
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:01,240
She said it was those
who tried to damage her reputation.

443
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,920
Was it someone like that man
at the inaugural ceremony?

444
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,019
Aunt Yeo Jin does
a lot of good deeds.

445
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,849
Why do these people keep appearing?

446
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,460
It must've been scary.

447
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,420
Gosh, it's terrifying.

448
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,000
How did you know?

449
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,700
It must've been shocking.
Are you all right?

450
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,240
Yes, it's not a big deal.

451
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,599
Who was it from?

452
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,640
Was it those who wanted to harm you,

453
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
like the man
at the inaugural ceremony?

454
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,779
Who knows?

455
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:35,049
Was that why you wanted to hurry
and bring Eun Chong home?

456
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,009
That has nothing to do with it.

457
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:38,980
I was just scared...

458
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,450
Eun Chong would be exposed
to the smallest danger.

459
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,259
I already lost Yu Jin.
I can't lose Eun Chong, too.

460
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:51,430
I thought about it,
and I should take advantage of Ms. Goo.

461
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:54,869
I'll have to bring her home anyway.

462
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,369
Ms. Chairwoman.

463
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,880
I found out
where your daughter is resting.

464
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:06,740
You did?

465
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,980
Where is it?

466
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,119
(The late Lee Du Na)

467
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,230
Ms. Chairwoman.

468
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,950
(The late Lee Du Na)

469
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,089
Yu Jin.

470
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:52,789
So, this was how you grew up.

471
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,230
We were finally reunited...

472
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,829
after 20 years of searching.

473
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,410
I didn't get to see
how beautifully you've grown...

474
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,480
or when you gave birth to Eun Chong.

475
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:19,180
I didn't get to do anything
with you.

476
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,690
I just want to hold you in my arms
just once.

477
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:45,940
Mother-daughter time travel.

478
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,410
They'd go back to a place where they
took a photo together as a child...

479
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,549
and take another photo
in the same pose?

480
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,980
I like this idea.

481
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,390
Where did you get the inspiration?

482
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:58,859
Eun Chong and I recently went
grocery shopping...

483
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,220
and went to a photo booth
to take a four-cut photo.

484
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,559
I began to think it'd be nice to take
the same photo when he grew up,

485
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,960
and thought it'd be the same
for mothers and daughters.

486
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,700
Good for Eun Chong.

487
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,240
He has a wonderful
mother-to-be like you.

488
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,369
A mother-to-be?

489
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:19,640
If a mother-to-be like that is on sale,
I'd like to get one, too.

490
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,650
If we could really buy one,
I'd love to get you one.

491
00:27:30,589 --> 00:27:32,420
(The late Lee Du Na)

492
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,990
Don't worry about Eun Chong.

493
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,230
I'll keep him safe.

494
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,269
It would've been wonderful...

495
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,609
if you were by Eun Chong's side,
not Ms. Goo.

496
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,779
No, I'll stop thinking like that.

497
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:03,220
I'll stop crying from now on.

498
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,859
I'll pull myself together,
reveal the truth behind your death,

499
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:09,960
and keep Eun Chong safe, too.

500
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,529
The floor is too cold, ma'am.

501
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,170
Daisies?

502
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:28,910
Those were Yu Jin's favorite.

503
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,779
Wait, could it be Sung Ho?

504
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,519
Sung Ho must've been here.

505
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:41,690
He's the only one who knows
that Yu Jin likes daisies.

506
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,529
Ms. Chairwoman, but he's in America.

507
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,799
Go and look for him.
Check the CCTVs.

508
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,859
Yes, ma'am.

509
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,930
Sung Ho...

510
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,269
Yu Jin, you saw him, right?

511
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,940
Daddy was here, wasn't he?

512
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:01,809
Is something going on?
You never meet me so suddenly.

513
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,819
I heard this place was
popular among families.

514
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,819
Danny and you were my family,

515
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,390
and I wanted to play dad today.

516
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,789
Something came up for Danny today.

517
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,690
Please allow your son
to pour you a cup of tea.

518
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,599
Yes, my son.

519
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,059
Thanks.

520
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,779
- Nothing is going on, right?
- Of course not.

521
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:39,880
- Right. Chairwoman Shin...
- Let's not talk about work today.

522
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,450
Let's only discuss things that
a dad and his son would talk about.

523
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,559
Yes. Have you decided
on a house to move to?

524
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,990
Yes, I've been looking.

525
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:49,559
Seoul was too crowded,
so somewhere in Gyeonggi Province.

526
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:51,690
- Eat up.
- Okay.

527
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:58,470
Ji Seok, your sister is
raising my grandson.

528
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,400
How could fate become so twisted?

529
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,309
How am I going to resolve
this feud between the two families?

530
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:07,309
I was honestly scared.

531
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,509
(Attorney Ko)

532
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,019
If it's an important call,
I will step out for a moment.

533
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,250
No, you can eat.

534
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,029
Yes, Attorney Ko.

535
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,759
Yeo Jin was at the cinerarium?

536
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:29,299
She cannot check the CCTV footage.

537
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,029
Give her whatever reason
to stop her from seeing that.

538
00:30:33,069 --> 00:30:34,839
I think it was Sung Ho.

539
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,740
I got the contact information
for the one in charge of the CCTVs.

540
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,309
I'll meet the person tomorrow
and confirm.

541
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,849
Find out if Sung Ho returned
to Korea in the last few days.

542
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,079
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,660
Yu Jin would want me
to bring Eun Chong home.

544
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,829
No matter how close they were,
he still grew up with a stranger.

545
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:05,029
A child under foster care?

546
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,940
But how can I hide the truth from Ms. Goo
and bring him here?

547
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,910
His real son died,
so that man isn't his real son.

548
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,049
The two staged everything together.

549
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:21,990
He asked that man to be his son.

550
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,289
A fake son.

551
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:29,690
Yes.

552
00:31:30,829 --> 00:31:33,259
There's nothing I won't do
to keep my grandson safe.

553
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,000
Ms. Goo.

554
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:42,170
You said you wanted
to repay my kindness.

555
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,680
There's something you can do for me.

556
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:50,150
You need to be Yu Jin...

557
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,450
for Eun Chong's sake.

558
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,759
(Cinderella Game)

559
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,829
I found a way to bring Eun Chong.

560
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:41,099
You need to reconsider,
Ms. Chairwoman.

561
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:42,269
There are no secrets in this world.

562
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:44,470
Why did you just walk out of there?

563
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,000
Because I live here.

564
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,400
Darn it. All of you!

565
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,940
I want to remove her
to a place where I can't see her.

566
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,109
- Ms. Goo Ha Na.
- She'll be my real daughter.

567
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,240
She'll instantly be like Cinderella.

568
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:56,009
How will you handle this?

569
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,410
In the end,
this will be for her benefit.

570
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:00,119
Please help me.

571
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,680
No, it can't happen.
