1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,410
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,980
(Episode 98)

5
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,710
Se Young! Stop!

6
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,740
No, Se Young!

7
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,410
No!

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:43,920
Se Young! No!

9
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,320
Please stop!

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,250
You can't do this. Get it together!

11
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,320
Let go of me.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,920
This is the first
and last decision I can make.

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,690
I'll end it all.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,860
Have you lost your mind?

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,230
Your death won't end anything.

16
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,960
Yu Jin wouldn't want you to die!

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,460
How do you know...

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,200
if she wants that or not?

19
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,370
Stay alive and take responsibility
instead of running away.

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,040
That's what Yu Jin wants!

21
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,950
Come with me.

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,110
You don't want me...

23
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,910
to find my peace by death, do you?

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:49,710
You don't want me to run away.

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,550
No.

26
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,820
Get punished for what you did
before you die.

27
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,090
I'm so scared.

28
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,060
I think it's too late.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,700
Ha Na!

30
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,180
Se Young.

31
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,250
Did you...

32
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:48,340
Se Young.

33
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,070
Have some.

34
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,870
Are you all right?

35
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,710
I'm fine.

36
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,910
Let me find a pharmacy
and get some cold medicine.

37
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,980
Okay.

38
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,770
Don't you feel bad for yourself
that the first decision you make...

39
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,940
in your life is death?

40
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,640
Meet with the chairwoman...

41
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,580
and pour out everything.

42
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,020
Apologize to her with all your heart
and ask for forgiveness.

43
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,020
I don't think I can face her.

44
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,720
Take courage just this once.

45
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:13,260
If you have the courage to die,
you'll find the will to live.

46
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,630
It's time for you
to break free from that nightmare.

47
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,330
Be freed from that guilt...

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,170
and live in peace.

49
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,910
In peace?

50
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,140
Can it really happen to me?

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,750
Only you need to change.

52
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,920
I don't think I can do that.

53
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,190
I've never imagined
living my life without my mom,

54
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,220
and I'd live
the rest of my life in distress...

55
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,820
as a murderer's daughter.

56
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:53,430
It's been 20 years,

57
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,730
but you already saw me...

58
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,370
still stuck in this place,

59
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,570
in this nightmare.

60
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,380
Yu Jin won't let go of me.

61
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,210
It's not Yu Jin.

62
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,320
You never let it go.

63
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:15,020
You felt bad
about what you did to her all along.

64
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,820
She must also know
how you really feel.

65
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:21,930
Because she...

66
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,260
would've been
a sincere friend to you.

67
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,900
Seeing you smile
makes me smile, too.

68
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,300
I can give you everything...

69
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,810
except for my mommy and daddy.

70
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,610
You're my best friend...

71
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,510
and my closest relative.

72
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:41,780
Daddy said we were like sisters.

73
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,550
Yu Jin...

74
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm sorry, Yu Jin.

75
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,660
Yu Jin...

76
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,400
Yu Jin...

77
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,010
I found Se Young.

78
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,810
She was at Seongbuk Port.

79
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,750
Did she really try to kill herself?

80
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes, I caught her
just as she was walking into the water.

81
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,750
Where did she get such an idea?

82
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,120
But I'm glad
you found her just in time.

83
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,820
Great job.

84
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,490
What are you up to?

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm at an important meeting.

86
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,010
- Are you at work?
- No.

87
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,610
Well, have a safe trip home. Bye.

88
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,180
What important meeting
are you having with these kids?

89
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,720
It's a secret operation.

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,700
Why are you here?

91
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,300
You're in shock
as if you've seen my ghost.

92
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,010
- You were released?
- Yes.

93
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,210
There was no evidence,

94
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,780
so how could they imprison me?

95
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,280
Anyway, why are you in my house?

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,190
Are you acting like the owner again
just because I was gone?

97
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,790
This isn't your house.

98
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,990
I already applied for an injunction.

99
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,130
And I'll put together every crime
you committed and report you,

100
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,830
including forgery
of private documents and fraud.

101
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,840
You try to look triumphant
because I haven't found the notebook,

102
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,370
but I know
you're trembling on the inside.

103
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,210
All you want to do is...

104
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,240
find the notebook
and destroy it, isn't that so?

105
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,910
You were the only one...

106
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,380
who had seen that notebook.

107
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:58,050
Those police officers were
manipulated by your delusion.

108
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,350
I decided not to treat you
like a human.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,190
Then, my anger dwindled by half.

110
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,390
My daughter only got unlucky...

111
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,360
and suffered...

112
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,460
in your beastly and evil hands.

113
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,730
Your daughter is as evil as you.

114
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,770
So, she played dumb and said nothing
about Yu Jin on that boat...

115
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:20,910
for the last 20 years.

116
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,410
You knew that, didn't you?

117
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,140
Yet you chose to keep it a secret.

118
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:26,740
How can you do that as a mother?

119
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,850
Then,

120
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,250
what else did you expect me to do?

121
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,750
Se Young already said
she didn't know.

122
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,920
My daughter lied,
so I had to patch up her mistake!

123
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,760
Do you want a trophy or something?

124
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,330
That was all I could do
to keep Se Young safe.

125
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,530
You wouldn't have been different
if you were in my shoes.

126
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,270
After that day,

127
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,210
Se Young never slept in peace.

128
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,610
She began to tremble...

129
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,940
and was unable to breathe
whenever someone mentioned Yu Jin.

130
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,110
She lived her life burdened
with that sense of guilt,

131
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,720
always on psychotropic drugs.

132
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,150
She suffered from nightmares
every single night!

133
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,690
Are you trying to act like a victim
in front of me?

134
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
She was only ten.

135
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:17,530
She didn't even know
what was right or wrong,

136
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,230
but that one lie she told
completely ruined her life.

137
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,430
Ruined?

138
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,670
Your daughter is still alive,

139
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,770
breathing, talking, laughing,

140
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,870
and getting loved.
But my daughter...

141
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,610
woke up on that cold boat,

142
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,680
trembling with fear,

143
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,640
swept by the waves in the storm
at that young age!

144
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,490
Do you want to play the mom now?
Was it hard to see your girl suffer?

145
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,020
I had no idea where my girl was...

146
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,690
and went around looking for her
for 20 years.

147
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,030
I couldn't smile or sleep.

148
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,060
I resented that sea
every single day...

149
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,700
and tortured myself all the time!

150
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,030
Yes, so why did she
have to go to that sea?

151
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,840
Yu Jin was the one who wanted to go.

152
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,610
Se Young...

153
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,840
only tagged along.

154
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,380
How can you...

155
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,950
Right. You weren't human.

156
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,320
I shouldn't expect you
to have a speck of conscience.

157
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,730
Don't you dare
lay a finger on my body again.

158
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:32,270
If you do, I'll take your life.

159
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,470
Sure.

160
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,170
Let's wait and see
who ends up dead first.

161
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:38,840
Your daughter's trauma...

162
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,350
will become much more serious
and cruel from now on.

163
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,450
And as for you,

164
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,820
I'll find the notebook...

165
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,580
and throw you back inside.

166
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,250
- Go ahead and try.
- Get out.

167
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:51,820
I don't wish to speak
to the devil anymore.

168
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,500
It's not like...

169
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,600
you lived such a humane life.

170
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,370
I'll leave for today.

171
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,190
Myung Ji got out.

172
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,690
How did you find out?

173
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,260
Did you get a call?

174
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,560
She had the nerve to come home.

175
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,800
Are you with her right now?

176
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,370
She left.

177
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:39,300
She told the truth
about Se Young's lie.

178
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,670
Do you know what she said?

179
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,010
She said Se Young was
also a victim...

180
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,110
because this made
her entire life tough,

181
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,490
although we lost Yu Jin.

182
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,700
The sea must've been cold
around this time.

183
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,330
What if you catch a cold?

184
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,570
I'm fine.

185
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,540
No matter how hard it was,
how could she want to die?

186
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,740
I hope she talks to the chairwoman
with that kind of courage.

187
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:20,080
She may act strong on the outside,
but she's a kid on the inside.

188
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,280
I never knew she had such trauma.

189
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,780
I feel bad...

190
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,450
for both Du Na and Se Young.

191
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,890
- What is it?
- You're too beautiful.

192
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:36,630
Jeez.

193
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:42,670
Right.
I heard Choi Myung Ji got out.

194
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,370
Yes, we have no chance
of locking her up...

195
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,270
if we don't find that notebook.

196
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,170
The chairwoman
must've been disappointed.

197
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,220
- You're home early, Mom.
- Hey, you were here.

198
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,520
Hello.

199
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,190
- Ms. Goo was here, too.
- Yes.

200
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,560
You're in a good mood today.

201
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,860
Did you have good sales today?

202
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,230
I always have great sales.

203
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,400
Jin Goo, there's something
I want to brag about.

204
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,700
What is it?

205
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,040
The headquarters picked me...

206
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,740
as the most outstanding
franchise operator.

207
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,940
So, they told me
to come and receive an award.

208
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,780
- My gosh.
- Really?

209
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,950
You're the best, Mom.

210
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,750
Congratulations, Mother.

211
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,980
Mother?

212
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,020
Gosh, it's great
to hear you call me that.

213
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,120
It just slipped out.

214
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,830
You said it already,
so we should make it stick.

215
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,230
Yes, that sounds great.

216
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,000
Okay.

217
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:49,370
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message...

218
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,470
Where did she go,
leaving her phone turned off?

219
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,310
She needs to run my errand
and get the notebook.

220
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,310
You're here.

221
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,920
When did you get out?

222
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,250
Just now.

223
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,550
Bye.

224
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,460
Get some rest.

225
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,730
Where have you been?
Your phone was off, too.

226
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,770
Were you with Ji Seok...

227
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,970
while I was at the police station?

228
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,210
I tried to kill myself.

229
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,240
What?

230
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,410
If I...

231
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,550
didn't tell a lie back then,

232
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,580
you wouldn't have caused
that hit-and-run accident.

233
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,450
Then, you wouldn't have been
a murderer,

234
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,720
and I wouldn't have become
a murderer's daughter.

235
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,030
There's no reason
to discuss the past.

236
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,930
Let's plan what we'll do next.

237
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,030
Have a seat.

238
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,170
Why did you do that?

239
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,670
I told you. I did it for you.

240
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,000
You said you didn't do it.

241
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,910
Then, you should've denied it
until the end.

242
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,070
There's no evidence,
so it means I didn't do it.

243
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,180
How can you get someone
to kill Yu Jin?

244
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,280
How do you call yourself human?

245
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,910
Listen to this girl.

246
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,090
If I'm not human,
what does that make you?

247
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,190
The devil?

248
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,620
What could I do?
She found her way back home.

249
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,490
If I let her live,
she would've met your aunt.

250
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,600
Then, everything you did
in your life...

251
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,770
would've been futile and in vain.

252
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,670
Was that what you wanted?

253
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,470
So, you were
the landlady Yu Jin met...

254
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,180
before she died.

255
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,880
You wanted her dead, too.

256
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:47,120
Stop pretending like
you're good now.

257
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,520
When I told you
that Ha Na was fake...

258
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,950
and that Yu Jin died,

259
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,160
you were thrilled.

260
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,060
I didn't know you did it.

261
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,430
I thought it was just an accident!

262
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,160
It doesn't matter who killed her!

263
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,470
You have no right to punish me.

264
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,630
You're my accomplice.

265
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,500
Your accomplice?

266
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,870
So, I need you...

267
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,340
to go to my safe...

268
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,250
and get the notebook.

269
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,950
Is that the notebook
the evidence they mentioned?

270
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,250
Yes.

271
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,230
Detectives will tail me,
so I can't go there.

272
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,890
I kept it in a safe
borrowed under your name.

273
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,530
I'll divert the detectives,

274
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,370
so just get the notebook...

275
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,040
and bring it home.

276
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,440
No.

277
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,310
- Why not?
- Turn yourself in.

278
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:42,370
Se Young.

279
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,880
They can't take me in
unless they have evidence.

280
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,450
I'll get the notebook
and burn that thing.

281
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,680
Then, we'll go abroad.

282
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,250
I'm not going. No.

283
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,250
- You can go alone.
- Do you think you'll be fine...

284
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,260
once I get arrested?

285
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,460
You'll be a murderer's daughter.

286
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,460
Do you think...

287
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
you can live alone,
known as the daughter...

288
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,100
of a murderer?

289
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,940
Without that notebook, you and I...

290
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,770
won't have to suffer like that.

291
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,440
We can go to a place...

292
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,810
where no one knows us
and live a very happy life.

293
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,050
What I want is...

294
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,420
for you to live
without sinning anymore.

295
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,200
It's not like
I always lived committing crimes.

296
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,060
It's all because of Yu Jin.

297
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,400
It sounds like...

298
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,800
you're blaming me.

299
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,170
Yes.

300
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,140
It's on you.

301
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,810
Everything happened because of you.

302
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,160
Do you think you'll be fine
once I get arrested?

303
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,400
You'll be a murderer's daughter.

304
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,860
Do you think...

305
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,930
you can live alone,
known as the daughter...

306
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,500
of a murderer?

307
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,370
Can I really live without Mom...

308
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,640
as the daughter of a murderer?

309
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,050
Your death won't end anything.

310
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,710
Yu Jin wouldn't want you to die!

311
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,250
How do you know...

312
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,120
if she wants that or not?

313
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,590
Stay alive and take responsibility
instead of running away.

314
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,120
That's what Yu Jin wants!

315
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,730
Can I really find the courage?

316
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,910
Auntie Ha Na,
what are you wearing today?

317
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,710
I don't know.

318
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,010
You should wear a dress.

319
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,280
- Why?
- It's pretty.

320
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,950
I'll shine your dress shoes.

321
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:07,180
I'm going to put on my sneakers.

322
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,350
But your dress shoes are prettier.

323
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,720
You have lots of demands today.

324
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,960
Then, please pick a pair
without high heels.

325
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,330
Okay. And you will
put on makeup, too, right?

326
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,430
Yes.

327
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,100
And will you do your hair?

328
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,900
Eun Chong,
is something going on today?

329
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:28,840
I want to show you off
to my friends.

330
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,340
Okay.

331
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,640
I'll dress up from my head to toe.

332
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,050
Okay!

333
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,990
Hey!

334
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,460
Give it to me.

335
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,030
Auntie Ha Na!

336
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,110
Hey, Jin Goo.

337
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,050
I'm watching the children play.

338
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,320
Yes, it's a warm day.

339
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,190
I'm fine. You can take your time.

340
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,860
Bye.

341
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,190
Drive safely.

342
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,430
Ms. Goo, this is for you.

343
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,900
My gosh.

344
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,940
- Is this for me, Ji Soo?
- Yes.

345
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
- Thank you.
- Sure.

346
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,540
I have one, too.

347
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,210
And you, Tae Hoon?

348
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:40,780
Is today something special?

349
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,110
Thank you.

350
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,320
Thank you, Ji Hoon.

351
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,620
And Seo Yeon? Thank you.

352
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,430
Auntie Ha Na.

353
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,970
Eun Chong, what are all these?

354
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,500
Ha Na.

355
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,270
Jin Goo.

356
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,400
Did you prepare all this?

357
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,920
Do you know what my dream is?

358
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,660
Your dream?

359
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,930
It's marrying Auntie Ha Na!

360
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,330
Bingo.

361
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,240
I want to spend
every second I have left...

362
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:16,470
with you.

363
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,640
Will you marry me?

364
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,200
Please marry me.

365
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,200
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

366
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,940
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

367
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,440
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

368
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,010
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

369
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,240
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

370
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,080
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

371
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,910
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

372
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,710
- Marry him!
- Marry him!

373
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,250
Kiss!

374
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,880
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

375
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,650
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

376
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,520
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

377
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,360
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

378
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:07,120
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

379
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,030
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

380
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,960
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

381
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,700
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

382
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,460
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

383
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,930
Auntie Ha Na
and Mr. Hwang are getting married!

384
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:23,840
- All right!
- All right!

385
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,040
Whoa.

386
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,030
Ta-da! It's a new dish.

387
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,030
This looks great.

388
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,500
Danny, it has
many different kinds of toppings.

389
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,280
The rice cake is chewy.

390
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,240
Hey, wait.

391
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:02,950
Let's share some ramyeon noodles.

392
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,820
Okay.

393
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,220
Oh, my.

394
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,430
Gosh. You're so boring.

395
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:21,000
If you're done, try the next dish.

396
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,800
- The next dish?
- I have another hidden move.

397
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,970
It's my fried rice,

398
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,910
and it's drop-dead delicious.

399
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,940
You can never say no...

400
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,510
to rice fried in tteokbokki sauce
topped with cheese.

401
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,790
- Open up.
- Forget it.

402
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,020
Shoop.

403
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,270
Gosh, it's so delicious.

404
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,630
I love it.

405
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,100
This will be a huge hit.

406
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,640
It's already a huge hit.

407
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,710
It already is.

408
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:11,050
Bring that notebook home.

409
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,950
I must get rid of it quickly.
I'm running out of time.

410
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,590
You can do it yourself.

411
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,050
I can't go
because detectives are tailing me.

412
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,830
The more we drag this out,
the more dangerous it'll be.

413
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,760
I have to get it done today.

414
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,230
Do you want to be...

415
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,230
a murderer's daughter?

416
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,640
This isn't just my business.
It's our business!

417
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,270
You have to live alone
if I get arrested.

418
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,510
Can you live alone without me?

419
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,980
You can't.

420
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:46,520
I'll let you get a fresh start
once we go to America.

421
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,250
I won't ever let you feel down.

422
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,890
I have enough slush funds...

423
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,690
so that there won't be a problem...

424
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,560
for us to make a living.

425
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
Will you be like this?

426
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,770
Do you want to see me
rot in prison for life?

427
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,670
Do you want me
to drop and die right here?

428
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,740
Do you know how hard it was
for me to get to this place?

429
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,750
You're my only daughter.

430
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,250
Why can't you help me with this?

431
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,120
Fine.

432
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,190
Even my daughter isn't on my side.

433
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,530
It wouldn't be any different...

434
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,390
if I died right here
than dying in prison.

435
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,200
I'll kill myself.

436
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,230
Where do I have to go?

437
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:40,000
Yes, all right.

438
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,570
They're tailing Myung Ji.

439
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,810
The detectives are behind her,
so they'll follow them, too.

440
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,710
I hope she goes
to where the notebook is.

441
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,580
They're all tailing her,
so she'll be caught eventually.

442
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,150
The notebook.

443
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,710
Ms. Choi Myung Ji.

444
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,480
- What do you want?
- You just hid a notebook, right?

445
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,150
- So what if it's a notebook?
- May I see it?

446
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,390
Why do you want to see it?

447
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,190
It seems like it may be
an important piece of evidence.

448
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,960
Darn it. I'm sick of hearing
about this evidence.

449
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,770
Go ahead.

450
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,410
(2025 Household Ledger)

451
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,250
You just tailed me, didn't you?

452
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,250
I get that
you're under investigation,

453
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,020
but are you allowed
to tail me blindly like this?

454
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,860
Isn't this
an infringement of human rights?

455
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,200
The detectives tailed her...

456
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,270
and got to the safe,

457
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,840
but the notebook was fake.

458
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,410
It was fake?

459
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,810
Then, where's the real one?

460
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,940
She must've left it in another safe.

461
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,480
I found it weird
that she moved so quickly.

462
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,320
She must've lured the detectives
to the fake notebook,

463
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,480
so the real one...

464
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,490
Se Young.
She must've asked Se Young.

465
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
Myung Ji, that sly woman.

466
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:17,130
She must've had Se Young
get her hands on the notebook.

467
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,160
We have to find it
before they get rid of it.

468
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,110
Did you bring the notebook?

469
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,770
Yes.

470
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,520
How did you get all the money
to tail Yu Jin,

471
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:50,260
keep her under your radar,
and find someone...

472
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,030
to cause the hit-and-run accident?

473
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,630
I made it
through real estate assets.

474
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,070
Did you make me do
illegal things at work...

475
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,640
to make this money?

476
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,500
Was that why you needed
so much money?

477
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,670
I did it all for you.

478
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,010
Sure. It's all my fault.

479
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,880
I should die.

480
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,480
- What are you talking about?
- I should've gone missing...

481
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,750
instead of Yu Jin on that day.

482
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,090
I should've died.

483
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,860
What's with you now?

484
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,890
Do you know what I regret the most?

485
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,730
Lying on that day,

486
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,230
and only trusting your words...

487
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,900
and living my life
only as you told me!

488
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,530
You lived your life in luxury...

489
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,600
all thanks to me.
Do not talk to me like this.

490
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,970
Just listen to me.

491
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,870
Then, you'll live a good life
even in the future.

492
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,340
I'm not going
to live like this anymore.

493
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,510
Did you think
your life would've been better...

494
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,880
if you spilled the truth back then?

495
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,980
You're my daughter.

496
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,450
If I instigated the accident,
then it'd make you my accomplice.

497
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,420
Stop calling me an accomplice!

498
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,260
Do you enjoy making me
an accomplice in your murder?

499
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,530
I'm not doing this gladly.

500
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,530
You just won't listen!

501
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,940
I have to burn this first.

502
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,090
Darn it. Come on, catch on fire.

503
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,560
My gosh.

504
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,960
Close the door. It'll smell.

505
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,620
Where's your mom?

506
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,870
- Get out.
- No.

507
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,380
Get out of here.

508
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,880
- Get out.
- Let go of me!

509
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,880
- Go!
- No!

510
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,080
- Get out of here!
- No!

511
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,680
Get out of here. Get out!

(Cinderella Game)

513
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:20,340
Do you want to live
like your mother?

514
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,040
Your mother, Choi Myung Ji,

515
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,170
was the reason
behind all these tragedies.

516
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,810
I don't know how I feel.

517
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,210
Would it help
if someone else was by your side?

518
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:29,250
- Someone else?
- Did you know...

519
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:30,480
Se Young tried to kill herself?

520
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,280
How can you say that now?

521
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,850
I'm so sorry.

522
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,620
You can make the decision.

523
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,920
It's your life.

524
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,460
I don't think my mom will change.

525
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,690
But I'll do what I can.
