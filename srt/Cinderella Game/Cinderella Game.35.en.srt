1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,109
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,550
(Episode 35)

5
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,429
Did she make
a fake daughter to test me,

6
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,500
just as Detective Cho said?

7
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,909
Yes, I knew it seemed suspicious
how she took down...

8
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:38,880
both the fireplace and the wooden swing
on the same day.

9
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,179
She wouldn't get rid of those...

10
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,049
even if she found out
that Yu Jin died.

11
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,149
- Mom.
- Yes?

12
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,289
Is Aunt Yeo Jin here?

13
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:50,859
No, she went to see Yu Jin.

14
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,359
Didn't you go with her?

15
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:54,530
She insisted that she'd go alone.

16
00:00:55,189 --> 00:00:57,329
Shouldn't you find out who she is?

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,229
Just save your energy.
We'll see her when she moves in.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,700
I felt so relieved
that she got rid of everything...

19
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,239
that belonged to her.

20
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,140
Who cares?
She's actually moving in here.

21
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,579
She's fake, Se Young.

22
00:01:12,409 --> 00:01:14,980
She's nothing but a toy.

23
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,519
I'll keep the toy under control...

24
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,950
so you can sit back and watch.

25
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,819
- How?
- You'll see.

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,420
I'm going to find out...

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,230
what your aunt and the fake girl
have on their agenda...

28
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,329
to deceive us and move in with us.

29
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,659
I think
this is going to be really fun.

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,829
- Are you going out to meet Jin Goo?
- Yes.

31
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,670
He's working out, so I'll wait
and have dinner with him, too.

32
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:38,969
All right.

33
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:48,810
Ms. Goo was my lost daughter.

34
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,719
I can't believe this.

35
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,849
Did you conduct
the parentage test and all?

36
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,890
You could've gotten her
confused with someone else.

37
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,060
We have
the parentage test result here.

38
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,069
Why did you pinch me?

39
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:13,400
- So, it's real.
- It is.

40
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,770
Say something, Ha Na.

41
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,939
She's right.

42
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,110
I'm sorry
for not telling you sooner.

43
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,250
I asked her not to.

44
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,479
I have a favor to ask of you, too.

45
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,020
- "A favor?"
- "A favor?"

46
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,419
I'll keep finding Ha Na a secret
for a while.

47
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,490
If I made this public,
she could become a target...

48
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,960
just because she was my daughter.

49
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:40,270
So, she'll come and live with me.

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,000
Is this true, Ha Na?

51
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:48,569
I'm thinking about it.

52
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:50,979
It's for your safety.

53
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:53,439
Also, it's only natural
for you to live with your mom.

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,949
It's sad to say goodbye to her,

55
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,919
but we should let her go
for her sake.

56
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,560
Then, do I not get to live
with Auntie Ha Na?

57
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,830
You'll move into my place...

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,729
with Auntie Ha Na.

59
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,000
Really? All right!

60
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,030
What about me? I also want to...

61
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:19,069
If this is the best for you,
then I'll be fine.

62
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,370
I mean it, Ha Na.

63
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,009
Right. I should relay
this great news to Ji Seok, too.

64
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:28,449
I'll talk to Director Goo myself.

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,990
One moment, Ms. Chairwoman.

66
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,870
Maybe that was Grandpa.

67
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,469
He said he'd be late today.

68
00:03:49,469 --> 00:03:51,000
Then, was it Ji Seok?

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,469
He wouldn't come here.

70
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,409
It must've been the passing wind.

71
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,020
Director Goo?

72
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,800
I think he heard everything.

73
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,069
Why did he just leave?

74
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,509
Ha Na was
Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

75
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:37,779
But Ha Na's dad died,

76
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,920
and Chairwoman Shin's husband
had left home.

77
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,720
If Ha Na really were
Chairwoman Shin's daughter,

78
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,660
then it must mean she ruined
her husband's friend's business...

79
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,230
and caused his death, too.

80
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,600
No.

81
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,870
If that was the case,
my dad would've known.

82
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,339
No!

83
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,060
Gosh.

84
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,269
Ji Seok?

85
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:35,269
Ji Seok.

86
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,579
You shouldn't speed
while driving in the alley.

87
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,790
Is something going on?

88
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,100
Are you okay?

89
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,509
Is something going on?

90
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,680
Go.

91
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,649
Is that you, Se Young?

92
00:06:20,649 --> 00:06:21,819
Mother.

93
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,389
What are you doing here?

94
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,420
Well...

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,699
He's the head director
of your workplace?

96
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:37,839
Wait, wasn't he the one
who took Jin Goo's position?

97
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,709
- Yes.
- Was he under the influence?

98
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,040
So, are you sure you're okay?

99
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,750
Shouldn't you take
an X-ray at the hospital?

100
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,649
I'm fine.
He just hit the bumper lightly.

101
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,649
And he wasn't driving
under the influence.

102
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:58,759
A man like that took Jin Goo's place
and became the head director?

103
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,990
What has the world come to?

104
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,800
Yes, right.

105
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,629
Have you met
the chairwoman's daughter?

106
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:10,399
No, has Jin Goo
not told you anything?

107
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,269
He didn't know anything, either.

108
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,279
I was so happy for her
and wanted to tell everyone,

109
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:19,439
but she told me to keep it a secret.

110
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,449
That's why I feel so antsy
to keep this to myself.

111
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,689
Mother, I should
go to a car repair shop. I'm sorry.

112
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,930
Gosh, you came out
only to get into an accident.

113
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,689
- Be careful on the road.
- Okay.

114
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,769
What happened to him?
He was so out of it.

115
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,740
He caused an accident
and even vomited.

116
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,180
I thought Goo Ha Na
lived in this area.

117
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,250
Did something happen at her place?

118
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,990
Please think of me
as your mother from now on.

119
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,589
You're all like my children
if you're Ha Na's siblings.

120
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,160
And Eun Chong is my grandson.

121
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,160
Really?

122
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,699
And you two were
all working at my company.

123
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,930
If there was some department
or project you wanted to do,

124
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,129
please let me know.

125
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:16,300
I'll give you as much support
as I can.

126
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,269
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

127
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,639
Thank you.

128
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,410
Thank you...

129
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,350
for showing your concern
for my siblings and even Eun Chong.

130
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,879
Of course, I should look after them.

131
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,179
Again, please keep this a secret.

132
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,919
Okay. Please don't worry.

133
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,320
Zipped.

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,360
- See you later, Eun Chong.
- Okay.

135
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,690
- Goodbye, Ms. Chairwoman.
- Bye.

136
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,059
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

137
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,039
- Did it hurt?
- Yes.

138
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,169
- Did that hurt?
- Yes.

139
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,639
What does this mean?

140
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,009
We hit the jackpot!

141
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,309
It's a secret!

142
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,350
- Hey, whatever. Get in here.
- Hey, get in here already.

143
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,149
- All right!
- Yes!

144
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,590
Why don't you move in next weekend?

145
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,360
I want to live with you
as soon as possible.

146
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:16,889
You can just bring Eun Chong
and move in.

147
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,830
I got everything ready for you.

148
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,730
I must be rushing things.

149
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,440
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,899
No, it's all right.

151
00:09:29,409 --> 00:09:30,580
I'll do that.

152
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:32,740
Thank you.

153
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,649
You can ask Jin Goo or Ms. Jang
if you have questions.

154
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:36,809
Okay.

155
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,350
Head Director Goo was here just now.

156
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,649
Ji Seok was here?

157
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,059
It seemed like
he heard what you said.

158
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,659
Then, why did he leave
instead of coming in?

159
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:06,279
Ms. Goo was my lost daughter.

160
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,080
I am Ha Na's birth mother.

161
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,549
When did everything go wrong?

162
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,220
Mr. Goo.

163
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,590
- I have to move?
- Yes.

164
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:23,889
It wouldn't be easy for you
to live in this huge place alone.

165
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,700
Why don't you find a place
like a studio apartment?

166
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,070
Uncle Ji Chang,
will you not live here anymore?

167
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,940
I could go to a much better place
from now on, so why should I?

168
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,970
Is something going on?

169
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,379
- Yes. Actually, my sister...
- Quiet.

170
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,679
Yes, right.

171
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:44,419
This is highly confidential,

172
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:47,179
so please understand
that I can't tell you.

173
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:50,919
If it's not easy for you to move,
feel free to enjoy the huge space.

174
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,820
We can let you do that.

175
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,690
Eun Chong, are you moving, too?

176
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:58,830
Yes, I'm going with Auntie Ha Na
to my bestie grandma's...

177
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,330
Anyway, our family will
go through a huge change.

178
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,370
I should go plan my business.

179
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,440
No, this isn't my room.

180
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,049
In the end, everything went
as you hoped, Yeo Jin.

181
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,120
Did something good happen?

182
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,659
Did the guy you met
on a blind date propose to you?

183
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,360
I couldn't care less
about a guy like that.

184
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,559
You said he was a real estate mogul
and an only son.

185
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,230
Not all fortunes are the same.

186
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,700
There are different levels
of richness.

187
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,870
I prefer old money to new money.

188
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,679
Right. Have you heard?

189
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:48,179
It's Mr. Goo and Yoon Se Young.

190
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,580
A few days ago, someone saw him
in front of a restaurant...

191
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,919
putting his coat over Yoon Se Young
and taking her somewhere.

192
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,289
"Taking her?"

193
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:58,059
It looked like they were
going up to the room.

194
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,059
Hey. "The room?" Darn it.

195
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,029
Who started this rumor?

196
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,559
Was it you?

197
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:06,399
If you say the wrong thing,

198
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,629
I may end up firing you.

199
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,039
The chairwoman of our hotel is
my sister...

200
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,639
Gosh, whatever.
You better be careful.

201
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:18,779
Okay. Fine.

202
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,740
It's Yoon Se Young again.

203
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,179
Is there really something going on
between the two?

204
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,980
What are you going to do?

205
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,490
It seems odd
no matter how much I think about it.

206
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,220
My parents
and Ha Na's dad were friends.

207
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,059
It would mean they were friends
with Chairwoman Shin's husband.

208
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,899
That would mean she took
her husband's friend's business...

209
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,460
and drove him to death.

210
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,870
That too.

211
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,000
Also, her daughter
went missing when she was ten,

212
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,340
but my sister lost her dad in a fire
when she was seven.

213
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:50,269
And she went to the children's home
and then got adopted by us at ten.

214
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,240
Your sister must know
those facts, too.

215
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,080
Let me check the news article.

216
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
It says she went missing
when she was seven.

217
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,789
(Yoon Yu Jin, age 7, went missing.)

218
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,830
I remember her as ten.

219
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,529
I'll look up other articles, too.

220
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,600
(Chairwoman Shin)

221
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,370
- Hello?
- It's me, Shin Yeo Jin.

222
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,139
May I see you right now?

223
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,019
- Come on in, Mr. Goo.
- You're here.

224
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,789
I didn't expect to see you here.

225
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,559
I thought we should
have a talk together.

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,340
I heard you were at home before,

227
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,570
so you must've heard already.

228
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,840
I am Ha Na's birth mother.

229
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,480
I didn't know we had
such a profound connection.

230
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,350
More like
the worst ill-fated relationship.

231
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,149
You're my family's enemy.

232
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,090
I honestly find it hard to believe.

233
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,360
We already did the parentage test.
Why is that?

234
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,789
Ha Na's dad already died,

235
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,799
but wasn't your husband
just away from home?

236
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,500
You're right.
Some facts do not align.

237
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:24,470
I already explained that to Ha Na.

238
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,000
I don't have memories
from my childhood, right?

239
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,940
The same goes
for the memories of my dad.

240
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:32,679
It seemed like my dad was
someone who saved me...

241
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,379
when I was lost by the sea,
but not my biological dad.

242
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,710
So, he isn't your biological father?

243
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,220
Where do you get the idea
to imagine something like that?

244
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:43,549
I'm Ha Na's mom,
so how can he be her dad?

245
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,289
There's a possibility that
my memories were distorted...

246
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,889
and erased after the two accidents,
my disappearance and the fire.

247
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,830
Then, what about
your daughter's disappearance.

248
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:56,470
I believe she went missing at ten.
But Ha Na...

249
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,669
came to my place at ten.

250
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,299
You have the wrong information.

251
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,610
She went missing when she was seven.

252
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,710
Did she...

253
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,980
really go missing
when she was seven?

254
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,679
Yes, there was a discrepancy
between the ages of her disappearance.

255
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,179
We had different memories of it, too.

256
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,690
That was why we conducted
a parentage test.

257
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,490
You need to run
the parentage test again.

258
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,789
How can you tell me
to do the test again...

259
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,230
with the chairwoman sitting here?

260
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,000
I get how this is hard to accept.
I felt the same way, too.

261
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:30,529
But please show some respect.
She's my birth mother.

262
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:33,840
- That darned respect.
- Ji Seok.

263
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,409
It's all right.

264
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,450
I understand
why he is suspicious of me.

265
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,149
However, I thought you'd be happier
than anyone.

266
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:47,149
That was unexpected.

267
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,889
If she was your daughter
just as you said,

268
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,889
then you would've repaid
my parents' kindness with evil.

269
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,690
Do you get it?

270
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,700
If you're done, may I leave?

271
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,029
Ji Seok.

272
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:04,840
Your distrust won't change the fact
that Ha Na is my daughter.

273
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,940
However, I do have one request.

274
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,809
Please keep it a secret for a while.

275
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:14,110
Only your siblings,
Mr. Hwang, and Ms. Goo know...

276
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,009
that she's my daughter.

277
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,980
Even Ms. Yoon
and her mother don't know.

278
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,779
Why don't they know?

279
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:22,419
They'll come and meet her
as soon as they find out.

280
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,820
Then, it'll be much easier
for anyone outside to find out.

281
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,690
I'll keep it a secret
until Ha Na moves in with me.

282
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,759
Are you going to live at her place?

283
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,700
Yes.

284
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,070
I'll keep the secret.

285
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,269
Ji Seok.

286
00:16:44,909 --> 00:16:46,679
Let's give him some time.

287
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,450
But I thought
he'd be as happy as you...

288
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:52,379
when you said
he was like a real sibling.

289
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,490
I didn't expect him
to respond that sensitively...

290
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,919
when I told him I was your mom.

291
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,430
You seemed quite startled.

292
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,000
You also left right away
when you heard them at home.

293
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,769
Were you the one
who let Ha Na meet...

294
00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:13,940
with Chairwoman Shin?

295
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,279
Yes, the chairwoman wanted to do
a parentage test,

296
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,710
so I did relay it to Ms. Goo.

297
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,380
Did you run
the parentage test yourself?

298
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,819
Yes, is there a problem?

299
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:26,880
"A problem?"

300
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,430
It must be nice...

301
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,029
to live such a simple life.

302
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,099
Does he mean that
his life isn't simple?

303
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,240
Why does he look so serious?

304
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:54,549
Is there a reason why she can't be
the chairwoman's daughter?

305
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:58,650
Isn't it cold?

306
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,720
It feels refreshing at heart
to breathe in cold air.

307
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:06,289
Did you feel frustrated?
Do you want something cool to drink?

308
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,359
- Something hot.
- My treat.

309
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,890
No, I want to treat you.
I owe you 50 dollars anyway.

310
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,230
What do you feel like?

311
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,630
- Something hot.
- Okay.

312
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,279
I get how this is hard to accept.
I felt the same way, too.

313
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,920
But please show some respect.
She's my birth mother.

314
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,390
Hwang Jin Goo
went to St. Paul's Home...

315
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,259
- two days in a row?
- Yes.

316
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:43,029
Yesterday, Chairwoman Shin
must've gone there with him.

317
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:45,230
Yes, I'm sure
she's looking for her daughter.

318
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:46,829
That was why Chairwoman Shin...

319
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,240
went to the children's home
where Ha Na grew up.

320
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,009
(Yoon Se Young)

321
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,180
The person you have reached
is unavailable. Please leave...

322
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,859
Are you all right?

323
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,759
(Are you all right?)

324
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,779
I called. Didn't you see it?

325
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,180
You ignored my call
and my text message.

326
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,450
"Are you all right?"

327
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,190
Why do you want to know
if I'm all right?

328
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,259
Right?

329
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,289
That was something
you should've said...

330
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,430
as the perpetrator
of the car accident.

331
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,630
Right. The car accident.

332
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:28,369
Sorry. You aren't hurt, are you?

333
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,599
You can talk to my secretary
and claim for the damage.

334
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,940
Did something happen
at Goo Ha Na's place?

335
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,849
What made you drive
completely out of your mind?

336
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:48,619
Things will become interesting
between you and Ha Na from now on.

337
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:51,150
You poor thing, Se Young.

338
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,859
- Why do you call me poor?
- Do you want to come in and hear...

339
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,759
- why I find you poor?
- Stop coming onto me.

340
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,859
I know all about your tricks.

341
00:20:59,099 --> 00:21:01,829
All right.
I shouldn't have said that.

342
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:15,109
I can't believe you're a regular
at my favorite restaurant.

343
00:21:15,549 --> 00:21:16,680
Right?

344
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,849
I've been a regular
for 20 years now.

345
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:21,049
- How long have you been coming?
- About ten years.

346
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,250
I was nearby
at a hospital with my mom,

347
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,289
then decided to settle here
when it came to sundae soup.

348
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,829
So, I've been coming
for much longer.

349
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,460
Then, let me set the table
as the newbie.

350
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,500
Okay.

351
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,869
Hey, I know you, too.

352
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,210
How did you two
end up coming together?

353
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,480
Well, he's the president
of my workplace.

354
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,680
I see. Is that so?

355
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,119
Your eldest brother came by
with an older man.

356
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,349
Did he?

357
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,920
This is on the house.

358
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,049
Enjoy.

359
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

360
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,130
So, Mr. Goo comes here, too?

361
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,700
We've been coming
since when our parents were around,

362
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,059
and she remembered us
every time we'd come.

363
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,630
And she gives us
extra food on the house.

364
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:10,569
Thank you for bringing me
to a meaningful place like this.

365
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,700
Eat up.

366
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:22,950
- You know how to eat this.
- It's basically the rule.

367
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,579
All my family would
start shaking the rice...

368
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:34,619
You should throw in kimchi juice
and seasoned chives, too.

369
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,259
Thank you.

370
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,430
You won't drift apart from Mr. Goo
because of the chairwoman, will you?

371
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,670
Of course not.

372
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,539
He'll be fine over time.

373
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,109
Ji Seok had always hoped...

374
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,609
I would find my happiness.

375
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:00,279
Why don't we become happy
with this sundae soup right now?

376
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,019
Okay.

377
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,529
Please be happy.

378
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,940
I'll do my best to help.

379
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,279
Everything will go well, right?

380
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:33,250
Yes, Mr. Goo may call you tomorrow
and congratulate you.

381
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:35,650
I hope that happens.

382
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,089
Then, I'd feel
so warm at heart this winter.

383
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,289
Do you like winter?

384
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,230
I prefer the cold to the heat.

385
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,269
- What about you?
- I also like winter.

386
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,599
It's such a warm season.

387
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,900
Do we say winter is warm?

388
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,609
Fish buns, red bean buns,
fish cake soup, baked sweet potato,

389
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,339
mufflers, and fur gloves.

390
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:01,950
These are all warm things.

391
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,380
And we wear long johns, too.

392
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,819
That's why I like winter.

393
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:08,650
I see. Winter was a warm season.

394
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:13,190
So, why aren't you wearing
a muffler and fur gloves?

395
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,089
You should keep yourself warm.

396
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,759
Gosh, it's all right.

397
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,839
I'll also give you my gloves
if you turn this down.

398
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:29,539
Well, if someone saw that,
would they take it the wrong way again?

399
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:30,910
Yes.

400
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,549
It's on you anyway,
so keep it until you reach home.

401
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,849
Then, thank you.

402
00:24:44,289 --> 00:24:48,359
I really hope
this winter stays warm.

403
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,089
Mom.

404
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,789
Dad.

405
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,829
Can you believe this?

406
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,630
Ha Na was...

407
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,700
Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

408
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,339
How...

409
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:37,940
How can this happen?

410
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:43,450
Think of how you two passed away.

411
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:47,380
Think of...

412
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:52,089
Think of everything I went through
to be here right now.

413
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,059
Mom...

414
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,140
One, two, three.

415
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,609
- Say cheese!
- Say cheese!

416
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,789
Keep your hands warm
before you go to sleep.

417
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,789
How can you play well tomorrow
with those hands?

418
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,359
Thank you.

419
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,660
- Ji Seok.
- Ha Na.

420
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,829
The police said
our mommy and daddy died.

421
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,799
No, right?

422
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:40,440
They didn't die, did they?

423
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,109
I'm going to make money.

424
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:45,079
I've been doing that.
I'll pick up more part-time jobs.

425
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm not in a position
to sit around and study at ease.

426
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:50,279
I have to make a living for my
siblings as the head of the family.

427
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,720
I'll pick up more jobs.

428
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,119
I don't want that!

429
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,190
Run away, Ha Na.

430
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,420
Run away.

431
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,000
Hey, Ji Seok.

432
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:47,200
Today? What time?

433
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,369
Okay. Bye.

434
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:57,809
Mr. Goo may call you tomorrow
and congratulate you.

435
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:13,500
Ji Seok.

436
00:28:16,769 --> 00:28:18,369
Have you had breakfast?

437
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,869
You probably couldn't sleep.

438
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,180
- Have some tea.
- Okay.

439
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,650
Yesterday, I was a bit...

440
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,779
Do you have another reason to think
you're Chairwoman Shin's daughter...

441
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:36,690
other than the parentage test?

442
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,319
The circumstances point that way.

443
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,289
I was oddly involved
with the chairwoman...

444
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:44,390
as soon as I started
at Hyesung Tour.

445
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,829
She bought me that dress
at the department store,

446
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:50,769
she once cried at a market
when I was there,

447
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,940
and she sent the food
for our parents' memorial service.

448
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,309
Did she think...

449
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,039
you were her daughter
starting back then?

450
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:00,380
I guess so.

451
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,509
When I was beaten
by Ms. Yoon's mother,

452
00:29:03,849 --> 00:29:05,180
she sincerely covered for me...

453
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:06,819
That's enough.

454
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,519
We did the parentage test...

455
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,049
because we couldn't trust
the circumstances.

456
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,519
You recently asked if I knew...

457
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,559
someone named Yoon Yu Jin
at the children's home...

458
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,190
because she was
the chairwoman's daughter, right?

459
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,799
My real name was Yoon Yu Jin.

460
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,299
I questioned the kindness
she had shown all along,

461
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,069
so it felt like the puzzle pieces
finally came together.

462
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,609
If I weren't her real daughter,
why would she call...

463
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,480
an ordinary girl like me
her daughter?

464
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,779
Ji Seok, I know
you hold animosity against her...

465
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:43,690
because of your business.

466
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,160
Of course, work is important,

467
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,420
but it's not as important
as your family.

468
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,259
I'm not forcing anything.

469
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,200
I'll wait until you accept this.

470
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,809
Do you feel happy to be...

471
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:05,640
Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

472
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:10,509
I met the woman who gave birth to me.

473
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,349
Yes, I'm happy.

474
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,119
But still, my foster parents are...

475
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:16,920
my first parents to me.

476
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:20,190
All of you are
my dearest family, too.

477
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,589
That'll never change.

478
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,160
To our family, she's...

479
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:24,660
What?

480
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:26,559
To our family, she's an enemy.

481
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,369
You just became
the enemy's daughter.

482
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,769
Please be happy for me, Ji Seok.

483
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,410
I want you to celebrate with me
more than anyone.

484
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:37,039
I'd feel like...

485
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,839
I was really her daughter
only if you celebrated with me.

486
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:45,349
Will you do that?

487
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:48,519
I won't.

488
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:51,720
You can live
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

489
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:53,390
We'll manage on our own.

490
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,890
I'll talk to Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

491
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:58,960
What do you mean?

492
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,299
Please sever your ties...

493
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,000
with Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

494
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,099
Goo Ji Seok.

495
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,140
Why are you doing this again?

496
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,079
I try to understand you,
but it's just impossible!

497
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,640
It's not like I'm your enemy.

498
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,279
Don't you think you're too harsh?

499
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:18,980
Yes, you are my enemy.

500
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,650
See? It would've been better
if you left when my parents passed.

501
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,460
You kept sticking around
even when I told you to leave.

502
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,029
It must've been for you to leave
after you met your birth mother.

503
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:30,990
Stop saying what you don't mean.

504
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,759
And don't talk like
severing our ties are that easy.

505
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:38,470
All of you are family to me.

506
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:40,700
- The chairwoman is...
- Chairwoman Shin must be something.

507
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,710
She severed...

508
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,880
our 20 years in an instant.

509
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,980
- I said, that was enough.
- This is it for us.

510
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,220
Have a good life.

511
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:57,420
Ji Seok.

512
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:02,960
Hey! Ji Seok!

513
00:32:04,359 --> 00:32:05,500
Ji Seok.

514
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,470
Ji Seok...

515
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,759
(Cinderella Game)

516
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,200
Did you say you wouldn't accept
how she was the chairwoman's daughter?

517
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,670
From now on,
Eun Chong and I are her family.

518
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:22,240
You have no idea
you're holding onto a decaying lifeline.

519
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,339
Everything I have is yours.

520
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,779
Why do you take things this far?

521
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,509
It's even better.

522
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,950
I'll compensate her that much.

523
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,980
Should I start my plans
before her fake daughter comes?

524
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:36,420
You should've come to me
while the offer was valid.

525
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,319
Should we do it again
under the camera?
