1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,210
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,110
(Episode 89)

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,620
The court must've been crazy...

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,090
to grant this to you.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,820
You. What are you doing?

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,890
Watch your attitude when you speak.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,030
You two are both ridiculous.

10
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,330
Take him and go to your room.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,970
Eun Chong, come with me.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,240
It's all because the judge didn't know
how dangerous you were.

13
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,280
I'll tell them all about you...

14
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,150
and request a revocation.

15
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,320
What makes me so dangerous?

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,220
I adore him so much.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,990
Was that why you drugged him
to put him to sleep,

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,330
then locked him up inside?

19
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,130
You put Chairwoman Shin into a coma,

20
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,900
- didn't you?
- I can't deal with this.

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,270
I saved her.

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,370
What about the hit-and-run accident?

23
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,480
- What?
- You instigated...

24
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,750
Du Na's hit-and-run accident,
didn't you?

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,080
You were the landlady...

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,550
she met, weren't you?

27
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,760
Did you want
to reopen the investigation?

28
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,670
It doesn't matter what you do.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,940
You can't even make me flinch.

30
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,640
This is getting
more and more ridiculous.

31
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,610
Hey, if I knew about Yu Jin,
I would've told Yeo Jin.

32
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,280
- For 20 years, why would I...
- Because you wanted Hyesung Group.

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,790
And that's also the reason
why you want to take Eun Chong now.

34
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,390
You're free to think
however you like.

35
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
It doesn't matter what you say.

36
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,630
I'm taking Eun Chong with me.

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,270
Yes, come inside.

38
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,250
Why did you let a stranger in?

39
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,680
We'll leave soon...

40
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,650
as long as you two cooperate.

41
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,360
Ms. Choi Myung Ji is
Lee Eun Chong's legal guardian.

42
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,020
She has the right to take the boy
and look after him starting today.

43
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,930
I'll request a revocation.

44
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,430
- She can't take him.
- She can't take him.

45
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,030
You can do whatever you want.

46
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,130
But Ms. Choi has
legal rights over him.

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,340
What about the child's opinion?

48
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,140
Eun Chong doesn't want to go.

49
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,610
Of course, his opinion is important.

50
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,010
But according to the current law,
opinions of children under 12...

51
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,610
aren't legally binding,
but are considered only a reference.

52
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,950
She's a dangerous woman
who can hurt him!

53
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,180
You must provide clear evidence...

54
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,450
to prove the child can face danger.

55
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,560
Do you have evidence?

56
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,660
I do.

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,730
I'll get rid of whatever stands
in the way of your future with her,

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,410
no matter who it may be.

59
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,510
Eun Chong won't be an exception.

60
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,580
She recorded this without consent.

61
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,520
Also, anyone can
make empty threats in words.

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,850
I will not let a child abuser
take Eun Chong.

63
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:36,920
If you stop his legal guardian
from taking him,

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,460
you'll be considered as holding him
under illegal confinement.

65
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,930
What kind of law is that?

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,960
- Ha Na is his foster mother...
- That's the current law.

67
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,280
Eun Chong.

68
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,140
Auntie Ha Na...

69
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,780
Come here.

70
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,250
All right.

71
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:13,660
I don't want to go
with Little Grandma.

72
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,760
I don't want to let you go, either.

73
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,260
But Grandma's hospitalized,

74
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,500
so your little grandma
became your guardian now.

75
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,170
Even police officers can't help us.

76
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,150
Grandpa will come and get you soon
after he becomes your guardian.

77
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,420
So, hang in there until then. Okay?

78
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,380
You have to promise.

79
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,290
Yes. Don't cry from now on.

80
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,660
I won't cry.

81
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,660
And tuck in all the way
when you go to sleep.

82
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,200
Okay.

83
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,670
Juice or water from Little Grandma
can make you sleepy,

84
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,910
so pour your own beverages
when you get thirsty. Okay?

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,140
Okay.

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,810
Call me if anything happens.

87
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,050
I'll call you often, too.

88
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,420
Come in.

89
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,730
This is your home, Eun Chong.

90
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,530
Mr. Hwang's place isn't your place.

91
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,940
She's right. Who's your grandmother?

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,940
You are
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin's grandson.

93
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,140
That means you have to stay here.

94
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,180
Grandma will come here
when she gets discharged,

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,110
and Grandpa will also come here
when the police release him.

96
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,280
Why did police officers
take Grandpa away?

97
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,420
He probably did something wrong.

98
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,960
Eun Chong, do you want orange juice?

99
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,160
I don't like the sleepy juice.

100
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,730
Then, do you want water?

101
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:59,230
I'll get it myself.

102
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,140
He was probably told
not to take anything from me.

103
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,600
What will you do with him?

104
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,110
I'll send him to study abroad.

105
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,240
Leave within this week.

106
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,910
Just Eun Chong and me?

107
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,750
I'll be there, too.

108
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,220
I have to go to avoid an arrest
when the hit-and-run case reopens.

109
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,420
Start planning your study abroad
starting tomorrow.

110
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,120
Don't let anyone find out.

111
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,260
When should I turn in
my request for a leave?

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:29,290
Go abroad first,
then e-mail it or something.

113
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,400
Just as we expected,

114
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,570
Choi Myung Ji had been planning
to become Eun Chong's guardian.

115
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I didn't expect her
to take him like this.

116
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,770
Do you think he'll be okay?

117
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,940
She took him,
so she wouldn't do anything weird.

118
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:48,380
Turn in a request for revocation
to the court tomorrow.

119
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,580
I'll talk to an attorney and see
if Mr. Yoon can be...

120
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,850
booked without detention.

121
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,580
Okay.

122
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,990
You were very brave back there.

123
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,990
"You instigated
Du Na's hit-and-run accident!"

124
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,590
"You were the landlady, too!"

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,900
It's a do-or-die situation
for me, too.

126
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,500
Gosh, I need to find evidence.

127
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,270
They reopened the case,
so we should trust them and wait.

128
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,240
I put all my faith in it.

129
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,350
Did you make sure
you weren't tailed?

130
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,220
Of course. I've been a professional
for a long time.

131
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,520
But you got the driver's face
caught on CCTV.

132
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,390
What if he gets caught soon?

133
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,860
Even if he does,
you have nothing to worry about.

134
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,330
You're why he's making a living,
so he won't come clean.

135
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,230
Make sure you keep him quiet.

136
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,270
You still need to offer
some more money.

137
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,110
I'll keep my eyes
on the investigation and decide...

138
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,910
if I'll give you more or not.

139
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,580
Eun Chong,
did you get there all right?

140
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,280
Yes, I kept my promise
and didn't cry.

141
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,450
What about you?

142
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,450
Good. I didn't cry, either.

143
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,390
Eun Chong, you're a brave boy.

144
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,820
I got thirsty,
so I poured my own water, too.

145
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,890
Great job.

146
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,660
But Auntie Ha Na,
I miss you already.

147
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,030
Me, too.

148
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,830
I always miss you,
even when I'm with you.

149
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,000
- You miss me when you're with me?
- Yes.

150
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,910
Eun Chong,
I'll call you again later.

151
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,710
Bye.

152
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,150
He still sounds happy.

153
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,560
I also miss you
even when I'm with you.

154
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,960
Jeez.
You made use of that right away?

155
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,630
I'm happy to see you smile.

156
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,770
Don't worry too much.

157
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,840
I won't.

158
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,520
My gosh.

159
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,820
Ji Seok.

160
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,530
Bye, Ha Na.

161
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,030
Bye.

162
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,210
May I...

163
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,840
have a word with you?

164
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,420
- Are you dating Ha Na?
- Yes.

165
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,920
You may not like it,
but please give us your support.

166
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,360
Sure.

167
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,560
Why did you want to see me?

168
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,430
Choi Myung Ji
took Eun Chong just now.

169
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,830
She became his legal guardian.

170
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:57,670
I heard Mr. Yoon was
going to be his guardian.

171
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,370
He was detained,
so the process couldn't proceed.

172
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,280
He needs to be released...

173
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,280
as soon as possible
to take Eun Chong from her.

174
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,410
Are you asking me to help him
get booked without detention?

175
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,720
Yes.

176
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,320
I'm not that powerful.

177
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,360
He was detained with the possibility
of evidence destruction and flight.

178
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,630
What if you vouch for him?

179
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,830
First, you should handle
Mr. Yoon's identity fraud...

180
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,100
and illegal stay,
then make your case after.

181
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,400
The police won't object...

182
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:35,210
if you vouch for him.

183
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,310
Go through immigration procedure
under his name, Yoon Sung Ho,

184
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,680
and handle Richard Han's status
as an illegal alien.

(Petition for Yoon Sung Ho,
Petitioner: Goo Ji Seok)

187
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,570
The suspect, Yoon Sung Ho,

188
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,240
helped me live once again
after I lost my parents.

189
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,910
He did help with my revenge,

190
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:14,050
but at the same time, he was truly in love
with his wife, Shin Yeo Jin.

191
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:18,750
He gave up
on living an ordinary life...

192
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:23,550
and atoned for his wife's fault
with victims of her corporate raids,

193
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,290
sacrificing himself
to cover up for his wife's mistakes.

"Attempted murder?"

196
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:45,710
That's crazy.
He did that to Chairwoman Shin?

197
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,610
So, her husband was framed?

198
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,950
That's right.
Mr. Yoon would never do that.

199
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,280
I guarantee it.

200
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,750
Please sign the petition.

201
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,920
Yes, of course.
I'll help out right away.

202
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,460
I hope this helps.

203
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,500
Everything will go well.

204
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

205
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you up to?

206
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,500
Please sign it, too, Ms. Yoon.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,170
A petition?

208
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,480
Jin Goo and Ha Na are...

209
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,780
gathering signatures to book
Uncle Sung Ho without detention.

210
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,050
Those two always do
the most annoying things.

211
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,750
What happens once he gets released?

212
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,920
Nothing.
We'll go abroad with Eun Chong.

213
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,020
What if he gets released
before we go study abroad?

214
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,130
Are you leaving to study abroad?

215
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,860
Bye, Mom.

216
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:41,930
I'm thinking about it.

217
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,370
She's suddenly moving abroad?

218
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,480
Did you sign it?

219
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,250
Who do you think you are to do this?

220
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,050
He needs to be released
to act as Eun Chong's guardian.

221
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,120
I can't let someone like your mom
raise Eun Chong.

222
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,030
What about my mom?

223
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,890
She's good to Eun Chong.

224
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,530
You won't sign this anyway.

225
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,170
You'll side with your mother.

226
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,000
- Give that to me.
- What do you mean?

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,370
What did you mean by that?

228
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,470
- Are you saying my mom did that...
- Yes.

229
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,880
Your mom is the key suspect...

230
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,650
for attempted murder.

231
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,650
What?

232
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,220
Can you be responsible
for those words?

233
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,920
That's considered defamation.

234
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,090
She has no honor to protect.

235
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,760
She even plays around
with people's lives.

236
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,860
She plays around with lives?

237
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,570
Does she think
she can say whatever she wants?

238
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,610
Choi Myung Ji became
his legal guardian?

239
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,480
That was one thing I wanted to stop.

240
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,050
So, we're preparing a petition
to have you released.

241
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,850
Ji Seok is in the process
of reinstating your identity...

242
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,350
and handling
your immigration problems.

243
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,790
He is?

244
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:16,130
I've become indebted
to too many people.

245
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,490
Please don't think like that.

246
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,600
Eun Chong is your grandson,

247
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,570
but we all adore him.

248
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,930
He's right.

249
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,870
Thank you.

250
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,510
Ha Na turned in a request
to revoke her guardianship.

251
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,240
We can probably bring him back
as soon as they confirm...

252
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,180
how dangerous Choi Myung Ji is.

253
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,910
Thank you.

254
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:40,250
The police are identifying suspects
for the hit-and-run accident.

255
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,020
You two are doing
everything I should do.

256
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:45,720
I'll repay you.

257
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,960
- Sure.
- Sure.

258
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,160
Can I go and meet Auntie Ha Na?

259
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,670
You can meet her
whenever you want to.

260
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,700
Really?

261
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,740
Then, I want to visit Grandma
at the hospital with my auntie.

262
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,740
But Eun Chong, you know what?

263
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,750
Your grandma and grandpa...

264
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,950
did something really bad
to Auntie Ha Na's family.

265
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,850
What did they do?

266
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,650
I'll tell you when you grow up.

267
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,490
That's why they won't like it
if you go to her place.

268
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,460
That was why you had to go
to Mr. Hwang's place.

269
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,530
Auntie Ha Na likes me.

270
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:31,100
But her siblings don't.

271
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,570
Eun Chong,
you can't come here anymore.

272
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,680
Even if I have Grandma's permission?

273
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,880
No, don't come here.

274
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,680
It's Uncle Ji Chang.

275
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,650
Uncle Ji Chang, why are you hiding?

276
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,390
I didn't hide.
I was just standing here.

277
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,560
Even Grandpa was
arrested by the police.

278
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,070
So, I'm the only one...

279
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:03,170
who can look after you.

280
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,200
You have to go to a children's home
if you don't want to live with me.

281
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,770
Do you want to do that?

282
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,510
No.

283
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,950
So, you have to listen to me.

284
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,250
I'll go to my uncle's snack bar
and ask.

285
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,750
Do you want to do that?

286
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,920
Hello...

287
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,160
It's Choi Myung Ji.

288
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:31,200
Hey, Ji Chang! Come on out!

289
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,630
What is it?

290
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,470
Auntie Ji Eun, Uncle Ji Chang.

291
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:42,440
What is this?

292
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,110
Hey, Eun Chong.
I told you not to come here.

293
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:53,180
He had something to ask you two.

294
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,750
What is it?

295
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,290
Did my grandma do
something really bad...

296
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,820
to your parents?

297
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,130
Did she?

298
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,570
- Yes.
- Hey.

299
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,370
Stop it.

300
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,210
Mom, I came to pick you up.

301
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,920
You must be tired.
Why didn't you go home and rest?

302
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,190
How can I rest
while you're still working?

303
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,450
We need to rest together.

304
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:37,030
Anyway, what's going on
with the chairwoman's husband?

305
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,260
We wrote up a petition
to have him released.

306
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,200
- Do you want to sign it, too?
- Yes.

307
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,000
Give me lots of them.
I'll ask my staff for signatures.

308
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,370
I'm glad I came.

309
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,210
Are you asking us
to write a petition?

310
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,380
This is ridiculous.

311
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,420
She's right, Ha Na. This is wrong.

312
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,350
He stabbed us in the back,
so we felt really betrayed.

313
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,420
I know.

314
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:07,190
But Choi Myung Ji took Eun Chong.

315
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,530
Again? That was why she...

316
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,060
Anyway, that woman is
the biggest problem.

317
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,030
Ji Seok wrote a petition, too.

318
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,270
- He did?
- He did?

319
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,640
To be frank,
Chairwoman Shin is our enemy,

320
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,410
but Mr. Han was always good to us.

321
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,980
He saved Ji Seok's life
back in America.

322
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,210
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean?

323
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,710
Was he ill?

324
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:29,080
Was it an accident?

325
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,950
Anyway, sign this first.

(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

328
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,500
I wanted to save you.

329
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,760
The only thing
I could do to do that...

330
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,470
was to give you hope that
you can get your revenge on her.

331
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,270
It may sound like an excuse,

332
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,510
but would you have
accepted my help...

333
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,250
if I told you who my wife was?

334
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,120
In that case,
you might have died five years ago.

335
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,580
You should've just left me to die.

336
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,620
Then, I wouldn't have felt...

337
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,220
as miserable as I did.

338
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,630
I thought of you as my own.

339
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,570
When you trusted me and admired me,

340
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,070
I really thought of you as my son.

341
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,670
What brought you here?

342
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,570
I turned in my petition.

343
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,370
You'll be booked
without detention soon.

344
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,980
You should stay by Eun Chong's side.

345
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,910
Thank you.

346
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,520
I didn't do this
to make you thank me.

347
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,750
Don't let her take him from you.

348
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,260
Make sure you keep him safe.

349
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,760
- I will.
- Excuse me.

350
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:22,630
Ji Seok.

351
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,600
You asked if your revenge was
any significant because of my help.

352
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,570
You didn't complete your revenge
because of my help.

353
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,510
Actually, you helped me.

354
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:45,220
I was a coward
who denounced her from the back,

355
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,650
someone who couldn't stop Yeo Jin
in any way.

356
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,420
That was why I fled.

357
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,190
I always wanted to go back,
but I never had the courage.

358
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,060
Then, I ran into you.

359
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,030
I thought you'd be able to punish her
for everything she has done.

360
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,200
And you did.

361
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,140
I might have felt relieved, too.

362
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,440
I finally had the courage to return.

363
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,020
Thanks to you,

364
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,950
I could approach her once again.

365
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,760
I'm a sinner...

366
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,360
to both you and her.

367
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,530
I'll atone for this
for the rest of my life.

368
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,970
I'm sorry,

369
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,240
and thank you.

370
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,990
Eun Chong, did you pack everything?

371
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,660
Yes, are we
going somewhere tomorrow?

372
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,300
Eun Chong,
have you ever been on a plane?

373
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,600
No.

374
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,600
You'll have a lot of fun
on the flight.

375
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,740
- Let's go to a theme park, too.
- Okay.

376
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,340
After I leave the country tomorrow,

377
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:21,080
Yeo Jin can't do anything to harm me
even after she wakes up.

378
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,350
What's she going to do
as long as Eun Chong is in my hands?

379
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,190
Eun Chong, you can go play
in your playroom.

380
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,600
What did you say to him...

381
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,730
to make him so obedient?

382
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,100
I played my moves.

383
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,140
Make sure you check
if you're missing anything.

384
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,370
Okay.

385
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,210
I'm sorry, Auntie Ha Na.

386
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,280
Please forgive everything...

387
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,420
my grandma and grandpa did wrong
to your family.

388
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,160
(Auntie Ha Na)

389
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,270
Hello?

390
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,570
Hey, Eun Chong. Have you had dinner?

391
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,140
Yes.

392
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,640
What did you eat?

393
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,110
Pork cutlet.

394
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,780
That sounds delicious.

395
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,010
Anyway, why do you sound so down?

396
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,220
- Are you unwell?
- No.

397
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,820
What were you up to?

398
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,390
I was packing...

399
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,030
Do you want to play
a board game with me?

400
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,400
Hello? Eun Chong.

401
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,730
Auntie Ha Na...

402
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,140
Yes, Eun Chong?

403
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,570
Bye, now. I'm sleepy.

404
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,510
You're sleepy?

405
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,410
Okay. Goodnight.

406
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,280
Is something going on?

407
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,720
Hello?

408
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,260
Is something going on
with Eun Chong?

409
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,420
What do you mean?

410
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,890
He didn't sound well.

411
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,860
I was wondering if he was unwell.

412
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,000
Why would he be unwell?

413
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,500
He had
delicious pork cutlet for dinner,

414
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,140
then had fun with Se Young
in his playroom.

415
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,570
He must've been sleepy.

416
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,440
I'll go see him tomorrow.

417
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,980
No, I have to do something,
so not tomorrow.

418
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,110
Come on the weekend
to play with him.

419
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,080
- Do you mean it?
- I don't make up lies.

420
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,650
Come on the weekend.

421
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:49,530
I should lower her guard first
to catch her by surprise.

422
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,960
What has gotten into her?

423
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,400
If the weather is nice,

424
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,900
Eun Chong, Jin Goo,
and I should go to the Han River...

425
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,140
and get on the pedal boat.

426
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,580
I'll get some ingredients
to make gimbap.

427
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,610
(Maintain Order)

428
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:13,850
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, sir.

429
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
Thank you for everyone's hard work.

430
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,320
I just received a call.

431
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,160
They narrowed down the suspect
for the hit-and-run case to ten.

432
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,260
That's great news.

433
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,730
But first, I need to see Eun Chong.

434
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,900
Yes, sir. Let's go.

435
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:38,910
I don't think anyone's home.

436
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,540
No, it's quiet.

437
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,510
Did they all go out?

438
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,120
How may I help you?

439
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,760
I came to meet my grandson,
but no one seemed to be home.

440
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,890
Oh, the family went on a trip.

441
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,200
They just left, and they said
they'd be away for about a month.

442
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,630
- "A trip?"
- Do you know where they went?

443
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,000
I'm not sure.

444
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,610
Hello? Yes, Mr. Hwang.

445
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,810
Congratulations on your release.

446
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,550
Where are you?

447
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,250
I came to see Eun Chong,

448
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,020
but I heard Myung Ji
went on a trip with Eun Chong.

449
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,850
She just left.

450
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,290
"A trip?"

451
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:29,160
- To where?
- He doesn't know that.

452
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,600
She said a month,
so it seemed like somewhere abroad.

453
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,530
What if he gets released
before we go study abroad?

454
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,640
Are you leaving to study abroad?

455
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,270
Bye, Mom.

456
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,380
I'm thinking about it.

457
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:53,420
Sir, I'm near the airport,
so I'll go and check.

458
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,190
Okay. I'll head there, too.

459
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,580
Hello.

460
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,450
I'm here, Ms. Jang.

461
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,480
Hello.

462
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,120
Here are the files.

463
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,120
Mr. Yoon's family relation certificate
and a copy of his ID.

464
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,990
Thank you.

465
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:36,060
I'll bring Eun Chong home
right away...

466
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,430
as soon as he becomes
his legal guardian.

467
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,970
I see.
Can you stay here for a moment?

468
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,970
I have to meet the doctor.

469
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,440
Sure.

470
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,850
Please get up...

471
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,680
and keep Eun Chong safe.

472
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,850
Please keep him safe,

473
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,520
catch the culprit
of Du Na's car accident,

474
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,800
and find out
how you ended up bedridden.

475
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,200
And I have to catch the culprit
of my parents' car accident, too.

476
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,040
Hey, Jin Goo.

477
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,050
Eun Chong didn't call me. Why?

478
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,450
It's nothing. Where are you?

479
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,450
At Chairwoman Shin's hospital room.

480
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,560
I came to get
Mr. Yoon's file from Ms. Jang.

481
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,160
- Are you done with your meeting?
- Yes.

482
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,090
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

483
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,830
Why did he ask if Eun Chong called?

484
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,040
Is something going on?

485
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,280
It looked like she moved.

486
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,790
She moved.

487
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,020
What is it?

488
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,090
Ms. Shin Yeo Jin
just moved her finger.

489
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,670
I'm not seeing things, am I?

490
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,210
The person you have reached is...

491
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,680
Yes, Ha Na?

492
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:41,080
The chairwoman
regained her consciousness?

493
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,990
Yes, when will you arrive
at the hospital?

494
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,090
I'll be there soon.

495
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,030
Okay.

496
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,860
Why did you ask me about Eun Chong?

497
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,330
I have to go.

498
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,070
Which finger was it?

499
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:01,270
It was her left hand.

500
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,670
How many times did she move?

501
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,810
Twice or so.

502
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,250
Ms. Shin, can you hear me?

503
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,950
Can you blink?

504
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,790
What's going on?

505
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,260
She moved her finger.

506
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,960
She did?

507
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:38,240
Ma'am, can you tell me your name?

508
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,510
Shin...

509
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,480
Yeo Jin.

510
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,920
What? She regained consciousness?

511
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,630
How is she?

512
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:59,500
Is she in a normal state?

513
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:02,730
We haven't made
an accurate diagnosis yet.

514
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay.

515
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,840
- Did Aunt Yeo Jin wake up?
- Yes.

516
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,680
I must check
what her condition is like.

517
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,710
It'll be the end of me
if she remembers my notebook.

518
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,820
Hey, Se Young. I have to go back.

519
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,560
Take Eun Chong
and leave the country first.

520
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,620
Alone?

521
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,030
I have to go
and check her condition.

522
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,980
Sorry?

523
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,450
Yu Jin.

524
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,350
Yu Jin.

525
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,430
My daughter.

526
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,100
Who?

527
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,670
It's me, Mommy. Yu Jin.

528
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:18,130
(Cinderella Game)

529
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,500
Yeo Jin, are you really up?

530
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,970
Yeo Jin will remember everything
when she wakes up.

531
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,080
- Mr. Hwang.
- Everything will come to light.

532
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,810
No! It can't!

533
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,580
I know it's brazen of me to ask.

534
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,820
- Yu Jin.

535
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:36,450
What if she really becomes Yu Jin,
and not just her fake daughter?

536
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,620
Don't go anywhere.

537
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,960
I looked everywhere for you.
