1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:01,535
A false report?

2
00:00:02,375 --> 00:00:03,846
No, what he said was a false report.

3
00:00:04,545 --> 00:00:06,345
We'd dispose of the business as stated in the article.

4
00:00:06,976 --> 00:00:08,246
(Head Director's Office)

5
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,016
Goodbye, then.

6
00:00:13,785 --> 00:00:15,316
I've been expecting you, Mr. Hwang.

7
00:00:16,356 --> 00:00:20,156
Release a correction that the disposal is not true.

8
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:21,395
I will present...

9
00:00:23,825 --> 00:00:25,736
the disposal of Hyesung Tour at the board meeting.

10
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:27,835
Who the heck are you?

11
00:00:28,566 --> 00:00:29,905
Are you here as a corporate raider?

12
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,066
Why does selling Hyesung Tour make me a corporate raider?

13
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,335
I already said I'd put my focus on the hotel.

14
00:00:34,706 --> 00:00:36,246
You were the one who disregarded me.

15
00:00:36,246 --> 00:00:37,746
You killed it on purpose.

16
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:39,816
You destroyed our contracts...

17
00:00:39,816 --> 00:00:41,816
starting with Hyesung Hotel and other affiliated businesses,

18
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:44,545
and you ruined our business with Dubai!

19
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:48,515
You've clearly shown your filthy intentions on display.

20
00:00:49,926 --> 00:00:51,685
If you knew, why did you let it happen?

21
00:00:54,726 --> 00:00:58,065
You're more cut out to be the chairwoman's personal assistant.

22
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:00,065
Take your hands off Hyesung Tour,

23
00:01:00,065 --> 00:01:01,965
and just look after her daughter.

24
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:15,416
I was the one who held back from punching you,

25
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:19,815
but you punched me instead.

26
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,325
Shut your mouth.

27
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:25,955
Just wait. You'll be unemployed in no time.

28
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,366
I'm sure you aren't after me.

29
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,765
Yet why do you keep obsessing over me?

30
00:01:32,765 --> 00:01:34,696
Someone may hear that and take it the wrong way,

31
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:36,806
thinking I have feelings for you.

32
00:01:37,935 --> 00:01:39,336
You're crazy.

33
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:43,806
All right. Let's find out which one of us will be unemployed.

34
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:57,156
The phone won't stop ringing.

35
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,995
And the news articles are coming out endlessly.

36
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,726
Yes, please do that, Reporter.

37
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,726
Well, can you take it down for now?

38
00:02:04,966 --> 00:02:06,995
If Hyesung Tour went down like this,

39
00:02:07,136 --> 00:02:10,305
all Jin Goo had done would be futile.

40
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,636
Then, will Aunt Yeo Jin transfer Ha Na to the hotel?

41
00:02:14,675 --> 00:02:16,376
Yes, please do that.

42
00:02:16,645 --> 00:02:17,906
Okay. Thank you.

43
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:25,085
Tomorrow is finally the D-day.

44
00:02:25,955 --> 00:02:27,515
Is tomorrow our first day?

45
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:29,955
Did she mean this by the D-day?

46
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:33,055
Releasing this news article?

47
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,666
Ms. Yoon, wait.

48
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:47,476
- What? - Where are you going?

49
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:49,145
Why do you care?

50
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:52,615
Everyone seemed busy. Do you have to talk to me?

51
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:55,645
That's right. Everyone is busy because of the news of our disposal.

52
00:02:55,946 --> 00:02:58,615
But you seemed unaffected by this.

53
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:00,416
What are you saying?

54
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:04,786
It was as if you already knew the article would be released today.

55
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:07,726
What is this nonsense?

56
00:03:07,726 --> 00:03:09,395
Is it because I'm not making calls?

57
00:03:09,566 --> 00:03:11,696
My head is full right now!

58
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,166
I have a splitting headache...

59
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:15,495
from figuring out what I should do between Jin Goo and Mr. Goo.

60
00:03:16,335 --> 00:03:18,406
Who were you on the phone with last night?

61
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,575
You said today was the D-day.

62
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,145
By any chance, was that about the news of our disposal?

63
00:03:28,645 --> 00:03:30,316
You're now making stuff up.

64
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:35,356
First, you thought I was a thief, and now, I'm a spy?

65
00:03:36,025 --> 00:03:37,555
You're dying to make my life miserable...

66
00:03:37,555 --> 00:03:39,525
both at home and at work!

67
00:03:40,126 --> 00:03:42,325
- Watch what you say. - No, you watch it.

68
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:45,166
Stop making stuff up after eavesdropping on my call.

69
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,436
- Jin Goo, what happened? - Come in.

70
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:57,446
Did it not go well?

71
00:03:58,976 --> 00:04:00,716
Only if I had Amira's files...

72
00:04:03,686 --> 00:04:05,245
She didn't even check her e-mail.

73
00:04:07,286 --> 00:04:08,356
Did you fight him?

74
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:10,485
I punched him first,

75
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,795
and he let me do it as if he had expected.

76
00:04:12,856 --> 00:04:14,026
You punched Mr. Goo?

77
00:04:14,026 --> 00:04:16,096
He kept provoking me and making me mad.

78
00:04:16,096 --> 00:04:17,896
You should've held back if you had known.

79
00:04:17,896 --> 00:04:18,995
I lost my temper.

80
00:04:19,536 --> 00:04:21,565
He'll present the disposal at the board meeting,

81
00:04:22,565 --> 00:04:24,266
so I need to meet with the directors first.

82
00:04:24,536 --> 00:04:26,076
Let me know if you need help.

83
00:04:31,445 --> 00:04:34,615
The news is already out. Can we really take this back?

84
00:04:34,716 --> 00:04:36,615
We may lose our jobs...

85
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:38,846
if the business gets sold soon.

86
00:04:39,586 --> 00:04:42,185
You never know, so write your resume, just in case.

87
00:04:42,185 --> 00:04:44,526
Hey, don't jinx this.

88
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:45,755
Let's give Mr. Hwang our trust.

89
00:04:45,896 --> 00:04:47,096
Yes, I trust him.

90
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,026
Everything will go well.

91
00:04:49,925 --> 00:04:50,995
Hey.

92
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:56,235
You all must be worried.

93
00:04:56,635 --> 00:04:59,005
I'll do whatever it takes to stop the selling process,

94
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:01,635
so please don't get worried and focus on your job.

95
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,375
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

96
00:05:03,476 --> 00:05:05,976
I'll hold off on my tasks with the hotel for a while.

97
00:05:05,976 --> 00:05:07,445
Let me know whenever you need help.

98
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:08,576
- Yes. - Yes.

99
00:05:10,346 --> 00:05:11,385
What?

100
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:15,856
- What's that? - An announcement on the intranet.

101
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,795
What now? Opening a disciplinary committee?

102
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,766
"Workplace violence?" What does this mean?

103
00:05:30,766 --> 00:05:31,935
It was Mr. Goo, wasn't it?

104
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:35,906
He got me.

105
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:41,576
Yes, Ms. Jang.

106
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:43,286
The chairwoman wants to see you.

107
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,086
A disciplinary committee? What's this all about?

108
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:48,985
I couldn't control my temper...

109
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:50,956
and punched Mr. Goo.

110
00:05:51,786 --> 00:05:54,156
- You resorted to violence? - I'm sorry.

111
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:57,026
The disposal in itself is causing confusion in the company.

112
00:05:57,365 --> 00:05:59,336
If Mr. Hwang's assault gets brought up,

113
00:05:59,396 --> 00:06:02,536
the board will not stand with him.

114
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:05,005
You should take measures very soon.

115
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,036
I'll gladly accept the disciplinary action.

116
00:06:07,036 --> 00:06:09,476
For now, I'll focus on stopping the sales process.

117
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,305
I'll meet the directors,

118
00:06:12,615 --> 00:06:15,115
apologize, and persuade them.

119
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,985
I'll meet with them.

120
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,516
Summon the directors who are on my side.

121
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,885
Bribing a detective in the jurisdiction seems to be...

122
00:06:21,885 --> 00:06:24,086
the only way we can get our hands on the case report.

123
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:27,096
Chairwoman Shin probably took a strong measure with the police.

124
00:06:27,956 --> 00:06:31,166
We may end up exposing ourselves, so be careful.

125
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,495
Yes. You must think Mr. Hwang is...

126
00:06:33,495 --> 00:06:34,966
the mastermind behind the fake daughter.

127
00:06:34,966 --> 00:06:39,005
He's a loyal dog who does anything Chairwoman Shin asks.

128
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:43,005
Were you the one who let Ha Na meet with Chairwoman Shin?

129
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,346
The chairwoman wanted to do a parentage test,

130
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:47,875
so I did relay it to Ms. Goo.

131
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:52,516
He must've tampered with their parentage test.

132
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:00,596
It's Ms. Goo.

133
00:07:07,865 --> 00:07:09,536
You probably didn't come because you were worried.

134
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:12,635
- Are you here to complain? - Both.

135
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:15,836
Shoot. At least let me hear it.

136
00:07:15,906 --> 00:07:17,175
Why were you beaten up?

137
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:19,375
I thought you were all that.

138
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:20,716
I let him punch me.

139
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,286
I'm waiting for my chance to give him a big blow.

140
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:26,086
Why do you only want to fight him?

141
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:28,115
Is the president your sworn enemy?

142
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,685
Do you know what Hwang Jin Goo is like?

143
00:07:30,385 --> 00:07:31,586
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:33,896
What is he like?

145
00:07:34,255 --> 00:07:38,365
He's the biggest contributor in making you her fake daughter.

146
00:07:40,536 --> 00:07:42,766
You said you were happy to be Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

147
00:07:44,536 --> 00:07:46,276
Then, show me that you're really happy.

148
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:49,545
It should be worth cutting off ties with me.

149
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,115
I have to meet the chairwoman.

150
00:08:03,326 --> 00:08:04,956
Show you that I'm really happy?

151
00:08:06,995 --> 00:08:09,596
How am I going to be happy if you keep doing this?

152
00:08:14,065 --> 00:08:15,635
Please withdraw the request for a disciplinary committee.

153
00:08:15,635 --> 00:08:17,865
- I'll talk to Mr. Hwang... - I came to propose...

154
00:08:18,635 --> 00:08:20,076
the disposal of Hyesung Tour.

155
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:23,005
You came in vain if you were here to discuss that.

156
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,306
Let's talk after you read this.

157
00:08:33,755 --> 00:08:35,556
You've been busy with many endeavors...

158
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:38,025
other than Hyesung Group.

159
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:42,726
Was this Richard Han?

160
00:08:42,726 --> 00:08:44,566
If you approve the disposal of Hyesung Tour,

161
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,635
then I'll stay quiet about your corporate raiding.

162
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:51,035
After all, we're a team for the time being.

163
00:08:51,535 --> 00:08:53,135
And my own teammate is blackmailing me.

164
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,936
- If you refuse... - You need to give me...

165
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:57,476
time to think.

166
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,846
How would I know what Mr. Goo is thinking?

167
00:09:04,846 --> 00:09:08,155
Why would he want to ruin his sister's workplace?

168
00:09:08,456 --> 00:09:10,826
He's getting his revenge on you.

169
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:11,885
I have no idea.

170
00:09:12,086 --> 00:09:14,625
Jin Goo will meet with the board, so just wait.

171
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:17,566
Wait. Hello?

172
00:09:19,365 --> 00:09:21,596
Why is she so calm?

173
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,206
Good grief.

174
00:09:23,765 --> 00:09:25,005
Is something going on?

175
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:27,476
- When did you get here? - You asked me to come...

176
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:28,905
until you hired another housekeeper.

177
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,005
Anyway, why are you here alone?

178
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,245
Everyone is at work.

179
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:37,546
Your son's company is about to go down.

180
00:09:37,885 --> 00:09:39,415
What do you mean?

181
00:09:40,056 --> 00:09:43,485
What does Richard Han do to take over businesses?

182
00:09:43,655 --> 00:09:47,596
The rumor about how somebody is digging up corporate raiding...

183
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,226
must be true.

184
00:09:49,495 --> 00:09:51,926
He's in America, so I can't meet him right away.

185
00:09:52,265 --> 00:09:53,995
- Set up a video call. - Yes, ma'am.

186
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:56,635
What about the disposal?

187
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,066
Jin Goo is looking for the evidence, so I'll give him time.

188
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:04,946
I can't let them have it easily, just the way they want.

189
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:08,875
(Head Director's Office)

190
00:10:13,515 --> 00:10:15,155
Withdraw your request for the disciplinary committee.

191
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,356
You came worried about him and not me?

192
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,596
Right. Are you all right?

193
00:10:21,356 --> 00:10:22,826
He made everything easy for me.

194
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:25,466
Are you really going to hold a disciplinary committee?

195
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,936
Workplace violence will get him at least a suspension.

196
00:10:33,806 --> 00:10:36,176
You said you'd come to me after Hyesung's disposal makes the news.

197
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:39,576
I guess you still have feelings for Hwang Jin Goo.

198
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:44,745
You also don't want me to end it with him for good.

199
00:10:45,515 --> 00:10:47,356
We can get more use out of him.

200
00:10:47,415 --> 00:10:48,785
Then, is today our first day together?

201
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:51,326
Come to my place after work.

202
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:01,336
He won't pick up. Se Young won't pick up, either.

203
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,765
Well, they must be busy.

204
00:11:03,865 --> 00:11:05,436
What are they going to do?

205
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:08,176
Ms. Bang Ul, can you keep coming here?

206
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:11,346
I can't. Mr. Hwang said no.

207
00:11:12,076 --> 00:11:14,076
I'll come until you find a new housekeeper.

208
00:11:14,076 --> 00:11:16,586
But I like you, Ms. Bang Ul.

209
00:11:16,985 --> 00:11:19,316
I'd love to see you every day, too.

210
00:11:22,686 --> 00:11:23,885
This is my present.

211
00:11:24,285 --> 00:11:26,525
How pretty. My gosh.

212
00:11:26,596 --> 00:11:29,025
- Where should I put this? - Right here.

213
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:30,765
My gosh. How cute.

214
00:11:30,865 --> 00:11:32,326
This is so cute.

215
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,466
How can you sit around and play with that kid right now?

216
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:40,706
Both Jin Goo and Se Young won't pick up their phone,

217
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,936
so I'm frustrated, too.

218
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:45,375
Think about it. How can they pick up their phones now?

219
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,155
This sticker...

220
00:11:57,856 --> 00:11:59,226
Did you give it to her?

221
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:01,596
Yes, it's my favorite.

222
00:12:01,826 --> 00:12:04,395
- Do you want one, Little Grandma? - No.

223
00:12:06,466 --> 00:12:09,495
Wait, I've seen this before.

224
00:12:10,535 --> 00:12:11,635
What's wrong?

225
00:12:11,936 --> 00:12:14,505
Did you give this sticker to anyone else?

226
00:12:14,505 --> 00:12:15,706
My bestie granny.

227
00:12:16,106 --> 00:12:17,645
Who's your bestie granny?

228
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:18,905
The chairwoman.

229
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:23,816
What's with her?

230
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:25,645
What about this sticker?

231
00:12:34,995 --> 00:12:37,365
That kid gave her this sticker?

232
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:43,005
She even lied and said a boy monk gave it to her.

233
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:47,035
Why did she leave it here to cherish it?

234
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:53,745
This boy is getting on my nerves.

235
00:12:56,015 --> 00:12:58,385
Gosh, you're good at this.

236
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,716
When did you first meet your bestie granny?

237
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,255
- At the department store. - "The department store?"

238
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:12,125
Yes, that day?

239
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,596
What about after that?

240
00:13:14,596 --> 00:13:16,606
- At the supermarket. - "The supermarket?"

241
00:13:18,135 --> 00:13:19,676
Which one?

242
00:13:19,806 --> 00:13:21,606
K Supermarket. It's in my old town.

243
00:13:23,576 --> 00:13:25,645
Why was Yeo Jin there?

244
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:29,846
Was she there alone?

245
00:13:29,885 --> 00:13:31,446
Mr. Hwang was there, too.

246
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:34,655
Mr. Hwang Jin Goo?

247
00:13:38,356 --> 00:13:41,596
She went to that neighborhood with Jin Goo?

248
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:46,966
What did you do with Mr. Hwang and the chairwoman?

249
00:13:46,966 --> 00:13:49,566
The chairwoman treated us to shabu shabu.

250
00:13:50,806 --> 00:13:54,275
And she even treated you to a meal?

251
00:13:55,306 --> 00:13:58,905
Then, when did you give her that sticker?

252
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:01,316
When we had shabu shabu.

253
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:02,676
When was that?

254
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,946
When we went grocery shopping...

255
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,655
for my grandparents' memorial service.

256
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,385
"Memorial service?"

257
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:15,525
Jin Goo was at the memorial service for Goo Ha Na's parents.

258
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:21,836
That was when she got busy after she received that file.

259
00:14:24,606 --> 00:14:26,535
She must've found out that Yu Jin had died...

260
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:29,706
and went around busily trying to make that fake daughter.

261
00:14:33,476 --> 00:14:35,176
Ji Seok told me...

262
00:14:35,676 --> 00:14:38,086
you were looking for proof that Chairwoman Shin's daughter died.

263
00:14:38,285 --> 00:14:41,255
Yes, sir. But she has made everything private,

264
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,385
so it isn't easy.

265
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:44,385
I'll ask the police.

266
00:14:44,686 --> 00:14:47,025
- You will? - Yes.

267
00:14:47,356 --> 00:14:51,466
Tell Ji Seok that it'll take a while to find information on her daughter.

268
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,596
Let him focus on the disposal.

269
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,365
Yes, sir. Then, who will negotiate the sales process?

270
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,865
My attorney.

271
00:14:58,466 --> 00:15:00,875
We know about her business in corporate raiding,

272
00:15:01,176 --> 00:15:03,476
so she'll give us favorable terms.

273
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,546
And turn down the request for that video call.

274
00:15:16,885 --> 00:15:19,086
- Hello. - Hello.

275
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:29,096
Ma'am, where did the trash come from?

276
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,905
I just cleaned up Head Director Goo's office.

277
00:15:33,905 --> 00:15:35,476
Was it really Ji Seok?

278
00:15:36,806 --> 00:15:39,375
- What's wrong? - I need to find an important file.

279
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:42,316
(To Hyesung Tour)

280
00:15:42,946 --> 00:15:45,586
He must've thrown out everything that was inside.

281
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,255
I saw him shredding regular paper.

282
00:15:56,226 --> 00:15:57,296
What are you up to?

283
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:02,096
Mr. Hwang, this was the envelope Amira sent me.

284
00:16:02,635 --> 00:16:05,066
Where did you find this?

285
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:07,005
In the trash from Mr. Goo's office.

286
00:16:07,576 --> 00:16:10,476
He must've shredded what was inside.

287
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:11,676
"Shredded?"

288
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:15,946
Ms. Goo, go back to the office.

289
00:16:17,716 --> 00:16:18,785
Mr. Hwang!

290
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,456
- What is this, Mr. Hwang? - What is this, Mr. Hwang?

291
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,726
Our hope.

292
00:16:25,326 --> 00:16:27,255
We'll have to work overtime tonight.

293
00:16:28,326 --> 00:16:29,356
Is that okay?

294
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:33,096
Wait, do we have to put all these back together?

295
00:16:33,096 --> 00:16:35,535
Let's try our best.

296
00:16:35,796 --> 00:16:38,436
An important file...

297
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:40,676
that can save Hyesung Tour is in this pile.

298
00:16:41,676 --> 00:16:44,476
If you have a previous engagement, you may leave.

299
00:16:44,476 --> 00:16:47,076
No, we have to try something.

300
00:16:47,645 --> 00:16:49,115
Yes, we should.

301
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:52,186
We should do it.

302
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,356
Yes.

303
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:59,086
The chairwoman won't help you with the disciplinary committee?

304
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,826
Things are hectic enough because of our disposal.

305
00:17:01,326 --> 00:17:03,526
If she tries to persuade the board over my business,

306
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,496
it can backfire.

307
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,496
Then, are you going to wait until you get disciplined?

308
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:12,465
Our team is working overtime today. Can you help us if you're free?

309
00:17:12,905 --> 00:17:13,975
Well...

310
00:17:14,405 --> 00:17:15,875
Come to my place after work.

311
00:17:17,475 --> 00:17:20,715
I'm sorry. I have a meeting for the hotel out of the office.

312
00:17:20,816 --> 00:17:23,746
It's all right. You should do your job there first.

313
00:17:34,756 --> 00:17:36,256
This reminds me of the old days.

314
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,195
Why did you prepare so much food? What if I didn't come?

315
00:17:41,195 --> 00:17:43,135
I thought we were done playing games.

316
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:45,165
Jeez. I'm hungry.

317
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,576
You can't stay at the headquarters...

318
00:17:54,576 --> 00:17:55,875
after you call the disciplinary committee...

319
00:17:55,945 --> 00:17:57,586
and sell Hyesung Tour, right?

320
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,115
Were you still worried about him?

321
00:18:00,415 --> 00:18:01,756
Pick your side.

322
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,455
I left Jin Goo at the battlefield and came here.

323
00:18:04,556 --> 00:18:05,786
I thought I already did.

324
00:18:07,996 --> 00:18:09,056
For now.

325
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,165
Let's eat.

326
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:20,236
- Right, did Ha Na come for you? - She did.

327
00:18:20,236 --> 00:18:21,836
Did you really cut ties with her?

328
00:18:22,675 --> 00:18:25,606
You only did it on the outside. You still care about her, right?

329
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:26,846
That's an ancient story.

330
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,445
Are Ha Na and Chairwoman Shin...

331
00:18:30,316 --> 00:18:31,586
still all over each other?

332
00:18:32,846 --> 00:18:36,455
It's not just Ha Na. I now have that kid as my superior.

333
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:40,326
At times, it feels like he has the most power at my place.

334
00:18:40,425 --> 00:18:41,526
Eun Chong?

335
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:46,266
(Jin Goo)

336
00:18:47,266 --> 00:18:49,365
Pick it up. I want to know what it's about.

337
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:51,106
You're so mean.

338
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,236
I'm just like you.

339
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,725
The person you have reached is...

340
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,365
Is she still in the meeting?

341
00:19:25,766 --> 00:19:27,836
Gosh, look at the time.

342
00:19:27,935 --> 00:19:30,006
You should go home. Let's finish up tomorrow.

343
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,475
We have to do this again tomorrow?

344
00:19:32,945 --> 00:19:35,816
I have to be somewhere tomorrow. I'll finish up today.

345
00:19:36,986 --> 00:19:38,286
I also can't stay tomorrow.

346
00:19:38,546 --> 00:19:40,786
Only those who have time can stay late.

347
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,155
If I must, I'll stay up all night and finish.

348
00:19:43,155 --> 00:19:44,385
I have time tomorrow.

349
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,596
- Me, too. - Okay.

350
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,225
We're almost done.

351
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:51,996
Okay.

352
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,006
This is nice. It reminds me of our old days.

353
00:19:59,135 --> 00:20:00,405
When does it remind you of?

354
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:05,106
How I used to lie in your arms as we watched movies all night.

355
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:08,945
- My arms hurt so much back then. - Jeez.

356
00:20:10,746 --> 00:20:13,615
Back then, you were so innocent.

357
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:15,155
And you ruined me.

358
00:20:15,856 --> 00:20:17,685
I didn't do anything.

359
00:20:17,685 --> 00:20:19,256
I only rubbed off on you.

360
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:21,725
I should be the one to talk.

361
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,165
Then, let's say we both rubbed off on each other.

362
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:29,665
Shouldn't you go home?

363
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:32,465
What time is it?

364
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:37,606
Gosh, I have to go.

365
00:20:39,046 --> 00:20:40,346
Thirty more minutes.

366
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:42,675
My family is vulnerable because of you-know-who.

367
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:44,185
You can't help them by going home.

368
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:47,486
Then, ten minutes.

369
00:20:48,215 --> 00:20:49,286
Five.

370
00:20:56,326 --> 00:20:58,566
It seems like that boy is the key.

371
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,736
Why did she suddenly turn Goo Ha Na into her daughter...

372
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:06,806
as soon as she found out Yu Jin had already died?

373
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,175
Eun Chong, aren't you sleepy?

374
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,276
I'm going to wait for Auntie.

375
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:14,215
You will? Okay.

376
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:18,486
She treats him as if he's her own grandson.

377
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:22,316
But he's not Yu Jin's son. What's going on?

378
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,225
The girls are running late.

379
00:21:24,986 --> 00:21:26,256
They're working overtime.

380
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:31,965
Yeo Jin, you must protect Jin Goo.

381
00:21:37,135 --> 00:21:38,506
- Auntie! - Hey!

382
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,536
I came home too late. Gosh.

383
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,405
I'm home.

384
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,076
Have you found the evidence?

385
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:47,846
We're putting shredded documents together.

386
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:49,445
We have to work on it until tomorrow.

387
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:50,816
Good work.

388
00:21:50,816 --> 00:21:53,415
Anyway, did you come alone? Where's Se Young?

389
00:21:53,986 --> 00:21:55,586
Se Young isn't home yet?

390
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:58,086
Didn't you two work overtime together?

391
00:22:00,225 --> 00:22:01,526
I'm home.

392
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:03,096
Hey, come on in.

393
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:04,766
You two worked overtime together.

394
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:06,596
Why did you act like you two came separately?

395
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:10,365
- Let me get changed first. - Okay.

396
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:14,336
Me, too.

397
00:22:18,006 --> 00:22:19,145
Where have you been?

398
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:23,445
Do I have to report my whereabouts to you?

399
00:22:23,445 --> 00:22:26,846
You knew our company was in trouble. Why couldn't you help out?

400
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,155
We all worked overtime.

401
00:22:28,155 --> 00:22:30,826
Were you mad that I didn't throw out my job at the hotel to help you?

402
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:31,986
That wasn't what I meant.

403
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,695
You offered to hold it off and help us out.

404
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:36,725
I wanted to help, too.

405
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:38,796
But I had a meeting to attend. What choice do I have?

406
00:22:38,965 --> 00:22:40,336
I didn't know that.

407
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,905
- Have you been drinking? - I had a glass of wine.

408
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:47,736
Is that wrong, too?

409
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,385
What will happen to you if your company gets sold?

410
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:04,486
It won't get sold.

411
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:07,756
What kind of a grudge does the director have against you...

412
00:23:07,756 --> 00:23:10,465
to do this to you not just once, but twice?

413
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:14,266
That new man can't get rid of you.

414
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:16,935
The chairwoman already knows you worked night and day,

415
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:18,705
devoting yourself to her business.

416
00:23:18,705 --> 00:23:21,506
The chairwoman must have a plan, too.

417
00:23:22,135 --> 00:23:24,076
Mom, I need to wash up.

418
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:32,115
Should I talk to the chairwoman?

419
00:23:34,256 --> 00:23:36,056
- Workplace violence? - Really?

420
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,826
- That's crazy. - How can this happen?

421
00:23:38,925 --> 00:23:41,225
- What will happen to Mr. Hwang? - I wonder.

422
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:44,165
- He can't come to the office. - There was a rumor, right?

423
00:23:44,665 --> 00:23:45,796
What's going on?

424
00:23:52,135 --> 00:23:55,435
Is that the announcement for Jin Goo's disciplinary action?

425
00:23:56,006 --> 00:23:57,175
- He's on suspension. - Starting when?

426
00:23:57,276 --> 00:23:59,145
- He punched someone at work. - Why did he do that?

427
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:00,306
I don't believe this.

428
00:24:00,945 --> 00:24:02,715
On suspension...

429
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:05,286
and access control to the office?

430
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:12,526
What is it?

431
00:24:15,695 --> 00:24:16,725
No way.

432
00:24:17,865 --> 00:24:19,526
Your president is under disciplinary action?

433
00:24:19,965 --> 00:24:21,066
Quiet.

434
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:29,405
Gosh, is this really happening on my last day here?

435
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:40,016
What's going on?

436
00:24:40,885 --> 00:24:41,986
Jin Goo...

437
00:24:55,236 --> 00:24:57,135
(Disciplinary Action, Hwang Jin Goo: Suspension and access control)

438
00:25:00,776 --> 00:25:01,875
Remove that.

439
00:25:02,675 --> 00:25:03,776
And the laptop.

440
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:05,145
What's going on?

441
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:07,346
President Hwang Jin Goo.

442
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,175
You are excluded from all projects as of this hour.

443
00:25:10,846 --> 00:25:13,715
You are not allowed to be here under your access control.

444
00:25:13,715 --> 00:25:15,915
Must you take things this far?

445
00:25:16,115 --> 00:25:18,725
We're only following our orders.

446
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,655
Please refrain from entering the Tour Planning Team's office.

447
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:22,925
What if I refuse?

448
00:25:23,695 --> 00:25:26,865
You should be grateful that you weren't dismissed.

449
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:30,705
If you wish to come to work while you're under suspension,

450
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,566
I have no way of stopping you.

451
00:25:33,135 --> 00:25:35,736
But you won't have a seat at the Tour Planning Team's office.

452
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,205
I doubt you'll have anything to do.

453
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:39,546
Isn't this too harsh?

454
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,175
He's still the president.

455
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,375
So what?

456
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,576
He's not above the law.

457
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:44,746
I just have to stay away...

458
00:25:46,115 --> 00:25:47,885
from this office and that one, right?

459
00:25:50,655 --> 00:25:52,425
Wouldn't it be better if you waited at home?

460
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,455
I have to stick around the office...

461
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:57,026
to find Amira's file and fight back.

462
00:25:57,296 --> 00:26:01,195
I'd give him what he wanted if I stayed home.

463
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:03,066
You're still the president.

464
00:26:04,465 --> 00:26:06,566
People will see you as they walk by.

465
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:09,036
I'm with you.

466
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,905
I borrowed an extra laptop from Administrative Support.

467
00:26:12,175 --> 00:26:14,046
You can't sit around and take this.

468
00:26:14,175 --> 00:26:16,576
- You must put up a fight. - That's right.

469
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,685
What's this?

470
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:26,026
President Hwang is working on a desk in the hallway.

471
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:28,395
He's under suspension. What kind of work can he do?

472
00:26:32,596 --> 00:26:33,695
Hello?

473
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:37,336
- Shredded documents? - Yesterday, they must've...

474
00:26:37,336 --> 00:26:38,536
worked overtime to put those together.

475
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,076
How did you throw out the file from Dubai?

476
00:26:41,135 --> 00:26:42,175
Did you shred it?

477
00:26:42,306 --> 00:26:43,336
Yes.

478
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,606
What if they really put it together?

479
00:26:47,046 --> 00:26:48,145
Bye.

480
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,286
Who were you talking to?

481
00:26:51,685 --> 00:26:52,846
We're at work.

482
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:56,655
And why do you care about who I'm talking to, Ms. Goo?

483
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,796
I thought I heard her talking about putting shredded documents together.

484
00:27:08,766 --> 00:27:11,336
Hwang Jin Goo must be looking for the shredded files Amira sent.

485
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:13,606
It'd be tough to piece it back together.

486
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:15,935
Should I say that's endearing?

487
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:20,175
I commend him for putting himself through useless trouble.

488
00:27:33,756 --> 00:27:34,826
Hello.

489
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:36,695
- Mr. Hwang, stay strong! - Mr. Hwang, stay strong!

490
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:37,796
- We support you. - We support you.

491
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,236
- Thanks. - Let's go.

492
00:27:45,365 --> 00:27:47,806
Is this how Italian artisans feel?

493
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:54,375
I found it.

494
00:27:55,145 --> 00:27:57,286
It's "Has" of Hassan.

495
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:03,385
- Is that right? - Yes.

496
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:05,125
One moment.

497
00:28:07,996 --> 00:28:10,096
Look. I did it.

498
00:28:11,096 --> 00:28:12,826
- It came together! - Okay!

499
00:28:12,826 --> 00:28:15,435
- Okay. She did it! - Yes!

500
00:28:17,036 --> 00:28:19,236
- Did you do it? - My gosh. Mr. Hwang!

501
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:20,905
You can't be in here. Is this okay?

502
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:22,776
Then, should I go?

503
00:28:22,776 --> 00:28:24,506
No, come back, Mr. Hwang.

504
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,006
We'll keep it a secret, so join us.

505
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,975
I got a third of a page done.

506
00:28:30,316 --> 00:28:32,986
We just finished a third of a page.

507
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:35,385
Then, let's put it together with yours.

508
00:28:40,425 --> 00:28:43,625
I think yours is the top part. Let's try again.

509
00:28:44,965 --> 00:28:46,026
Try again.

510
00:28:47,395 --> 00:28:48,766
Gosh, please.

511
00:28:49,996 --> 00:28:52,006
- What? - What?

512
00:28:53,635 --> 00:28:55,576
- We did it! - We did it!

513
00:28:57,576 --> 00:28:59,746
- We did it! - Yes! We got this!

514
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,875
- Yes! - All right!

515
00:29:03,145 --> 00:29:04,986
- We did it. - Finally.

516
00:29:04,986 --> 00:29:08,086
All right. We just need to find another third.

517
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:13,455
- We're sorry, Mr. Hwang. - We're sorry, Mr. Hwang.

518
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,395
It's okay. You two should go.

519
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,425
- Then, good luck. - Good luck.

520
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,026
You can do this, Ha Na.

521
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:21,536
Thank you. Good work!

522
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,076
Hey.

523
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:32,346
At the emergency room?

524
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:34,975
Yes, okay.

525
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:39,246
Is your sister sick?

526
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:41,455
Yes, it must be enteritis.

527
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:44,385
Then, you should go.

528
00:29:44,385 --> 00:29:46,056
No, I should help out.

529
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,155
It's okay. You should go.

530
00:29:55,465 --> 00:29:58,435
Gosh, you should go home, Ha Na.

531
00:29:58,766 --> 00:30:00,566
I said I'd be late.

532
00:30:02,506 --> 00:30:04,606
Hey, I found it.

533
00:30:05,675 --> 00:30:07,106
I just need two more pieces.

534
00:30:07,475 --> 00:30:08,615
Let me see that.

535
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:14,955
- Gosh, that hurts. - That really hurt.

536
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,566
Okay.

537
00:30:58,266 --> 00:31:01,695
Hey, I found the last piece.

538
00:31:01,935 --> 00:31:03,036
Really?

539
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:05,766
I finished it.

540
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,076
- I finished it! - Yes!

541
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:10,975
- Yes! - Yes! My gosh!

542
00:31:11,746 --> 00:31:12,975
- My gosh. - I can't believe it.

543
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:21,586
You weren't supposed to be here!

544
00:31:22,356 --> 00:31:23,455
Come this way.

545
00:33:34,816 --> 00:33:36,915
(Cinderella Game)

546
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,625
Will you let Jin Goo get humiliated like this?

547
00:33:39,625 --> 00:33:41,826
You have to handle the disposal, too.

548
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:43,756
You should make a decision by tomorrow.

549
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:46,395
What did Mr. Hwang see in Se Young that he decided to marry her?

550
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:48,596
I have a good reason when I don't share something.

551
00:33:48,596 --> 00:33:50,195
You're rather nosy.

552
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:52,606
But I'm sorry. The game has already ended.

553
00:33:52,606 --> 00:33:54,606
- Congratulations. - Chairwoman Shin must have...

554
00:33:54,606 --> 00:33:55,635
another intention.

555
00:33:55,635 --> 00:33:57,805
That kid seems like the real one.

556
00:33:57,805 --> 00:34:00,446
I feel great about everything today.

557
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:01,875
"Dear?"
