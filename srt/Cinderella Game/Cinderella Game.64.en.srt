1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,909
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,139
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,750
(Episode 64)

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,279
Do you have
something to say, Yeo Jin?

6
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,220
- Yes, have a seat.
- Okay.

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,859
My priority is
for Eun Chong to find his peace.

8
00:00:17,989 --> 00:00:19,120
Of course.

9
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,660
That was why I thought of a way.

10
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,660
Why don't you two marry...

11
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:28,530
and adopt Eun Chong?

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,909
You want us to adopt him?

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,109
That'd be wonderful.

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,979
There are no parents...

15
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:43,950
who'll be better
at taking care of Eun Chong.

16
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:46,219
- Isn't that so, Se Young?
- Yes.

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,350
It also sounds great to me,
Aunt Yeo Jin.

18
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,659
You two will also become
the heirs to Hyesung Group...

19
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:53,630
after you adopt Eun Chong.

20
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,259
Our priority is to raise Eun Chong
into a wonderful successor.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,899
Jin Goo and Se Young's marriage...

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,600
and Eun Chong's adoption.

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,069
Everything
worked itself out wonderfully.

24
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:08,310
Isn't that so, Jin Goo?

25
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,340
Se Young seems happy with this.
What do you think?

26
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:14,950
I don't want to do this.

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,849
Why not?

28
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,019
I cannot marry Se Young.

29
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:25,260
I'd like to call off the engagement.

30
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,829
Jin Goo.

31
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:29,129
What is this utter nonsense?

32
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,530
What's the reason?

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,629
We...

34
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,200
don't love each other.

35
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,769
You need to talk to me first.

36
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,569
Did you just drop this alone...

37
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,569
without talking to Se Young?

38
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,510
How dare you
call the engagement off?

39
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:45,510
You two should talk.

40
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,420
He caused enough trouble
with Goo Ha Na all along,

41
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,760
and he now wanted
to call the engagement off?

42
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,230
They absolutely cannot call it off
for Eun Chong's sake.

43
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:05,730
Of course not.

44
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,069
You won't find a better man than Jin Goo
to be Eun Chong's dad.

45
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,039
You should've talked to me first.

46
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,409
How can you announce this
to the elders without saying a word to me?

47
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,780
I didn't want to share it like this.

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,680
The chairwoman told us to marry
and adopt Eun Chong, so...

49
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,090
So what?

50
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,719
You always did everything
as she asked.

51
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,689
That was why you agreed to marry me.

52
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:34,960
So, just decide...

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,159
to adopt Eun Chong
as you always have.

54
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,500
I won't do that anymore.

55
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:41,669
And I made the decision
to marry you...

56
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,270
regardless
of what the chairwoman wanted.

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,939
Back then, I liked you.

58
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,169
Now you don't,
so you're calling it off?

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,879
I still like you today,
just as I did back then.

60
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,810
I'll marry you and adopt Eun Chong.

61
00:02:56,979 --> 00:02:58,550
You don't like him.

62
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,090
I understand you want to be his mom
because of Hyesung Group, but...

63
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,219
If you get it, then it's fine.

64
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,520
He began to grow on me,

65
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:09,330
and I want to raise him
into a solid successor, too.

66
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:13,629
You didn't even ask
why I was calling the engagement off.

67
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,030
Is this because of Ji Seok?

68
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,000
That's 50 percent.

69
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:22,840
I don't want to mention him
to the elders.

70
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,840
It'll only embarrass me,

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,680
and it won't benefit you, either.

72
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,780
What about the other half?

73
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,379
I'm not sure if I can spend...

74
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,150
the rest of my life with you.

75
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,419
I don't love you.

76
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,530
- But I...
- Don't say that you love me.

77
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,129
Both you and I know that isn't true.

78
00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:47,930
Don't fool yourself, too.

79
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,430
You can't see through my mind.

80
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,139
Isn't it because of Goo Ha Na?

81
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,310
Ha Na is irrelevant
to our broken engagement...

82
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,379
She probably is.

83
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,139
If we break off our engagement,
it's her fault.

84
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,650
So, make a wise decision.

85
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,919
I'm not calling this off.
Not even over my dead body.

86
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,919
- Don't get Ha Na into this.
- I threw down my pride to say this.

87
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,789
You have no right...

88
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,189
to jilt me like this.

89
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:14,060
You cheated on me with Goo Ji Seok
while we were engaged.

90
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:16,029
That's more than enough
to break off our engagement,

91
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:17,360
and I have all the right to do that.

92
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,930
I wasn't cheating.
I told you it was all in the past!

93
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,300
Both you, me, and Goo Ji Seok know
it's not just in the past.

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,170
But I don't want the elders to know.

95
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,569
Let's call it off quietly.

96
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:33,649
I'll kill myself
if you call the engagement off.

97
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,319
I'll kill myself!

98
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,160
Se Young.

99
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,129
What? What happened to her?

100
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,959
Se Young.

101
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,800
Are you all right? What's wrong?

102
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,399
She's bleeding!

103
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,410
She bled?

104
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,269
Is she unwell?

105
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:03,509
She should see a doctor.

106
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,910
Yes, she'll come downstairs
after changing.

107
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,850
You can drive her, Jin Goo.

108
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,720
No, I'll go with her.

109
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,319
- You can stay home.
- I'll go.

110
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:20,759
I feel more comfortable with Mom.

111
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,029
Let's go.

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,660
Have a seat.

113
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,110
I hope you and Se Young...

114
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,279
will become Eun Chong's mom and dad.

115
00:05:41,449 --> 00:05:44,480
I can be his dad
without marrying her,

116
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,620
but I cannot marry Se Young.

117
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,860
She may not share blood with me,
but she's still my niece.

118
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,360
Se Young and her mom
stayed by my side...

119
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,759
after Yu Jin and my husband
both left this home.

120
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,740
If anyone should become his mom,

121
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,240
it'd have to be Se Young.

122
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,439
Please become his dad
and be my successor.

123
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,540
I probably must've hurt you
in some way,

124
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,980
but you also know
how much I trust and depend on you.

125
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,319
I don't think...

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,889
I'll change my mind.

127
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,420
Is it because of Goo Ha Na?

128
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,920
My decision to call this off...

129
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:28,089
has nothing to do with Ha Na.

130
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,230
(JH Beautiful Women's Clinic)

131
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,310
I thought I was pregnant, too.

132
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,769
You are pregnant.

133
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,449
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,350
Keep this and show it to Jin Goo.

135
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,959
- What is this?
- The baby in your womb.

136
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,759
You're eight weeks
into the pregnancy.

137
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,860
Mom.

138
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,769
This is the last move you can make
to cling to him.

139
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,269
Vaginal bleeding due to stress?

140
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:15,269
This was a chance
sent to us by fate.

141
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,680
Do you think he'll believe it?

142
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,279
You stayed the night out last time.

143
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:25,819
Yes.

144
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,750
He saw you bleeding with his eyes,

145
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,959
so he'd believe you
if you said you were pregnant.

146
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,089
If he doesn't believe you,
we can bribe a doctor...

147
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:39,860
and take him there with you.

148
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,500
Then, am I now an expectant mother?

149
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,480
Hey, are you all right?

150
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,019
Yeo Jin, we need to celebrate.

151
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,660
Se Young is pregnant.

152
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,790
Really?

153
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,930
Congratulations, Se Young.

154
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,829
Thank you, Aunt Yeo Jin.

155
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:14,300
Where's Jin Goo?

156
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,670
He's upstairs with Eun Chong.

157
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:18,170
She'll get to adopt Eun Chong
and have her own child.

158
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:20,300
We have two occasions to celebrate.

159
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,569
I'll go upstairs
and talk to Jin Goo.

160
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,339
- Okay.
- Okay.

161
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,149
What did the doctor say?
Are you unwell?

162
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,659
No.

163
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:41,960
You're a dad now, Jin Goo.

164
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:45,759
- What?
- And I'm a mom.

165
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait, are you saying
you're pregnant?

166
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,200
Yes, I'm eight weeks into it.

167
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,470
Are you serious?

168
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,769
Look.

169
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,679
That's your baby in my womb.

170
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,049
I was still in the early stage,
so I should've been careful.

171
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:04,480
That bleeding
could've led to the worst.

172
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,919
That's our baby.

173
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,019
Are you going to let our child
grow up without a dad?

174
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,059
If you aren't sure if it's yours
because of Ji Seok,

175
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:17,460
then I'll let you check
after I give birth.

176
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,129
You're really something
for making me say...

177
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,269
something like this.

178
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,440
Come in.

179
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,110
- Did you tell him?
- Yes.

180
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,549
Congratulations, Jin Goo.

181
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,779
This child came to this world
as a blessing,

182
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,750
so you should be grateful.

183
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:44,820
She's still in the early stages,

184
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,629
so she has to be careful.
Don't give her any stress.

185
00:09:49,929 --> 00:09:51,059
So, don't try to break off...

186
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,129
the engagement again, okay?

187
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,100
How dare a servant like you
try to break off the engagement?

188
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:59,399
I should be the one
to call this off first.

189
00:09:59,539 --> 00:10:01,139
Breaking it off, my foot.

190
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,779
You're now tied down for life.

191
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,389
Congratulations, Bang Ul.

192
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,389
Both you and I will
become grandmothers.

193
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,720
"Grandmothers?"

194
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,289
Is Se Young pregnant?

195
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:25,659
Goodness, that's great.

196
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:26,929
How far along is she?

197
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:28,370
Eight weeks.

198
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,669
How did you know?
Did she have morning sickness?

199
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,600
She suddenly had vaginal bleeding.

200
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,169
She bled?

201
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,509
Are the baby and Se Young both fine?

202
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,240
Thankfully, yes.

203
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,909
Goodness, why did she bleed?
Is she unwell?

204
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,980
We'll talk in person tomorrow.

205
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,750
Come to our place, okay?

206
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,690
Yes, I'll make some healthy food
for Se Young to eat.

207
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,090
That's our baby.

208
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,460
Are you going to let our child
grow up without a dad?

209
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,840
How did I end up coming here?

210
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,379
I'm going in first.

211
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:26,320
What do you want?

212
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:29,830
You're really brazen for a con man.

213
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,029
I heard you were the one
who made Ha Na into a fake daughter.

214
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,769
Wait, why should I be so polite?

215
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,440
You ruined my sister's life.

216
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:41,340
You were the key instigator.

217
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,539
I'm guessing you're probably here
to apologize to Ha Na.

218
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:47,710
She doesn't need
something like that.

219
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:51,320
Don't be seen anywhere
in the 100-meter radius of our home.

220
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:55,389
Just go
unless you want to fight me, too.

221
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:07,129
Mr. Hwang is outside.

222
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,740
How's Ha Na?

223
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,240
Get lost!

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,179
That's none of your business.

225
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,610
Don't show her your pathetic pity.

226
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,419
I never pitied her.

227
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,980
Then, why did you deceive her?

228
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,690
It was because you pitied her
and thought she was a joke!

229
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:32,019
That isn't the case.

230
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,690
I knew I did Ha Na
and her siblings wrong.

231
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,059
If you allow me,

232
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,029
I'll repay all of you
for the rest of my life.

233
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,700
Can you make it like
this never happened?

234
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,970
You can't.

235
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,299
Then, don't ever lurk around here.

236
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,710
The day I see you here again is...

237
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,210
the last day you'll breathe.

238
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:07,590
I must've liked you,

239
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,860
Ha Na.

240
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,279
Se Young cheated on him
with Ji Seok.

241
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,649
I knew something was fishy
between those two.

242
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,419
What? Why did he go after
someone else's woman?

243
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,750
Did I actually hear it?
Or was I dreaming?

244
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,360
You're up, Ha Na.

245
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,730
How do you feel?

246
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,200
I feel better.

247
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
Have some porridge
before you take your medicine.

248
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:48,830
Have a seat.

249
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,610
About Ji Seok and Se Young...

250
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,340
What? How did you know?

251
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,250
I thought I heard
Ji Eun saying that yesterday.

252
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,850
Were they
really in that kind of relationship?

253
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:08,190
Shocking, isn't it?

254
00:14:09,789 --> 00:14:12,960
Why did he choose to date
someone who'd marry soon?

255
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,429
Did he have
no one better in his life?

256
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,029
Goodness. You should eat.

257
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:25,639
Ji Seok was Se Young's other man?

258
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,909
I said it was all in the past,
that we broke up two years ago.

259
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,750
Two years ago?
Ji Seok was in America back then.

260
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,980
Did he date her back then?

261
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,590
How did things
get tangled up like this?

262
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:50,889
Congratulations, Jin Goo.

263
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,029
I'm so happy about this.

264
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,330
It's now considered invaluable
to have a baby before marrying.

265
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,570
I'm so glad.

266
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,070
I'm making chicken and seafood soup
to give to Se Young tomorrow.

267
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:02,610
- Have some when I'm done.
- I'm fine.

268
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,980
Is something weighing you down?

269
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,879
Did you feel burdened
now that you became a dad?

270
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,250
The child will grow up on their own
after you give birth to them.

271
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,450
And you two have enough money,
so don't worry about it.

272
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:15,789
I'll get changed.

273
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,399
She's pregnant?

274
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,840
Eun Chong, these days, can you sleep
right away when you lie down?

275
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:39,039
How have you felt lately?

276
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,850
Do you feel jolly and happy?

277
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,480
Or do you feel sad and angry?

278
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:48,789
You must feel sad.

279
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,889
Is it because
you cannot see Auntie Ha Na?

280
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,429
How sad are you?

281
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,730
Eun Chong has a reduced appetite
and insomnia,

282
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,169
and he has no interest
in anything right now.

283
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,500
He's suffering from depression.

284
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,769
What can I do
to help him get better?

285
00:16:10,009 --> 00:16:12,110
It'd be best
to let him meet Auntie Ha Na,

286
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,179
the reason for his depression.

287
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,080
I can't do that.

288
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,710
Is there any other way?

289
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,320
He'll undergo play therapy
and art therapy at the same time.

290
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,120
Painting or communicating with animals
will help improve...

291
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,590
his emotional stability.

292
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,529
Goodness.

293
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,799
- Where's Se Young?
- She's in her room.

294
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,970
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman. I'm here.

295
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:46,509
- Hello.
- Hello.

296
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:58,490
- Yes, Mom.
- Bang Ul is here.

297
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,820
Okay.

298
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,210
Se Young, Jin Goo's mother is here.

299
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:18,640
Mother.

300
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:21,410
You can lie down
if you're too tired.

301
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,079
Goodness, how did you
end up bleeding?

302
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,519
I'm so glad
both you and the baby are fine.

303
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,049
Yes, Mother.

304
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,559
Goodness, what's wrong?

305
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,859
Why are you crying?

306
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
She was heartbroken
because of Jin Goo.

307
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,700
Both Se Young and I
didn't get any sleep last night.

308
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,240
What about Jin Goo?
Did he do something wrong?

309
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,069
He said...

310
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:53,039
he wanted to call off
our engagement, Mother.

311
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,650
Calling the engagement off?

312
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,319
You're now pregnant with his child.
What is this nonsense?

313
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:03,150
Tell me about it.

314
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:06,019
Se Young fainted
after hearing that yesterday...

315
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,930
and ended up bleeding.

316
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:12,099
Well, thanks to that,
we found out about her pregnancy.

317
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,299
Why did he want to call it off?

318
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:15,970
Did you two get into a fight?

319
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,470
No.

320
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,869
He said he didn't love me, Mother.

321
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,079
I feel miserable.

322
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,680
How can he say that to me,
who's pregnant with his child?

323
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,250
Goodness, stop crying.
You'll lose your energy.

324
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,750
You're in the early stages,
so you must be careful.

325
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,289
He's going to be a parent soon.
What's this nonsense about love?

326
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,130
Don't worry about him.

327
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,059
He won't be able to call it off.

328
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,700
What if he stays stubborn?

329
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,470
Mother, I want to give birth to a child
in a happy family...

330
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,339
and raise them well.

331
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,539
He said that when he didn't know
you were pregnant.

332
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,210
He has
a high sense of responsibility.

333
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,809
Just trust me and relax.

334
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,119
I made chicken and seafood soup,
so warm it up and have some.

335
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,750
Yes, Mother.

336
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,990
My goodness.
You must've been heartbroken.

337
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,559
How can he say
he wants to call the engagement off?

338
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,400
Make sure you take charge
and keep him in line.

339
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,700
Se Young is in the early stages,
so she can't be stressed out.

340
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,470
Okay.

341
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,809
And the chairwoman said...

342
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,380
they should adopt Eun Chong
after they get married.

343
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,880
Eun Chong?

344
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,450
If they just adopt Eun Chong,

345
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:42,490
Jin Goo will be
the next chairman of Hyesung Group.

346
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,059
And the one after him
will be Eun Chong.

347
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,730
So, you need to do your best
to convince him.

348
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,960
If Se Young marries someone else,

349
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,299
that'll be the end
of Jin Goo's success.

350
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:59,799
If the chairwoman wants that,
then he'll do that.

351
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,779
- Hello.
- It's been a while, Ha Na.

352
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,609
Were you ill?

353
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,809
I caught a cold.

354
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,920
You must've been stressed out.

355
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,519
You dropped a lot of weight.

356
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:19,559
Hey, Ha Na. You're back.

357
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,259
- Hello, Mr. Yoon.
- Hey.

358
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:27,259
Anyway, there was a rumor that
the chairwoman found her daughter.

359
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,829
Is that true?

360
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,440
I heard that was a false rumor.

361
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,670
There was already an article
on the suspicion of her death.

362
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,970
What's the fact, then?

363
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,809
It's not like
she has multiple daughters.

364
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:42,910
Is Mr. Hwang here?

365
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:45,849
He's out on business,
so he isn't in the office.

366
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,089
I see.

367
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:51,359
(Letter of Resignation)

368
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,910
I heard you skipped work.
Are you unwell?

369
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,750
Didn't you choke me
and tell me to die?

370
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,950
You should be grateful
that I let you live.

371
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,720
Did you call to check
if I were dead?

372
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,019
Don't be mad.

373
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,250
I wasn't in my right mind.

374
00:21:25,589 --> 00:21:26,890
What are you up to?

375
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,829
Don't you need me?

376
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,299
I need you.

377
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,799
I have to stay low
until I get married.

378
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:37,829
Don't even call me.

379
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,440
Why are you
so adamant about your marriage?

380
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:41,740
Hyesung Group
doesn't belong to Hwang Jin Goo.

381
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,480
My aunt told me to marry him
and adopt Eun Chong.

382
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,980
It wouldn't be so bad
to take it over in that way.

383
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:51,210
It'll be fun to control things
behind the scenes.

384
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:56,150
I'll call you back.

385
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:57,890
Yes?

386
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,160
- May I come in?
- Sure.

387
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,329
Do you feel better?

388
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,900
You should've gotten more rest.
Why are you here already?

389
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,740
I resigned.

390
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,799
I'm glad.

391
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,210
You kept working and working
without ever taking any time off.

392
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,109
You should rest for a while.

393
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,579
Are you dating Yoon Se Young?

394
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,089
- Eun Chong.
- Ms. Bang Ul.

395
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,829
Have you been well, Eun Chong?

396
00:22:36,829 --> 00:22:38,730
I heard you were sick.
Do you feel better?

397
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:39,900
Yes.

398
00:22:41,769 --> 00:22:45,069
Grandma,
I don't have the cold anymore,

399
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,269
so may I go play with Yali?

400
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,210
He'll undergo play therapy
and art therapy at the same time.

401
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:53,039
Painting or communicating
with animals will help improve...

402
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,579
his emotional stability.

403
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,650
But Ms. Sim, you must be busy.

404
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,019
I'm fine...

405
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,289
as long as he has your permission.

406
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,559
- You can go, Eun Chong.
- Okay.

407
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:12,029
I apologize
that Jin Goo caused trouble.

408
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,259
He can't call the engagement off.

409
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,630
I'll talk to him
and make sure he understands.

410
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,930
Okay.

411
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,849
Hwang Jin Goo, that punk, came back?

412
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,390
Chairwoman Shin should apologize,
but she wouldn't come.

413
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,819
Only that punk I don't want to see
comes by every day.

414
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,019
Are they kidding me?

415
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,990
I think it's our turn.

416
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,230
We'll barge in if she won't come.

417
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,700
Yes, let's teach her a lesson
and show what happens...

418
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,970
if she messes with our family.

419
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,839
Get up.

420
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,740
Let's go.

421
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:01,750
- Who is it?
- We're Goo Ha Na's siblings.

422
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,079
What the heck?

423
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,220
What do you want?

424
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,950
We're here to see the chairwoman.

425
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,019
Goodness.

426
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:11,660
Who is it?

427
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,490
Goo Ha Na's younger siblings.

428
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,559
Let them in.

429
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,539
What brings you here?

430
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,779
Don't you know?

431
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,779
How will you compensate
for ruining my sister's life?

432
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,849
She can't eat or sleep.

433
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:41,250
She's practically dead.

434
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,789
You need to apologize sincerely...

435
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,089
to my sister.

436
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,359
Have a seat before you talk.

437
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,000
You need to return
kindness with kindness,

438
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,799
not with evil!

439
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,539
Did you have any idea
how she raised Eun Chong?

440
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,640
She raised him
with so much love since infancy...

441
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,210
after he was
left alone in this world.

442
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,880
And she went through so much
trying to find his grandmother.

443
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,779
How can you do this as a human?

444
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,779
Ms. Goo persistently declined
any compensation.

445
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:17,490
I had been thinking about a way.
I'm glad you're here.

446
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,329
- You need to apologize first!
- Hey.

447
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,660
What kind of compensation
are we talking about?

448
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,200
I can offer her money
or real estate.

449
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,369
Tell me what you want.

450
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,069
First, apologize to her.

451
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,809
Then, you can compensate.

452
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,380
All right. Come inside.

453
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,549
Yali!

454
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:57,160
You're going to be Jin Goo's son?

455
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,299
Then, you're my grandson.

456
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,769
Ms. Bang Ul, can you do me a favor?

457
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,940
What is it?

458
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,200
Can I go to Auntie Ha Na's place?

459
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,069
I want to see her.

460
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,210
Really?

461
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,609
But the chairwoman can't find out.

462
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:15,309
Can we keep it a secret?

463
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,509
"A secret?"

464
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,119
I came today...

465
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,619
to say my goodbyes.

466
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:29,829
What? Did you get a new job
while you took some time off?

467
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,460
No, I'm going to rest.

468
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,900
Wait, why are you suddenly quitting?

469
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:37,069
Are you seriously unwell?

470
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,539
No.

471
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,940
Thank you very much for everything.

472
00:26:42,009 --> 00:26:44,940
Wait, you can't just leave
without a farewell party.

473
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,980
It's such a shame.

474
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,349
Let's schedule something
and meet up.

475
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,819
You've done well, Ha Na.

476
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,119
Thank you.

477
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,549
Excuse me.

478
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:00,390
Hello?

479
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,789
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na.

480
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,500
Whose phone are you calling from?

481
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,829
Ms. Bang Ul's phone.

482
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:12,369
You're going to come to my place
with Ms. Bang Ul?

483
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,970
I'm at work right now,
so I'll be there soon.

484
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,940
Okay. Please wait for me.

485
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,019
Do you feel okay?

486
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,880
I feel too sick to eat anything.

487
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,089
But still, you should eat something.

488
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:33,890
I'm better off without eating.
I'll end up vomiting anyway.

489
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,029
That must be hard.

490
00:27:36,589 --> 00:27:39,099
Will you really
call our engagement off?

491
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,359
I'll tell you
after I sort out my thoughts.

492
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,769
Our baby can hear everything.

493
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:46,240
Let's talk later.

494
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:48,670
Bye.

495
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,740
(Travel Service Department
General Manager Hwang Jin Goo)

496
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,990
(Letter of Resignation,
Name: Goo Ha Na)

497
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,829
Mr. Yoon, when did Ms. Goo come by?

498
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,700
She just left
about five minutes ago.

499
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:18,970
Five minutes?

500
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:24,539
You must've missed
your auntie so much...

501
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,279
if you ended up becoming depressed.

502
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,250
I get to meet
both Yali and Auntie Ha Na today.

503
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,819
It's the best day ever.

504
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,650
It is.

505
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
(Chairwoman Shin)

506
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,190
Why is the chairwoman calling me?

507
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,500
I probably shouldn't pick up.

508
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,940
The person you have reached...

509
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,069
I thought of going
to Ms. Sim's restaurant for dinner,

510
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,339
but she wouldn't pick up.

511
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:07,279
What if she took Eun Chong
and went to Goo Ha Na's place?

512
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:09,950
That's nonsense.

513
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:12,160
He was already in that neighborhood,

514
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,289
so he probably asked her.

515
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,700
Tell Ms. Jang to get the car ready.

516
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,269
Are you going to go?

517
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,839
Why is it so hard to grab a taxi?

518
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:34,980
This is bad.

519
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:51,289
- Hop in, Ha Na.
- It's okay.

520
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,859
I won't say anything.

521
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,000
You must be in a hurry, so hop in.

522
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,109
- Where is she right now?
- She's almost here.

523
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,880
What do you want to do with her?

524
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,420
I want to give her a big hug.

525
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:19,160
Goodness. Do you love her that much?

526
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:20,359
- Yes!
- My gosh.

527
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,329
Auntie!

528
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,400
Goodness. Ms. Chairwoman.
Why are you here?

529
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:34,470
You can't come here after saying
you wanted to see the cat.

530
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,069
- Let's go.
- I don't want to.

531
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:38,140
I want to see Auntie Ha Na
before I leave.

532
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:40,140
She's almost here.

533
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:43,049
Can you just let him see her
while he's already here?

534
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,779
- Get him in the car.
- Yes, ma'am.

535
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:46,950
Let's go, Eun Chong.

536
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,279
My goodness.

537
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,319
My gosh.

538
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:53,359
- My gosh, Eun Chong.
- Ms. Bang Ul!

539
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,259
My goodness. Why...

540
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,319
Eun Chong!

541
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:24,690
Eun Chong!

542
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,990
Auntie Ha Na?

543
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,759
- You can't go.
- Auntie Ha Na!

544
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,259
- Eun Chong, no.
- Auntie Ha Na!

545
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:32,759
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na!

546
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,829
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

547
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,329
- Oh, no.
- Auntie Ha Na!

548
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:39,140
Auntie Ha Na!

549
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,470
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Eun Chong. No.

550
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:45,140
- Please open the door.
- Let me out!

551
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,609
Open the door.

552
00:31:46,609 --> 00:31:47,710
You can't go.

553
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,349
- Go.
- Eun Chong, I'm right here.

554
00:31:52,349 --> 00:31:55,049
- Please open the door.
- Auntie Ha Na!

555
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:56,319
- Go.
- Auntie Ha Na!

556
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:59,119
No. Eun Chong!

557
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,890
Eun Chong!

558
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,130
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

559
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,829
Auntie Ha Na!

560
00:32:07,829 --> 00:32:10,029
Eun Chong! Please don't go!

561
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:14,799
Auntie Ha Na!

562
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,670
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Eun Chong!

563
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,480
Eun Chong!

564
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,180
Auntie Ha Na!

565
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,319
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Eun Chong!

566
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,670
(Cinderella Game)

567
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,779
Since when did you dare to defy me?

568
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,880
You're calling the engagement off
after getting your fiancée pregnant?

569
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,210
I'll take responsibility
for the baby.

570
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,920
Why don't you marry me
and adopt Eun Chong?

571
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,950
Depression?

572
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,950
How will you take responsibility
for my sister's life?

573
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,990
How is his grandmother
worse than us?

574
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,259
I need to bring Eun Chong home.

575
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,589
I got the evidence that
she forcefully took him in her car.

576
00:33:42,589 --> 00:33:43,589
The police?

577
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,029
He was never diagnosed
with depression. He's healthy.

578
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:48,359
Eun Chong!

579
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,500
Drag her out.
