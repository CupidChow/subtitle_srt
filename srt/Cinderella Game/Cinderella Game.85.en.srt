1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,610
Let go of me! Darn it!

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,250
Come on!

6
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,050
Ji Seok.

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,570
Ji Seok, please help me.

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:37,640
Goo Ji Seok!

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,350
Let go of me!

10
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:43,310
Goo Ji Seok!

11
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,920
Let go of me!

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,390
Goo Ji Seok!

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,260
Calm down.

14
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,820
I'll get you an attorney,
so don't say anything.

15
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,130
I'll be there now, too.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,460
What's going on?

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,700
Se Young was arrested
for embezzlement.

18
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,770
- "Embezzlement?"
- Yeo Jin, please help her.

19
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,900
Where did she take it from,
and how much?

20
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,840
A million dollars from Hyesung Tour.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,980
How did she take that much money?

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:14,910
I'm sure she didn't do it alone.

23
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,110
Did you put her up for this?

24
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,220
You'll help her, right?

25
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,490
I need to run to the police station.

26
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,430
"Help her?"

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll lock you
and your daughter up in prison.

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,530
It probably
isn't just a million dollars.

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,670
I've tracked down Myung Ji's account
in the Bahamas and found it.

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,040
She would've needed a fortune
to keep an eye on Yu Jin in America.

31
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,640
If she had instigated
the hit-and-run accident,

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,410
she would've needed much more money.

33
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,010
She has done
illegal real estate speculation...

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,450
for a very long time
to get that kind of money.

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,950
I'll find all of her slush funds.

36
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,350
The evidence is too strong,

37
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,920
so you should focus on
reducing your sentence.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,360
Cooperate and let them know...

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,990
why you embezzled the money,

40
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,030
and why you had to do it.

41
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,870
Mom, you put me up for it.

42
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,900
You can also offer to repay
or return the embezzled amount.

43
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,510
All of the million dollars?

44
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:15,010
Just say that you'll do it.

45
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:17,740
Mom, I don't want to go to prison.

46
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,280
Wait, if the company drops the suit,

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,920
the punishment will be much lighter.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,580
Can you find out if that's possible?

49
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,650
I'll go to the office tomorrow
and find out.

50
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,720
Did you see Se Young
taken by the police?

51
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,060
Yes.

52
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,890
She kept denying it until the end.

53
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,860
How can she be so brazen?
I don't get it.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,230
She had been groomed
to live that way.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,340
This is like the code
to their survival.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,670
What are your feelings for her?

57
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,910
My feelings aren't important
at this point in time.

58
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:56,280
What's important is that
my feelings for her...

59
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
aren't as strong as my passion
to get revenge.

60
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,320
And when the revenge ends,

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:04,160
could that passion
return to Se Young?

62
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,560
Who knows...

63
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,090
how my feelings will change?

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,230
What did you see in her?

65
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,730
She's someone
that even women can't comprehend.

66
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,740
I pitied her.

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,710
You pitied her?

68
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,280
What about you?

69
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,680
What are your feelings
for Hwang Jin Goo?

70
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,980
Do you still have trouble
forgiving him?

71
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,540
What about you?

72
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,870
What are your feelings
for Hwang Jin Goo?

73
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,170
Do you still have trouble
forgiving him?

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,840
Don't do that!

75
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,720
You can't hit a child.

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,220
- Ha Na.
- Let go of me!

77
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,450
Hey! Darn it.

78
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,660
How do you know Ha Na?

79
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,390
What's the relationship here?

80
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,460
Us?

81
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,800
We're on the same side.

82
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,340
Fate is truly incredible.

83
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,910
When we talked about the bracelet,

84
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,710
you said we would've met
If we were meant to meet.

85
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,440
That's an understatement.

86
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,380
This kind of relationship
isn't just ordinary.

87
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,420
Hey, this looks like
the lucky bracelet.

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,390
"The lucky bracelet?"

89
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,320
This kid gave me a bracelet
when I was younger.

90
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,720
He said the bracelet would
protect me instead of my family.

91
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,850
(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

92
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,380
Please do not barge in like this.

93
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,890
Sorry. I got into this habit
while Yeo Jin was here.

94
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,890
You have a minute, right?

95
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,760
- You may leave.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,230
From now on, check with
my secretary before you walk in.

97
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,540
I'd prefer
you didn't visit me at all.

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,680
Drop the suit
on Se Young's embezzlement.

99
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
There's clear evidence,

100
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,550
so I can't do that as I like.

101
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,680
You.

102
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,550
Did you forget
how you got that position?

103
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,590
Se Young gave you the clearance
for the security server...

104
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,390
That was nowhere near enough.

105
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,390
It had two-factor authentication.

106
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,260
I don't care if there were
two factors or three.

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,960
You first got to it
with whatever Se Young gave you.

108
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,600
That was why you said
you'd side with us!

109
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,670
Me, side with you?

110
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,040
If we were on the same side,

111
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,640
why did you release
that article on my parents?

112
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:20,490
How could I release
an article like that?

113
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,760
And that article had a bigger effect
on Yeo Jin than on you!

114
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,020
That must be why...

115
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,530
Chairwoman Shin told me...

116
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,660
to handle the embezzlement
by the law.

117
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,930
What? Yeo Jin said that?

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,750
Yes?

119
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,250
A tail?

120
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,050
It felt like I was followed
since the day I met you.

121
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,960
Go off the radar now.
No, go to New Zealand.

122
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,260
You'll get caught
if you stay in Korea.

123
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,770
Okay. Bye.

124
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,180
Life must be
great for you these days.

125
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,720
You broke off Se Young's marriage,

126
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,920
got her cuffed for embezzlement,

127
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,260
your brother
took over Hyesung Group,

128
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,390
and someone like you
became the chief auditor.

129
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,730
Yes.

130
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,200
Everything sounds very unfortunate
for your daughter.

131
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,930
She'll be
released on probation anyway.

132
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,840
I won't hand over Hyesung...

133
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,940
to some dregs like
you and your brother.

134
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,980
You wanted to kill
Du Na and Eun Chong...

135
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,880
just to get that Hyesung,
didn't you?

136
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,880
Only because of money.

137
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
What can you do by glaring at me?

138
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,220
Someone once said
they pitied Se Young,

139
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,150
and I could finally see why.

140
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,820
- What?
- Admit to your faults...

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:09,460
before you end up with more regrets.

142
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,660
"Regrets?"

143
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,140
That's something reserved
only for nobodies like you.

144
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,220
Just wait.

145
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,190
You're next.

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,590
I heard Ms. Yoon's mother was here.

147
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,100
Yes, she came to ask to let go
of Se Young's embezzlement.

148
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm sure it's not because
she doesn't have the money.

149
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,870
She doesn't even want to use
a penny of her money...

150
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,040
or admit to her faults.

151
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,640
Why is it so hard for her
to admit to her faults?

152
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,540
- It was easy for me.
- Me, too.

153
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,080
Are we the odd ones out?

154
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,180
You'll go see Eun Chong, right?

155
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,720
- Let's leave together.
- Okay.

156
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,960
Do you want
to eat lunch together, too?

157
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,110
After the audit,

158
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,150
do you want to return
to the Travel Service Department?

159
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,250
I already resigned.

160
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,690
I still have it with me.

161
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,360
You're still on leave.

162
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,630
I'll just take some time off.

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's bring back Hyesung Tour.

164
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,970
Chairman Goo said
he'd bring it back...

165
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,310
if the mother-daughter therapy tour
becomes a success.

166
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,950
Really?

167
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,380
I knew you'd be happy.

168
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,450
I'll consider it.

169
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,250
I thought you didn't like
playing hard to get.

170
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,030
One, two, three.

171
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,160
Gosh.

172
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,600
One, two, three.

173
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,470
It's finally spring.

174
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,440
How pretty.

175
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,980
- The bride?
- Yes.

176
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,250
The groom is good-looking, too.

177
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,220
- How so?
- All his features.

178
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,360
One, two, three.

179
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,580
You can hold it.

180
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,580
What?

181
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,250
You can hold my hand.

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,270
What?

183
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,400
It's Uncle Ji Chang.

184
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,370
Uncle Ji Chang!

185
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,170
Darn it.

186
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,380
Uncle Ji Chang, why are you hiding?

187
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,550
Goodness.

188
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,520
I didn't hide.
I was just standing here.

189
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,220
I heard your business was thriving.

190
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,090
Yes.

191
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,330
I heard your restaurant was
a big hit, too.

192
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,760
Our places are
the top two in our neighborhood.

193
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,600
Is that so?

194
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:52,100
- Come to my place to visit him.
- Yes, sure.

195
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,340
- He's staying at your place?
- Yes.

196
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,640
It was a secret.

197
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,480
Was that a secret? Why?

198
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,660
Hey, Mr. Owner,

199
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,360
don't you know that
letting your workers go on time...

200
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
is the best thing you can do?

201
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,200
Gosh. Bye, then.

202
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,970
Wait. Just take their orders.

203
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:30,210
I'll show you what I can do.

204
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,610
- Hi.
- Hello.

205
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,450
I came to Korea to eat this.

206
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,150
We'll order...

207
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,090
your best tteokbokki and fritters.

208
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:46,060
Yes, okay. Sure.

209
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,000
Enjoy.

210
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,130
Don't forget to dip it in here.

211
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,700
Oh, my gosh. Look at this.
It's so cute.

212
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:06,040
Gosh, is this
that famous tteokbokki?

213
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,120
How is it?

214
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,790
It's so good.

215
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,820
The tteokbokki here is
so special and delicious.

216
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,590
Thank you. Good!

217
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

218
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:25,730
Hey, you'll soon become the owner
of a global snack bar.

219
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,270
Anyway, what's with that long face?

220
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:33,040
The thing is, Eun Chong is
at Hwang Jin Goo's place.

221
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,570
Really?

222
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,140
Darn it.

223
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:38,180
I thought it'd be one night,
but he settled in.

224
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,250
I hope
they aren't meeting in secret.

225
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,280
Eun Chong, after this,
why don't you practice dictation?

226
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,220
Okay.

227
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,150
Mr. Hwang, why are you
not marrying Auntie Se Young?

228
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,790
What?

229
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,960
Auntie Se Young and I broke up.

230
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,230
Gosh. What about her baby?

231
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,800
She never had one.

232
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,470
The hospital told her
the wrong thing.

233
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,510
Gosh.
So, you don't have a girlfriend?

234
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,910
I should find one.

235
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,780
Auntie Ha Na
doesn't have a boyfriend, either.

236
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:19,450
Can you two marry?

237
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,990
Will you help us?

238
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,330
Get married, you two!

239
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,130
All right. Let's have some fruit.

240
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Okay. Here.

241
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,510
Ms. Bang Ul,
I told my auntie and Mr. Hwang...

242
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,340
to get married.

243
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,480
Really? That would be nice.

244
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,780
Goodness.

245
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,260
- What is it?
- Do you need any help?

246
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,570
No, you can stay outside.

247
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,340
I don't want to.

248
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,740
Then, have a cup of juice.

249
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,350
- Do you want some juice, too?
- Is it the sleepy juice?

250
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,350
"The sleepy juice?"

251
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,720
The juice Little Grandma gave me
made me sleepy.

252
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,160
"The sleepy juice?"

253
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:40,460
Has Myung Ji been feeding
sleeping pills to Eun Chong?

254
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,670
I think so.

255
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,070
All right.

256
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,150
Yeo Jin, why were you
on the second floor?

257
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,650
Have you been drugging Eun Chong?

258
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,990
What are you talking about?

259
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,130
Did you drug him
and put him to sleep?

260
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,790
No, why would I do that?

261
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,530
Yeo Jin, please let go of me.

262
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,270
The sleepy juice?
How do you call yourself human?

263
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,540
You even locked him in
after you put him to sleep.

264
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,850
How can you do that
to that little boy?

265
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,750
What else
have you done to Eun Chong?

266
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:05,820
Tell me!

267
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,290
No, everything is
a misunderstanding.

268
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,220
- Let go of me.
- Yeo Jin, please.

269
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,760
Get out. Get out of here now!

270
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,230
- Yeo Jin.
- Get out of my house now!

271
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,490
- Yeo Jin!
- Get lost!

272
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,630
Yeo Jin!

273
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,580
How could you take advantage of me
and then look away?

274
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,680
You should've helped me!

275
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,450
It's not too late
to say that you'll help me.

276
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,950
Work is work,

277
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,020
Se Young.

278
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,460
I thought we were on the same side.

279
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,760
I thought
we were on the same journey!

280
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,000
We were together
on the journey to revenge.

281
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,270
My goal was to get revenge
on Chairwoman Shin,

282
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,780
so I used you for my revenge.

283
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,340
You were used by me.

284
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,280
So, you'll leave me
now that you got your revenge?

285
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,780
You left me, too.

286
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,650
I made my decision
when you abandoned me...

287
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,490
and left America,

288
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,160
that I'd destroy
both Chairwoman Shin...

289
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,560
and you.

290
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,300
You're disgusting.

291
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,040
You're allowed to leave me,

292
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,940
but I'm not?

293
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,610
You also had fun
in your fling with me.

294
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,640
You are...

295
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,450
the worst kind of scumbag.

296
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,210
Then, what does that make you
for liking a scumbag?

297
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,090
Just wait, Ji Seok.

298
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,820
I can leave you,

299
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,690
but you can't leave me.

300
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,310
Did you meet him?

301
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,880
Is there a way to destroy Ji Seok?

302
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,450
He won't save you, will he?

303
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,420
- He used me to get revenge.
- What?

304
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,450
It wasn't even love? He used you?

305
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,720
It's all your fault!

306
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,220
How is this my fault?

307
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,060
Think about how you treated him
back in America.

308
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,260
You treated him like a beggar,
humiliated him,

309
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:30,030
and broke us up, too!

310
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,630
That's why he's getting revenge.
It's on you.

311
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,670
I embezzled the money
because of you, too.

312
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,200
Stop bringing up these old stories.

313
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,400
So? What's the conclusion?

314
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,200
I have to return
the million dollars.

315
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,910
I can...

316
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,280
always pay back that kind of money.

317
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,810
That dirty jerk.

318
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,550
Why were you kicked out of home?

319
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,480
What are we going to do
without Aunt Yeo Jin behind us?

320
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,420
She drugged Eun Chong?

321
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,660
That woman is insane.

322
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,100
I wanted to kill her,
but I just kicked her out for now.

323
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,430
Just the thought of
that little boy getting drugged...

324
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,470
broke my heart.

325
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,070
It's a relief that we found out now,

326
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,410
and Eun Chong is in a safe place.

327
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,080
I have good news
and bad news for you.

328
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,180
The good news first.

329
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,550
I restored the video
of Yu Jin's accident.

330
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:34,760
- Really?
- The driver's face was caught.

331
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,760
So, can we catch the driver?

332
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
We're searching right now,
so I'm sure we'll do that.

333
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,370
What's the bad news?

334
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,740
Detective Cho disappeared.

335
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,910
He must've noticed his tail.

336
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,140
Myung Ji must know where he is.

337
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,880
But we can still catch him
if he's in Korea, right?

338
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,050
We must.

339
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,350
We have to find him
for Eun Chong's sake.

340
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,630
How did she come up with the idea
to drug Eun Chong?

341
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,260
I should report her right now
for child abuse.

342
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,400
I just don't get it.

343
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,140
I'm glad
we brought him out soon enough.

344
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,570
It's dreadful to think
she's still at that house.

345
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,280
Shouldn't Se Young and her mom leave
instead of Eun Chong?

346
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,840
The chairwoman said
she'd kick them out.

347
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,980
She did.

348
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,780
Eun Chong is fine now,

349
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:35,990
and it won't happen again,
so calm down.

350
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,060
I got too worked up.

351
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,420
The night air feels nice.

352
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,480
It does.

353
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,820
I can see the stars, too.

354
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,920
I can't believe
you and I faced a day like this.

355
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,390
A day like what?

356
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,200
There's nothing we're hiding
and nothing we have to hide.

357
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,330
We can be honest with each other.

358
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:26,800
You were pretty honest.

359
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,540
- I was?
- Yes.

360
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,410
You told me
you liked me three times.

361
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,980
Three times?

362
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,610
The first time was at the park.

363
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,950
I must've liked you,

364
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,750
Ha Na.

365
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:44,250
The second time was
when I told you to marry Se Young.

366
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:47,420
I like you, Ha Na.

367
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:52,160
If possible, I want to marry you.

368
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,460
Then the third time was
during the audit...

369
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,930
in the investigation room.

370
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,670
I want to apologize to her
for the rest of my life,

371
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,310
right by her side.

372
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,110
You were keeping count?

373
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,180
But let me do it...

374
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,380
the fourth time.

375
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,840
I must've liked you, too.

376
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,570
But I thought I shouldn't want you,

377
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,640
so I had to fight my feelings.

378
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,880
I don't have to do that
anymore, right?

379
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:51,020
I can be honest with you, right?

380
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,330
You can do as you like, Ha Na.

381
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,800
I'll be here for you.

382
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,520
Myung Ji, they might know something
about the hit-and-run accident.

383
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,260
There was a request to restore
a hard drive thrown away...

384
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,960
by the police station
in the jurisdiction.

385
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,990
- You should be careful.
- What?

386
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:45,000
Are they really investigating
the hit-and-run accident?

387
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,040
No.

388
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,740
I'll be fine as long as
there's no evidence I was behind it.

389
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,780
The notebook.

390
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,610
"St. Paul's Home?"

391
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,140
(Yu Jin's address in America)

392
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,910
"Detective Cho Byung Jin?"

393
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,450
That's the detective
who disappeared.

394
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,590
(Cho Byung Jin: October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

395
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:39,660
(October 21, 1.23 million dollars,
balance for Yu Jin's accident)

396
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,690
(November 3, 80,000 dollars,
expenses for Yu Jin's accident)

397
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,590
This is the ledger...

398
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:46,660
she has kept with him
since six years ago.

399
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,300
The two million dollars
she used to cover up...

400
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,970
the hit-and-run accident she caused.

401
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,050
Yu Jin.

402
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,390
Yu Jin...

403
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,900
Myung Ji took your life so brutally.

404
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,410
Yu Jin.

405
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,820
Yu Jin...

406
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,900
It's all Mommy's fault.

407
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,430
It's all my fault.

408
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,880
Yeo Jin.

409
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,120
Get out of here.

410
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,450
How dare you come here?

411
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,320
That notebook.

412
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,530
Are you here to take this notebook?

413
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,930
What's that notebook?

414
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,060
How shameless.

415
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:31,700
This notebook is filled with records
of you tailing and monitoring her.

416
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:34,800
Yeo Jin, that notebook isn't mine.

417
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,440
I just picked it up.

418
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,210
Everything you say is a lie.

419
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,050
You told Yu Jin
you were the landlady...

420
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,050
when she came here
six years ago, right?

421
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,520
How did she know that?

422
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,990
What are you talking about?

423
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,290
Yu Jin was here six years ago?

424
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,260
You've deceived me all my life,
and you continue to tell a lie.

425
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,960
I'm not lying! My gosh.
This is so frustrating.

426
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,800
- Shut your mouth!
- Yeo Jin, it's a misunderstanding!

427
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,040
You killed my daughter,
so I'll kill yours.

428
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,610
Yeo Jin, don't be so scary.

429
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,940
Be sure to watch...

430
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,010
how I take Se Young down.

431
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,410
No, Yeo Jin.

432
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,220
I'm so sorry.

433
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,020
I can explain everything.

434
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,330
Yeo Jin, please just...

435
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:33,030
spare Se Young.

436
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,270
Please forgive me just this once.

437
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,370
My daughter deserves to die,
but yours doesn't?

438
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,410
I'll kill Se Young,
then I'll kill you, too!

439
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,840
Yeo Jin.

440
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:57,420
Give me that.

441
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,990
Give it back.

442
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,460
- Let go of me!
- Give it back!

443
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,730
Why did you steal my notebook?

444
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,830
You caused
Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident...

445
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:11,030
and killed her!
Everything is in here!

446
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,900
You're over.

447
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,350
Don't you dare harm my daughter.

448
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,090
I won't go down
as you wish, Yeo Jin.

449
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,530
Yeo Jin.

450
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,400
Yeo Jin.

451
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,540
She's still breathing.

452
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,450
Should I just leave her to die?

453
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,740
(Cinderella Game)

454
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,440
Chairwoman Shin fell into a coma?

455
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,940
If she passes away in that coma,

456
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,010
Choi Myung Ji will become
Eun Chong's legal guardian.

457
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,210
Let's find a way.

458
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,550
Make use of your boyfriend.
What else will you do with him?

459
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,120
This must be why everyone dates.

460
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
I need to siphon off
Yeo Jin's assets...

461
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:13,220
on the assumption that
she won't wake up.

462
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:15,090
You are not allowed
inside the patient's room.

463
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,330
Who dares to keep me out?

464
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:19,600
- Do you know who Richard Han is?
- What do you mean?

465
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,470
When will you introduce me
to your family?
