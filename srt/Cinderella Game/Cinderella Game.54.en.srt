1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,680
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,580
(Episode 54)

5
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,050
I didn't do it!

6
00:00:16,089 --> 00:00:17,160
What was that?

7
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,199
Go away.

8
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,829
- Se Young.
- It wasn't my fault.

9
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,000
No! It wasn't me.

10
00:00:32,869 --> 00:00:35,340
Se Young!

11
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:44,149
Were you dreaming?

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,159
What's wrong? It's me.

13
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,490
It'll be much better
if you just dream about it,

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,200
because it'll soon become
your reality.

15
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:02,000
I remembered everything you did...

16
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,469
twenty years ago.

17
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,510
I'm so sorry.

18
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,280
I apologize.

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,319
- What's wrong?
- I apologize.

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,890
Please forgive me. Please.

21
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:24,620
- I'm sorry...
- Se Young.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,920
Get a grip on yourself.

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,290
I'm sorry...

24
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,700
I'm sorry...

25
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,540
Get out.

26
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,700
Get out of here!

27
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:52,680
- Look at me.
- I'm sorry...

28
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:54,819
Get a grip of yourself
and look at me!

29
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,459
Mom?

30
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,199
What was she dreaming about?
She seemed out of her mind.

31
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,740
Why did she ask me to forgive her?

32
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:30,259
Let's say Yu Jin remembers everything
just as you think.

33
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,990
Then, will everything she says
become the truth?

34
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,629
There's no evidence!

35
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,699
Memories can get distorted,
changed, and exaggerated...

36
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,669
over 20 years of time.

37
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:46,240
Even so, Aunt Yeo Jin will
listen to Yu Jin,

38
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:47,810
not me.

39
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:54,150
Aunt Yeo Jin knows everything.
She's just testing us, Mom.

40
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,449
She might have reported me
for child abuse.

41
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,650
She might have wanted me
to undergo a police investigation.

42
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,889
This is driving me crazy.

43
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:04,560
I can't just tell her
that it was me.

44
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,860
Se Young, trust me one last time.

45
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,599
What you're imagining right now is
just a dream, a nightmare.

46
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,569
What did Yu Jin say
to make you like this?

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
She knew I was with her
when she went missing at ten...

48
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:23,580
and that we went
to Seongbuk Port for an outing.

49
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,210
Those weren't enough to say
you caused her disappearance.

50
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,479
I was wearing her hat,
and it dropped on the boat.

51
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,379
I wanted to get on that boat...

52
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,650
and suggested we play
hide-and-seek...

53
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,189
Why do you remember this?

54
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,819
I told you to forget it all!

55
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,560
It won't go away.
What can I do, Mom?

56
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,060
I'm so scared, Mom.

57
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,699
Stop thinking about that
and go to sleep.

58
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,969
You need your medicine.
Your medicine.

59
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:57,939
Here. Take your medicine.

60
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,150
Here. Take it. Now.

61
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,379
I don't want to take it.

62
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:06,349
You have to force yourself
to take it. Here.

63
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:32,980
Se Young, do you feel unwell?

64
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,750
Oh, no.

65
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,550
She couldn't sleep well.

66
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,120
I heard the police called and said
they got the address confused...

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,220
and came to the wrong home.

68
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,449
Yes, how can they make
a mistake like that?

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,560
That ended up halting the adoption.

70
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,860
Wait, you can't adopt him?

71
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,959
Our household was under suspicion
for child abuse.

72
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,230
I don't think
we can do that for a while.

73
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:55,470
Auntie...

74
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,670
I'll look for something.
There should be a way.

75
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,769
It's better to give it some time
and process it again...

76
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,009
instead of trying too hard now
only to fail the screening.

77
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,009
Yes, that'll be safer.

78
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,879
You're done adopting him.

79
00:05:13,949 --> 00:05:15,319
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

80
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,189
This is the only way
for me to see you...

81
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:20,120
for a long time.

82
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,800
Eun Chong, is there something
you want to eat or do today?

83
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,730
There is. I want to eat
marshmallows and hot chocolate.

84
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:30,899
Yu Jin liked those.

85
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,170
Did she tell him to bring those up?

86
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,209
Then, do you want
to make some with me later?

87
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:43,180
You can make that?

88
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:45,980
Auntie Ha Na is
good at making that, too.

89
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:48,620
Then, we can do it together.

90
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,120
That sounds like fun.

91
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:52,620
- Right, Auntie Ha Na?
- Yes.

92
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,930
Yu Jin, you loved hot chocolate
and marshmallows as a kid.

93
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:58,860
You must've remembered that.

94
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,170
- I did? No, I don't remember.
- Gosh.

95
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,139
You loved that.

96
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,040
How can she remember everything?

97
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,740
It'll all come back to her later.

98
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,370
Yes, I'm sure.

99
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,680
You need to realize
that you're a fake very soon.

100
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,550
That's the only way
for Se Young to live.

101
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,720
See? She even remembers
hot chocolate and marshmallows!

102
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,889
She said she didn't remember.

103
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,360
How would Eun Chong know about it?

104
00:06:30,699 --> 00:06:33,800
Yu Jin made him bring him up
when I could hear it.

105
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,870
That's not what's important
right now.

106
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,600
Tell Yu Jin
the blabbering last night...

107
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:41,470
was a mistake.

108
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,470
Otherwise, she'll get
suspicious of you.

109
00:06:44,009 --> 00:06:46,310
She was in my room?

110
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:50,980
I liked hot chocolate
and marshmallows?

111
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,819
Du Na, you loved that.

112
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:56,720
It's a wonder, right?

113
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,329
Come in.

114
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,230
- May I come in for a second?
- Sure.

115
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:14,410
I heard you were in my room
in the middle of the night.

116
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,069
- Don't you remember?
- No.

117
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,480
I have nightmares from time to time.

118
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:24,420
Apparently, I say nonsense
while I'm out of my mind.

119
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,750
I must've said
something odd to you, too.

120
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,220
Did I say something?

121
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,290
You said you were sorry
and apologized,

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,060
then asked for forgiveness.

123
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,300
You don't remember that at all?

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,459
No.

125
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,199
I must've said
random nonsense again.

126
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,670
I do that when I have nightmares.

127
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,470
I didn't mean to say it to you.
Don't mind it.

128
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,949
It felt like I postponed
the adoption. I'm sorry.

129
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,579
You didn't do that on purpose.

130
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:08,029
I don't want to postpone
the adoption anymore.

131
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:11,360
Should I look for a way
without telling Mom?

132
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:18,870
It's Ji Seok.

133
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,170
Hey, Ji Seok.

134
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,079
Right now?

135
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,779
Hey.

136
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:35,990
What's going on?

137
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,059
I was surprised
you suddenly wanted to see me.

138
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,990
I heard there was a problem
with Eun Chong's adoption.

139
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,159
Who made the child abuse report?

140
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:46,529
It was a false alarm.

141
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:49,500
It was meant for another house.
They came to the wrong place.

142
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:53,840
- There was no report against you?
- No.

143
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:57,070
The police checked on child abuse
on the day of the agency's visit,

144
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:59,309
and the police visit was a mistake?

145
00:09:00,009 --> 00:09:01,879
- Do you believe that?
- Then what?

146
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,120
Someone made a false report
to stop you from adopting him.

147
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:07,549
The mistake with the address was
just an excuse to cover it up.

148
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,350
Who would do that?

149
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:14,360
Someone who can't have you
as Eun Chong's legal guardian.

150
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,029
- Who's that?
- Think about it.

151
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,070
Someone who doesn't want Eun Chong
to become my son?

152
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,700
Could it be my mom?

153
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,840
That's a possibility.

154
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,179
It's honestly tough for a mom
to let her daughter become a single mom.

155
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,610
Aunt Myung Ji
also disapproved of the adoption...

156
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,179
because I'd be a single mother.

157
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,320
Yoon Se Young's mom was
worried about you?

158
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,789
Yes, and she's been nice
to Eun Chong lately.

159
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,690
She's now with me
on the adoption, too.

160
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:48,259
Se Young's mom must know...

161
00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:50,460
she's a fake
and that Eun Chong is the real one.

162
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,860
Is something going on?

163
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,200
I heard you told
Ji Eun and Ji Chang...

164
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,669
to accept any help from my mom.

165
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,110
And you were concerned
about Eun Chong's adoption, too.

166
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,480
I told you already.
I must be growing up.

167
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:11,080
Is that really everything?

168
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,320
Nothing else is going on, right?

169
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,990
No.

170
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,220
I'm sorry...

171
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,559
for giving you a tough time
and acting like a jerk...

172
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,429
all along.

173
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,000
Gosh. Is this a prank?

174
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,980
Should I help you
with Eun Chong's adoption?

175
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,279
We can process this
without Chairwoman Shin finding out.

176
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,879
Do you need her approval?

177
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,179
Please find out.

178
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,419
Okay.

179
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,759
Ji Seok is supporting
Eun Chong's adoption, too.

180
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,590
No way. That just gave me chills.

181
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,600
How did he change so drastically?

182
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,899
What if he was equipped
with a cruel twist?

183
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,830
I can tell when I look at him...

184
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,840
that he's totally serious.

185
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,000
If he turns to our side,

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,970
we'll be an unbeatable family.

187
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:11,179
Eun Chong would get adopted
very soon.

188
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:13,580
There won't be a problem
if Ji Seok helps out.

189
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:15,950
- All right!
- All right!

190
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,320
- Anyway.
- Yes?

191
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,750
Can we all be this happy?

192
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:25,320
I'm feeling kind of anxious.

193
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,389
- Darn it. Shut your mouth.
- Gosh.

194
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:30,129
Why do you always hit me? Darn it.

195
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:32,129
You'll jinx this.

196
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,950
When my mommy was younger,

197
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,279
she loved to dip marshmallows
in hot chocolate.

198
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,750
I see.

199
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,820
My mom's place also had a fireplace.

200
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,019
Auntie Ha Na said
she thought my mommy was...

201
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,590
probably from a rich family.

202
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,759
Right, Auntie?

203
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,799
Yes.

204
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,429
I guess so.

205
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,299
Mom, you're really good at this.

206
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,240
You must've made this often.

207
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,370
Well, I made it occasionally
whenever you wanted some.

208
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,080
Gosh, it looks like snow.

209
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,509
- Here.
- Hey.

210
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,779
Gosh, Eun Chong.

211
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Take this.

212
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,220
Does it look like snow?

213
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,159
All right! Hey.

214
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,730
You... Where should I put it?

215
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:37,129
Your head?

216
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:38,929
- Here.
- Gosh.

217
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:41,970
I'll get you, too.

218
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,039
The three are putting on a show
to rub me in the face.

219
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,240
Aunt Yeo Jin must know everything.

220
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,809
What are you up to?

221
00:13:00,549 --> 00:13:01,820
What's with her?

222
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,059
- Like this.
- Put it in like this.

223
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,419
- Make it pretty.
- Oh, my.

224
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,129
- Look!
- Let me try again.

225
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:11,259
My daughter is
on the verge of death,

226
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,669
- but you three look so happy.
- You can't force it.

227
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,500
- Is that how you do it?
- I can't force it?

228
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,309
Where are you going?

229
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:25,740
I don't want to be here.

230
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,440
You don't believe me, either.

231
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,080
You treat me like I'm a lunatic.

232
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,610
Is this because
of hot chocolate and marshmallows?

233
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,549
They were making it
because Eun Chong wanted some.

234
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:36,149
Yu Jin makes Eun Chong
and Aunt Yeo Jin do that...

235
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,350
to get her revenge on me.

236
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,919
Why won't you believe me?

237
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:43,629
All right.
Calm down, and I'll go out with you.

238
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,399
Go east.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,769
Will she be okay if she goes east?

240
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,710
Yu Jin remembers everything,
doesn't she?

241
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,379
- She doesn't.
- Really?

242
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,509
If you want to lose your anxiety,
look east.

243
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:05,049
Yes, her newlywed home faces east.

244
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,590
Your bed faces south now, right?

245
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:10,750
We'll go home
and change that to the east.

246
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,730
Mom, this is the last box.

247
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,169
Gosh, there are
so many kinds of sauces.

248
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,269
Yes, customers will have fun
picking and choosing.

249
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,980
And you'll have fun making money?

250
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:33,610
That'd be great.

251
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:38,450
I think I'm about ready.

252
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,620
Let's go home after this.

253
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,649
You should get some rest
before your grand opening.

254
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,490
I should look around and see
if I missed anything.

255
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,029
Even students were supposed to rest
the day before their test.

256
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,429
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

257
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,669
At your home?

258
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,500
Her economical situation must be
the biggest issue for the adoption.

259
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,309
What if I become
her financial guarantor?

260
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,480
I could probably do that
as her younger brother.

261
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,580
I'll look into it.

262
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:10,480
Did you think Chairwoman Shin
made the false report?

263
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,019
It could've been Se Young's mom.

264
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:14,720
It would hurt her the most...

265
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:17,090
if Ha Na became
Eun Chong's guardian.

266
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,360
I heard her attitude to Eun Chong
recently changed, too.

267
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,700
Are you saying she knows
he's Chairwoman Shin's grandson?

268
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,059
It's just a possibility for now.

269
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,169
Even Se Young
doesn't seem to know yet.

270
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,070
Yes?

271
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:37,210
Hey, you two were here already.

272
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,710
- Hello, Mr. Han.
- Hello, Mr. Han.

273
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,950
- Please have a seat.
- Sure.

274
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,620
Something you can use
to put pressure on Chairwoman Shin?

275
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:53,360
I wondered if there was anything
other than corporate raiding.

276
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,330
Do you have
to put pressure on her again?

277
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,899
I may need it in the future.

278
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,070
But you won't tell me what it is?

279
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,700
I'll tell you
when I'm 100 percent sure.

280
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,870
I'll look for something. Eat up.

281
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,470
Yes, sir. You should eat, too.

282
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,879
Does this concern Eun Chong?

283
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,990
I suddenly miss Mommy
after drinking hot chocolate.

284
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:26,559
You can watch her videos.

285
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,690
- Do you want to go see those?
- Yes.

286
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:33,399
He wants to see his mommy,
so we'll go look at her videos.

287
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,269
- Chat with Jin Goo when he comes.
- Okay.

288
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:37,600
Let's go.

289
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,750
- I'm here.
- You're here.

290
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,220
Mom's in my room with Eun Chong.

291
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,019
- She asks you to wait a moment.
- Okay.

292
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,289
Is Se Young home?

293
00:16:58,289 --> 00:17:00,759
She just left with Aunt Myung Ji.

294
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:03,460
Put it closer to the wall. Goodness.

295
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,099
Come on out now. Okay.

296
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,240
All done. Goodness.

297
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,210
Gosh. Okay.

298
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,809
Goodness.

299
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,380
I wonder...

300
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:28,150
if I'll ever stop using talismans.

301
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,690
- Let's go.
- No.

302
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:33,059
I don't want to be where Yu Jin is.

303
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,130
Then, at least call Jin Goo.
Don't be here alone.

304
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,259
I'll manage.

305
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:41,369
I'm leaving.

306
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,009
(Goo Ji Seok)

307
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,819
It must be hard on Se Young
to go through police questioning.

308
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:05,460
What will happen
to Eun Chong's adoption?

309
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:09,130
Mom thought I should do it later
because of the child abuse incident.

310
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:12,759
But I'm thinking of processing it
without telling Mom.

311
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,299
Without telling the chairwoman?

312
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:18,140
I think I can manage it on my own
so that she won't mind it.

313
00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:21,309
Please don't tell her about it.

314
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,009
Okay.

315
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,509
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

316
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,349
Did my mom
go through something unfortunate...

317
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:37,349
other than losing me?

318
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,759
What do you mean?

319
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,789
She looks sad from time to time.

320
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,660
She looks distant
even as she speaks to me.

321
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,700
When we went out together,
she went after someone else...

322
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,430
while calling my name.

323
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,069
Is that so?

324
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,700
It looks like there's someone...

325
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,009
she misses and wants to see
even now.

326
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:59,839
It's probably your father.

327
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,180
Aunt Myung Ji thinks
it can't be him,

328
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,220
that Mom won't feel anything
for a husband...

329
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,619
who's been away for over 20 years.

330
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,049
But you haven't asked
the chairwoman?

331
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,160
I felt cautious about asking.

332
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,299
You wanted to be careful
for a while.

333
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,049
Do you feel unwell?

334
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,180
Because of the police?

335
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,390
- How did you know?
- My sister talked to Ha Na.

336
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:49,589
The punishment is too harsh
for nudging him on the head.

337
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,130
I'm so unlucky.

338
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,369
You don't have to go that far.

339
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,970
It could've been worse.

340
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:01,470
Has Yu Jin...

341
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:04,880
ever talked about her childhood
with you?

342
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,240
No, she doesn't remember.

343
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:10,849
- I think she does.
- Such as?

344
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,119
You're doing that again.

345
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,160
What does Yoon Yu Jin remember?

346
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,329
Everything.

347
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:30,970
Get some sleep on my bed.

348
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,200
You look tired.
Do you want some egg porridge?

349
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,809
Yes.

350
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,079
Wake me up when you're done.
I'll be in your room.

351
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,650
I left my car key up there.

352
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,529
Why won't she pick up?

353
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,170
Gosh.

354
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,809
Where did she go
in that short while?

355
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,539
There it is.

356
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,089
Come on.

357
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,920
Where did she go in that state?
Why won't she pick up...

358
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,799
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

359
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:50,450
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

360
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,240
What's wrong?

361
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,509
- I'm leaving.
- Stay for some egg porridge.

362
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,279
I don't feel well.

363
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:30,849
Mom...

364
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,329
Mom.

365
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,160
Why are you here?

366
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,299
What are you two doing right now?

367
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,740
Did you lure her inside?

368
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,009
You came here to do this,
didn't you?

369
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,279
You're a sick punk.

370
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,250
Did you just smirk?

371
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:59,279
You know Eun Chong is
the real grandson, don't you?

372
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,720
You stopped her from adopting him.

373
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Yes, because this is ridiculous.

374
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,420
How dare you?

375
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:11,089
Let go of me. Let go!

376
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,460
That's enough!

377
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,200
I came here on my own.

378
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,630
I wanted to come here.

379
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,099
Come with me right now.

380
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,769
Come out now!

381
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,240
No.

382
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,440
You've gone crazy.

383
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,609
Come out. Now!

384
00:23:28,809 --> 00:23:30,980
- That hurts!
- Come!

385
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,240
That's for Ms. Sim.

386
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,910
I couldn't even help her
before her grand opening.

387
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,539
It's all right, Ms. Chairwoman.

388
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,240
It's for your mother.

389
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:03,279
She helped us out very much
for a long time.

390
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,420
It was a shame that
the end was like that.

391
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:11,759
I'll visit her later
and bid her good luck.

392
00:24:11,819 --> 00:24:14,059
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

393
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,390
Was Eun Chong's adoption postponed?

394
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:22,829
- I won't let Goo Ha Na adopt him.
- Why not?

395
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:25,269
If she takes
both parental rights and custody,

396
00:24:25,769 --> 00:24:28,339
I won't have any rights to him.

397
00:24:28,869 --> 00:24:31,539
Even if she turns malicious
and refuses to show him to me,

398
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,940
I won't be able to do anything.

399
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,980
Then, what will you tell Ms. Goo?

400
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:39,819
I'll make an excuse
to stall for time.

401
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,589
Pretend like
you don't know anything.

402
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:48,390
What's wrong?
Did she say anything about the adoption?

403
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,690
No.

404
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,430
I feel bad about it, too.

405
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:55,900
Eun Chong wanted it desperately,
but I couldn't make it happen.

406
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,299
May I share a word with you?

407
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,670
Sure.

408
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,769
Ms. Goo was worried...

409
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:07,109
that you showed a sad face
from time to time.

410
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,779
She asked if you went through
another unfortunate event.

411
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,650
Is that so?

412
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,950
I was reminded of Yu Jin
whenever I was with Ha Na,

413
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:19,420
so I must've shown my emotions.

414
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,730
I'll be careful.
Thank you for telling me.

415
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:26,660
I heard she found
your daughter's photo in your room.

416
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,769
She wasn't suspicious of you,
but you should be careful.

417
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,670
All right.

418
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,069
Also, you need to show
more care, interest,

419
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,509
and love to her than Eun Chong.

420
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:42,809
In the end, that is
the best you can do for Eun Chong.

421
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,480
I understand what you mean.

422
00:25:45,849 --> 00:25:49,250
Do you remember
the promise you made me?

423
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,220
However, I do have one term.

424
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,029
Please keep her safe
no matter what the situation is.

425
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,400
Promise me that
you won't hurt her...

426
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,369
in any way.

427
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,940
I do. Don't worry about it.

428
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,009
Yes, ma'am.

429
00:26:19,779 --> 00:26:21,450
How long have you been seeing him?

430
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,289
What are you going to do?

431
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,720
I have no idea.

432
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,190
Why did you foolishly fall
for that guy...

433
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,190
who came to get his revenge on you?

434
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:31,329
I made a move first.

435
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,900
What?

436
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,829
I wanted to be with Ji Seok first.

437
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,329
What's with you?

438
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,410
Do not let Jin Goo find out.

439
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:51,210
Se Young.

440
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,019
Hey, Jin Goo. When did you get here?

441
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,789
The chairwoman wanted to see me,
so I just got here.

442
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,059
Why did you look so alarmed?

443
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,460
Were you talking behind my back?

444
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,299
There's nothing
to badmouth you about.

445
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,960
I heard you'd get questioned
by the police.

446
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,500
Why didn't you tell me?

447
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,829
It wasn't something to boast about.

448
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:14,700
I'm going with her tomorrow.
You don't have to mind it.

449
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,740
You two should chat.

450
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,910
Where did you go with Mother?

451
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,690
I felt stifled,
so I went to get some air.

452
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,819
- One of your earrings is gone.
- What?

453
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,859
Where did I lose it?

454
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,529
It's your favorite pair.
I got you those.

455
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,430
Yes, could it be in my car?

456
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,099
I should look for it.

457
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,240
Anyway, why did
Aunt Yeo Jin want to see you?

458
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,410
My mom would open
her new business tomorrow,

459
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,410
so the chairwoman gave me money
to give to her.

460
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,650
I'll be there with my mom tomorrow.

461
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,750
Should I go to the police with you?

462
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,849
No, I'll go with Mom.

463
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:04,490
Why didn't you
pick up your phone yesterday?

464
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:06,759
I fell asleep early.

465
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:09,289
When will you go home?

466
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,660
Now that I saw you, I should go.

467
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,430
Okay.

468
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,079
Bye.

469
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,180
Hey, wait.

470
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:34,279
Don't tell my mom about adoption.

471
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:36,890
- Okay.
- Right!

472
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,289
I forgot about the bracelet.

473
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,920
I'll show it to you later.

474
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,859
Okay.

475
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:46,359
Anyway, we said we'd be friends,
but you still speak respectfully.

476
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,430
It's so awkward
for me to speak casually to you.

477
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,400
Se Young won't like that, either.

478
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:53,470
Then, we'd say we were childhood friends
from 20 years ago.

479
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:56,539
She'd hate it even more
if you told her the truth.

480
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,440
Gosh, 20 years ago, I was 10.

481
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,809
Now that I thought about it,
that young girl...

482
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,750
went through so much in her life.

483
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,990
Yes.

484
00:29:17,829 --> 00:29:19,930
Again, she's talking about 20 years ago,
when she was 10.

485
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,900
She's mentioning this here and there
for me to hear it.

486
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,029
She's trying to stress me out.

487
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:27,970
I'll end up dying with stress
if I stay here.

488
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,789
I'm going east.

489
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,289
East.

490
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,029
Hey.

491
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,000
Are you going somewhere?

492
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,299
Where is she going
this late at night?

493
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,569
Se Young...

494
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,450
This brat.

495
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,079
What's wrong, Aunt Myung Ji?

496
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,789
She left last night with a suitcase.

497
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,930
Why are you telling me this now?

498
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,000
- The person you have reached...
- Come on.

499
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,569
(Lala Palace, Unit 1002)

500
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:38,369
She's at her newlywed home.

501
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,880
She went to his place.

502
00:30:48,019 --> 00:30:49,089
Se Young.

503
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,700
Se Young, what's with you?

504
00:31:01,859 --> 00:31:03,470
You're as cold as ice.

505
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:04,970
- Come out.
- No!

506
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:08,339
No, this is the most eastern place
in this house.

507
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:10,240
I have to go east.

508
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,039
- I have to stay here.
- Get a grip on yourself!

509
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,940
No, you get a grip on yourself!

510
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,289
Look at me.

511
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,359
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

512
00:31:32,859 --> 00:31:33,930
Yu Jin is...

513
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:36,900
dead.

514
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,400
Stop lying.

515
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,369
- That's just a lie!
- She's not Yu Jin!

516
00:31:41,539 --> 00:31:43,440
Goo Ha Na is a fake.

517
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,079
"Fake?"

518
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,509
Yu Jin died...

519
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:53,220
six years ago.

520
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:59,819
Goo Ha Na was a fake
that your aunt made up.

521
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,130
A knockoff.

522
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,329
"Fake?"

523
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:10,660
(Cinderella Game)

524
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,529
I don't care what you do
to get her feelings.

525
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:14,430
She'll marry Jin Goo anyway.

526
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,029
The air seemed personal
between those two.

527
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,369
You should make sure your
future mother-in-law doesn't get anxious.

528
00:33:20,569 --> 00:33:23,109
No way. A fake daughter?

529
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,680
- A fake daughter?

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,309
We'll kick out
that fake daughter first.

00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,809
I'll begin to play both sides.

00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,920
I'll kick her out
in the most miserable and gruesome way.

00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,250
Life is so interesting.
