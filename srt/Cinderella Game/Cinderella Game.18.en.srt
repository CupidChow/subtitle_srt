1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,109
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,509
(Episode 18)

5
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,549
- Lee Eun Chong.
- Yes!

6
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,009
Let's go.

7
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,789
Eun Chong's mom was found
in an uninhabited home on an island...

8
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,060
at the time of her disappearance.

9
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,170
People in that neighborhood thought
she was that family's granddaughter.

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,700
Right before her death,
snippets of her memories came back,

11
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,969
but they had
nothing to do with an island.

12
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,879
So, is she badly ill?

13
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,510
She's in the mortuary,

14
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,780
classified as a deceased person
without family.

15
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,209
She passed away?

16
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:18,319
I wanted to confirm this
and make sure,

17
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,920
so I want to take
Eun Chong's DNA to get tested.

18
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,230
Someone named Shin Yeo Jin...

19
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,640
just came into the emergency center,
so could I ask about her condition?

20
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,299
I'm sorry to ask,
but what is your relationship?

21
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,409
- I'm her family.
- One second, please.

22
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,280
This time, I really thought
she was her daughter.

23
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,290
Didn't she do the parentage test...

24
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,319
because their DNA matched,
and they could be related?

25
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,930
The chairwoman's DNA
was contaminated.

26
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,859
So, Yeo Jin's DNA was
contaminated, too.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
That was why we didn't get a call
when Yu Jin died.

28
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,639
Who could've done this?

29
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,210
When will you have the result?

30
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,810
It'll take a while,

31
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,680
but I'll speed it up
as soon as possible.

32
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,919
Actually, Detective Min,
I was going to call you.

33
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,780
I saw the news two days ago...

34
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:28,319
about the family
that found their son after 28 years.

35
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,590
We're still getting lots of calls
because of that news.

36
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,259
It's rewarding for us, too.

37
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,189
When I saw that news,

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,900
I hoped I'd be able to find
Eun Chong's grandmother.

39
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,599
But I didn't expect to meet her
after she passed.

40
00:02:43,699 --> 00:02:45,699
Well, we don't know for sure yet.

41
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,710
Yes, we don't have the result yet.

42
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,379
So, Ha Na,

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,379
it's kind of weird
for me to bring this up now,

44
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:56,680
but there's a problem
with the mortuary,

45
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,680
so she'll have to have
her funeral tomorrow.

46
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:02,250
Otherwise, she'd be cremated
as a deceased without family.

47
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,219
I need you to make a decision.

48
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,060
Me?

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,740
Who could it be?

50
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,409
Who's trying to stop us
from finding Yu Jin?

51
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:25,110
Grandpa.

52
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:28,879
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

53
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,250
Your hat looks awesome.

54
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,219
Thank you.

55
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:36,389
Why are you here alone?
Where's your mom?

56
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:37,759
I came with my auntie.

57
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,419
She's over there.

58
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:44,430
Grandpa, may I try your hat on?

59
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,300
Gosh, it's huge.

60
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,710
But you still look great.

61
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,080
Thank you.

62
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,080
I have to go now, Grandpa.

63
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,780
Goodbye!

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,849
Auntie Ha Na!

65
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,719
Don't run. You might fall.

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,990
Let's go.

67
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,970
Eun Chong.

68
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,779
We'll know for sure
if she's your grandmother...

69
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,610
after the test results come out.

70
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,050
We don't know yet, right?

71
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,480
No.

72
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,490
But she must've been
quite ill for a while.

73
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,060
She passed away not long ago.

74
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,160
Then, is she in the otherworld now?

75
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,600
Yes.

76
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,600
If she was your grandmother,
she'd be with your mommy now.

77
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,939
We have to give her
a funeral tomorrow.

78
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:05,410
The government gives a funeral
to those without family.

79
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,449
But she could be your grandmother,

80
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,420
so I thought
we could give her the funeral.

81
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,019
What do you think?

82
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:21,990
Let's pray that
she'll go to a good place.

83
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,370
Ms. Goo.

84
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,540
Oh, my. Mr. Hwang.

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,339
Hey, Eun Chong.

86
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,410
He must be in a bad mood today.

87
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,550
Is he sick?

88
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,180
No.

89
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,519
What brings you here?

90
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,850
Someone got sick.

91
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,959
- Your mother?
- No.

92
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,300
Mr. Hwang, may I come to work
in the afternoon tomorrow?

93
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,500
I have to be at a funeral.

94
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,370
Did someone pass away?

95
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,269
Eun Chong's grandmother.

96
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,110
Really?

97
00:06:10,209 --> 00:06:11,509
Then, take the day off.

98
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:12,709
It's all right.

99
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,250
I can come in the afternoon.
I have some work to do.

100
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,579
Is there anything I can do to help?

101
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,250
No, thank you
for your consideration.

102
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,300
Mommy. My mommy in paradise.

103
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:36,069
By any chance, did you meet Grandma?

104
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,509
If you met her,

105
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,879
then she must be my grandmother.

106
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:48,980
Can you please tell me?

107
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,149
But Kongkong,

108
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,620
why is everyone I miss...

109
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:02,259
in paradise already?

110
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,370
If she is Eun Chong's grandmother,
she'll reunite with him as a corpse.

111
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,410
You need to learn
a better way to talk.

112
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,579
We're holding a funeral tomorrow.

113
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:20,310
Is the borough office
or the community center doing it?

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,410
I should do it.

115
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:23,879
Why should you do that?

116
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,250
You don't even know
if she's his grandmother or not.

117
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,620
What if she is?

118
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,589
We won't be able
to collect her remains...

119
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,259
if her ashes get mixed up
with other people.

120
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:34,329
It costs a fortune
to hold a funeral.

121
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,790
I'll use the money from my savings.

122
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,259
My gosh,
this isn't why you work that hard.

123
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,170
Shouldn't his rich grandma show up
and turn around...

124
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,800
your life, Eun Chong's life,

125
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,069
and even our lives?
That's only fair.

126
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:47,040
How could she be a nuisance
even after death?

127
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,610
Gosh. Don't you dare say
anything like that around Eun Chong.

128
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,279
A funeral?

129
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
She should do it
after the test results come out.

130
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,079
I can't believe how nosy she is.

131
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,279
Why would I go there?

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,850
I'm busy!

133
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,089
What was that?

134
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:06,420
Oh, she found someone who could be
Eun Chong's grandmother,

135
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,689
but she had already passed away.

136
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,290
The DNA test result wasn't in yet,
but she told me...

137
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:12,100
the funeral was tomorrow
and invited me.

138
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,230
Why would I go
to a stranger's funeral?

139
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,970
Gosh, she must love
making her life difficult.

140
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,569
Struggling must've become her hobby.

141
00:08:19,569 --> 00:08:21,639
She could be
Eun Chong's grandmother.

142
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:25,240
What? Well, that's possible.

143
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,889
It doesn't matter
if she's your grandmother...

144
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,789
or not.

145
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,460
We should give a funeral
to someone who has no family.

146
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:49,570
I still hope she isn't the one.

147
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,070
I want to let you meet
your grandmother.

148
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:58,480
It'd be so unfair
if you never got to see...

149
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,549
your mommy, daddy,

150
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,419
and grandma, too.

151
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:11,159
This was why I couldn't find Yu Jin
until this day.

152
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:13,960
If my DNA was contaminated,
then it'd be impossible.

153
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,129
I'm going to register it again.

154
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:19,159
- You took a sample recently, so...
- That could be contaminated, too.

155
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,830
I'll do it again and again...

156
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,830
No.

157
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,970
I don't trust the police anymore.
I'm going to the NFS.

158
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,039
Do you want to do that?

159
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,509
It'd take a little longer
to do that with the NFS,

160
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,879
but you could trust them
to be safe and professional.

161
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,480
Tell the legal team leader
to come home tomorrow.

162
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,549
Yes, ma'am.

163
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,389
Sung Ho's DNA
could be contaminated, too.

164
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,120
If his DNA was also contaminated,
someone must've done it on purpose.

165
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,389
Of course.

166
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,759
But something like that
shouldn't happen.

167
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,299
I'll ask the police tomorrow
and find out if that's the case.

168
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,970
This was why
I saw Yu Jin in my dream.

169
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,200
She came to tell me this.

170
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,870
She must've resented me...

171
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,350
for sitting around
and waiting like a fool.

172
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,950
It was a relief that
you found out now.

173
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,889
Yu Jin is such a smart girl.

174
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:20,419
You and Se Young can go home.

175
00:10:20,889 --> 00:10:22,759
Jin Goo and Ms. Jang can stay.

176
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,299
I want to stay, too.

177
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,100
Mom, you should go home.

178
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,470
Just me?

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,740
Okay, then.
Call me if anything happens.

180
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
- Yes.
- Okay.

181
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,610
Yeo Jin, you should get some rest.

182
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,610
She's going to the NFS
to register her DNA.

183
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,149
What do I do now?

184
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:47,049
She won't be able to register right away
after the request.

185
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:50,120
The police needed to send them
her daughter's DNA,

186
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,990
the one they took 20 years ago.

187
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,190
It'd take at least a month or two.

188
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:58,200
Then, can you find a way
within that period?

189
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,259
I need to.

190
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes, she'll request
an investigation...

191
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:06,299
into the reason
for the contamination.

192
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,940
Is that all right?

193
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,169
There are many ways
to dodge the responsibility.

194
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,080
But it will take a lot of money.

195
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,950
I recently gave you some.

196
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,149
I get paid by the gig.

197
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,850
If you don't want to do it,
then you can stop here.

198
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,090
Good grief.

199
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,559
Wait.

200
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:33,299
What if I tell her
that she already died?

201
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:37,700
She needs to know that to give up.

202
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,299
If she finds out her daughter died
in a hit-and-run accident,

203
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,139
she'll open a reinvestigation
right away.

204
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,039
I thought you destroyed
all the evidence.

205
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,940
You can never be too careful.

206
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,679
It's only been six years.

207
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:52,480
You can tell her or not
after at least ten years.

208
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,320
I have to wait four more years?

209
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,860
This is driving me crazy.

210
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,149
Yes, Attorney Ko.

211
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,259
Have you contacted
the director of the children's home?

212
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:34,429
The old director's number in Canada
must be incorrect,

213
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,830
so I couldn't reach out.

214
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,200
But I scheduled a meeting
with the current one this afternoon.

215
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,200
I'll meet you
in front of the hotel in an hour.

216
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,220
Goodness, Ha Na.

217
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:44,129
Eun Chong.

218
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,799
You poor thing.

219
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,519
Why is no one picking up?

220
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,350
You're here.

221
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,389
I went through so much trouble
trying to find you.

222
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:14,289
Why are you doing this so far away?

223
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,190
Keep silence.

224
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,860
Why are you crying?

225
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,570
She's not your grandmother.

226
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,500
Why is that little kid...

227
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,470
looking so mature?
He's breaking my heart.

228
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,750
Contact the NFS
and request a DNA sample collection.

229
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,190
And have Yu Jin's DNA sample
sent to them as well,

230
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,559
the one we registered
with the police 20 years ago.

231
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:46,620
Yes, ma'am.

232
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,690
It'd be much better for her to know
that Yu Jin already died.

233
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,799
But it'll be troublesome
if she opens up...

234
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:56,929
a reinvestigation
for her hit-and-run accident.

235
00:14:57,129 --> 00:14:58,970
I'll also request an investigation
into the cause of the contamination.

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,440
This is driving me crazy.

237
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:06,009
If someone did that on purpose,

238
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,980
we must make this public...

239
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,549
by using the media.

240
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:11,419
She wouldn't have known...

241
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:13,720
if it hadn't been for this.

242
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,820
The investigation must be
absolutely thorough.

243
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,789
- Do you get it as the legal team?
- Yes, ma'am.

244
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,159
Did you also wish to confirm
the contamination of Mr. Yoon's DNA?

245
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,190
President Hwang is on it now.

246
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:26,659
Ms. Chairwoman.

247
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:30,000
What happened?
What did the police say?

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,570
The information is sensitive,
so they can only disclose it...

249
00:15:32,669 --> 00:15:34,570
to the actual person,
not even his family.

250
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,710
And it'd be possible
if we got Mr. Yoon's consent.

251
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:40,980
We have no idea where he is
and what he did for 20 years.

252
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,179
How are we going to get his consent?

253
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:44,919
Goodness, why couldn't Sung Ho...

254
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:47,019
at least leave
his contact information?

255
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,889
The files from that time were
lost in a fire,

256
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,259
so we didn't have anything left.

257
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,889
What was your daughter's name?

258
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,899
Her real name was Yoon Yu Jin,

259
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,529
but she was called Lee Du Na
at the children's home.

260
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,269
She was found in an island village
and ended up here.

261
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,809
Then, she emigrated to America
with her foster parents.

262
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,710
She came to Korea six years ago,

263
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,909
but she died in a car accident.

264
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,179
Her death declaration had
the former nun's signature.

265
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,049
Also, Ms. Lee had...

266
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,519
a one-year-old son at that time.

267
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,750
He should be seven by now.

268
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,720
You must be looking for him.

269
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,159
Yes, but please don't tell anyone...

270
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,690
that I'm looking for him
for his safety.

271
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:32,899
I will compensate you handsomely
if I can find him.

272
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,399
The staff here all changed
five years ago,

273
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,269
along with my appointment.

274
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,639
The former staff aren't here,
so it won't be easy.

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,809
But I'll look into it
and get back to you.

276
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:44,610
Please do that.

277
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:47,240
- She wasn't her daughter?
- No.

278
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,809
She must've gone to the hospital
because of that shock.

279
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,450
If their DNAs matched,
how could she not be her daughter?

280
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,419
I need to look more into that.

281
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,590
It must've been a relief
to Hwang Jin Goo and Yoon Se Young.

282
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,360
Have you heard back from Hassan?

283
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:04,460
Daeri Construction is in contact
with Hassan in Dubai,

284
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:05,829
so we'll hear back very soon.

285
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
I still can't reach Mr. Han.

286
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,140
I began to wonder
if something happened to him.

287
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:18,309
Eun Chong.

288
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,950
Everyone is alone.

289
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:25,250
Auntie Ha Na, Auntie Ji Eun,

290
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,450
Uncle Ji Seok and I
don't have a mommy or daddy.

291
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:29,920
And of course, no grandmother.

292
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,019
So, don't be so sad.

293
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,490
I'm fine.

294
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,029
All right.

295
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:39,329
It's a relief that you know a thing
or two about life.

296
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,470
Eun Chong,
I have to go to work right away.

297
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,769
Stay home with Uncle Ji Chang.

298
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:47,700
May I go to the kindergarten?

299
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,069
Do you want to?

300
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:50,470
I'll drop him off.

301
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,940
- Get changed and grab your bag.
- Okay.

302
00:17:54,609 --> 00:17:55,680
Right.

303
00:17:57,549 --> 00:17:59,180
Ji Seok told you
to use this for the funeral.

304
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,789
I'm grateful.

305
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:05,059
He only acts cold on the outside.
He doesn't feel that way.

306
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,319
Everyone knows
he's only cold on the outside.

307
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,559
Not me. I don't know that.

308
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,289
- Let's see how much he gave you.
- Hey.

309
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,329
I had to use my savings to do this.

310
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,470
Return it to him if she doesn't turn out
to be his grandmother.

311
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,269
I thought he said
to use it for the funeral.

312
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,900
I'm going to work like this.

313
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,410
- What about you?
- Well.

314
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,710
My shift is in the afternoon,
so I'll leave later.

315
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,410
Why? You should rest
at your huge house with high ceilings.

316
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,650
Can you really get some rest
in this tiny little space?

317
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,849
It's because I'm tired
after traveling that far.

318
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:36,089
I'll leave soon!

319
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:37,150
All right, then.

320
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:39,559
Great work today.

321
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:41,430
Thanks, my younger siblings.

322
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:43,890
Bye, now.

323
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,170
Can he contaminate the DNA
even if it's with the NFS?

324
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,430
Will everything be okay
once the investigation begins?

325
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,970
Things won't happen that quickly
even if it goes to the NFS.

326
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,910
And opening an investigation
won't resolve everything.

327
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,109
I'm handling everything,

328
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,480
so you don't have to mind it.

329
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:01,750
Just do everything I tell you.

330
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:03,450
What now?

331
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,480
I heard tourists from Dubai would
be coming in soon.

332
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,150
Tamper with the numbers
for their flight and lodging.

333
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,920
Do you think that's easy to do?

334
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,720
You can't live your life
only doing easy things.

335
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,930
Did you think
you'd have Hyesung Group for free?

336
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,660
You said I wouldn't have to do
anything dirty.

337
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,829
What about the real estate business?

338
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:23,569
The real estate market
isn't showing good returns now.

339
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,269
Think of how urgent this is
if I have to ask you.

340
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,839
I have to pay a lot more
to get to the NFS.

341
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,339
And who cares
if you get some dirt on you?

342
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,880
Look at everyone who's a success.

343
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,109
They're as hideous as their fame.

344
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,319
I mean, Hyesung Group will be yours.

345
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:40,619
Who cares if your hands are dirty?

346
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,579
You still have the habit
of biting your nails.

347
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,210
Mind your own. Stop irritating me.

348
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,289
Did you move into my apartment
to harass me?

349
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,460
- Are you in Block 4, Unit 1001?
- Have you been digging my back?

350
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,890
You did that first.

351
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,460
You moved across the hall
from my newlywed home on purpose.

352
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,160
What are you trying to get
by provoking me?

353
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:28,829
- Break off my marriage?
- Why would I do that?

354
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,799
It's exciting.

355
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,839
You love exciting things.

356
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,910
That was ages ago.

357
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,039
Did your taste change
along with your man?

358
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,710
Are you more drawn to stability?

359
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,940
You're boring now.

360
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,210
Try and harass me.

361
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,710
You'll find out
who'll end up suffering more.

362
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,680
Was that why you staged
the money envelope incident?

363
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:54,859
You've lost your mind.

364
00:21:07,569 --> 00:21:09,740
This is the proposal
for Dubai tourists.

365
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,140
Sure.

366
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,410
This is the proposal
for Dubai tourists.

367
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:15,950
Great work, Ha Na.

368
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,180
Thank you, Mr. Yoon.

369
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,660
What an eyesore.

370
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,509
This is the proposal
for Dubai tourists.

371
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:45,980
I heard tourists from Dubai would
be coming in soon.

372
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,910
Tamper with the numbers
for their flight and lodging.

373
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,849
Ms. Goo.

374
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,950
I'm in charge of funding for Dubai,
so only do as I say.

375
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,720
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

376
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,259
And I don't care if you're going
to a funeral or a wedding.

377
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,390
You have to talk to me
to take half a day off.

378
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,599
How many times have I told you?
Or are you just stupid?

379
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:09,329
Who do you have behind you
to act so unruly?

380
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:12,940
The president? Or Head Director Goo?

381
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,769
I'm sorry.
I was in a bit of a hurry.

382
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,940
I won't let that happen again.

383
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:20,380
Follow me.

384
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:51,839
Do you have...

385
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,440
a habit of receiving things?

386
00:22:54,509 --> 00:22:57,410
The money envelope incident
just quieted down,

387
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:59,450
but you took an outfit
from the chairwoman already?

388
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:02,519
You were behind
the money envelope incident.

389
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,960
Should I just spread that video?

390
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,690
It's not like that.

391
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,829
Actually, she said we got
the Dubai contract thanks to me...

392
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,059
and called it a gift.

393
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,799
- What?
- She must've thought...

394
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:15,470
I was someone else.

395
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,299
But I missed the time to inform her,

396
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,799
so I wanted to tell her
the truth soon.

397
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,839
She'd get much more unruly
after finding out that it was her.

398
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,109
If you stayed quiet already,
then keep it that way.

399
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,980
She would feel so awkward
if she found out.

400
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,880
Would it be better
if I stayed quiet?

401
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,819
It wouldn't be good manners
to give it back to her.

402
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:37,049
Return it for money or something.

403
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,420
I didn't think returning it
would be good manners, either.

404
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,289
She paid with a credit card,
so I couldn't return it anyway.

405
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:44,329
Then, just keep it.

406
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,329
But you know,
I have that outfit, too.

407
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:48,670
It's the newest from this season.

408
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,200
Don't wear it to work.

409
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,539
What you're wearing today...

410
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,339
looks better on you.

411
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,779
Why is she always out to get me?

412
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,920
Should I drop
her money envelope video?

413
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,289
Accepting that outfit will
make me feel uneasy for a long time.

414
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,089
I'll tell her
and give it back to her.

415
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,730
Ha Na will be too afraid...

416
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,700
to wear an outfit that costs
1,000 dollars.

417
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,900
I knew it'd be cooped up
in the closet.

418
00:24:28,609 --> 00:24:31,039
So, I should wear it for her.

419
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,410
That's how I can honor you,
isn't that so?

420
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,910
"Yes, you're right!"

421
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:42,519
Gosh. Oh, my.

422
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,529
It's my day off.

423
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,630
Darn it. Why is he home already?

424
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,829
I'm getting a job right after
the hands-on training.

425
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,970
I'd quit the cafeteria right away
and open my business if I had money.

426
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,839
It's my dream to run
a Michelin-starred restaurant.

427
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,609
Yes, that recipe?

428
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,349
Who was that?

429
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:13,619
I thought I saw something walk by.

430
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,319
Did the funeral go well?

431
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,519
Yes, thank you
for your consideration.

432
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,319
Is Eun Chong all right?

433
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,690
He seems a little down,
but he's staying strong.

434
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,369
- What's this?
- Please give it to Eun Chong.

435
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:32,970
I want to share my condolences.

436
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:35,640
Goodness. No, Mr. Hwang.
You don't need to do this.

437
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,210
It's not for you.
It's for Eun Chong.

438
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,279
In that case, I'll give it to him.

439
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:45,420
Thank you.

440
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,089
I've been wanting to ask you this.
May I do that?

441
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,549
Sure.

442
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,789
How did you end up
raising your nephew?

443
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,799
(Honey.)

444
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:10,369
(Honey.)

445
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,109
(Mr. Yoon Sung Ho.)

446
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,420
Yu Jin's dad,
if you see this e-mail,

447
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,190
please check with the police
and see...

448
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,160
if the DNA you left 20 years ago
got contaminated.

449
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,029
(Send)

450
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,900
The DNA was contaminated?

451
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,670
Yes, they requested an investigation
into the reason...

452
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:39,900
for the contamination,

453
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,200
but it will take some time.

454
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,710
Chairwoman Shin will register
her DNA sample with the NFS.

455
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,440
If she doesn't trust the police,

456
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,009
she must think
someone contaminated it intentionally.

457
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,920
If that suspicion was correct,
then who would do that?

458
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,819
Someone who doesn't want
the chairwoman's daughter to return.

459
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,089
Yoon Se Young and her mother,
Hwang Jin Goo,

460
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:01,359
or someone on the board.

461
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:04,930
Or others
who hold a grudge against her.

462
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,569
- They could've worked as a team.
- Yes.

463
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,369
And I think everything will go well
with the Dubai contract.

464
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,099
Hassan will come to Seoul.

465
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,339
He'll give us
his date of arrival later.

466
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:16,410
That's great news.

467
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,779
It's Mr. Han.

468
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,779
Yes, Mr. Han.

469
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,180
I couldn't reach you,
so I was worried.

470
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,279
Is everything okay?

471
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,619
You're in Korea?

472
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,259
I'm out of town
to handle some personal business.

473
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,519
I'll be there soon.

474
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,029
Let's talk in person.

475
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:37,829
And don't tell anyone that I'm back.

476
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,799
I'll see you later.

477
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:47,940
She can't share personal information
like the children's contact,

478
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,269
but she will call them and find out.

479
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,539
I'm so grateful.

480
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,910
Will it be difficult
to continue searching...

481
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,779
with just
"seven-year-old Lee Eun Chong?"

482
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:59,619
We need proof that you are
his grandfather.

483
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,049
It's too dangerous
for me to reveal my identity.

484
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,589
My DNA was contaminated,

485
00:28:03,589 --> 00:28:05,660
and my daughter's hit-and-run
accident didn't seem right.

486
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:09,329
Can you see if we can reinvestigate
the hit-and-run accident?

487
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:10,589
Yes, sir.

488
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,900
My daughter had been here all along.

489
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
I felt so bad and guilty...

490
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,339
that I didn't find her earlier.

491
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,940
You'll find your grandson soon
in your daughter's place.

492
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,670
I'll make sure I find Eun Chong.

493
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,579
I'll do whatever it takes.

494
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:33,079
President Hwang gave this to you.

495
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,150
What's this?

496
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,559
Money!

497
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,559
It's called condolence money.

498
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,029
People give it as a symbol
of their condolences...

499
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:47,660
and to help
with the funeral expenses.

500
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,869
Should I call President Hwang
and thank him?

501
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,470
It's too late today.
I'll let him know tomorrow.

502
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,769
Here, Auntie Ha Na.

503
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,339
He gave this to you.

504
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:02,809
But it was supposed to help
with the funeral expenses.

505
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:05,750
You held the funeral,

506
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,380
so you should keep it.

507
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,690
But still, this is your money.

508
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,559
I'll save it for you.

509
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:17,190
When you grow up
and begin to make money,

510
00:29:17,259 --> 00:29:18,559
you can give me pocket money then.

511
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,730
That'll take such a long time.

512
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,000
You have no idea
because you're still young.

513
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,670
Time flies.

514
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,309
Let's go to sleep.

515
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,970
Turn the lights off, Eun Chong.

516
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,250
Let me cover you.

517
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,420
Okay.

518
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,089
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Yes?

519
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,529
My grandma must've met
with my mommy in paradise, right?

520
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,529
Yes, she probably did.

521
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:57,029
It must be nice for my grandma...

522
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:59,140
to be with my mommy in paradise.

523
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,839
Auntie, please don't die.

524
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,039
I won't.

525
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,250
I'll live for a long time.

526
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,349
Okay.

527
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,029
The old woman
in that island village died?

528
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,900
Yes, and her family
gave her a funeral.

529
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,170
"Her family?"

530
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:30,900
She had family?

531
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,099
They weren't her immediate family.

532
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,410
It was the family of someone
who seemed to be her grandson.

533
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:36,640
"Someone who seemed to be
her grandson?"

534
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:41,109
Wait, was that Eun Chong?

535
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,079
Yes, that family had...

536
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,109
a seven-year-old
named Lee Eun Chong.

537
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,880
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

538
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:50,950
I believe he is your grandson.

539
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:53,720
His guardian is
a woman named Goo Ha Na.

540
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,660
She's the same age as your daughter,
and she lived with her...

541
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,490
in the same children's home.

542
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,599
Where do they live?

543
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,730
All right. Let me see you.

544
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:08,339
Santa Claus is coming
to the kindergarten today, right?

545
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,869
- You'll get presents! Good for you.
- Yes.

546
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,180
What do you want
from Santa Claus, Auntie?

547
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,009
What do I want?

548
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,950
One moment.

549
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,660
Hello, Detective Min.

550
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,259
Do you have the result?

551
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,329
Yes, Eun Chong's DNA
didn't match with hers.

552
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,470
Is that so?

553
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,740
Yes, I understand.
Thank you for your hard work.

554
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,039
Yes, goodbye.

555
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,019
- Eun Chong.
- She wasn't my grandmother?

556
00:31:56,119 --> 00:31:57,190
No.

557
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,960
I think it's good news for you.

558
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,730
You may get to meet
your real grandma.

559
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,059
Okay.

560
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,440
He was the boy I met last time
at the hospital.

561
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,839
Why are you here alone?
Where's your mom?

562
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,180
I came with my auntie.

563
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:24,980
She's over there.

564
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,200
(Cinderella Game)

565
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,599
Who could have contaminated the DNA?

566
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,430
You must stay suspicious
of everyone.

567
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,339
Can you find out...

568
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:22,670
about Eun Chong
and Ms. Goo's living conditions?

569
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,440
I need to find more ways
to get more money.

570
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,539
I'm afraid
Eun Chong will fall into danger.

571
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,009
Didn't you appoint Ms. Goo?

572
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,680
Could I really trust the two
who got their jobs through connections?

573
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:34,849
People are always betrayed
by those who are the closest.

574
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,690
You want me to accept it, don't you?

575
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,890
Today will be the last supper.
