1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,040
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,750
Open the door.

5
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,019
Open the door!

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,349
Eun Chong!

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:18,359
- Open the door.
- They even changed the passcode.

8
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,160
Eun Chong!

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,429
Open the door, please!

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,000
- Eun Chong, it's me.
- Auntie Ha Na!

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,100
Hold him.

12
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:32,100
- No, you can't go, Eun Chong.
- No, Eun Chong.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,570
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na!

14
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:35,840
- No.
- No.

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,140
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Goodness. No.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,210
Auntie Ha Na!

17
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,450
Eun Chong.

18
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,049
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Eun Chong, I'm here.

19
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,520
Eun Chong!

20
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,450
Eun Chong, no.

21
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,289
Auntie Ha Na...

22
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,689
Eun Chong!

23
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,829
- Open the door, please!
- Auntie Ha Na!

24
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:57,659
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

25
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,799
No.

26
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,900
Eun Chong, you have to listen to me
if you want to meet Auntie Ha Na.

27
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,239
Please let Auntie Ha Na in.

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,750
Eun Chong.

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,450
Eun Chong...

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,090
Please stop.
You are causing a disturbance here.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,620
Excuse me.

32
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:28,629
I live here.

33
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:31,560
My nephew is inside.
I just need to take him with me.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,769
She's his guardian.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,469
We've received complaints
from the neighbors.

36
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,730
Please keep quiet.

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,540
My nephew is in there,
waiting for me.

38
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:41,510
Please help me.

39
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,909
Please help me.

40
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:46,480
Can you come
and unlock a door right now?

41
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:48,150
Auntie Ha Na!

42
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,049
- Let go of me!
- Goodness, Eun Chong.

43
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:52,950
Eun Chong.

44
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:56,750
Do you want
Auntie Ha Na to adopt you?

45
00:01:57,189 --> 00:01:58,319
Yes.

46
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,359
I'll let her adopt you
if you listen to me.

47
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,530
Then, why didn't you let her in?

48
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,699
She didn't want to live here,
so she left.

49
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,569
Why?

50
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:18,240
It's the security team. Yes?

51
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:22,080
He called a locksmith?

52
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:38,000
- Ms. Jang.
- She'll report you...

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,330
for breaking and entering
if you come inside.

54
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,840
Just let me take Eun Chong.

55
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,539
If you continue to make a scene,
she'll retract you as a guardian...

56
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:52,409
and request a restraining order
against you...

57
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,849
from approaching Eun Chong.

58
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,780
Do what?

59
00:02:57,979 --> 00:02:59,449
That's nonsense.

60
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:02,349
You should leave today.

61
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:06,419
Eun Chong is looking for me.

62
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,259
Please let me in.

63
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,629
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:13,030
At least let me see him!

65
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,629
Eun Chong!

66
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:19,000
Eun Chong!

67
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:23,979
Eun Chong!

68
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,750
Eun Chong!

69
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,949
Eun Chong!

70
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,319
Goodness, Ha Na.

71
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,129
Ha Na.

72
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,629
- Ha Na!
- Ha Na.

73
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:45,830
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,530
Are you okay?

75
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,949
Hey, what's going on? Ha Na!

76
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:09,620
Ha Na.

77
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:11,620
How did you two
end up coming together?

78
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,629
How did your introduction go?

79
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:14,759
Do you feel unwell?

80
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,490
You look so awful.

81
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,629
She needs to rest.

82
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,360
Lay out the futon.

83
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,100
Okay.

84
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:22,899
Goodness.

85
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,040
Come here.

86
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,980
Get some rest, Ha Na.

87
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,689
What's going on?

88
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:45,120
Did something happen
during your introduction?

89
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,689
I shouldn't have left that house.

90
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:51,699
I should've held out
until Eun Chong came back.

91
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,069
What do you mean
you left that house?

92
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,629
Did you run away?

93
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:58,339
Hey, she's too old
to call this running away.

94
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,670
Did Eun Chong go elsewhere?

95
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,839
Tell us so that we can understand.

96
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:04,240
Ha Na...

97
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,480
isn't Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

98
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:08,810
- What?
- What?

99
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,649
Yu Jin died,

100
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,420
and Goo Ha Na was a fake?

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,230
What are you saying, Aunt Yeo Jin?

102
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,860
How can she be a fake?

103
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,970
Is Yu Jin really dead?

104
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,540
Yes.

105
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:35,170
She died in a car accident
six years ago.

106
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,579
Goodness, no. Yu Jin...

107
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:49,350
When did you find out, Yeo Jin?

108
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,589
Why haven't you told us?

109
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,589
I can't believe it.

110
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:56,360
Oh, no.

111
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,959
I feel so bad for Yu Jin.

112
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,300
I had to keep it a secret
to keep Eun Chong safe.

113
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,170
What do you mean?

114
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,339
Eun Chong is...

115
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,709
Yu Jin's son.

116
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,949
- He's...
- He's...

117
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,949
- Yu Jin's son?
- Yu Jin's son?

118
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,629
Eun Chong is Chairwoman Shin's son?

119
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,329
So, she made Ha Na a fake daughter
to keep Eun Chong safe?

120
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,670
How is that possible?

121
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,000
They even conducted
a parentage test.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,199
It was fabricated.

123
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,470
- No way.
- Darn it!

124
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,439
I can't believe you, Ji Seok.

125
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,839
You made up a lie
to surprise us, right?

126
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,680
She is
the chairwoman's daughter, right?

127
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,750
Please just say so!

128
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,050
She's not
Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

129
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,550
Those con artists.

130
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,720
Ji Seok, get up.
We have to report them...

131
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,819
to the police right now
and destroy that family!

132
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,160
I can't believe it. I don't want to.

133
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:01,660
No, this is impossible.

134
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,360
Ha Na was so thrilled
she found her birth mother.

135
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:07,430
The least she can do is
repay Ha Na for raising Eun Chong.

136
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,000
How can she do something like this?

137
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,470
I can't let this go.

138
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,009
She deceived our family
and made a fool out of us.

139
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:18,939
Isn't that so, Ji Seok?
We need to get revenge!

140
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,310
I will get the revenge.

141
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,550
But for now,
you two need to look after Ha Na.

142
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,790
I feel so bad for her.

143
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,389
I thought she finally got to see
better days...

144
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,199
after years of toiling,

145
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,930
but some con artist deceived her
with this soap opera story.

146
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,170
Was she kicked out
when this scheme came to light?

147
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,730
Did she just steal Eun Chong?

148
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,970
She walked out of there herself.

149
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:46,699
Why did she do that?

150
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,040
She should've held out
with everything she could do!

151
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,879
If she wanted to leave,
she should've brought Eun Chong.

152
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,350
Just tell him to live a good life
with his rich grandmother.

153
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:58,750
They won't be able to mess with us
only if Eun Chong is still with us.

154
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,850
He was
the real winning lottery ticket.

155
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,990
Hey, you were thinking about that
in this situation?

156
00:08:04,459 --> 00:08:07,560
So what? What now?
Will you mooch off Eun Chong now?

157
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,259
You're such a parasite.

158
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,730
You need to make a wise judgment.

159
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,930
Who paid the money
to start your business?

160
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,329
What if she tells you
to return it right now?

161
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,500
It's unfair
to pull out an investment.

162
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,810
Yes, so we need to be wise
and crunch some numbers.

163
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,240
We have to make her pay
for raising Eun Chong...

164
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,410
and deceiving Ha Na, too.

165
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,720
This is awful.

166
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,750
Auntie Ha Na...

167
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:44,600
He's my grandson and my blood.

168
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,000
If you want to move out,
you can leave alone.

169
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,409
I should've left with him.

170
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,220
Hello?

171
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,789
Hello? Eun Chong.

172
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,980
What was that?

173
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:34,980
I want to call Auntie Ha Na.

174
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,519
I want to go to her!

175
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,419
She left you here.

176
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,990
Do you think
she'll be happy to see you?

177
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:44,620
She didn't leave me here.

178
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,389
She'll come for me.

179
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,529
We have tteokbokki and fried chicken
ready for you. You like those.

180
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:50,590
Let's eat.

181
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:52,830
Auntie Ha Na!

182
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,929
It's Jin Goo.

183
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:01,909
You're here.

184
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,009
Mr. Hwang...

185
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,409
Why did you cry?

186
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:14,350
Can you take me to Auntie Ha Na?

187
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,490
Eat your tteokbokki...

188
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,759
if you want to meet your auntie.

189
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,000
Here. Have some.

190
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,009
Come on.

191
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:39,710
If you don't eat your food
or listen to your elders,

192
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,309
you'll never get to meet
Auntie Ha Na.

193
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,379
Stop scaring him.

194
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,590
Eun Chong,
if you stop crying and eat well,

195
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,649
she'll come and see you.

196
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,159
Really? When?

197
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,059
Do you want to see her soon
or much later?

198
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:58,230
Soon.

199
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,330
Then, what should you do?

200
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,100
I won't cry and eat my food.

201
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,470
That's it.

202
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,269
Eat your tteokbokki.

203
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,980
Eat up.

204
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:13,909
And try this, too.

205
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,019
You must let Eun Chong go to Ha Na.

206
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,659
He's my grandson.
Why would I send him away?

207
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,360
He lived with her to this day,

208
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,730
and she's still his foster mother.

209
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:34,730
She raised him for a mere six years.

210
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:38,039
Those years aren't more important
than the rest of his life.

211
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,769
She had been looking
for his grandmother all along.

212
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,179
She found me, so I should raise him.

213
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,450
Even if you do that,
you can't separate them like this.

214
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:51,250
Eun Chong can't live
apart from Ha Na.

215
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,919
He has never done that.

216
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:56,220
Ms. Goo will also realize
which one of us...

217
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,860
Eun Chong is better off with.

218
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:01,129
She moved in here
thinking you were her birth mother.

219
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,230
It must've been awful to realize
she was used as a fake daughter,

220
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:06,600
so you shouldn't hurt her
with Eun Chong's problem.

221
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,500
I ask of you.

222
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,669
I offered to have her
as my adopted daughter...

223
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:13,200
and to make her into Yu Jin,
yet she declined.

224
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,509
She said she'd leave with Eun Chong,
so she left me no choice.

225
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:19,139
You should've shown concern
about her feelings first.

226
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,710
You need
to apologize wholeheartedly...

227
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,850
and ask for her forgiveness first.

228
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:28,419
Did she say she'd forgive me
if I apologized?

229
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:30,149
You need to apologize
until she accepts it.

230
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,460
I'll compensate her...

231
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:37,600
for raising Eun Chong
and deceiving her as my daughter.

232
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,860
That's not what Ha Na wants.

233
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:41,929
If you want to compensate,

234
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,169
you need to give her what she wants.

235
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:48,370
She can become Cinderella
if she turns a blind eye just once.

236
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,370
I don't understand
her obstinate refusal.

237
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,950
She made this simple matter
more and more complicated.

238
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:00,179
I didn't think
this would come to light so quickly.

239
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:01,889
Who gave this away?

240
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:06,190
How did she find out?

241
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:10,230
This was delivered home.

242
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,360
It was sent by someone who knew
what Yu Jin looked like at age ten.

243
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,539
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

244
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,480
Is something going on?

245
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,850
I asked her
to send Eun Chong back to Ms. Goo.

246
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,860
He's her only blood.
She'll never do that.

247
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,759
Stop saying something like that
and try to soothe Eun Chong.

248
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,299
He's practically
Hyesung's successor.

249
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,529
What if he gets hurt by evil people
while living with Goo Ha Na?

250
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,639
I heard she found out she was a fake
by looking at the missing poster.

251
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,840
- Yes.
- Where's the envelope it came in?

252
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:58,179
It's in the recycling bin
in the utility room. Why?

253
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,950
Was he trying to find who sent that?

254
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:05,049
He won't be able to.

255
00:14:08,419 --> 00:14:09,889
- Is this it?
- Yes.

256
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:11,990
Did you want to find out
who sent that?

257
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,429
- Nothing was on it.
- I have to.

258
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,700
If someone sent this
on the day of her introduction,

259
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,899
it had to be intentional.

260
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,600
Yes, I wonder.

261
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,970
Who could've sent that,
and for what reason?

262
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,840
Do you want your sister
to bring Eun Chong home?

263
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,309
No, he's our enemy's blood,
so it's better to end this here.

264
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:38,480
And Chairwoman Shin
won't let her grandson go, either.

265
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:40,350
Probably not.

266
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,350
After some time,

267
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:45,090
she'll also realize it's better
for the chairwoman to raise him.

268
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,730
If Eun Chong ends up
with Chairwoman Shin,

269
00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:51,000
then only your fight
with Chairwoman Shin remains.

270
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,860
It's finally my time to aim
for Chairwoman Shin's neck.

271
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,929
No human punishment
would seem enough...

272
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,600
if I threw in what she did
to my sister.

273
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,940
She'd be severely punished by fate.

274
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,009
Eun Chong, I heard you had been
looking for your grandma.

275
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,049
You found her.

276
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,059
I am your real grandma.

277
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,629
- You are?
- Yes.

278
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,559
Your mom, Lee Du Na,
was my daughter.

279
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:32,570
But Auntie Ha Na is your daughter.

280
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,169
She lied.

281
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:41,279
These are photos
of your mommy and me.

282
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,779
It's my mommy.

283
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:49,320
Your mommy was my daughter.

284
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:55,230
Then, why did Auntie Ha Na lie?

285
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,700
She must've wanted
to be my daughter.

286
00:15:58,629 --> 00:16:01,169
But she was caught lying, so...

287
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:04,840
Was that why she left without me?

288
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,340
Yes.

289
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,970
Can't you be her mommy?

290
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:15,149
Let's live with her, Grandma.

291
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,580
She couldn't even marry
because of you, right?

292
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,149
If you keep asking her
to live with you,

293
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:24,190
she'll never get to marry.

294
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:29,330
- Don't you want her to be happy?
- Yes.

295
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:32,799
Then, you should
help her get married.

296
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,970
Is she getting married?

297
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:38,139
She must want to.

298
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,110
I told you.

299
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,450
We were on a trip to the beach.

300
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,950
It's a heartbreaking memory.
I don't want to remember it.

301
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,590
You're back here now.
Let's not speak about the past.

302
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:04,259
Yu Jin drank spoiled milk?

303
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:08,069
That's impossible. How odd.

304
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,099
Yu Jin was lactose-intolerant,

305
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:13,970
so she only had lactose-free milk.

306
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,940
- Isn't that so, Yeo Jin?
- No.

307
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,410
You're not remembering it right.

308
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,480
Yu Jin could drink regular milk.

309
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,309
Yu Jin, you loved hot chocolate...

310
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,720
and marshmallows as a kid.

311
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,650
You must've remembered that.

312
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:29,950
- I did? No, I don't remember.
- Gosh.

313
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,059
How can she remember everything?

314
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:33,859
It'll all come back to her later.

315
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,059
Yu Jin.

316
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,630
Yu Jin.

317
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,730
Don't go.

318
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:43,700
Mom, I'm right here.

319
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,470
Come by my side.

320
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,109
I miss you.

321
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
She looks sad from time to time.

322
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:55,109
She looks distant
even as she speaks to me.

323
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:56,250
Yu Jin.

324
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,049
- When we went out together,
- Mom, be careful.

325
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,349
she went after someone else...

326
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,119
- while calling my name.
- Yu Jin...

327
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,750
It looks like there's someone...

328
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,920
she misses and wants to see
even now.

329
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:08,359
Ms. Goo, how would you feel...

330
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:11,660
if someone used you
as a fake daughter?

331
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,529
There was so much evidence
that I was a fake,

332
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:21,569
but I still had no idea.
How can I be so foolish?

333
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:33,720
Do you want a drink?

334
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,519
You should get wasted
if you want to get some sleep.

335
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,960
How can I be so pathetic?

336
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,799
There was so much evidence
that I was a fake,

337
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,700
but I still didn't know.

338
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,069
How can I be so oblivious?
I was such an idiot.

339
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,970
No one would imagine
she was a fake daughter.

340
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,900
The ones
who deceived you are at fault.

341
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,410
You must brace yourself,
especially in times like these.

342
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,809
I'll find a good day
to barge into that place.

343
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,920
Anyway, did you walk out
just like that?

344
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,349
What about your stuff?
Will they send it over later?

345
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:11,920
My suitcase.

346
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:17,660
Ha Na, Mr. Hwang is here.

347
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,900
He came with Eun Chong
and your luggage.

348
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,630
That place packed up your things
and sent those here?

349
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:25,970
Darn it. They're making me furious.

350
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,039
He's waiting for you.

351
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,279
Tell him to leave.

352
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,589
She asks you to leave.

353
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,990
She isn't in good condition.

354
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:45,890
Okay.

355
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,789
How can they be
so ungrateful and brazen?

356
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,529
Can they go around tampering with
and taking advantage of people...

357
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:53,329
just because they're rich?

358
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:56,630
This kind of ridiculous scheme
must be punished by law...

359
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,539
No, by fate.

360
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,539
This isn't just an insult
and attack on Ha Na,

361
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:04,880
but it's on our entire family.

362
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,039
Isn't that so?

363
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:10,480
Yes, everything is
the chairwoman's fault.

364
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,589
You must be stumped
between the chairwoman and Ha Na.

365
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:18,059
Thank you for siding with justice.

366
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:22,029
Please take good care of Ha Na.

367
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,690
Okay.

368
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,359
She's completely dejected.

369
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,029
She won't eat,
and I don't know if she can sleep.

370
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,640
What a great guy.

371
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,509
But he's pretty taciturn.

372
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,220
Ha Na.

373
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,390
Please punish me.

374
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,369
I'll receive it gladly,
no matter what it is.

375
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:11,940
You're back.

376
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,910
I just got home, too.

377
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,609
Did the chairwoman
present her daughter successfully?

378
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:18,950
I'll tell you later, Mom.

379
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,950
Okay.

380
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,019
Did something happen?

381
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,710
He won't be able to sleep
without Kongkong.

382
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,049
Kongkong. Auntie Ha Na...

383
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,589
I'll ask her
to bring Kongkong tomorrow.

384
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,819
Right now.

385
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,259
It's too late.

386
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,160
You can sleep in my room.

387
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:04,029
I want to sleep here.

388
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:07,059
You have to listen to me
if you want to meet her tomorrow.

389
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,930
Will she really come tomorrow?

390
00:22:11,069 --> 00:22:13,269
Of course. She'll come.

391
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,869
Promise me.

392
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:17,339
I promise.

393
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,680
Wipe your tears.

394
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,720
How's Eun Chong?

395
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,619
He wanted Kongkong last night.
Bring it over.

396
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,589
Come and meet him, too.

397
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,859
Will you open the door for me?

398
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,200
You can ask Eun Chong...

399
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:42,500
who he wants to live with,
you or me.

400
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,269
I'll let Eun Chong live
with someone he wants.

401
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,740
Do you mean it?

402
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,980
Will you let him go
if he wants to live with me?

403
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,180
I will, if that's what he wants.

404
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,180
I'll be there now.

405
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,819
Ha Na.

406
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:08,660
- Do you feel better?
- Yes.

407
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,589
I'm going to Eun Chong.

408
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,599
She said she'd let him go
if he wanted to live with me.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,200
- Chairwoman Shin said that?
- Yes.

410
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,470
She wouldn't let him go that easily.

411
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,809
She must've changed her mind
for his sake.

412
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,410
- I have to go.
- You have to give up on him.

413
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,440
I can't.

414
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,309
I won't give up
until he gives up on me.

415
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,880
You'll have to give him up someday.

416
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,480
I'll think about that
when the time comes.

417
00:23:37,589 --> 00:23:40,819
How did you find out
you were a fake daughter?

418
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,730
Eun Chong brought
Du Na's missing poster to me.

419
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,730
It was a snippet
of a newspaper article.

420
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,640
A missing poster on a newspaper?

421
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,319
Can you make
some egg porridge for me?

422
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,420
Sure.

423
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,859
May I lie down for a minute?

424
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,509
Yoon Se Young.

425
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,440
You were here to steal this.

426
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,380
(Missing Child,
Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

427
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,349
Who knows what her daughter
looked like when she was ten?

428
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:45,890
Se Young, Mother, the board members,

429
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,890
and Goo Ji Seok?

430
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,460
Did she find out
she was a fake daughter?

431
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,400
How did she find out she was a fake?

432
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,359
It wasn't Goo Ji Seok.

433
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:57,970
Then, was it Se Young or Mother?

434
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,240
Did they already know
Ha Na was a fake?

435
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,869
If they had known,

436
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:06,039
they would've wanted to stop her
from becoming...

437
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:08,910
the chairwoman's daughter
and Eun Chong's mom.

438
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,849
Then, the ones who tried to stop
the adoption were...

439
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,019
(Head Director's Office)

440
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,819
Summon Yoon Se Young.

441
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,759
- Is something going on?
- Now.

442
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:22,930
Yes, sir.

443
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:25,599
Yes, I understand. Okay.

444
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,599
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

445
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,839
- Where are you going?
- Director Goo wants to see me.

446
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,279
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

447
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:54,930
Why did Ha Na lock herself in her room
and not answer her phone?

448
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,990
She won't say anything.
How would I know?

449
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,000
Did you want to see me,
Director Goo?

450
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:07,740
Yesterday,

451
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,609
how did Ha Na find out
she was a fake daughter?

452
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:15,410
What?
You already knew she was a fake?

453
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,309
How did she find out yesterday?

454
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,150
I'm asking you.

455
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,319
Someone sent
Yu Jin's missing poster to her.

456
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,490
She must've realized she was a fake
after seeing that.

457
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,599
What were you doing at that time?

458
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,140
Getting ready to go to the hotel.

459
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:44,140
How is she?

460
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,680
She must've been badly shocked.

461
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:50,710
What's with you?

462
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:53,019
You sent her the poster, didn't you?

463
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:56,119
No, I didn't.

464
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:58,420
You took it from my room.

465
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,730
How dare you do this to my sister?

466
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,599
Die.

467
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,900
Die!

468
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,400
Mr. Goo! You can't do this.

469
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,099
You need to stop!

470
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,579
How dare you steal that from me
and send it to my sister?

471
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:30,690
Because she's not your sister,
but your first love.

472
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,960
If I had let her be,
she would've adopted Eun Chong...

473
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,420
and taken Hyesung Group!

474
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,029
Is that what you really want?

475
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:41,329
I'm sick and tired of Goo Ha Na,
who's always stuck next to you!

476
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:44,430
She's like a leech,
two years ago and even now!

477
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,240
Your mom put you up for this.

478
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,440
Why? Do you want to strangle
my mom, too?

479
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,509
You will...

480
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,880
go under because of your mom.

481
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,359
Jin Goo...

482
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,099
Just now,

483
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,029
all of my suspicions...

484
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,970
have been resolved.

485
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:33,849
You will...

486
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:36,650
go under because of Goo Ha Na.

487
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:55,569
Jin Goo, I can explain.

488
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,140
You don't have to explain your
relationship with Goo Ji Seok...

489
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,849
any further.

490
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,250
I already know.

491
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,849
You sent that flyer to Ha Na,
didn't you?

492
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,789
Was it you and your mother...

493
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,589
who stopped her
from adopting Eun Chong?

494
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:11,750
No.

495
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,259
I'll go and ask Mother.

496
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,529
- I'll talk to the chairwoman.
- You can't.

497
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:20,359
I stopped her
because she was a fake.

498
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:22,170
I couldn't sit
on my hands and watch...

499
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,930
a fake daughter take Hyesung.

500
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,970
"A fake?"

501
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,000
The chairwoman took her in
and had her as a daughter.

502
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,269
If you can take it,
why can't Goo Ha Na have it?

503
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,980
She can't compare to me.

504
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,809
I was Aunt Yeo Jin's niece,

505
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,710
and I lived with her as a family
for 20 years.

506
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,950
That was why she wanted to leave
the company to you and me.

507
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,950
I was about to lose everything.
Why can't you understand me?

508
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,019
Fine.

509
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,049
If I must, I can.

510
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,220
But how can you reveal it like that?

511
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,059
Didn't you consider
how shocked she would be?

512
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,630
You don't have the right
to say that to me.

513
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,130
You made Goo Ha Na
into her fake daughter.

514
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,910
I wonder where Auntie Ha Na is now.

515
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,049
Eun Chong,
who do you want to live with?

516
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:17,349
Auntie Ha Na or Grandma?

517
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:18,619
Auntie Ha Na.

518
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,390
Was there anything good
about living with me?

519
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:26,160
There was. Auntie Ha Na
didn't have to suffer anymore.

520
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,529
I liked how you,
Auntie Ha Na, and I...

521
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,470
went out together
and had great food.

522
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,569
Then, it'd be best for you
if you, me, and Auntie Ha Na...

523
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,509
- all lived together.
- Yes.

524
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,380
It can happen.

525
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,150
Really?

526
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,150
She told her to take Eun Chong
if he wanted to go?

527
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,289
Yes.

528
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:53,720
I wanted to tell Ha Na
to just leave him there,

529
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,759
but he didn't do anything wrong.

530
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,829
If that kid wants to live with us,

531
00:30:58,829 --> 00:31:00,759
then of course,
I'll accept him generously.

532
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:05,130
She wouldn't let Eun Chong go
that easily.

533
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:09,509
So? Did your sister go there now?

534
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,579
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Eun Chong.

535
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:21,380
Auntie Ha Na,
you abandon me here, right?

536
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,849
I didn't.

537
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,920
I came for you.

538
00:31:28,089 --> 00:31:30,589
Can you live here with me?

539
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,200
I can't do that.

540
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,769
I want to live with you,
Auntie Ha Na.

541
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,599
Grandma said she'd let you go
if you told her...

542
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,640
you wanted to come with me.

543
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,279
What are you talking about?

544
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,609
- Yeo Jin.
- He should live with who he wants.

545
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:53,980
I'm going to live in my home
from now on.

546
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,990
You can decide
if you'll live here with Grandma...

547
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,319
or if you'll live with me.

548
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,190
Auntie Ha Na...

549
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:04,829
You can do as you want, Eun Chong.

550
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:07,200
Of course, he'd go with his aunt.

551
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,170
What were you thinking?

552
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,970
You want to live with me, right?

553
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,470
Come with me.

554
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,809
I want to live here.

555
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,319
Eun Chong.

556
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,859
You want to live here?

557
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:37,630
Yes, I'll live with Grandma.

558
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,289
(Cinderella Game)

559
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,990
Is that really all I can do for you?

560
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,029
Cut your ties.

561
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:47,359
It's the best you can do
for each other.

562
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,829
What will you do
now that Jin Goo knows?

563
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,369
I'll kneel before him
and beg or something.

564
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,500
You were the one who did me wrong.

565
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,339
You made my fiancée cheat on me.

566
00:33:55,339 --> 00:33:57,410
You should've done a better job
at keeping her with you.

567
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,839
Get out of my sister's life
while I'm still nice.

568
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:02,349
What do I do
when I miss Auntie Ha Na?

569
00:34:02,349 --> 00:34:04,250
I thought about this
again and again.

570
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:05,920
I must've liked you,

571
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:07,849
Ha Na.
