00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,909
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,439
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,139
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,610
(Episode 15)

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,559
Yu Jin. My baby.

6
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,460
- Mommy.
- My baby.

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:27,030
How did you get here?

8
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,030
You kept praying, right?

9
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,100
So, I came to see you.

10
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:35,439
Come here, my baby.

11
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,520
Yu Jin.

12
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,219
My baby. Pumpkin.

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,219
Yu Jin?

14
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,490
Pumpkin!

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,189
Yu Jin.

16
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:57,899
Yu Jin, where are you, my baby?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,729
Come to Mommy.

18
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,069
Don't go, Yu Jin.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,900
Yu Jin!

20
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,890
You kept praying, right?

21
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,890
So, I came to see you.

22
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:38,269
You came to see me
because I kept praying?

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,510
You will...

24
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,879
come to see me, right?

25
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,890
She has a sad story
of losing her only daughter...

26
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,359
a long time ago.

27
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,110
Bang Ul, can you make us some tea?

28
00:02:15,509 --> 00:02:16,909
- Have a seat.
- Yes.

29
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,150
- Is the chairwoman at work?
- She's leaving in the afternoon.

30
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,620
So, she'll have lunch
before she leaves.

31
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,620
I know everyone at her office,

32
00:02:31,889 --> 00:02:33,219
but I haven't seen you before.

33
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,659
I heard the head director's
older sister recently started.

34
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,729
Is that you?

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,629
Yes.

36
00:02:41,169 --> 00:02:43,300
Please do your best for Ms. Yoon.

37
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,900
She needs help
from her junior staff.

38
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,740
Yes, I'll do my best.

39
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,909
Here.

40
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,780
- Thank you.
- Sure.

41
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,990
- Have some.
- Yes.

42
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,259
I don't know
how this will come across,

43
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,460
but Mr. Goo has
practically stolen...

44
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:13,569
President Hwang's position.

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,900
I heard he canceled
the contract with the hotel, too.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:19,939
Why would your younger brother
do that to your workplace?

47
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,370
Are you two on bad terms?

48
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,710
No.

49
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,310
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:29,979
It's nothing for you to apologize.

51
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,479
Don't mention that
I said something like this,

52
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,949
but put in a good word to him.

53
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:39,889
Or you can tip me off quietly
if you know anything.

54
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,360
No?

55
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,870
All right. You can finish your tea.

56
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,770
You can grab a cab.

57
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,400
Goodness, no.

58
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,240
It's all right. I have cab fare.

59
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:58,979
You came here on business,
so your travel should be covered.

60
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:02,009
Otherwise, I heard
it could be seen as a power trip.

61
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:11,360
Hello, Ms. Jang?
Have you heard anything from him?

62
00:04:14,889 --> 00:04:17,500
I had a hunch
I'd have an update on Yu Jin.

63
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,500
Please look into it.

64
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:27,040
Hey, was someone here?

65
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,870
One of Se Young's juniors.

66
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,839
She left a file.

67
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,680
- Would you like something, ma'am?
- No.

68
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,850
I dozed off and dreamed of Yu Jin.

69
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,250
Did you have the same dream again?

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,459
This time, it was different.

71
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,660
She'd always cry
and go further away,

72
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:50,829
but this time,
she showed me a huge smile.

73
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:53,870
My goodness.
That was a wonderful dream.

74
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,500
Yes, Yeo Jin.
It must be a good sign.

75
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:01,009
I've never had
such a long dream about her.

76
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,310
And she has never smiled before.

77
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,610
There must be great news ahead.

78
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,310
Should I find a good fortuneteller?

79
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:18,689
I wanted to turn the fireplace back
to how it looked before.

80
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,029
The fireplace? All of a sudden? Why?

81
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:24,959
I'll clean it up, Ms. Chairwoman.

82
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,899
Yes, you should make it look clean.

83
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:33,170
We boarded up the fireplace long ago
ever since Yu Jin had disappeared.

84
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,629
Why did she give me so much money?

85
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:03,300
Gosh, what do I do?

86
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,699
It'll be weird to go back
and return it to her.

87
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,750
Where's Ms. Goo?

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,009
I sent her on a work task.

89
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,550
It's odd to say this
without her here,

90
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,519
but Ms. Goo is the exclusive guide
for guests from Dubai.

91
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:22,990
She already has experience,

92
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,420
and she has done good work
during the Hyesung Hotel incident.

93
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,389
Please show her your support.

94
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,730
I'm going to Hanguk Hotel.
Have a great day, everyone.

95
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,259
- See you.
- See you.

96
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,040
How can she be the exclusive guide?

97
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,300
Do you think
it's because of Director Goo?

98
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,569
He messed with our business.
Why would he give her a chance?

99
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,040
It's such a mystery.

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,610
Does she have a bigger connection
than Director Goo?

101
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,050
She must have
the most fascinating connections.

102
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,750
- Ms. Yoon, are you okay with her?
- Why would I be okay?

103
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,850
Stop chatting and get to work.

104
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,889
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

105
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:03,829
Oh, hello, Mr. Hwang.

106
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,129
Where have you been?

107
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,600
Whose clothes is that?

108
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,639
It's for Ms. Yoon, isn't it?

109
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:16,209
As I mentioned before,
turn down these personal errands.

110
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,240
You'll be busy soon.

111
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:19,839
Okay.

112
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,579
As you know, we're having guests
from Dubai starting next month.

113
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,319
You'll be the exclusive guide.

114
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,319
You should put together
a program proposal.

115
00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:29,019
Really?

116
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,889
So, why me?

117
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:33,089
What's so bad about you?

118
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:35,290
- Do you not feel confident?
- Goodness, no.

119
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,589
I'll do a great job.

120
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:38,199
That's good, then.

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,800
Thank you.

122
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,569
All right!

123
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,879
I brought your coat, Ms. Yoon.

124
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,980
Excuse me, Ms. Yoon.

125
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,089
Please return this to your mother.

126
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:05,060
- What's this?
- Your mother gave it for a cab,

127
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:07,990
but it was too much,
so I thought I should return it.

128
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,129
Do I have to run your errands?

129
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,899
You should've said no to my mom
if you didn't want it.

130
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,600
Why did you bring it here
and ask me to return it?

131
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,740
Why?

132
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:22,509
Were you going to keep it
if the amount was decent?

133
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,079
But did you get scared
when you saw too much inside?

134
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,550
Is that why you are
making my mom look weird?

135
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,709
What? No.

136
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,179
- Then, I'll return it myself...
- Forget it.

137
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,950
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

138
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,200
What's this?

139
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,100
Why was this stained?

140
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,629
What? Where?

141
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,029
Right here. Can't you see?

142
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,240
I think...

143
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,610
the fabric is supposed to be...

144
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,070
Get your hands off.

145
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,909
Why? Were you offended?

146
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:01,879
No.

147
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:07,220
Mr. Hwang said I was the exclusive guide
for Dubai guests.

148
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,230
If she finds that awful,
then it must be true.

149
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:17,700
You must pay us three times as much
as compensation for breaking terms.

150
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,960
If you tell me who your investor is,

151
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,730
then we will
adjust the compensation.

152
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,169
Mr. Hwang, just accept the trend.

153
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,440
We will pay the compensation,
so stop nitpicking.

154
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:31,980
You're a reasonable man.

155
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,250
- "Reasonable?"
- It's reasonable to follow trends.

156
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,120
It's always reasonable
to follow the trend.

157
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,490
No, in these times,
we must be especially vigilant.

158
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,889
Hyesung Tour was
intentionally attacked,

159
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,230
so I must know the reason
not to suffer twice.

160
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,559
I heard the investor was American.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,759
Was the investor a Korean-American?

162
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,830
I don't know.

163
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,799
Do you know Richard Han?

164
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,840
It looks like
President Hwang is suspecting us...

165
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,710
as Hanguk Hotel's investors.

166
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,879
If he already mentioned my name,

167
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,980
they'll just have
to find the evidence.

168
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,750
It won't be easy
to find the evidence.

169
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,720
Why don't you rush
the Dubai project?

170
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,950
Hanguk Hotel and Hyesung Hotel...

171
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:19,990
What's next? The Dubai deal?

172
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,659
It'll take a while
to develop the Dubai project.

173
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:27,470
- Why?
- Hwang Jin Goo got ahead of me.

174
00:10:28,269 --> 00:10:30,940
I'll begin by canceling contracts
for restaurants and rental cars.

175
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,309
President Hwang must be
an unexpected challenge.

176
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,110
And Chairwoman Shin seems to be
looking for her lost daughter.

177
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,980
She has been quiet
for a while, hasn't she?

178
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,320
Why has she resumed the search?

179
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:50,250
There are no known reasons.

180
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,389
She must've wanted to find her
as her parent.

181
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,429
We'll talk in person soon.

182
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:01,169
Yes, I wish to meet you soon, sir.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,769
An envelope with money went missing?

184
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:05,700
I put it in the drawer,
but it's not there.

185
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:08,210
Who was in the office during lunch?

186
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,639
We went out to eat together
and came back together.

187
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,679
Was Ms. Goo here?

188
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,850
I wonder.
I didn't see her at the restaurant.

189
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,289
Ms. Goo, where have you been?

190
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:24,860
I went to the archives
to find books on Dubai.

191
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,389
Soo Jung, Jin Kyung,
go through her drawers.

192
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,789
Yes.

193
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,299
- Go.
- What's wrong?

194
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:33,899
Why are you going through my drawer?

195
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:37,330
Only you saw me putting
this envelope into my drawer.

196
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,909
Is that the envelope?

197
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,220
There it is.

198
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,889
Did you give it back as a show,
then decide to steal it?

199
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,490
What? No.

200
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,490
Wait, why was this in my bag?

201
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,919
I don't know what this is about.

202
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:02,929
Then what? Did someone else
put this in your bag?

203
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,500
- Gosh, is there a CCTV here?
- No.

204
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,269
You knew it wasn't around
when you stole it.

205
00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:10,870
No, I really didn't steal it.

206
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,139
I told you
about three strikes, didn't I?

207
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,269
I got you the third time.
Leave right now.

208
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,549
What's going on?

209
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:29,450
- How much?
- It was 500 dollars.

210
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,759
I found it in her bag,
yet she denied it.

211
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:32,919
She's so brazen.

212
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,759
If she said she didn't do it,
then it must be true.

213
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,889
Why would she confess
that she was the thief?

214
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,029
The money was in her bag.

215
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:41,100
Why do you keep doing this?
You're always on her side.

216
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,470
I wasn't taking her side.
I'd say the same for anyone else.

217
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,169
What if someone else
put that in her bag?

218
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,009
That's absurd.

219
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:49,970
We cannot ignore that possibility.

220
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,740
Make sure you handle it cautiously.

221
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,009
We keep losing our hotel contracts,
so don't let our staff lose spirits.

222
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,450
And make sure
we don't let the word go out.

223
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,929
My auntie needs to repay her debt.

224
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,259
"Debt?" How much is it?
And why are you paying it off?

225
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,570
I just need 10 50-cent coins.

226
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:22,769
I wanted to check the CCTV
in the corridor to see...

227
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,740
who went into the office at lunch.

228
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,539
- The Tour Planning Team?
- Yes.

229
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:30,179
- So, between 12:30 p.m. to 1 p.m.?
- Yes.

230
00:13:34,889 --> 00:13:38,460
The CCTV in the corridor
was turned off at that hour.

231
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,889
It was turned off? Why?

232
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,059
Was there an update
or maintenance scheduled?

233
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,860
I don't see any notice
for that time period.

234
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,539
Then, could someone have...

235
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:55,610
turned it off
and back on intentionally?

236
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,669
Who knows?

237
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,710
There is a bit of chance.

238
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,450
Who could be?

239
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,679
Only Ms. Yoon and I saw her...

240
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:08,320
put the envelope into her drawer.

241
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,230
I told you not to call me.

242
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,269
I'm guessing
no one is bothering you these days.

243
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,769
No one, my foot.

244
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,470
So? Do you need me?

245
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,970
I'll ask if I need your help.

246
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,309
- Don't get ahead of yourself.
- Right.

247
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,580
It's already been six years.

248
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:39,879
Don't you think
I did such a neat job?

249
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,919
Neat, my foot.
You've been haunting me for years.

250
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,460
I'll wait for your call.

251
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,330
Good grief.

252
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:59,000
Ji Eun, there was a theft
at Hyesung Tour.

253
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,309
Someone stole
from Ms. Yoon Se Young.

254
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,570
What? Who was this brave brat?

255
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:04,940
How did you know it was a woman?

256
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,710
Someone who pulled strings
to get her job.

257
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:09,080
If she didn't get the job fairly,
she should at least do her job well.

258
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:13,820
Hyesung Tour?

259
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:17,389
- What's her name?
- No idea.

260
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,360
I heard she was a tour guide...

261
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,860
who started days ago.

262
00:15:21,659 --> 00:15:22,830
Darn it.

263
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,600
The person you have reached is...

264
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,740
Why won't you pick up?

265
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:37,879
Why did you have to go
to your nephew's kindergarten?

266
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,340
You don't have to answer me
if it's private.

267
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:45,750
My nephew took up jobs
trying to help me.

268
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,580
To pay your debt back?

269
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,049
How did you know?

270
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,590
I ran into him in the alley.

271
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,320
And I got a flyer, too.

272
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,190
He cared so much about his auntie.

273
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,129
I should be a better aunt.

274
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,429
And I paid off my debt.

275
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,929
- You did?
- Yes.

276
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,500
Actually, I met my ex-boyfriend
on that day...

277
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,070
to pay him back.

278
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:13,110
I ended up sharing too much.
This is embarrassing.

279
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:15,580
Well, people sometimes go into debt.

280
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:18,220
I caused
too many commotions, haven't I?

281
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

282
00:16:21,149 --> 00:16:23,690
You first met me
when I took up an illegal gig,

283
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,690
so I could understand the suspicion.

284
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,519
You said you'd never do that again.

285
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:30,490
I trust my staff members,
and that includes you.

286
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,500
So, make sure
you prove your innocence.

287
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,070
Don't take the false blame
over just 500 dollars.

288
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,740
Thank you for giving me your trust.

289
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,600
Is there a way
to prove your innocence?

290
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,710
Not yet.

291
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,409
Yes, something was weird
with the CCTV in the corridor.

292
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:50,149
- Why?
- I think someone turned it off...

293
00:16:50,149 --> 00:16:52,549
just during lunch on purpose.

294
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,980
- "On purpose?"
- Yes.

295
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,490
The security office said turning it off
in a certain range of time...

296
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,389
usually happens
under maintenance notices.

297
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,230
But there were no notices,
and the reason was unknown.

298
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:05,299
They'll look into it
and get back to me.

299
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,930
Let me know when you hear back.

300
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,470
Yes, sir.

301
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,670
He's been searching through villages
near the sea where she went missing.

302
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,349
A few years ago,
a young woman and a kid...

303
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:23,410
came by looking
for someone like Yu Jin.

304
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,720
He left his contact there,
so he'd look into it and call back.

305
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:31,920
If that young woman knows Yu Jin,

306
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,259
all I have to do is
find her contact.

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,240
I'm home, Aunt Yeo Jin.

308
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,640
Hey, you're home.

309
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,240
You lit the fireplace.

310
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,880
I wanted to use it this winter.

311
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,349
Why is she
suddenly lighting the fireplace?

312
00:18:04,859 --> 00:18:06,220
Because of that dream
she had of Yu Jin?

313
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,759
Who knows?

314
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,759
Leave her alone.
It's not a big deal.

315
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,299
How did it go with the envelope?

316
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,900
I made her look like a thief.

317
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,670
I found fault with her,
so she'd be fired very soon.

318
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,410
I considered reporting her
for taking a bribe.

319
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,539
Good. Great job.

320
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,279
No one could find out
you were behind this, right?

321
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,849
She wants to prove her innocence,
but there's no way.

322
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,450
Can you think of a way?

323
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,390
We can't let her get kicked out
by taking false blame as a thief.

324
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,730
She's getting bashed into pieces
for pulling strings and stealing.

325
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,400
She was framed.

326
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:50,869
Otherwise, why would it
show up in her bag?

327
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,839
And the envelope was
from Yoon Se Young's mother.

328
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,170
"Yoon Se Young's mother?"

329
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,809
- She staged this.
- "Staged?"

330
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,549
Why would she do that?

331
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,559
I should've returned it
when she gave it to me.

332
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:17,589
Why did I bring it to the office?

333
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:20,759
Who could it be?

334
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,670
It was a relief
that Mr. Hwang believed me.

335
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,440
Make sure you prove your innocence.

336
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:28,940
Don't take the false blame
over just 500 dollars.

337
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:31,779
How did he know it was 500 dollars?

338
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,640
Did Ms. Yoon tell him?

339
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:36,109
- Then, I'll return it myself...
- Forget it.

340
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:41,490
She didn't even open it...

341
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,150
when she stashed it in her drawer.

342
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,589
What's with that serious face?

343
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,829
- Are you imagining something?
- What? No.

344
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,329
Eun Chong, did you prepare
everything for tomorrow?

345
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,200
Yes, I have to bring...

346
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,170
Mommy's cell phone tomorrow.

347
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,539
What? Why?

348
00:20:02,539 --> 00:20:05,410
It's a secret right now.
I'll tell you tomorrow.

349
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,779
Gosh. Why would a kid like you
keep secrets?

350
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,109
What could it be?

351
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:15,549
My gosh.

352
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,359
Get in!

353
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,460
Hello, Mr. Hwang.

354
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,089
I'll just take the bus.

355
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:23,559
Hop in. We're losing time.

356
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,630
Thank you.

357
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,369
We actually ran into each other
as neighbors.

358
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:37,140
Did you get some sleep?

359
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,480
I didn't think so.

360
00:20:39,579 --> 00:20:40,880
I didn't sleep too well.

361
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,220
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

362
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:49,950
How did you know it was 500 dollars?

363
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,589
Ms. Yoon said so. Why?

364
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:58,059
I was wondering
if words got around everywhere.

365
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,240
- I need to take this.
- Sure.

366
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,740
Hey, what's up?

367
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,480
Ha Na, the envelope thing
could've been staged by Yoon Se Young.

368
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,509
- What do you mean?
- Don't you know what it means?

369
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:16,480
Does she hate you?

370
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,650
Is there a reason
why she needs to frame you?

371
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,150
I don't know.

372
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,289
How did you come up with that idea?

373
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,589
- Ji Seok did.
- Ji Seok?

374
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,490
He wouldn't tell me why,

375
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,559
but he was sure
Yoon Se Young staged this.

376
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,599
Gosh, how am I going to get her?

377
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,099
Why would Ji Seok think so?

378
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,380
That's enough.

379
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,549
What's enough?

380
00:21:51,549 --> 00:21:52,950
Your immature and crude play.

381
00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:54,420
Are you dreaming?

382
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,619
You aren't fully awake yet.

383
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:58,319
How will you handle this later?

384
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,720
You were worried about me?

385
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,490
How despicable.

386
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,259
Yes.

387
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,069
That's how you should respond.

388
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,769
You'll become
the main hero of this play.

389
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,710
Wait, you aren't the main hero.
You're the biggest villain.

390
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,569
So, people can get better
at talking nonsense.

391
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,480
Speak for yourself.

392
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,950
You seem like a real heiress
after acting like one for a while.

393
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,180
- Has the real heiress died?
- You're crazy.

394
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,970
- Ji Seok.
- If you quit when I told you to,

395
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,269
you wouldn't be in this situation.

396
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,210
What?

397
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,180
Ms. Yoon, why is my desk outside?

398
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,180
You're no longer with Hyesong Tour
as of yesterday. You didn't know?

399
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,650
I never resigned.

400
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:03,549
You've been struck out.

401
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,430
Does Hyesung Tour have
a strikeout policy?

402
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,059
I thought you weren't allowed
to fire employees recklessly.

403
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,259
So, you'll bring the law into this?

404
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,599
I can call the police.

405
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,230
Let's handle the theft first.

406
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,769
Beat it.
I don't want to see you around here.

407
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,609
The CCTV in the corridor...

408
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,109
could've been tampered with
just during lunchtime.

409
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,980
What? Says who?

410
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,509
I confirmed it
with the security office.

411
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,119
They'll find the reason
and give me an answer,

412
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,380
so I will leave on my own...

413
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,420
if I turn out to be the perpetrator.

414
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:44,829
Why is the desk out there?

415
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,299
- She must've been fired.
- I think so.

416
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,529
Be quiet.

417
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,029
- Hello.
- Hello.

418
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,880
Why did you say
the camera was tampered with?

419
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,339
That woman kept prying,

420
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:04,509
so he must've told her
what was in the manual.

421
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,849
Did you destroy everything
that could be used as evidence?

422
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:11,289
Call me immediately
if anything happens.

423
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,460
Hanguk Hotel's investor is
also Richard Han?

424
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,769
Yes, I don't have hard evidence yet,

425
00:24:22,099 --> 00:24:24,329
but circumstantial evidence
seems to point to him.

426
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:29,069
If that is true,
what do you think he's after?

427
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:32,480
I need to know what he's like
to give you an answer.

428
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,609
- When is he coming?
- The end of this month.

429
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,710
Let's schedule a meeting
as soon as he arrives.

430
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,220
Yes, ma'am.

431
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,190
(Missing Persons Unit)

432
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,160
What's wrong?

433
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,190
It's the Missing Persons Unit.

434
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,329
You should pick up.

435
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:52,700
Hello?

436
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,500
Yes, that's me.

437
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,140
A missing person you found
seemed to be my Yu Jin?

438
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,309
Yes, if she's in her thirties,
that's about Yu Jin's age.

439
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:07,410
Where is she right now?

440
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,920
She doesn't remember?

441
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,690
How's her condition?
Do you have a picture of her?

442
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,029
I should run a parentage test first.

443
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,660
Yes.

444
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:29,700
All right. Thank you.

445
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:35,140
Are you all right?
You should have this.

446
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,680
So, the DNA sample was a match...

447
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,920
with a missing person
who could be Yu Jin, right?

448
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,650
Yes.

449
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,289
Yes, there was a chance
our DNA could match.

450
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,930
Congratulations, Chairwoman Shin.

451
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:57,130
This was the first time
you had a DNA match.

452
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,259
I'm so happy for you.

453
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,430
This isn't a dream, is it?

454
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:04,230
Can I really believe this, Jin Goo?

455
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:07,099
No, it's not a dream.

456
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,609
You can believe it.

457
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,710
So, what did they say?

458
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,480
Yes, they asked me...

459
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,210
to take a new DNA sample
and send it to the police station.

460
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:19,720
Call Dr. Hong.
Let me do it right away.

461
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,650
Yes, I'll escort you there.

462
00:26:22,519 --> 00:26:26,190
Don't let anyone find out
until I have the final result.

463
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,759
Yes, ma'am.

464
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,029
Let's take your sample.

465
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,299
Okay.

466
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,640
You're all done.

467
00:27:02,089 --> 00:27:04,859
I'm Lee Eun Chong,
and my most cherished item is...

468
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,500
this cell phone.

469
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:09,569
This phone has...

470
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:12,569
videos of me and my mommy,
who's in paradise.

471
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,539
My mommy, who's in paradise,

472
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:17,539
passed away in a car accident
when I was one.

473
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,039
I cannot see her,

474
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,309
but I can still see her
and listen to her voice...

475
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:26,619
on this phone,
so this is my most cherished item.

476
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:30,220
But someone who is
the dearest to me is...

477
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,359
my auntie, Auntie Ha Na!

478
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,289
Okay.

479
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,059
I'm the dearest person to you,
Eun Chong,

480
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,369
so I won't let people
treat me unfairly.

481
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:50,839
I'll make sure I clear my name.

482
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,190
Yu Jin.

483
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,990
Was that why
you came to see me in my dream?

484
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:10,529
We will meet again. We will.

485
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,369
I'm home, Aunt Yeo Jin.

486
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,009
Were you looking at Yu Jin's photos?

487
00:28:23,009 --> 00:28:24,309
Get changed and come downstairs...

488
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:26,339
- for a cup of tea.
- Okay.

489
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
The police station called me.

490
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,220
- With an update on Yu Jin?
- Yes.

491
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,220
This missing person they found
had a DNA match with me.

492
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,960
She's about the same age, too.

493
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,059
Oh, my. Was it Yu Jin?

494
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,400
My goodness.

495
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,440
Congratulations, Yeo Jin.

496
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,440
Se Young, this is big news.

497
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,609
We found Yu Jin.

498
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,509
Really, Aunt Yeo Jin?

499
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,009
You found Yu Jin?

500
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,180
I have to wait for the DNA test.

501
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,119
If your DNAs match,
it must be 100 percent certain.

502
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,519
When will they have the result?

503
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,960
I told them to do it
as quickly as possible.

504
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,500
It'll come out within the week.

505
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,869
The wait still seems too long.

506
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,170
Can't they rush it?

507
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,539
My heart is racing.

508
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:29,769
I've already waited 20 years,

509
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,440
so a few days wasn't a problem.

510
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,539
Yes, you're right.
It's just a few days.

511
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,519
Do you like that one?

512
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:47,859
Here.

513
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,099
Eun Chong, you were
also so adorable back then.

514
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,900
Do I look like my mommy?

515
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,299
Yes, of course.

516
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:01,799
Your sparkly eyes, defined nose,

517
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:03,170
cute lips,

518
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,109
and you're brave like her, too.
You're just like her.

519
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,849
Go to sleep if you're sleepy.
Let's go to sleep.

520
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,380
All right.

521
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:23,160
Your mommy helped
prove my innocence...

522
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:25,730
when people framed me as a thief
at the children's home.

523
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:31,029
What would your mommy have done...

524
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,299
if she were still with us?

525
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,049
Keep it quiet
until we have the result.

526
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,150
- Of course.
- Yes.

527
00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:49,720
Have some.

528
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:01,430
What's wrong?

529
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,599
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

530
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,710
I was a little excited
to hear about Yu Jin.

531
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,480
Do you like that one?

532
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,750
This one, too.

533
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:20,279
I have to find
Eun Chong's grandmother, too.

534
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,589
But I'm getting no matches
with his DNA,

535
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:26,720
and there are no leads.

536
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:32,359
Fireplace. Wooden swing.

537
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Hot chocolate. Marshmallow.

538
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:38,900
Can I really find her
with these leads?

539
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:47,339
If you hadn't
gotten into that accident,

540
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,509
would we have found his grandmother?

541
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,289
Du Na, tell me.

542
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:58,420
Who were you with...

543
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,960
just before your death?

544
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:04,559
I'm dying to see her.

545
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:06,529
But of course, not as much as you.

546
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,230
Thank you.

547
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,220
(Cinderella Game)

548
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,019
I can't believe it. I'm scared.

549
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,019
Yu Jin will never show up.

550
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:05,390
Let's get moving.

551
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,690
We should cut it down
when we have a chance.

552
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,759
I'll offer a deal
that is hard to turn down.

553
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,089
I never stole
that envelope with money.

554
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,500
I don't know anything.

555
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,259
Please help vindicate Ms. Goo Ha Na.

556
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,900
Shouldn't you focus more
on the bet you have going with me?

557
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
There's a criminal here
at Hyesung Tour's office,

558
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,269
so arrest her immediately.

559
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,599
What are you doing?

560
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,509
Someone like you
can't win against me.
