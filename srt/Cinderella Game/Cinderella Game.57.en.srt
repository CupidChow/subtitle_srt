00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,909
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,250
You can use this hand
to do everything now.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,019
- I'm so happy to be done.
- Great.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,589
- Lee Eun Chong's guardian, please.
- Yes?

7
00:00:15,189 --> 00:00:17,359
Sit here for a second.

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,460
Okay.

9
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:24,960
Hello.

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,600
- Here's the bill.
- Okay.

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:33,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,159
- Here's your card.
- Thanks.

13
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,590
- Thank you.
- Sure.

14
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:16,079
Excuse me. Have you seen
the boy who was sitting here?

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,480
He just left.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,120
Thank you.

17
00:01:24,819 --> 00:01:25,819
Excuse me.

18
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:27,790
Have you seen a boy
in a blue jacket?

19
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:28,930
No.

20
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,000
Eun Chong!

21
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,140
Mr. Hwang.

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,840
Are you at home?

23
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,739
Can you e-mail me the edited version
of the mom-daughter tour proposal?

24
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:49,010
No.

25
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,079
Mr. Hwang...

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,319
What's wrong? Is something going on?

27
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:58,590
Eun Chong disappeared.

28
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,930
What? "Eun Chong is gone?"

29
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,359
What?

30
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:10,099
Eun Chong is gone?
What are you talking about?

31
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:12,539
He was there while
I paid the bill at the hospital,

32
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,240
but he suddenly disappeared.

33
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,469
"Suddenly disappeared?"

34
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,180
Have you looked everywhere?

35
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,750
Have you called the police?

36
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,110
- Aunt Yeo Jin.
- Yeo Jin.

37
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,319
- Hello?
- Where did you lose him?

38
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,550
At the hospital?

39
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:31,689
Goodness. Yeo Jin.

40
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,120
Are you going to go yourself?

41
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,289
If we report it to the police,
they'll find him right away.

42
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,699
There are CCTVs everywhere.

43
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,099
She's right, Aunt Yeo Jin.

44
00:02:39,699 --> 00:02:41,229
- Let go of me.
- Goodness.

45
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,270
- Goodness.
- Yeo Jin!

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,240
- Ma'am...
- Yeo Jin!

47
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,240
- You should probably leave today.
- Yes, all right.

48
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,250
Please let us know
when you find Eun Chong.

49
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,020
You'll find him,
so don't worry about it.

50
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,550
Yes, goodbye.

51
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,879
Goodbye. My gosh.

52
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,330
It wouldn't be so bad
if he disappeared like this.

53
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:14,270
Where's Aunt Yeo Jin?

54
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,969
She grabbed a passing taxi and left.

55
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:20,439
She must've been reminded of Yu Jin
and lost her mind.

56
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,069
- Shouldn't we go with her?
- She'll call Ms. Jang.

57
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,479
Let her tell the whole world
that he's her grandson.

58
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:32,550
It'd be great
if his identity got exposed.

59
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,050
Excuse me.

60
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,259
Have you seen a boy
in a blue jacket?

61
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,889
- No.
- No.

62
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,930
Thank you.

63
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:45,300
Ha Na!

64
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,229
Mr. Hwang...

65
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:50,500
- Did you report it to the police?
- Yes.

66
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,370
Let's check
the hospital's CCTV footage first.

67
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:56,409
They're on a lunch break,
so I have to wait.

68
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,650
Then, let's check the corridor first
with CCTV in the building.

69
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,080
Okay.

70
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,449
(Police)

71
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:13,419
- Are you here for the missing boy?
- That's right.

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,069
That's Eun Chong.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,100
Who's that man?

74
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,269
The boy doesn't seem wary of him.
He must be an acquaintance.

75
00:04:27,339 --> 00:04:29,170
- Can you rewind it?
- Sure.

76
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,050
- No way.
- Can you tell who he is?

77
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,689
Lee Seok Ki?

78
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,490
Who is that?

79
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:46,790
My ex-boyfriend.

80
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:51,360
The number you have dialed
does not exist.

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,399
He must've changed his number.

82
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,199
I'll run a background check on him.

83
00:04:56,769 --> 00:04:57,800
Where's Eun Chong?

84
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,670
We're looking at the CCTV footage
to find his whereabouts.

85
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,439
Please don't worry, Ms. Chairwoman.

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
I think I know who took Eun Chong.

87
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,449
Is it someone you know?

88
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:09,180
- Yes.
- Who?

89
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,420
Tell me! Who took him?

90
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,920
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Ms. Chairwoman.

91
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:24,199
Where are you?
Is the kid safe with you?

92
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,370
The police are looking through
CCTVs out on the street, too.

93
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,069
Call Goo Ha Na right now.

94
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,269
How did you find out
about her ex-boyfriend?

95
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,740
I thought he might be useful,
so I took a measure.

96
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,959
(Incoming Call)

97
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,129
Hello?

98
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,060
It's me, Ha Na.

99
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,100
Lee Seok Ki.

100
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,939
You took Eun Chong, didn't you?

101
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,300
Where is he right now?

102
00:06:06,939 --> 00:06:08,170
Where's Eun Chong right now?

103
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,779
If you dare lay a hand on him,
you won't live to see another day.

104
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,689
So, why isn't Auntie Ha Na coming?

105
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:24,759
She'll be here.

106
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,629
Anyway, does she have a boyfriend?

107
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:30,089
Do you want to work things out
with my auntie again?

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,800
We had a good run, right?

109
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:35,129
We had lots of fun, didn't we?

110
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,069
Then, why didn't you marry her?

111
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,769
- Was it because of me?
- No.

112
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,379
I was a fool.

113
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,009
I looked back
and reflected on everything.

114
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,350
Eun Chong, do you want to be my son?

115
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,649
What?

116
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:57,689
I'll be your dad.

117
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,100
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na...

118
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,269
Goodness. Eun Chong.

119
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,439
Are you all right?
You aren't hurt, right?

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,240
No. Grandma, are you crying?

121
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,649
I was so happy
that you weren't hurt.

122
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,350
Ha Na.

123
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,850
Why did you take him
without telling me?

124
00:07:28,019 --> 00:07:29,519
This is kidnapping!

125
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,720
"Kidnapping?"
He decided to come with me.

126
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,329
We ran into each other by chance.

127
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,029
He wanted ice cream,
so I bought some for him...

128
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:38,160
and brought him home.
How is that kidnapping?

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,699
What kind of a kidnapper
takes the kid back home?

130
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,129
I even called you.

131
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,199
You.

132
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,300
- Ms. Chairwoman!
- Ms. Chairwoman!

133
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:49,139
Did you think you would live
after kidnapping my Eun Chong?

134
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,209
Was the chairwoman
of Hyesung Group...

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,279
allowed to hit
a perfectly innocent bystander?

136
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,350
Shut your mouth!

137
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,949
I'll sue you for kidnapping.

138
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,149
Is he your grandson or what?

139
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,160
Why are you making a huge scene?

140
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,920
- You.
- Ms. Chairwoman.

141
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,259
You should take Eun Chong
and wait in the car.

142
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,730
You should do that, Ms. Chairwoman.

143
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,269
Let's go, Eun Chong.

144
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,069
- Auntie...
- Hey.

145
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,000
You can go to the car with Grandma.

146
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,939
Let's go.

147
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,680
Why did you take him?

148
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:33,679
- Tell me.
- I had to do this to see you.

149
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,049
You kidnapped Eun Chong to see me?

150
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,259
It was a planned crime.

151
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,460
How did you know
he was at the hospital?

152
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,690
Hey, I wondered who you were.

153
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,159
You're that president from before.

154
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,370
Wait, are you two dating?

155
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,570
Why are you together on the weekend,
even though this isn't your office?

156
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,870
If you really did this
just to see me,

157
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,110
run to the police right now
and turn yourself in.

158
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,779
If you don't, I'll sue you.

159
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,809
If you sue me,
I'll file a countersuit...

160
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,450
for Hyesung's chairwoman's assault.

161
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:05,580
Right. You were
Hyesung Group's hidden daughter?

162
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,519
Says who?

163
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,259
Who told you that?

164
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,429
I don't care if you are
Hyesung's daughter or not.

165
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,799
Come back to me.
I'll be good to you.

166
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,129
What's with you?

167
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
You aren't even worth my punch.

168
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,340
Get out of my house right now.

169
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,970
Don't be so harsh, Ha Na.

170
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,340
You're incredibly impolite.

171
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,870
Let go. Let go of me.

172
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,210
Get out. Get out of here!

173
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,580
I'll call you, Ha Na.

174
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,279
Just go.

175
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,220
Don't you dare call Ha Na.

176
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:40,519
I'll kill you.

177
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,429
It made no sense that
he kidnapped Eun Chong to meet me.

178
00:09:53,429 --> 00:09:57,200
So, how did he find out
she was my mom?

179
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,299
I wonder.
Who could've leaked the information?

180
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:11,480
Eun Chong, are you all right?

181
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,320
Who did you go with?

182
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:16,090
Did you understand
everything I said?

183
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,559
You cannot follow anyone else alone,
even if you know them.

184
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,730
Okay.

185
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,659
You must've caught a cold.

186
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,460
Would you like some hot honey tea?

187
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,799
I'll ask Ms. Jang to do it.

188
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,029
It must've been tough for you, too.
Please get some rest.

189
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,370
Yeo Jin, you were gone in a taxi
when I went out with a coat.

190
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:36,070
You should go upstairs
with Eun Chong.

191
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,639
Okay.

192
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,840
Let's go.

193
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,110
Goodness.

194
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
How did you end up coming with them?

195
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,019
Yeo Jin must've called him.

196
00:10:59,429 --> 00:11:01,299
I'm sorry, Auntie Ha Na.

197
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,940
Don't ever do this again.

198
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,669
- Promise me.
- I promise.

199
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,539
Are you mad, Auntie?

200
00:11:14,379 --> 00:11:15,480
No.

201
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,450
I was just in shock.

202
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,350
My heart dropped
when I began to think...

203
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:23,149
I could've lost you forever.

204
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:25,259
I won't do that again.

205
00:11:25,789 --> 00:11:28,190
Auntie Ha Na, I need to peepee.

206
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,259
- You should go.
- Okay.

207
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,549
She must've been
as desperate as that...

208
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,889
when she lost me.

209
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,990
- Eun Chong.
- Auntie Ha Na...

210
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,299
Eun Chong.

211
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,659
Are you all right?
You aren't hurt, right?

212
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:09,399
No. Grandma,

213
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,799
are you crying?

214
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,940
I'm grateful that
she cares so much about Eun Chong.

215
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:20,409
But she was my mom,
so shouldn't she worry about me first?

216
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:24,919
I was quite shocked...

217
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:27,320
when Eun Chong disappeared.

218
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:38,399
Should I call Dr. Hong?

219
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:41,330
I'll be fine after I get some rest.

220
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,600
I need to put
a bodyguard on Eun Chong.

221
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,070
- He shouldn't attract attention...
- It's better than losing him.

222
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,110
Find a team of bodyguards for him...

223
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,509
when he comes and goes
from kindergarten.

224
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:52,610
Yes, ma'am.

225
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,549
If I may add my bit,
it's not advantageous...

226
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,049
to show your emotions for Eun Chong
for both Ha Na and Eun Chong.

227
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,120
If anyone finds out...

228
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,960
I wasn't in my right mind
to consider those things.

229
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,090
I was so scared
I could lose Eun Chong, too.

230
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:09,230
It won't happen again.

231
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,659
He was Ha Na's ex-boyfriend, right?

232
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,600
How did he know
Yu Jin was my daughter?

233
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,600
Shut them up
and make sure they don't talk.

234
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:24,710
Mission success.

235
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:28,850
She was reported for child abuse,
then she lost the kid, too.

236
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:33,750
She'd never be able
to adopt Eun Chong.

237
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,789
I've never felt so alive
since when I was ten.

238
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,690
Yu Jin is dead,

239
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,389
and Yu Jin's son is only seven.

240
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,529
Wait.

241
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:48,500
Why don't you adopt Eun Chong?

242
00:13:48,669 --> 00:13:50,730
- Me?
- You can marry Jin Goo...

243
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,440
and adopt him.

244
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,710
Then, naturally,
Hyesung will be yours.

245
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,480
That's a plausible plan.

246
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,659
Can we talk?

247
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,139
Did the chairwoman call?

248
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,179
I called Ms. Goo
to get the proposal...

249
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,850
for the mother-daughter tour.

250
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,409
Then, you heard about it
and ran over?

251
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,179
I was in such shock that
I didn't remember how I got there.

252
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,019
It was a relief we found him.

253
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,190
It could've been much worse.

254
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:45,519
Right?

255
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,730
I thought about a few things,

256
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,659
and you were right.

257
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,799
I'm self-centered and selfish.

258
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,009
And I only considered my feelings
and ignored how others felt.

259
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:04,240
I was the one at fault
with your mother's matter.

260
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:07,110
I should've been more concerned
about how you and she felt.

261
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:10,549
I was a bit flustered,

262
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:12,779
so I resorted to defending myself.

263
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,950
All right.
Thank you for understanding.

264
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,759
I'll visit Mother and talk to her.

265
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,529
It's okay. She forgot about it.

266
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:23,629
You don't have to do that.

267
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,929
I'll be a good daughter-in-law
once we marry.

268
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,399
Why won't you say anything?

269
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:34,940
Se Young.

270
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:38,909
(Goo Ji Seok)

271
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,740
It's a spam call.

272
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,149
So, we've made up, okay?

273
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,149
- Why won't you say anything?
- Why don't we...

274
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,320
take a break?

275
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,059
You wanted to do that, too.

276
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:59,100
That was because I got mad.

277
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,029
You want to take a break
three months before our wedding?

278
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,399
Are you even considering
calling our marriage off?

279
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,539
That's not what I mean.

280
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:08,940
But we never had...

281
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:12,710
a serious thought
about our relationship to this day.

282
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,480
We've known each other as kids,
so it was easy to get together.

283
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,309
We're now about to marry...

284
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,820
because our parents want it,
and we're happy with it, too.

285
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:24,019
But I thought there was a need
to consider this marriage...

286
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,120
just between us two.

287
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,629
You should give it
a serious thought.

288
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,529
See if you really love me.

289
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,230
I do love you, Jin Goo.

290
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,070
Don't you love me?

291
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:39,000
What do you think love is?

292
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,440
Someone I can plan a future with.

293
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,909
Aiming for the same goal.

294
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,580
Hyesung Group?

295
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,639
This isn't news.

296
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,549
What's love to you?

297
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:50,980
Honestly, I'm not so sure.

298
00:16:51,549 --> 00:16:54,019
That's why I want to think about it.

299
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,720
Is this his way of saying...

300
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,659
he doesn't love me?

301
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,190
Bye.

302
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,200
Fine.
Go ahead and think all you want.

303
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,769
It wasn't like we dated
because of love.

304
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,309
I'm not calling this marriage off.

305
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,980
What are you up to?

306
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:29,119
I thought Mom had caught a cold,
so I wanted to make pear juice.

307
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,420
This must've been hard on you, too.
You should get some rest.

308
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,119
You must be in shock.

309
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,630
First, because of Eun Chong,
then because of the chairwoman.

310
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:41,700
If I were you,
I would've felt slighted and sad.

311
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,200
So, it's natural to feel
slighted and sad, right?

312
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,869
Of course. The chairwoman...

313
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,240
must've been scared that
her nightmare would repeat itself.

314
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,650
That must've been
why she overreacted.

315
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,579
She was quite worried about you.

316
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,849
I see.

317
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,950
And the adoption
got postponed again.

318
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,920
Eun Chong and I want this
so desperately,

319
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,329
but why won't this happen?

320
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,089
I even have a rich mom now.

321
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,329
It will happen someday.

322
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,970
No, very soon.

323
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,569
Yes.

324
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:20,369
Let me know
if your ex-boyfriend reaches out.

325
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,769
Don't try to get through this alone
once again.

326
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,279
All right.

327
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:29,380
One second.

328
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,980
Hey, Ji Chang.

329
00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:37,150
I forgot.

330
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:39,690
How can you forget about us?

331
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,789
Did you forget us
now that you became rich...

332
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,299
What? Eun Chong went missing?

333
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,069
And?

334
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,069
It's me. What's going on?

335
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,039
Someone you knew took him? Who?

336
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,140
- Who is this crazy...
- Punk?

337
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,769
Who took Eun Chong
without telling her?

338
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,410
So, the home visit got called off?

339
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,849
If Eun Chong went missing,
it couldn't be Chairwoman Shin.

340
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:06,849
Was it Se Young's mom?

341
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,619
Eun Chong? Was he all right?

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,819
Thankfully, yes.

343
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,660
But isn't it odd?

344
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,059
How did he run into Eun Chong
in front of the hospital?

345
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,660
He must've known
Eun Chong would be at the hospital.

346
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,470
I feel the same way.

347
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,470
During the home visit last time,
she was reported for child abuse.

348
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
This time, the kid disappeared.

349
00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:29,740
Didn't this look completely staged?

350
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:32,410
There could be someone
who wants to stop the adoption.

351
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,910
Bingo. I knew you and I spoke
the same language.

352
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,680
Anyway, who would do that?

353
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,349
What an awful man.

354
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,589
Ms. Goo's heart must've dropped.

355
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:49,359
The chairwoman went out
without wearing a coat,

356
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,029
so she caught a cold.

357
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,259
Oh, no.

358
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,970
I should go over tomorrow
and make some porridge.

359
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,670
Se Young's mom is there, too.

360
00:19:57,670 --> 00:19:59,240
Myung Ji can't do anything.

361
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,970
Anyway, the chairwoman
must adore Eun Chong a lot.

362
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,839
- It's like he's her own grandson.
- Yes.

363
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,680
Mom.

364
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,680
Was there something you wanted to do
with your future daughter-in-law?

365
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,660
I thought it'd be great
if she was like my daughter.

366
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,460
I want to cook together,

367
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,890
go to the bathhouse together,
go grocery shopping together,

368
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,230
and badmouth
drama characters together.

369
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,599
- I see.
- But girls these days hate that.

370
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,700
Se Young probably hates that, too.

371
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,910
Ms. Goo would be
good at something like that.

372
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,779
Goodness, that was unnecessary.
I'm so silly.

373
00:20:43,849 --> 00:20:44,880
Goodness.

374
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,150
Oh, my. We're missing mushrooms.

375
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,650
I'm so out of it. Good grief.

376
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,710
She seems rather unwell.

377
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,910
Should I put a wet towel over her?

378
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,920
Yu Jin.

379
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,490
Yu Jin, don't go.

380
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:30,930
Mom, I'm right here.

381
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:32,829
Come by my side.

382
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,369
I miss you.

383
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,569
Come back.

384
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:42,410
Don't go.

385
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
Is she dreaming
that I'm going somewhere?

386
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,480
Goodness.

387
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,250
You're up.

388
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,549
How do you feel?

389
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:02,190
You were in much pain
late in the night.

390
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,490
I feel much better.

391
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:09,289
Did you stay here to look after me?

392
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,859
I didn't do much.

393
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,799
I must've
broken your heart yesterday.

394
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,369
I was sorry for blaming you...

395
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:23,569
while you were troubled
after Eun Chong disappeared.

396
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,109
It's all right.

397
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,150
That reminded me of how I lost you,
so I wasn't in my right mind.

398
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,789
Did you dream about me last night?

399
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,319
What?

400
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,930
You kept calling out for me
in your sleep.

401
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:44,859
You told me not to go,
that you wanted me to stay.

402
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,470
You cried out so desperately for me.

403
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,900
Yes, right.

404
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,500
I saw you in my dream.

405
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,710
I'm here with you.

406
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
You don't have to have
such dreams anymore.

407
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,549
Okay.

408
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:17,990
Who is it?

409
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,730
Does Ms. Goo Ha Na live here?

410
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,170
Who are you?

411
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,940
Hey, I think your guests are here.

412
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,009
- My guests?
- Yes.

413
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,420
It's been a while.

414
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,619
Ha Na, did you
get home safely yesterday?

415
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,460
Are you crazy?

416
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,529
How did you know I was here?

417
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,200
Why did you come to our place again?

418
00:24:52,529 --> 00:24:53,759
Do you know them?

419
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,269
I don't.

420
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,170
She lurked around nearby
a few days ago,

421
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,470
and I asked who she was.

422
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:01,299
She said she was
your ex-boyfriend's mom.

423
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,410
Why are you here?

424
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,440
I thought
the chairwoman of Hyesung...

425
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,509
would have a home with golden walls.

426
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,950
But everything is ordinary.

427
00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:12,680
Where are you, Chairwoman Shin?

428
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,250
How dare you slap my son?

429
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,650
Come out now!

430
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,460
What are you doing?

431
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:20,420
We can talk outside. Take her out.

432
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,559
She has something to say.

433
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:24,089
Tell your mom to come out.

434
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,500
Say what?

435
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,029
You can talk to me.

436
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:29,369
This matter is between moms.

437
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:30,430
You can talk to Seok Ki.

438
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,140
I have nothing to say to him.

439
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,710
I'll compensate you for her slap,
so just go outside.

440
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,609
Well, shouldn't Yeo Jin come out?

441
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,250
What's with all the noise?

442
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,079
Yeo Jin, you still don't feel well

443
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:49,390
But Yu Jin's ex-boyfriend
and his mother are here.

444
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,190
Why did you
let random people come inside?

445
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,359
"Random people?"

446
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,390
You can't say that to your victim.

447
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,529
You slapped my son yesterday.

448
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,500
How dare you hurt my precious son
like some barbarian?

449
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,539
And if you had,
you should've settled the matter!

450
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,740
I came to clean up after you.
Do you not want me here?

451
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:13,480
- We can go to the police station.
- Your son kidnapped my...

452
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:17,250
He kidnapped Eun Chong.

453
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:18,779
I let him go
instead of suing him for abduction.

454
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:20,180
How dare you come here?

455
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,759
Wait, were they the ones
who kidnapped Eun Chong yesterday?

456
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,259
How can you be so evil?

457
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,029
How dare you show up here
after kidnapping that boy?

458
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,900
Come out.
Leave before I call the police!

459
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,039
What's wrong with you, woman?

460
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,670
- Do you know how expensive this is?
- My gosh!

461
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,309
- Did you just hit me?
- Yes, I did!

462
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,509
- You!
- Mom!

463
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:47,410
- Good grief!
- Are you okay?

464
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:52,420
This family is violent
through and through.

465
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,819
I'll make the newspapers report...

466
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:56,720
that you're a Violent Group,
not Hyesung Group!

467
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,490
Is that all you have to say?

468
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,690
- That isn't all I have to say!
- My gosh!

469
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,059
- I'm not done!
- Goodness!

470
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,160
Enough!

471
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,099
Sit down.

472
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,869
You're here anyway,
so I'll hear you out.

473
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:12,769
That's more like it.

474
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,670
Seok Ki, you can talk to Ha Na.

475
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,240
Ha Na, let's talk.

476
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,250
I have nothing to say to you.
Get out of here.

477
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,220
Hey, no.
It's minus ten degrees out there.

478
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,480
I'd freeze to death.

479
00:27:26,849 --> 00:27:29,619
Ha Na, the chairwoman...

480
00:27:29,619 --> 00:27:31,759
took a seat,
trying to talk this out with me.

481
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,559
You should talk it out, too.

482
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:36,529
Let go of your temper.

483
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,630
You should act classy
like Hyesung's daughter.

484
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,329
Yes, you should go upstairs...

485
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,130
and talk to him.

486
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,170
- Come with me.
- Okay, Ha Na.

487
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,210
Yeo Jin is suffering from a cold,

488
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,750
so let's cut to the chase
and settle the case.

489
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,019
I don't have
to listen to this anymore.

490
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:03,220
Give her some money and let her go.

491
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,759
Money isn't everything.

492
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:08,490
We have enough money, too.

493
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:10,089
Then, what else do you want?

494
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,160
I heard Ha Na was...

495
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:16,329
Hyesung Group's hidden daughter.

496
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,799
My gosh.

497
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:22,609
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,640
You did enough damage yesterday.
You brought your mom here?

499
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:28,079
How did you know I was here?

500
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,619
Ha Na, I'm sorry for everything.

501
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,190
Let's start over.

502
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,589
I'll be so good to you.

503
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,259
I'll be a great dad to Eun Chong.

504
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:41,319
Get up.

505
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,730
You're doing this because
you know I'm Hyesung's daughter.

506
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,900
How did you find out?

507
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,160
Didn't you tell my mom?

508
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,269
Why would I tell your mom?

509
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,369
I have no idea.

510
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:53,339
But I'm not doing this
because you're a Cinderella now.

511
00:28:54,369 --> 00:28:55,710
I really loved you.

512
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,109
You know that, too. Right?

513
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,609
I love you, Ha Na.
You're the only one for me.

514
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,779
What's wrong with you?

515
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:06,480
Get rid of him. He's annoying me.

516
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:09,089
Whoa. Who's that?

517
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,950
I had been curious for a while.

518
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,559
He's such a nuisance in many ways.

519
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:15,259
He's just your match.

520
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,170
You heard her. You're a nuisance.

521
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,670
I've been put off by you
for a long time,

522
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,500
so take your mom and go
before I call the police.

523
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:30,809
No. I'm going to wait
until you aren't mad anymore.

524
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:35,250
I'm not leaving
until you take me back.

525
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,480
- Then, what?
- I'll live here.

526
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,750
Have you lost your mind?

527
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,990
So, Yu Jin said
she was Hyesung's daughter?

528
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,460
Yes.

529
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,230
Yu Jin wouldn't do that.

530
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,700
Did she really say that herself?

531
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,970
Why would I make that up?

532
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,869
Gosh, should I call her
and have a three-way talk?

533
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,940
So? What do you want?

534
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:08,009
It's obviously money, Yeo Jin.

535
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,480
I want money,

536
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,680
and I want to be your in-law.

537
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,519
"In-law?"

538
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,019
Hey, that's not something
you can wish for.

539
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:20,990
They already broke up.

540
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,329
Why would she want to marry a man...

541
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:24,160
- who came back for her money?
- It's not easy...

542
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:26,900
for me to accept
a daughter-in-law with a kid.

543
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,099
My son is just all over her,

544
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,799
so I'm offering to accept her
with great generosity.

545
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:35,509
I'll sign an agreement
if you agree to keep...

546
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:37,569
my daughter's secret.

547
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,180
Fine.

548
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:42,250
My secretary will reach out.

549
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,880
And I'll ask Yu Jin...

550
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:47,720
if we'll be in-laws or not.

551
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,450
Please leave.

552
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,289
Let's do that.

553
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:54,319
Gosh, the chairwoman is
so easygoing.

554
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,859
- Hey! Let go of me!
- Please, Ha Na.

555
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
- Let go of me!
- Stop harassing my auntie!

556
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,329
Let her go!

557
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:04,430
No, I won't. I won't let you go
until you agree to date me again.

558
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:10,039
Eun Chong, I'll be your dad.

559
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,109
No! Let my auntie go!

560
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,980
What's with you?

561
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:18,750
Hey, I let her go.
I let your auntie go, okay?

562
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,980
Don't cry.

563
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,549
I adored you so much. Don't cry.

564
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:25,289
Seok Ki, put him down.

565
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,460
No, I don't want to. Never.

566
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,789
Where are you going?

567
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,230
Put him down right now! Hey!

568
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,099
- You.
- Go away. No!

569
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:41,240
No. I'm not putting him down.

570
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,009
Say that you'll marry me.

571
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,079
If you don't,
I'll jump out with Eun Chong.

572
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,140
Auntie Ha Na...

573
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,609
Seok Ki, I understand.

574
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,579
So, come down. We'll talk later.

575
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54,650
Say that you'll marry me.

576
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,049
Fine. I will.

577
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,589
So, put Eun Chong down first. Okay?

578
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,990
Please!

579
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,720
What are you doing?

580
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,190
Put my grandson down right now!

581
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,630
"My grandson?"

582
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,099
(Cinderella Game)

583
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,500
You can proceed with Eun Chong's adoption
without telling anyone.

584
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,799
I have something to say.

585
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,869
I should adopt Eun Chong myself.

586
00:33:17,869 --> 00:33:20,000
Why do you choose
to take this that far?

587
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,799
How will Chairwoman Shin respond
when she finds out?

588
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,539
I heard it came from you.

589
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:24,740
I'll find out
after the investigation.

590
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,279
I'll never have to kneel
before someone petty like you.

591
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,849
Mr. Hwang,
I can be honest with you, right?

592
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:32,119
- Does she think she's Yoon Yu Jin?
- What?

593
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,650
Just wait, Mr. Goo. I'll also expose
your hideous true nature...

594
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:37,150
very soon.
