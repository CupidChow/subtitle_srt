00:00:04,274 --> 00:00:05,745
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:18,795 --> 00:00:22,765
Yeo Jin, Yu Jin will surely come home.

3
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:24,095
Of course.

4
00:00:24,934 --> 00:00:26,165
My Yu Jin...

5
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:30,205
will come back.

6
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,344
Myung Ji, you should go back home with Se Young.

7
00:00:37,345 --> 00:00:40,344
No, we should go back together when Yu Jin returns.

8
00:00:40,345 --> 00:00:42,385
Se Young must've had a tough time today.

9
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:43,815
You should go home with her.

10
00:00:58,265 --> 00:01:00,605
Wait, what are you talking about?

11
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:01,905
I...

12
00:01:03,504 --> 00:01:05,534
lied to Uncle Sung Ho.

13
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,744
I knew Yu Jin was on a boat,

14
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:10,845
but I said I didn't know.

15
00:01:11,774 --> 00:01:13,515
You saw her...

16
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,685
get on a boat?

17
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:18,284
Yes.

18
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:20,754
It's all my fault.

19
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:22,355
What do you mean...

20
00:01:23,355 --> 00:01:24,754
it's all your fault?

21
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:28,265
I was wearing her hat, and...

22
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:31,065
Stop crying and speak clearly.

23
00:01:35,634 --> 00:01:38,274
I was wearing her hat,

24
00:01:38,405 --> 00:01:40,405
but it flew away in the wind.

25
00:01:41,345 --> 00:01:43,105
Then, it landed on that boat.

26
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,514
So, Yu Jin and I...

27
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:47,515
got on the boat trying to get it back.

28
00:01:47,845 --> 00:01:50,113
What time did that happen?

29
00:01:50,114 --> 00:01:52,185
As soon as we arrived by the sea.

30
00:01:52,715 --> 00:01:55,354
Why didn't you tell your uncle at that time?

31
00:01:55,355 --> 00:01:58,053
If you had told him, we would've found her right away.

32
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:00,725
What were you thinking when you made up that lie?

33
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:04,433
Why did you do this? Why?

34
00:02:04,434 --> 00:02:06,295
I tried to tell him,

35
00:02:07,364 --> 00:02:08,635
but I got scared.

36
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:11,635
Yu Jin was weird.

37
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,445
She wouldn't even budge.

38
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,575
I shook her around, but she wouldn't open her eyes.

39
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:19,344
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,084
"She wouldn't even budge?"

41
00:02:23,515 --> 00:02:25,515
There was a room on that boat.

42
00:02:26,385 --> 00:02:28,084
She hid there...

43
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:30,654
while I was it,

44
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:33,594
and she probably slipped down the stairs.

45
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,434
Uncle Sung Ho wasn't nearby...

46
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:40,135
when I came to get him.

47
00:02:40,804 --> 00:02:44,175
Later on, he found me and asked where Yu Jin was,

48
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,744
so I got scared.

49
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:50,575
The boat was already leaving.

50
00:02:57,785 --> 00:02:58,915
Mommy.

51
00:03:00,355 --> 00:03:01,785
What will happen to her?

52
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,554
We can find her, right?

53
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:06,925
Of course.

54
00:03:08,265 --> 00:03:09,494
She'll be fine.

55
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:13,635
You didn't tell anyone else...

56
00:03:15,105 --> 00:03:16,665
what you just said, did you?

57
00:03:17,235 --> 00:03:18,334
No.

58
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:20,644
Okay. Good job.

59
00:03:21,274 --> 00:03:22,344
Good job.

60
00:03:26,114 --> 00:03:29,844
Do not share this with anyone even in the future.

61
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:33,825
Forget everything you told me.

62
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:41,425
Se Young, listen closely to what I'm about to say.

63
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:44,934
You didn't know anything.

64
00:03:45,765 --> 00:03:48,804
You didn't see her get on that boat.

65
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:52,035
She was in the car...

66
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:53,575
when you went to the restroom.

67
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:55,904
While you were gone,

68
00:03:56,774 --> 00:03:58,644
Yu Jin disappeared all by herself.

69
00:03:59,144 --> 00:04:00,714
What you said to Uncle Sung Ho was right.

70
00:04:00,985 --> 00:04:03,955
You never lied. Do you understand?

71
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:08,655
Do you understand?

72
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,895
- Okay. - Good.

73
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:16,295
Do everything as I say from now on.

74
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:20,235
Even if Yu Jin comes back and tells the truth,

75
00:04:20,735 --> 00:04:22,335
you have to keep saying it isn't true.

76
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,675
You did not put her hat on,

77
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:29,175
and you did not get on the boat with her.

78
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,845
That's the only way we'll be fine.

79
00:04:33,475 --> 00:04:36,285
It'd be the end of us if Aunt Yeo Jin found out.

80
00:04:37,355 --> 00:04:38,485
Do you...

81
00:04:39,785 --> 00:04:42,655
understand what I mean?

82
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,454
- Okay. - Good.

83
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,014
Gosh, it's cold.

84
00:05:40,985 --> 00:05:42,943
What? Look at this girl.

85
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,554
Hey, why are you sleeping here?

86
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,453
My goodness. Your hands are as cold as ice.

87
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:51,624
Hey! Come on out!

88
00:05:51,754 --> 00:05:53,054
Goodness, little one.

89
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,134
She could've faced the worst due to hypothermia.

90
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,304
Thank you.

91
00:06:02,564 --> 00:06:04,034
It's all thanks to the weather.

92
00:06:04,035 --> 00:06:07,443
I felt dizzy, and my heart raced to think that she could've died...

93
00:06:07,444 --> 00:06:10,275
if the temperature had dropped any lower than this.

94
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:14,244
She was severely malnourished,

95
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:16,485
and I saw bruises as well. What's going on?

96
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:20,114
She fell while playing and bruised herself,

97
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,354
and she was malnourished because of her poor appetite.

98
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,654
She wouldn't eat anything even if there was food in front of her.

99
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,655
It breaks my heart.

100
00:06:27,364 --> 00:06:30,465
Her condition isn't normal.

101
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:32,394
She hasn't grown as much as her peers.

102
00:06:32,395 --> 00:06:35,003
She's just particular. What do you expect me to do?

103
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:36,235
I didn't give birth to her.

104
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,203
We were also stressed out...

105
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:40,275
adopting and raising her!

106
00:06:49,184 --> 00:06:50,613
- "A hat?" - Yes.

107
00:06:50,614 --> 00:06:52,655
A child's hat was found on the boat.

108
00:06:53,355 --> 00:06:55,025
Is this your daughter's hat?

109
00:06:57,025 --> 00:06:58,924
Yu Jin...

110
00:06:58,925 --> 00:07:00,624
Yes, that's Yu Jin's hat.

111
00:07:01,165 --> 00:07:03,965
What about her? Where is she?

112
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,665
Please find Yu Jin for us.

113
00:07:07,304 --> 00:07:09,835
She's fine, right?

114
00:07:10,064 --> 00:07:12,105
Please say it is so.

115
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:13,704
Do you have any updates?

116
00:07:13,804 --> 00:07:16,504
(The police for the people, staying true to the basics.)

117
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:18,645
We found...

118
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,785
the shipowner's dead body on the boat.

119
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:26,085
A dead body?

120
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:27,954
Your daughter hasn't been found yet.

121
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:30,823
We're still searching, so give us a little more time.

122
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:33,155
- We'll do our best to find her. - Honey.

123
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,645
It's all my fault.

124
00:08:23,574 --> 00:08:25,675
I tried to tell him,

125
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:27,885
but I got scared.

126
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:30,915
Yu Jin was weird.

127
00:08:31,285 --> 00:08:32,655
She wouldn't even budge.

128
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:35,854
I shook her around, but she wouldn't open her eyes.

129
00:08:36,885 --> 00:08:38,995
Did she lose consciousness?

130
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:47,434
What if Yu Jin returns and tells the truth?

131
00:08:48,804 --> 00:08:51,234
They'll be suspicious of Se Young no matter how hard...

132
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:52,974
she denies it.

133
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:58,074
Yeo Jin won't sit on her hands if she finds out.

134
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,444
What do I do?

135
00:09:02,844 --> 00:09:04,155
Have they heard anything yet?

136
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,824
Is this Seongbuk Police Station?

137
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:15,723
I'm calling about Yoon Yu Jin,

138
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,534
a girl who went missing yesterday. I'm the aunt.

139
00:09:17,535 --> 00:09:19,495
I was wondering if you had heard anything.

140
00:09:21,505 --> 00:09:22,564
What?

141
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:26,834
Her hat was found on the boat?

142
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:29,505
Then, what about her?

143
00:09:33,074 --> 00:09:36,214
"The shipowner's dead body?"

144
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,885
What about Yu Jin?

145
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:43,255
All right.

146
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,665
The shipowner died.

147
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:55,035
So, Yu Jin isn't likely to return alive, either.

148
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,344
Mommy.

149
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:08,484
What is it?

150
00:10:08,745 --> 00:10:10,385
Why? Do you need something?

151
00:10:11,054 --> 00:10:13,354
Has Uncle Sung Ho called?

152
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:14,984
Not yet.

153
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:18,995
Se Young, come here and have a seat.

154
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:25,934
Brace yourself, Se Young.

155
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:28,804
Yu Jin...

156
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,704
may not return.

157
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:34,344
Why not?

158
00:10:35,245 --> 00:10:36,974
Did Yu Jin die?

159
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:44,015
It was unfortunate for her to get into this accident.

160
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,824
But there are things you can't do anything about.

161
00:10:48,885 --> 00:10:50,724
Even if Yu Jin doesn't return,

162
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:52,395
it's not anyone's fault.

163
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,094
Yu Jin was just unlucky.

164
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:00,094
What will happen to her, Mommy?

165
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,304
It is heartbreaking.

166
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:11,675
But she did everything because she wanted to.

167
00:11:12,944 --> 00:11:14,645
She was the one who wanted...

168
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:17,385
to go to the island.

169
00:11:18,214 --> 00:11:19,314
But...

170
00:11:20,314 --> 00:11:22,584
if I hadn't suggested we get on that boat...

171
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:23,995
Stop talking about that.

172
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:25,755
It wasn't your fault.

173
00:11:26,925 --> 00:11:29,995
Did you force her to get on the boat?

174
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:33,895
Did you tell her to pick up the hat that flew away?

175
00:11:35,464 --> 00:11:37,165
You two were on the boat together,

176
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:40,035
and she was the only one who slipped down the stairs.

177
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,344
It's her fault for slipping down. Don't you think so?

178
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,714
So, you didn't do...

179
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,354
anything wrong.

180
00:12:02,425 --> 00:12:04,694
I saw lots of bruises and wounds on your body.

181
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,265
How did it happen?

182
00:12:11,434 --> 00:12:14,005
I'm fine. I'm not in pain anymore.

183
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,045
I thought you were asleep in your room.

184
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:19,615
Why did you leave quietly in the middle of the night?

185
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:22,114
You startled me so much.

186
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,214
There, there.

187
00:12:23,645 --> 00:12:24,854
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,824
If the door was locked, you should've yelled and asked for help.

189
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,724
You're such a foolish girl.

190
00:12:32,755 --> 00:12:35,025
We received a report of child abuse.

191
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:36,665
"Child abuse?"

192
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,635
Did you see me abuse her?

193
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:41,164
Who was it? Who reported me?

194
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:43,164
Was it you? Or you?

195
00:12:43,165 --> 00:12:46,433
We pay so much attention and raise her with utmost care!

196
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:48,145
Child abuse?

197
00:12:48,675 --> 00:12:49,905
Ha Na, you tell them.

198
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:51,274
Did we abuse you?

199
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,374
Did we starve you? Did we force you to stay up?

200
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,544
Did we ban you from going to school?

201
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,414
Or did we beat you up?

202
00:12:56,415 --> 00:12:58,385
How on earth did we abuse you?

203
00:12:58,785 --> 00:13:01,184
Don't just sit there and tell them.

204
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:04,425
This was why people said you shouldn't adopt.

205
00:13:04,594 --> 00:13:07,665
Did you think I brought you up to hear people say this to me?

206
00:13:07,964 --> 00:13:09,324
Good grief. This is so unfair.

207
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,895
Who do I need to talk to for injustice like this one?

208
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,535
It's all right, so you can be honest.

209
00:13:16,104 --> 00:13:17,733
Yes, tell her.

210
00:13:17,734 --> 00:13:19,333
What didn't we do for you?

211
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,745
What did we do wrong?

212
00:13:21,604 --> 00:13:23,074
You hit her yesterday, too.

213
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:24,944
What?

214
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,175
I recorded everything here.

215
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,583
I didn't hit her!

216
00:13:30,584 --> 00:13:33,053
I just pushed her a little.

217
00:13:33,054 --> 00:13:34,384
How is that child abuse?

218
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:37,854
Child abuse is something she has done to my kid.

219
00:13:38,125 --> 00:13:39,324
Look at this.

220
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,764
She almost burned my kid to death with hot water,

221
00:13:41,765 --> 00:13:44,794
so I just knuckled her head a few times. That's not abuse.

222
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,764
I just tried to discipline her,

223
00:13:46,765 --> 00:13:48,664
but you'd call that child abuse?

224
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:50,504
Then, you should never tell people to adopt!

225
00:13:50,505 --> 00:13:52,905
- There, there. - Please come with me.

226
00:13:53,035 --> 00:13:54,244
Let go of me.

227
00:13:54,245 --> 00:13:56,904
I didn't do anything wrong. Let go of me!

228
00:13:56,905 --> 00:13:59,474
Let go! Hey! Let go of me!

229
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,584
It's all right, so tell me the truth.

230
00:14:04,015 --> 00:14:05,954
What will happen to me...

231
00:14:06,655 --> 00:14:08,084
if I tell the truth?

232
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,285
Will I have to go back to a children's home?

233
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:13,354
Do you not want to go there?

234
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:15,525
What do you want to do, Ha Na?

235
00:14:54,665 --> 00:14:55,734
Hello.

236
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:58,004
You should go home.

237
00:14:58,005 --> 00:14:59,875
We'll contact you as soon as we receive more updates.

238
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,545
We've sent out a helicopter to search for her,

239
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,245
so please trust us and go home.

240
00:15:14,885 --> 00:15:18,125
Honey, I'll stay here. You should go home.

241
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,724
I can't leave Yu Jin here and go back.

242
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:23,795
Yu Jin...

243
00:15:25,064 --> 00:15:27,035
She's a brave girl.

244
00:15:27,265 --> 00:15:28,704
I know she's alive.

245
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:31,704
I'll do whatever it takes to find her,

246
00:15:31,934 --> 00:15:33,104
so go home.

247
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:37,275
- You should escort her back. - Yes, sir.

248
00:15:49,354 --> 00:15:52,354
The owner here was an old man who passed away with dementia.

249
00:15:52,694 --> 00:15:56,194
All kinds of strangers come and go from his empty house,

250
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:58,035
so it's an eyesore to this town.

251
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,094
They asked me to get rid of this as soon as possible.

252
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:02,733
He had a daughter.

253
00:16:02,734 --> 00:16:05,275
It had been a while since I heard from her.

254
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:09,244
She didn't even show up at her father's funeral.

255
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,344
Goodness.

256
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:12,943
What? What was that sound?

257
00:16:12,944 --> 00:16:14,073
- I wonder. - What?

258
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:15,285
- Goodness. - What's that sound?

259
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:22,385
Who are you?

260
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,694
What are you doing in this empty house?

261
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:28,193
It's been loud around here with stray cats all over this place,

262
00:16:28,194 --> 00:16:30,165
and you were that stray cat!

263
00:16:32,564 --> 00:16:34,703
I'm not a stray.

264
00:16:34,704 --> 00:16:36,135
Do you know this place?

265
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,635
You have no shoes, and you don't look all right.

266
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,905
You're right.

267
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,875
Wait, isn't she the old man's granddaughter?

268
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:50,745
Remember? His daughter came with a young girl a few years ago.

269
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:53,255
She looks like her.

270
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:55,155
Gye Sook's daughter?

271
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:58,325
Hey, are you Gye Sook's daughter?

272
00:16:58,694 --> 00:17:01,294
Is this your grandfather's place?

273
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:05,534
Where's your mom? Why are you here alone?

274
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:09,305
Did you know that he passed away?

275
00:17:10,605 --> 00:17:12,034
Where's your mom?

276
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,175
My gosh. She's driving me crazy.

277
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:19,543
She had no idea her father died,

278
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:22,244
so she left her girl here and just left.

279
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,815
Goodness, that evil woman.

280
00:17:25,155 --> 00:17:26,415
Oh, my.

281
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,325
Goodness.

282
00:17:29,885 --> 00:17:30,984
My gosh.

283
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:42,365
Why won't you tell the truth?

284
00:17:42,805 --> 00:17:43,805
She keeps harassing you...

285
00:17:43,806 --> 00:17:46,135
because you stay quiet even after she beat you like that.

286
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:49,675
It's all right. I don't mind it.

287
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:50,974
What's all right?

288
00:17:51,815 --> 00:17:54,044
When you're in pain, you need to cry out loud.

289
00:17:54,214 --> 00:17:55,915
That's the only way people will know it hurts.

290
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,514
You have no idea.

291
00:17:58,254 --> 00:18:00,384
What don't I know?

292
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:01,484
I need...

293
00:18:02,754 --> 00:18:04,494
Mom and Dad.

294
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:08,365
I don't care if they beat me or abuse me.

295
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,994
I need Mom and Dad.

296
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:14,294
It's better to have...

297
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:18,234
that kind of family than living alone.

298
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:32,115
All right. Look here.

299
00:18:32,754 --> 00:18:33,854
Stop it.

300
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,385
- Say something to Hwang Jin Goo. - Stop filming me.

301
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:40,524
- Come on. - Stop filming me.

302
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:44,895
- Tell me. - Stop filming me.

303
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:47,835
Stop filming me.

304
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:53,003
- Say something. - Stop filming me.

305
00:18:53,004 --> 00:18:54,105
Come on.

306
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:57,145
Stop filming me.

307
00:19:00,675 --> 00:19:02,944
- No. - Stop filming me.

308
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:28,175
Goodness, how did this little one lose her memories?

309
00:19:30,075 --> 00:19:32,344
Gye Sook must've come to abandon her to her father...

310
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:34,274
because she didn't want to raise her.

311
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:35,885
Goodness.

312
00:19:57,105 --> 00:19:58,805
Hello? Yu Jin?

313
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:04,004
No.

314
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:53,155
You can have this.

315
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,825
You said it was pretty last time.

316
00:20:55,194 --> 00:20:58,135
- Can I really? - I'll also give you this hat later.

317
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:08,875
Yu Jin!

318
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:13,675
Yu Jin, why are you crying?

319
00:21:13,974 --> 00:21:15,244
Aunt Yeo Jin.

320
00:21:17,044 --> 00:21:18,585
Where have you been, my baby?

321
00:21:18,684 --> 00:21:20,684
I've been looking everywhere for you.

322
00:21:25,194 --> 00:21:26,625
Didn't you miss me?

323
00:21:27,524 --> 00:21:30,825
I thought about you to death.

324
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:34,234
Why won't you say anything?

325
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,135
You must be in shock.

326
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:38,734
You poor thing.

327
00:21:39,504 --> 00:21:40,734
You poor girl.

328
00:21:42,044 --> 00:21:45,115
Yu Jin. My Yu Jin.

329
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:46,815
Goodness.

330
00:21:47,274 --> 00:21:50,315
Yeo Jin, what's wrong?

331
00:21:50,645 --> 00:21:52,684
She's Se Young, not Yu Jin.

332
00:21:56,325 --> 00:21:57,585
Se Young?

333
00:22:00,254 --> 00:22:01,394
Where's Yu Jin?

334
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:03,365
She was with you.

335
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,963
Why did you let Yu Jin get on that boat all alone?

336
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:07,794
What were you doing?

337
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,405
Yeo Jin! Calm down.

338
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,273
Calm down.

339
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:17,675
Se Young went to the restroom and didn't see anything.

340
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:20,375
She doesn't know anything, Yeo Jin.

341
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:27,014
You should've kept an eye on Yu Jin.

342
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,585
Why did you leave her and go to the restroom alone?

343
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:32,395
Mommy...

344
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:36,365
Yes, there, there. It's all right.

345
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:39,194
Your aunt is just having a tough time.

346
00:22:42,305 --> 00:22:45,234
Yeo Jin, you must brace yourself...

347
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,105
in times like these.

348
00:22:48,444 --> 00:22:51,944
That way, you're going to find her.

349
00:22:52,274 --> 00:22:53,345
I can...

350
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:56,145
find Yu Jin, right?

351
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:58,885
Of course.

352
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:02,724
So, stay strong, Yeo Jin.

353
00:23:12,694 --> 00:23:14,395
Sir, please, I beg of you.

354
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:17,604
I'll pay as much as you want, so please help me.

355
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:19,374
The money isn't the problem. We'll get into an accident.

356
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:22,305
The wind is too strong over there, so we can't sail that way.

357
00:23:22,744 --> 00:23:25,415
I'm sure you have children, too.

358
00:23:25,575 --> 00:23:28,815
I don't even know if my young daughter is...

359
00:23:29,244 --> 00:23:30,614
alive or dead right now.

360
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:32,154
Please help me.

361
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:33,655
Mr. Yoon!

362
00:23:34,284 --> 00:23:36,983
I got a call that we found a girl who seemed to be your daughter.

363
00:23:36,984 --> 00:23:38,493
Please come and confirm.

364
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:39,595
Is that so?

365
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,165
Really? Where are you?

366
00:23:43,395 --> 00:23:44,734
I'll be there, too.

367
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:46,234
I'll check...

368
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,034
and call you, so wait at home.

369
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:51,973
I'll bring her back to Seoul if that girl is Yu Jin.

370
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,675
I need to see her myself.

371
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,404
Yeo Jin, you should leave it up to Sung Ho.

372
00:23:56,405 --> 00:23:58,915
You'd get there too late even if you left right now.

373
00:23:59,244 --> 00:24:00,345
Really?

374
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:03,944
Then, call me as soon as you confirm.

375
00:24:04,954 --> 00:24:06,014
Sung Ho.

376
00:24:07,385 --> 00:24:08,825
It must be her, right?

377
00:24:11,425 --> 00:24:12,555
I believe it, too.

378
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,125
So, call me as soon as possible.

379
00:24:17,264 --> 00:24:19,964
Did they find a girl who was similar to Yu Jin?

380
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:23,234
Yes, it must be her.

381
00:24:23,335 --> 00:24:24,464
I know it's her.

382
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,204
I need to go and get her.

383
00:24:28,704 --> 00:24:31,615
Sung Ho can do that.

384
00:24:33,145 --> 00:24:35,885
What a relief, Yeo Jin.

385
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,355
Yu Jin, my baby.

386
00:24:41,925 --> 00:24:43,484
Come home to Mommy.

387
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:51,694
Yu Jin.

388
00:24:53,494 --> 00:24:56,034
Yu Jin.

389
00:24:57,034 --> 00:24:58,175
Mr. Yoon.

390
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:01,744
Where's Yu Jin?

391
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,944
We found this girl.

392
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:08,915
You found this girl?

393
00:25:10,815 --> 00:25:12,555
We found her in a nearby town.

394
00:25:12,714 --> 00:25:14,684
She must've lost her speech because of shock.

395
00:25:15,355 --> 00:25:18,425
No, she's not Yu Jin.

396
00:25:18,754 --> 00:25:20,355
She's not Yu Jin.

397
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:23,065
- Yu Jin. - Mr. Yoon!

398
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:24,594
- Mr. Yoon, calm down. - Yu Jin.

399
00:25:24,595 --> 00:25:26,335
Please find Yu Jin.

400
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:28,933
- Yu Jin. - Sir, you can't do this here.

401
00:25:28,934 --> 00:25:30,504
Officer, please.

402
00:25:30,734 --> 00:25:33,575
Please find Yu Jin.

403
00:25:33,905 --> 00:25:36,374
Please find her. Please.

404
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:37,944
Please find Yu Jin.

405
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:40,914
Please find Yu Jin. Please?

406
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:44,145
Please find her. Please find Yu Jin.

407
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:50,024
Why won't he pick up?

408
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:52,524
- How long has it been? - Twenty minutes.

409
00:25:53,754 --> 00:25:55,293
I should call the police station.

410
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:58,125
Yeo Jin, let me do it.

411
00:25:58,494 --> 00:25:59,865
You should take a seat.

412
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:04,034
Yu Jin must be fine, right?

413
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:05,434
Everything must be okay.

414
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:07,874
She wouldn't be injured or anything, right?

415
00:26:07,875 --> 00:26:10,544
Hello? Is this the police station?

416
00:26:11,105 --> 00:26:14,574
This is Yoon Yu Jin's family calling.

417
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,914
I heard you found a girl who seemed to be Yu Jin.

418
00:26:16,915 --> 00:26:18,415
Have you confirmed everything?

419
00:26:19,815 --> 00:26:20,954
Hello?

420
00:26:21,385 --> 00:26:23,954
It was Yu Jin, right? Was it her?

421
00:26:28,155 --> 00:26:29,524
It wasn't her?

422
00:26:31,895 --> 00:26:33,034
What are you...

423
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:36,934
Why wasn't it her?

424
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:41,534
Did you confirm everything properly?

425
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:43,774
Did you turn a blind eye to her even after you saw her?

426
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:45,815
Where's my husband?

427
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:47,645
Did my husband confirm this?

428
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:51,315
Your husband said she wasn't your daughter.

429
00:26:55,954 --> 00:26:57,425
Goodness, Yeo Jin.

430
00:27:09,805 --> 00:27:12,875
What will happen to the girl if the mom is out of reach?

431
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:15,405
She'd be sent to a children's home.

432
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:19,315
If you get in touch with her mother, please call the police.

433
00:27:19,875 --> 00:27:21,014
Sure.

434
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,145
Goodbye, now.

435
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:27,585
Goodbye.

436
00:27:28,184 --> 00:27:30,454
- Goodness, poor thing. - Drive safely.

437
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:40,494
Good grief.

438
00:27:40,835 --> 00:27:43,105
She has many ways of gaining people's sympathy.

439
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:44,763
Why would you pity her?

440
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:46,734
I'd pity myself even more.

441
00:27:50,544 --> 00:27:51,645
You're so adorable.

442
00:27:57,214 --> 00:27:59,014
Thank you for everything.

443
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:03,954
Good grief. "Thank you?" My foot.

444
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:06,895
Have a good life.

445
00:28:08,194 --> 00:28:10,125
I won't take you back even if you return.

446
00:28:10,665 --> 00:28:11,835
Let's go.

447
00:28:16,034 --> 00:28:17,135
Let's go, Ha Na.

449
00:28:28,714 --> 00:28:29,915
Wait!

(Taesarang Seongmo Hospital)

451
00:28:38,754 --> 00:28:39,925
You can have this.

452
00:28:41,865 --> 00:28:43,224
What is this?

453
00:28:43,395 --> 00:28:44,964
That bracelet will bring you good luck.

454
00:28:45,294 --> 00:28:47,064
Why are you giving this to me?

455
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:48,534
I don't need it anymore.

456
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:50,234
I'll have surgery very soon.

457
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:53,774
"Surgery?" Then, you'll need this more.

458
00:28:53,905 --> 00:28:56,944
A really good doctor will operate on me, so I'll be fine.

459
00:28:57,605 --> 00:28:59,815
It won't be as good as family,

460
00:29:00,675 --> 00:29:02,684
but it'll keep you safe when you're in trouble.

461
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:05,385
Stay strong.

462
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:07,615
And goodbye.

Thank you.

465
00:29:23,264 --> 00:29:24,734
I hope your surgery goes well, too.

466
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:31,504
Well, Jin Goo is about to go into surgery,

467
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:34,815
so I wanted to thank the chairwoman before that.

468
00:29:37,214 --> 00:29:39,815
What do you mean, an accident?

469
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:43,625
I see.

470
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:46,925
Then, please thank her for us, Secretary Choi.

471
00:29:49,694 --> 00:29:50,994
What's going on?

472
00:29:58,434 --> 00:29:59,974
Hello, Myung Ji.

473
00:30:00,734 --> 00:30:02,405
Is something going on with Chairwoman Shin?

474
00:30:02,704 --> 00:30:03,905
Secretary Choi said...

475
00:30:04,004 --> 00:30:05,574
Did you not hear anything?

476
00:30:05,575 --> 00:30:07,414
That's why I'm calling you.

477
00:30:07,415 --> 00:30:09,244
Then, pretend like you don't know anything.

478
00:30:10,044 --> 00:30:12,984
Anyway, good luck with the surgery. Goodbye, now.

479
00:30:16,224 --> 00:30:17,655
What's going on?

480
00:30:19,294 --> 00:30:22,524
Did something happen to the chairwoman's daughter?

481
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:35,674
- Ms. Officer. - Yes?

482
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:36,805
I want to pee.

483
00:30:37,345 --> 00:30:39,645
Is that so? One moment.

I'm scared.

497
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:23,203
Yu Jin won't come back.

498
00:33:23,204 --> 00:33:24,904
I'll always be alone.

499
00:33:24,905 --> 00:33:26,815
We're very special sisters,

500
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:29,414
so we'll be connected at heart even when we're apart.

501

Everything will be yours if you do this right.

503
00:33:35,754 --> 00:33:37,783
I'll make it happen.

504
00:33:37,784 --> 00:33:39,095
It's all your fault.

505
00:33:39,454 --> 00:33:41,524
