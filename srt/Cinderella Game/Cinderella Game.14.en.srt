1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,040
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:07,580
(Episode 14)

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,009
Wait!

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,519
Please take another elevator.

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:14,150
It's all right.

8
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,219
- Get in.
- Right. Thank you.

9
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:32,039
Wait, we met
at the restaurant, right?

10
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:33,439
Right.

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,509
Do you work for Hyesung Tour?

12
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,409
Yes.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,479
Can you recommend
a place to travel to?

14
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,850
Who are you traveling with?

15
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,619
Alone.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,619
Where could a lonely
and melancholic person go?

17
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,429
If you felt lonely and melancholic,

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,700
wouldn't it be better
to spend time...

19
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:02,170
with your family and friends
instead of traveling?

20
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:06,540
Should you say that
as an employee of a travel agency?

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,640
I didn't mean you shouldn't travel.

22
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,079
The meal may be the same,

23
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,010
but something that tastes
just all right alone...

24
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:16,510
somehow tastes oddly delicious
when you share it...

25
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,849
with your family or friends.

26
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,079
You don't feel so empty anymore.

27
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,719
So, I hope you visit...

28
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,730
a nice place with people you like.

29
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,599
I'm back.

30
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,170
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

31
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,739
- Sure. Here it is.
- Thank you.

32
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,739
- Ms. Goo.
- Yes?

33
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,950
- How do you feel?
- Sorry?

34
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,680
We all went through this trouble
because of Head Director Goo.

35
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,650
Your brother just ruined
his older sister's workplace.

36
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:58,159
How does it feel? I'm just curious.

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,219
"Older sister?"

38
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,659
What did Mr. Goo say?

39
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,099
You wouldn't say anything
even if he said something.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,030
Well, you wouldn't betray
your younger brother...

41
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,800
for a workplace you were at
for just a few days.

42
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,069
I couldn't tell you that,

43
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,939
yes, my younger brother
will destroy Hyesung Tour.

44
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,479
I'm employed by Hyesung Tour,

45
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,280
so I will work for Hyesung Tour.

46
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:28,250
I hope you don't hold
a prejudiced opinion...

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,419
just because Director Goo
and I are siblings.

48
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
So, work is strictly work?

49
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:34,830
Yes, and I'll also assume
the same attitude.

50
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,159
What can I do next?

51
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,699
It had been almost a week
since I started.

52
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:39,830
I told you to wait.

53
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,729
Yes.

54
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:43,840
Where are you going?

55
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,870
- You told me to wait.
- I did.

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,569
I told you to wait.

57
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,680
I didn't dismiss you.

58
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,240
Right.

59
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,379
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

60
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,090
Why do you keep wriggling around?

61
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm trying to work,
and you're getting on my nerves.

62
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:06,259
Fine, harass me all you want.
You still can't break me.

63
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:08,729
No rain, no flowers.

64
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,430
How dare you exhale?
You're disgusting.

65
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,969
Am I not even allowed to breathe?

66
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:19,500
You just defiled...

67
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,069
the air I breathe with your breath.

68
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,409
Is this a rebellion?

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,379
Come to think of it,
you're just like your brother.

70
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,150
You both love rebellions, don't you?

71
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,580
Are you glaring at me?

72
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,849
What's going on, Ms. Yoon?

73
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,319
Chairwoman Shin,
what brings you here without a call?

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,729
You're here, Chairwoman Shin.

75
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,430
- Please come inside.
- Sure.

76
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,810
Wait, was she the chairwoman
of Hyesung Group?

77
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,870
She is.

78
00:03:57,909 --> 00:04:00,280
Why did I say something like that
to the chairwoman?

79
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,879
She may think I don't qualify
as a guide and fire me.

80
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,680
Is she here because of
the hotel's contract cancellation?

81
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,949
- Why did Director Goo do that?
- Tell me about it.

82
00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:11,689
I never imagined...

83
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:14,629
he could do something so cruel
with such kind looks.

84
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,730
Ms. Goo, is Director Goo Ji Seok
really your younger brother?

85
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,730
- Is he really your brother?
- Yes.

86
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,439
- No way.
- No way.

87
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,139
Anyway, why did he do that
to his older sister's workplace?

88
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,980
I heard Hwang Jin Goo
managed to find the rooms he needed.

89
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,709
He must have a trustworthy reputation
in the field.

90
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,449
I guess so.

91
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,990
What about Mr. Jung Man Soo?

92
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,959
Settle the case with his attorney.

93
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,990
Chairwoman Shin's side
became suspicious...

94
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,430
that someone was behind him
after he hired an attorney.

95
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,259
- If you try to settle the case...
- They'll grow even more suspicious.

96
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,529
- Are you sure about this?
- It'll be fine.

97
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,439
I saw the chairwoman
meeting someone discreetly...

98
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,439
out of the office.

99
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,470
She must've been
digging your back...

100
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,139
or doing something
about her lost daughter.

101
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,939
Let her find the girl...

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,009
if she wants to be the cause
that makes her daughter more miserable.

103
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,649
You think Hanguk Hotel's
new investor is behind this?

104
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,790
They changed
all their subcontractors, too.

105
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,920
Is that so?

106
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,259
I heard the chairman's son
went to America...

107
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,490
before they broke the ground
because of financial difficulty.

108
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,259
And their subcontractors did protest
when they weren't paid.

109
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,699
One of the clauses
on our contract says,

110
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,069
"Duty to notify when there is
a change of subcontractors."

111
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,870
We can use this to raise a problem.

112
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,970
Do we have to consider...

113
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,279
Hyesung Hotel's cancellation
only as a coincidence?

114
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,209
I am suspicious
of Director Goo Ji Seok.

115
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,149
We can make our judgment
after we hear from him.

116
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,060
Ms. Goo, you should meet her.

117
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,759
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin
of our group.

118
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,560
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

119
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,660
I apologize for not recognizing you.

120
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,230
I'll take note of your words.

121
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,670
Goodness, Ms. Chairwoman.
That was...

122
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,040
You should get back to work.

123
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,439
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,310
What did she say to you?

125
00:06:17,449 --> 00:06:19,420
Where do you think is
a good place...

126
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,519
for a lonely and melancholic person
to travel to, Ms. Yoon?

127
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:25,990
Everyone has different preferences,

128
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,329
so it'll depend on the person
and their situation.

129
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,060
Mr. Hwang?

130
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,199
A place
where they can take a rest...

131
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,300
while sharing good food with family,
friends, or someone they love.

132
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,300
Who they're with is more important
than a particular location.

133
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,540
A destination for those
who are lonely and melancholic.

134
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,939
That's not a bad theme to work with.

135
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,180
It's not so bad.

136
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,879
Yes, it was her, right?

137
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,550
She presented the mother-daughter therapy
at the interview, right?

138
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,790
I thought she was eliminated
for taking up an illegal gig.

139
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,819
You remembered her.

140
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,019
I was going to tell you
when I reported on the Dubai contract.

141
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,329
We sealed the deal under the premise
Ms. Goo will take charge.

142
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,189
That was why I gave her a job.

143
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,199
How did they know who she was?

144
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,230
Ha Na, if you have any questions...

145
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:11,040
or need help, let me know anytime.

146
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,439
What? Okay.

147
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,740
Ha Na, we were colleagues
who started together.

148
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,180
Love for your colleagues is
love for your country...

149
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,939
and your workplace.

150
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,279
You both sound so awkward.

151
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:25,079
Ha Na, you already know, right?

152
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,319
I was the only one
who treated you...

153
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,019
without prejudice.

154
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,160
Sure.

155
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,430
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

156
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,899
The chairwoman's beauty
must be timeproof.

157
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,269
She has such clear skin
even though she's over 60.

158
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,910
She may look great on the outside,
but her inside must be miserable.

159
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:51,980
She has a sad story
of losing her only daughter...

160
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,410
a long time ago.

161
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,680
She lost her daughter?

162
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:58,920
Settle the case?

163
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:02,089
That homeless man now has
an attorney and settlement money?

164
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,519
After Jung Man Soo's
family business went down,

165
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,230
his family had to spread out.

166
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,259
But recently,
they were finally reunited.

167
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,399
He made it too easy to notice
someone was behind him. It's odd.

168
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,069
I already said
you wouldn't settle the case.

169
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,800
He that would eat the fruit
must climb the tree.

170
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,540
Let's keep an eye on him
and see how he responds.

171
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,310
Summon Head Director Goo.

172
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,180
I'm sorry. The chairwoman called,
so I needed to go immediately.

173
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
It must be about the contract cancellation
with Hyesung Tour.

174
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:36,190
She probably wanted to see you
for the same reason.

175
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,019
You should meet her first.

176
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,460
I'll wait.

177
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,000
I want to sell our hotel rooms
at a better price.

178
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:54,710
Even if Hyesung Tour
gives us lots of business,

179
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:56,909
it won't mean a lot
if the unit price is too low.

180
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,309
Insisting on holding a partnership
just because of our affiliation...

181
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:02,649
is more like friendship
than business.

182
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,679
I plan to attract VIP guests
who pay a higher price per room.

183
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,220
I want to connect directly
with international businesses...

184
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,559
and create synergy
for our advancement overseas.

185
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,690
That's all great,
but if you disregard tradition...

186
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,559
and push forward
aggressively all alone...

187
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,700
I thought...

188
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,700
you'd like it done aggressively
because it was your tactic.

189
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,870
There was a line
you shouldn't cross in business.

190
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,639
The relationship must be
founded on basic trust.

191
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,710
Then, you find the proper timing
to implement aggressive strategies.

192
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,909
Hyesung Tour trusted us.

193
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,679
That wasn't how
you should cancel the contract.

194
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,350
I was disappointed in you.

195
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,990
Then, was everything
you have done to this day...

196
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,889
always within the line?

197
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:45,289
Recant the cancellation.

198
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:49,860
From now on, you will consult me
before making any decisions.

199
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,929
I make the calls and orders
as the chief officer of the hotel.

200
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,330
- Remember that.
- Yes, ma'am.

201
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:01,009
The intruder
of your appointment ceremony...

202
00:10:01,009 --> 00:10:02,409
offered a settlement
through his attorney.

203
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,980
How much should I demand?

204
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,509
Are you willing to settle?

205
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,309
- No.
- Then, why...

206
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:10,820
I can guess how powerful
the hand behind him is...

207
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:13,149
by offering the amount
for the settlement.

208
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,250
You won't settle anyway,
so you should go big.

209
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,120
What if he accepts it?

210
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,960
Is there someone you believe is...

211
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,960
behind everything?

212
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,100
I don't know.

213
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,429
You can't remember...

214
00:10:29,169 --> 00:10:30,500
because there are so many of them...

215
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,340
and you find them all insignificant.

216
00:10:34,169 --> 00:10:35,570
You don't have to mind it.

217
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,110
I wasn't asking for your opinion.

218
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,980
Yes, ma'am.

219
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,379
The police will handle the case
if she refuses to settle.

220
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,250
Will Mr. Jung be all right?

221
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,190
He'll hang in there.

222
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,490
Do you believe
there is no chance of settling?

223
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,289
I'll make her do it.

224
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:58,460
And to do that,
we need a strong variable.

225
00:10:59,629 --> 00:11:00,730
Such as?

226
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:02,169
Chairwoman Shin's daughter...

227
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,299
suddenly showing up,

228
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,639
although it's impossible.

229
00:11:09,139 --> 00:11:12,379
I'll tell Zero to report back
if anything extraordinary happens.

230
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,950
Has President Hwang called?

231
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,149
No, sir.
He probably left after waiting.

232
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,250
He'll be there.

233
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,789
It's now lunch.

234
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,649
Do you want to bet?

235
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,929
It's my win.

236
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,929
Yes, sir.

237
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,230
You were still here.

238
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,639
I said I'd wait.

239
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,340
My talk with the chairwoman
took a while.

240
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,440
I thought you'd leave
by the time it was lunch.

241
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,909
You should go eat.

242
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:44,710
It's not a big deal to skip a meal.

243
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,480
Let's go inside.

244
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,350
Come in.

245
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,019
I apologize for the shock yesterday.

246
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,559
Thankfully, I heard
you managed to find enough rooms.

247
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,299
Are you really sorry?

248
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,500
I am.

249
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,299
But I don't regret it.

250
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:12,940
Would the situation have changed
if I gave you a forewarning?

251
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,070
I thought you had basic manners
for the subsidiary...

252
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,210
who partnered with you in business,

253
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,080
but I must've overestimated you.

254
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,509
I didn't have basic manners.

255
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,519
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:26,519
I admit that
my process is rather rough.

257
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:28,289
Let's cut to the chase.

258
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,929
If another place offered
a better price than Hyesung Tour,

259
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,100
would it be a win-win situation for us
to hold fast to Hyesung Tour...

260
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,240
just because it was our subsidiary?

261
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,000
The deal is only sweet
for Hyesung Tour.

262
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,039
What's sweet is honey.

263
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,639
We've had our share
of tough moment with Hyesung Hotel,

264
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,980
although there's no use
in sharing this now.

265
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,450
We're here to do business,
so you should take the better offer.

266
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,289
It's a shame to break a long partnership
with Hyesung Hotel,

267
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,860
but we'll use it
as a chance to change.

268
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,490
The chairwoman asked me
to recant the cancellation.

269
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,230
But if that's what you want,
I won't need to do that.

270
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,460
I'll report back to her.

271
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:16,500
I want to ask you something.

272
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:21,240
Were you behind
Hanguk Hotel's decision?

273
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,779
You didn't try to change my mind,
so I thought you were the cool type.

274
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,809
But you have an impatient side.

275
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,879
You'll find out in time.

276
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:32,019
I don't think I'll need more time.

277
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,350
I felt relieved to know
you seemed to be reasonable.

278
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,789
It's always reasonable
to follow the trend.

279
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,590
And I'm the current trend.

280
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,789
But trends don't stay the same.

281
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,399
We'll see.

282
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,070
Hanguk Hotel and Hyesung Hotel...

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,399
What's next?

284
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,039
The Dubai deal?

285
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:55,440
You love jumping to a conclusion.

286
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,070
What if that conclusion was right?

287
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,440
Do you want to bet?

288
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,009
I'll bet my presidency
of Hyesung Tour.

289
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,149
I'm the head director.

290
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,419
I'll bet Hyesung Tour, too,
if that's what you want.

291
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,950
I'm in.

292
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,559
We're canceling the contract?

293
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,399
Yes, cancel all reservations
with Hyesung Hotel at this time.

294
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,730
- But we're affiliated.
- This is bad.

295
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,129
Don't be alarmed.

296
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,100
We'll find a way around this.

297
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,500
- Come in, Ms. Yoon.
- Yes.

298
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,879
I thought he went
to come to an agreement.

299
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,919
Mr. Hwang isn't the type
who'll call the contract off.

300
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,779
It looked like Mr. Goo was
set on ending this.

301
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,490
Do you know anything, Ha Na?

302
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,019
- Have you heard anything?
- No.

303
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,490
Does he really plan
to destroy Hyesung Tour?

304
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,929
This is bad.

305
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,129
We'll find another hotel.

306
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,799
Great decision.

307
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,899
He wanted to call it off,
and we weren't that desperate.

308
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:01,210
Did he make you stand out there
just to say that?

309
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:03,970
He has so many ways
of messing with you.

310
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,940
He must've been behind
Hanguk Hotel, too.

311
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,950
If my guess is correct,
he's trying to destroy the travel agency.

312
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,519
Why would he destroy
the travel agency?

313
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,750
His excuse will be that
he wants to focus on the hotel business.

314
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,149
Who knows what else he's after?

315
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,659
We can't just sit around, then.

316
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:19,190
Tell the chairwoman right away.

317
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,259
Don't get worked up.

318
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:23,429
They gave us a blow first,
so we'd hit them once, too.

319
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:26,460
I always liked something more dramatic
than playing it safe.

320
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,929
I've played too safely until now.

321
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,769
And that security wasn't free.

322
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,269
Everyone knew you worked hard
after taking up the travel agency.

323
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:36,639
Back then,
I had such a fun time working.

324
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:39,009
I should warm up slowly.

325
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,610
Is this situation fun for you?

326
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,320
I began to feel motivated
whenever Mr. Goo irritated me.

327
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:48,490
- Am I a pervert?
- You're impossible.

328
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,389
Should I meet this punk?

329
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,899
I can't barge into his office, so...

330
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,570
Right.

331
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,399
His older sister was
working for Se Young.

332
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,710
Should I take advantage of her?

333
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,509
Take a look at this.

334
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:16,179
I made this blanket.

335
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,480
"Blanket?"

336
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,019
It's for Jin Goo and Se Young.

337
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,490
I made it with light cotton,

338
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,690
so it'd feel unbelievably warm,

339
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,259
and it'd help them sleep better.

340
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,259
Se Young is rather sensitive, right?

341
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,330
It's because she doesn't get
enough good sleep.

342
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,629
She's not sensitive.

343
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,429
Bang Ul,
you don't have to pull it out.

344
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,940
Cotton can't be too light anyway.

345
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,110
Se Young can't sleep under anything else
except goose down.

346
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,809
She'd feel too stifled.

347
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,240
No one uses
cotton blankets these days.

348
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,980
It needs to carry some weight
to help you sleep better.

349
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,649
No, thanks. You can use it.

350
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,450
I guess I will.

351
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,029
Hey, the chairwoman found them...

352
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:04,859
a newlywed home,

353
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,200
so I wanted to fill it
with some furniture.

354
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,230
Everything was built in,
so you wouldn't need to.

355
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,700
The just need a bed,
a sofa, and a sound system.

356
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,470
All right.
Write down whatever they need.

357
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,240
What about the wallpaper
and the flooring...

358
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,450
It's an apartment complex,
so they don't need that.

359
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,420
Se Young just wants to hang
a few paintings on the wall.

360
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,289
Don't be like that.

361
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,190
Jin Goo was a talented guy...

362
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,930
with a perfectly good parent.

363
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,799
They'll need dishes
and utensils, though.

364
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,130
How can your tacky taste
be enough for Se Young...

365
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:47,769
Well, the chairwoman said
she'd get everything for them.

366
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:50,710
Would you like a cup of tea?

367
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,039
Here.

368
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,779
Here. Have some, Bang Ul.

369
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,119
It tastes bitter.

370
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,730
Clean it well.

371
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,299
If it's not clean,
I won't give you 50 cents.

372
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:18,869
I am cleaning it.

373
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,099
All done.

374
00:18:21,099 --> 00:18:22,769
I just need to pour some sawdust.

375
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,910
Let me put the treadwheel up first.

376
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,579
Eun Chong, you're really good.

377
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:30,910
It's not even a big deal.

378
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,900
Hey, what's going on, kids?

379
00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:04,680
Hello? Yes, ma'am.

380
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,119
Did something happen to Eun Chong?

381
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:13,259
I'm sorry. All right.

382
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,660
Mr. Yoon,
is Ms. Yoon out of the office?

383
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,900
I don't know. Why?

384
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,430
I was wondering
if I could take a leave.

385
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll call her.

386
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:29,910
She won't pick up?

387
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,740
If you're in a hurry, you can go.

388
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,809
I'll tell her.

389
00:19:33,509 --> 00:19:34,710
Thank you.

390
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,960
- What are you cooking?
- What do you mean?

391
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,769
Please walk on by.

392
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,400
I don't care
if you block me off like this,

393
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:00,640
but don't mess
with Jin Goo's future.

394
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,769
If you want your revenge,
do it personally.

395
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:05,380
Don't play dirty
and cause a commotion at work.

396
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,779
"Revenge?"

397
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,180
I already said
I had zero feelings about you.

398
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,819
I'm only doing my job.

399
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:15,650
Do you want me to get my revenge?

400
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:18,690
Is that a sort of regret?

401
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,859
If not, then never mind.

402
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,529
Keep your emotions under control.
Someone might catch you.

403
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:34,240
Hey, Hwang Jin Goo was
an interesting man.

404
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,069
I get what you see in him.

405
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:48,150
(Teacher's Room)

406
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,160
(1. I will walk your dog
for 50 cents an hour.)

407
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,329
It had been a few days
since Eun Chong...

408
00:20:57,329 --> 00:20:58,759
gave this out to his friends.

409
00:21:00,099 --> 00:21:01,700
I'm sorry, ma'am.

410
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,099
I should've paid
more attention to him.

411
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:06,869
He's a thoughtful kid.

412
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,970
He cares a lot about you, too.

413
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,839
I felt moved
after seeing this flyer.

414
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,950
(1. I will walk your dog
for 50 cents an hour.)

415
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,920
Who gave you 50 cents?

416
00:21:25,019 --> 00:21:27,789
Ji Soo. I cleaned her shoes.

417
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:29,589
I'm not mad.

418
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,630
You can lift your head up.

419
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:37,569
You can be honest with me.

420
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,670
I have a great job now,

421
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,339
so I can buy the toys you want.

422
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:44,170
That wasn't the reason.

423
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,779
Then, why did you do that?

424
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,750
Hello, General Manager.

425
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,220
When does your hotel
finish remodeling?

426
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:55,619
Why don't you sign with us
when that's done?

427
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:56,650
(President Hwang Jin Goo)

428
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,289
We're having tourists from Dubai
starting next month,

429
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,789
two hundred teams a year.

430
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:03,160
I'm certain.

431
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,099
You already heard
about Hyesung Hotel?

432
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,430
Not all subsidiaries
turned out to be on the same side.

433
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,039
That's why
you're getting this chance.

434
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,240
Let's talk in person soon.

435
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,240
Bye.

436
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:25,119
I'll sign with every hotel
except for Hyesung Hotel.

437
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:29,089
Hey, Lee Eun Chong! Where are you?

438
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,589
What brings you here?

439
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:32,160
Look at this.

440
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,829
He's such an embarrassment
to this neighborhood.

441
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,190
I thought I took everything down.

442
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,059
- Where did you find it?
- You knew about this?

443
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,259
Keep it down.

444
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,799
I just found out today.

445
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,640
How can I stay quiet?

446
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,410
It's like making a seven-year-old
go out and beg for money.

447
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:52,680
Don't you know I dread
looking pathetic the most?

448
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,509
I saw a few women
reading this and laughing at it.

449
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,349
What's going on?

450
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,089
Why are you here?

451
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,089
What? What's this?

452
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,029
Lee Eun Chong!
Where are you? Get over here!

453
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,390
Leave him alone.

454
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,559
I asked him a few times,
but he wouldn't tell me.

455
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,529
That little kid is
already obsessed with money?

456
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,740
My gosh, he's charging
50 cents for everything.

457
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,799
This was why he asked...

458
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,839
how many 50 cents he needed
to make 5 dollars.

459
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:25,079
What's this about five dollars?

460
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:29,180
No idea.
Is that how much a new toy costs?

461
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,049
- It wasn't because he wanted a toy.
- Then what?

462
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,049
Why would this 7-year-old need
5 dollars?

463
00:23:34,349 --> 00:23:37,190
- I doubt he meant 50,000 dollars.
- Wait, 50,000 dollars?

464
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,259
How much
did you extort from Seok Ki?

465
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,390
There's more than
the 50,000-dollar bank loan, right?

466
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:44,829
Why won't he come out?

467
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,200
Kongkong, you understand, right?

468
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:55,109
I just wanted to help Auntie Ha Na.

469
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,349
Eun Chong.

470
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,349
You must...

471
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,619
answer me honestly.

472
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,190
Were you trying to make...

473
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,160
the five dollars to pay...

474
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,460
Mr. Seok Ki back?

475
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,049
- Auntie...
- Don't cry.

476
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,029
Here. You can have the drumstick.

477
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,000
You can eat it.

478
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,769
Eat it while the offer stands.

479
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,799
You worked hard to make money.

480
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:01,970
I only made 50 cents.

481
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:06,279
Eun Chong, I paid everything back.

482
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,609
- Really?
- Yes.

483
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,150
Mr. Seok Ki's mom...

484
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,819
won't come here again.
No, she can't.

485
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,519
Where did you get the money?

486
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:17,789
Do you remember
Uncle Ji Seok giving me money?

487
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,390
- You saw it, right?
- Yes.

488
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,089
I paid everything back
with that money.

489
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,759
Uncle Ji Seok gave me
a lot of money.

490
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,230
I see.

491
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,329
You should've shared this with us.

492
00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:32,299
A little kid like you
shouldn't worry about making money.

493
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,470
Tell me about it.

494
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,309
But don't you think
50 cents is way too cheap?

495
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,609
You were always hogging the phone,
so I thought you had a girlfriend.

496
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,480
Eun Chong, what did I say?

497
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,619
Adults were supposed
to worry about money.

498
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,490
You don't have to worry about that.

499
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,319
If something like this
happens again,

500
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:55,089
I will get mad.

501
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,359
- I'll be very scary.
- Okay.

502
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,869
I just need to know
that you care that much about me.

503
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,700
Will you do this again or not?

504
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,839
I won't.

505
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,339
It's a promise.

506
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:09,940
I promise.

507
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:11,880
It's a promise.

508
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,450
If you felt lonely and melancholic,

509
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,660
wouldn't it be better
to spend time...

510
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,960
with your family and friends
instead of traveling?

511
00:26:28,059 --> 00:26:29,589
The meal may be the same,

512
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,529
but something that tastes
just all right alone...

513
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,799
somehow tastes oddly delicious
when you share it...

514
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,299
with your family or friends.

515
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,430
You don't feel so empty anymore.

516
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,940
Did you make this?

517
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,940
What do you think?

518
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,250
It looked crudely made.

519
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,680
No way. Take a good look.

520
00:26:52,349 --> 00:26:53,680
It still looks like it to me.

521
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,059
I worked so hard to make this,
imagining you drinking tea with it.

522
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,359
It does look rough and simple,
kind of homey.

523
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,730
Isn't that so?

524
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,799
Anyway, what's this teacup?

525
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,170
It's for our baby.

526
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,799
You already made one
for our nonexisting baby?

527
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,809
What do you mean, already?
We can make a baby now.

528
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,539
Let's drink tea later.

529
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,480
Why don't we make the baby first?

530
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,279
My gosh. Stop it.

531
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,609
Let's have tea.

532
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,220
Let's be together for a long time,
enjoying tea with one another.

533
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,759
What are you up to, Yeo Jin?

534
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,930
You still had these?

535
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,539
I figured you threw out
everything he made...

536
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,569
and thought it was unfortunate.

537
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,670
But you left these behind.

538
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,309
It was wonderful to see
the two of you...

539
00:27:54,309 --> 00:27:56,049
sharing tea together in love.

540
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,980
She must still have feelings
for her husband.

541
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:03,819
I couldn't throw it away
because of the baby teacup.

542
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:07,789
It must've reminded you of Yu Jin.

543
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,529
I keep seeing her in my dreams,

544
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,559
and it's always the same.

545
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,400
My goodness.
What was the dream about?

546
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,140
(1. I will walk your dog
for 50 cents an hour.)

547
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,579
I'm sorry.

548
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,950
I made your son
do something like this.

549
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,619
But you know what, Du Na?

550
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,890
I was a little happy
because of Eun Chong.

551
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,359
May I feel that way?

552
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:57,869
Ms. Goo.

553
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,579
I am your direct superior.

554
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:03,049
How dare you leave early
without my permission?

555
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:04,910
I'm sorry, Ms. Yoon.

556
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,180
You weren't in the office,
so I called you,

557
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,990
- but you didn't pick...
- You're so unruly.

558
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,220
Why did you go
to your nephew's kindergarten?

559
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,759
Does he not have a mom or dad?

560
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,089
What's going on?

561
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,430
You need to report to me directly...

562
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:22,900
when you want to leave early
or take the day off.

563
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:24,400
Yes.

564
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,069
Did something happen to your nephew?

565
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:28,400
It wasn't a big deal.

566
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:30,670
It must've been serious
if you had to leave early.

567
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,880
This doesn't concern you, Mr. Hwang.

568
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:35,980
Well, okay. I'm glad.

569
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,519
Go easy on her, Ms. Yoon.

570
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,160
- Ms. Goo!
- Yes?

571
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,960
I'm suddenly getting chills.

572
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,990
Go to my place and pick up a coat.

573
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,099
It's the violet-colored one
in my closet.

574
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,329
Okay.

575
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:02,670
The real estate market is dead,
so I'm out of money, too.

576
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,480
You need to stop this.

577
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,740
You can't say that to me.

578
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,339
I can expose everything.

579
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:11,480
The only daughter of Hyesung Group,
Yoon Yu Jin...

580
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,049
You need to wait.

581
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:21,559
Yeo Jin said
she kept dreaming of Yu Jin,

582
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,960
and this punk
began to call me more often.

583
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,359
What the heck is going on?

584
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,170
This is so irritating.

585
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:36,240
Who is it?

586
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,940
Yes, hello.

587
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,240
I work with Ms. Yoon Se Young,

588
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,980
and I'm here to run her errand.

589
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,450
Hello.

590
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:53,359
She told me to bring her coat.

591
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,559
Which one?

592
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:57,759
She said she had
a violet-colored coat in the closet.

593
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,029
- Go to the second floor.
- Yes, ma'am.

594
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,049
What are you doing over there?

595
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,450
I'm sorry.

596
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,950
The door was opened,
so I thought this was the room.

597
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,390
Good grief.

598
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,160
Wait here.

599
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:32,160
Okay.

600
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:39,339
I haven't seen you before.
What's your name?

601
00:31:39,869 --> 00:31:41,670
My name is Goo Ha Na.

602
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:45,480
I see. She's a Goo.

603
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,410
She's Goo Ji Seok's older sister?

604
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,089
Did the chairwoman's family
include a little girl?

605
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:08,430
She has a sad story
of losing her only daughter...

606
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,900
a long time ago.

607
00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:15,640
Is that the room
for the chairwoman's lost daughter?

608
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,119
(Cinderella Game)

609
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,750
Do you know Richard Han?

610
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,589
He's suspecting us
as Hanguk Hotel's investors.

611
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,430
An envelope with money went missing?

612
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:10,789
What's wrong?

613
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:14,230
Only you saw me
putting this envelope into my drawer.

614
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,000
Wait, why was this in my bag?

615
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,039
We can't let her get kicked out
by taking false blame as a thief.

616
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,569
Can you think of a way?

617
00:33:20,869 --> 00:33:23,339
You seem like a real heiress
after acting like one for a while.

618
00:33:23,339 --> 00:33:25,240
So, people can get better
at talking nonsense.

619
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,940
Has the real heiress died?

620
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,579
Someone who went missing
seemed to be my Yu Jin?
