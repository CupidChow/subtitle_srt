1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,209
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,209 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,339
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,950
(Episode 32)

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:20,690
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,289
Ms. Goo!

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,269
One moment.

8
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,399
- That woman...
- That's enough, Mr. Hwang.

9
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,210
You've crossed the line
a long time ago.

10
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:38,539
I was a bit shaken and nervous for
a bit after hearing about my mom,

11
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,210
and I even got hopeful.

12
00:00:41,109 --> 00:00:42,810
But I find everything annoying now.

13
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,880
You can meet her.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:46,420
You can meet that woman.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,490
She'll meet me?

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,259
Yes, when do you want to do it?

17
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:54,289
She'll meet you when you want to.

18
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,530
Tomorrow.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,310
Auntie Ha Na!

20
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,209
You washed up already?

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,750
Yes, Grandpa helped me wash up.

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,519
Thank you.
And you picked him up, too.

23
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:23,560
He bought me fish cake, too.

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:24,890
Did he?

25
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,790
I'm sorry. We became such a nuisance
as soon as you moved in.

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,959
It's all right.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,430
If it's okay, may I pick him up
whenever I'm free?

28
00:01:35,230 --> 00:01:37,769
We'd feel too sorry, though.

29
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,340
It's great for me, actually.
I won't feel lonely if I'm with him.

30
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,969
It's great for you, too.

31
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,640
Well, yes.

32
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,299
A woman who may be my birth mother?

33
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:17,740
Mom, Dad.

34
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,009
Even if she didn't turn out
to be my birth mother,

35
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,050
I should still meet her, right?

36
00:02:24,949 --> 00:02:28,789
And I should do
the parentage test, too, right?

37
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,669
Hey, Eun Chong.

38
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,009
You can polish shoes?

39
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,979
Yes, do you want me to polish
your shoes, too?

40
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:55,509
Later.

41
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,349
Are you going somewhere?

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,120
I have to meet someone.

43
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:07,629
It must be something important.
You're wearing that dress.

44
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,060
Is it a date?

45
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,560
Grandpa, isn't Auntie Ha Na pretty?

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,729
The chairwoman of her workplace
bought that for her.

47
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:17,340
Really?

48
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,870
Eun Chong, you polished my shoes?

49
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,740
Thank you.

50
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,789
She's here.

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,139
Ms. Chairwoman.

52
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,509
Ms. Goo.

53
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,870
Thank you for coming.

54
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:03,050
Yes, the chairwoman was that woman.

55
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,189
The woman
who may be your birth mother.

56
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,779
May I hold you in my arms?

57
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:38,550
Yes.

58
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,269
I'm sorry. I got ahead of myself.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,110
It's all right.

60
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,720
The two women who just walked in
went to a private room, right?

61
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,850
Are you with them?

62
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:17,990
Which room did they go to?

63
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,709
It was hard to tell because
you were too young in the picture.

64
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,550
But I think I can still see
some resemblances.

65
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,050
I've never seen my photos
when I was this young.

66
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,490
The chairwoman...

67
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,420
lost her daughter by the sea
when she was seven.

68
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,160
"By the sea?"

69
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,800
Then, I don't think
I'm who you're looking for.

70
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,569
I lost my father in a fire
when I was seven,

71
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:05,269
then sent to a children's home.

72
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,939
She thought your father might not
have been your birth father,

73
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,639
but someone who saved you
at the time of your disappearance.

74
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,879
No, he's my birth father.

75
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,750
My foster parents were
my dad's friends.

76
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,889
But they didn't see you
at the time of birth.

77
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,290
They may not have known.

78
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,029
I wanted to do the test first
because of my situation.

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,829
I couldn't risk
any rumors to fly around.

80
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:35,629
I'd like to apologize
if that made you sad.

81
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,370
It's all right.

82
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:43,839
I will do the test.

83
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,079
Thank you.

84
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:53,379
Did you bring
your hair or your toothbrush?

85
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,050
Yes.

86
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,160
It usually takes 2 to 3 days,
but I'll ask them to speed it up.

87
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:02,160
All right.

88
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,399
Let's eat together.

89
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,399
Okay.

90
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,240
Darn it. I can't hear anything.

91
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,170
Let's just go.

92
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,509
Everything would be over
if we got caught.

93
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:21,910
But we're here already.
Let's find out who she's with.

94
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,149
Who did she have to meet
immediately...

95
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,220
as soon as her video call
got postponed?

96
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,360
Did she hear something from Sung Ho?

97
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,389
Why are you so sure
that it's not about Yu Jin?

98
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,660
I know that instinctively.

99
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,629
Can we sit around
with our faith in your sixth sense?

100
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,569
We've done well so far
with your trust in me.

101
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:45,740
That was the case until now,
but it might not be in the future.

102
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,269
Don't jinx it.

103
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,149
Yes, the CCTV.

104
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,449
We can look at the CCTV footage.

105
00:07:58,379 --> 00:07:59,649
Get up. Now.

106
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:01,750
What if we go outside now
and get caught?

107
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,889
Just come out.

108
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,819
Yoon Se Young and her mother are
tailing Chairwoman Shin?

109
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,990
Where is Chairwoman Shin right now?

110
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,199
She went to a restaurant
on the outskirts of Seoul.

111
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,800
- With who?
- She came with Ms. Jang.

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,029
I'll find out whom she met
when they come out.

113
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:17,939
If she had to postpone
the video call...

114
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:19,870
and got Yoon Se Young
and her mother to tail her,

115
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,740
it must be about her daughter.

116
00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:23,810
Keep an eye on them
until they walk out.

117
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:29,180
What do your other siblings do
other than Head Director Goo?

118
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,750
My younger sister works
at the reception desk for Hyesung Hotel,

119
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,389
and my younger brother will graduate soon
as a culinary arts student,

120
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,759
so he's on practical training
at Hyesung Group's cafeteria.

121
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:42,889
They all work for Hyesung Group.

122
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:45,399
We definitely have a connection.

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,029
I guess so.

124
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,000
(My Home)

125
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,909
Please take it.

126
00:08:58,779 --> 00:08:59,940
Thank you.

127
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,750
Hello?

128
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,750
Hey, Eun Chong.

129
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,850
Where are you, Auntie Ha Na?

130
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,549
I'm eating lunch at a restaurant.

131
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,919
With who?

132
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,990
The chairwoman we met last time.
You know her, right?

133
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:15,759
Yes, my best friend?

134
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,399
Yes, your best friend.

135
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,929
May I talk to him?

136
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,669
Eun Chong, one moment.
Let me put the chairwoman on.

137
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,980
Hello?

138
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,840
Hey, it's you, Ms. Chairwoman.

139
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,980
Hello.

140
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,379
Hi. Have you been well, Eun Chong?

141
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,389
Yes, what about you?

142
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:44,389
Granny hadn't been too well...

143
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,360
because I missed you too much.

144
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:49,889
I've been well, too.

145
00:09:51,559 --> 00:09:54,600
Why can't we meet
even though we're best friends?

146
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,929
You should come over to our place!

147
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,240
- Should I?
- Yes.

148
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,039
Ms. Chairwoman.

149
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:10,279
Okay. I'll put your auntie on.

150
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,820
Hey, Eun Chong.
I'll be home after lunch.

151
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,960
- Should I get something?
- I want fish buns.

152
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,559
All right.
I'll bring fish buns home. Bye.

153
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,399
Right! Gosh. I forgot to tell her
about our new bidet.

154
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,340
Eun Chong must love fish buns.

155
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,139
You should get a good amount
and give it to her.

156
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:40,480
It's all right.

157
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,080
It's for Eun Chong,
so please don't turn it down.

158
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,980
Thank you.

159
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,919
He told me to visit him at home,
so could I really do that?

160
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,519
Of course.

161
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:55,460
But you'd be surprised
at how humble my place is.

162
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,730
Did she meet Ms Goo
to talk about Eun Chong?

163
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:05,570
Gosh, there are so many buttons.

164
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,679
It was like a water gun.

165
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,549
That bidet just hazed you.

166
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,120
One moment, Eun Chong.

167
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,720
What is this? Tushy warmers?

168
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,820
You're here.

169
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:29,860
Yes, it's me.

170
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,259
Have you found
where Chairwoman Shin is?

171
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,570
Yes, she went into a restaurant.

172
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,269
Danny is on standby outside.

173
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,799
- Let's stop here.
- Something important happened,

174
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,309
so she even had
to postpone the video call.

175
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,409
She recently went
to the children's home,

176
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,080
so it must be about her daughter.

177
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,210
That was why Yoon Se Young
and her mother tailed her.

178
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,480
Yoon Se Young and her mother
tailed her?

179
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,389
Yes, the two would suffer the most
if her daughter showed up.

180
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,159
If they saw Yeo Jin
meeting with Ms. Goo,

181
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,830
she could expose Eun Chong, too.

182
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,590
Sir?

183
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,600
Listen up.

184
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:09,399
You adopted your friend's son
despite your tough situation.

185
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,730
That's amazing.

186
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,169
Not really.

187
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:17,269
I wanted to adopt him
before he went to school,

188
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,710
but I couldn't.

189
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,850
He doesn't exactly have
a legal guardian.

190
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,080
Is it because
he doesn't have his parents?

191
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,320
It's a long story.

192
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,360
Tell me.

193
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,129
While my friend was
pregnant with him in America,

194
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,360
his dad got caught up
in an unfortunate accident...

195
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,000
and passed away.

196
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,340
After that, she said she seemed
to be tailed and surveilled on.

197
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:51,379
She didn't want
Eun Chong to fall into danger,

198
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,450
so she came to Korea in secret
to give birth to him.

199
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,779
She felt too uneasy about everything
and couldn't register his birth,

200
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,320
then passed away in an accident.

201
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:06,159
Ms. Chairwoman.

202
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:09,860
I shouldn't have said that.

203
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,169
I'm sorry. I've become
quite emotional with age.

204
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:19,100
I feel bad for both Eun Chong...

205
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,570
and his mother.

206
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,009
I'll try to find out
if there's anything I can do to help.

207
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,620
Thank you.

208
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:35,690
Regardless of the test result,

209
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,019
I'd like to remain friends with you
from now on.

210
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,289
Okay.

211
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:44,090
I'd be very grateful,
and it'd be a huge honor.

212
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,470
Ms. Chairwoman,
why don't we call it a day?

213
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,200
Okay.

214
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,039
Thank you for coming.

215
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:56,070
- See you later.
- Okay.

216
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,480
We looked through everything
until five minutes ago.

217
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,779
- Do you have another door here?
- Yes, the back door.

218
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,720
It's only for the staff,

219
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,850
but the bus stop is closer
to the back door on the map,

220
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:12,960
so some people come in that way.

221
00:14:13,059 --> 00:14:14,990
Please show me
the CCTV footage for that door, too.

222
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,659
The CCTV by the back door
broke down.

223
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,830
You must've seen the customers
in room one, right?

224
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,899
How many people were there?

225
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,299
I don't know.

226
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,309
Come on.

227
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,080
I know you do. Right? Now, tell me.

228
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,850
My goodness.

229
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,320
Is that an accident?

230
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,120
Wait, could it be my car?

231
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,759
Good grief.

232
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,759
Mom, be careful. Aunt Yeo Jin...

233
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,669
Yeo Jin.

234
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,110
What brings you here?

235
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,909
I thought you were
going to the temple.

236
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,279
The road to the temple froze,
so she decided to turn back.

237
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:12,720
She wanted to eat lunch
since we were out already.

238
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:18,120
We came for a drive
to spend some mother-daughter time.

239
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,289
We wanted to make
many memories before her wedding.

240
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,899
If I had known,
we could've come together.

241
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,559
Mom, your car.

242
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,169
Goodness, what's with me?

243
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,970
It sounded like my car alarm.

244
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,570
Please take your time.

245
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,909
I'll be outside, Aunt Yeo Jin.

246
00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:44,980
Se Young and Myung Ji didn't see
Ms. Goo or Jin Goo, right?

247
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,649
No, they left through the back door
before us.

248
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:50,120
I'll heighten the security.

249
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,320
Wait.

250
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,899
Where did they just walk out of?

251
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,440
We're here.

252
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:13,080
I thought about it on my way here,
and I doubt she was my mom.

253
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,279
It's weird that
my dad may not be my real dad,

254
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,850
and I didn't feel anything
when I saw the photo.

255
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,220
I also have no recollection
of growing up with a rich family.

256
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Your memories could've been
erased or modified...

257
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,929
as you went through
your disappearance and that fire.

258
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:31,460
I still doubt it.

259
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,960
Why do you think it won't be true?

260
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,330
What if she turns out
to be your biological mom?

261
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,470
I doubt it.

262
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,440
Do you not want her as your mother?

263
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:43,669
It's not that.

264
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,309
I didn't want to be disappointed.

265
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,850
There's one thing I envy
about Ms. Yoon.

266
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:55,389
That she has a mother
who'll do anything...

267
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,149
for her daughter.

268
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,889
And your mother, too.

269
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,659
The one who gave birth to you was...

270
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,230
probably someone who could
do anything for you, Ms. Goo.

271
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:10,170
And that woman
may be the chairwoman.

272
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,839
What is it?

273
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,609
Well, I felt happy
just to imagine that.

274
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:21,549
It'd be a huge deal.

275
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:23,250
I'd be like Cinderella overnight.

276
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,990
You could be that Cinderella.

277
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,259
I really hope
the chairwoman finds her daughter.

278
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,690
When she held my hand and hugged me,

279
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,759
she seemed so moved,

280
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,759
as if she was with her daughter,
although I was a nobody.

281
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:43,529
I almost cried with her.

282
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,970
Do you want to make a bet?

283
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,339
If you are her daughter,
what will you do for me?

284
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,480
I'll give you ten dollars.

285
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,940
You'll give me ten dollars
after becoming Hyesung's daughter?

286
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:57,480
You're rather stingy for Cinderella
who moved up the social ladder.

287
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,650
Then, 100 dollars.

288
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,250
So, you really have
zero expectations.

289
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:06,420
What will you do for me
if I'm not her daughter?

290
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,759
Whatever you want.

291
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:09,460
You have no idea what I want.

292
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,660
Tell me anything.

293
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,500
I'm serious.

294
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,759
I bet 100 dollars on this.

295
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,869
I'm serious, too.

296
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,299
You won't lose anything,
so tell me whatever you want.

297
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,670
I'll think about it
and let you know.

298
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,839
You don't believe me, do you?

299
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:29,710
Thank you for coming today.

300
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,680
Please relax
as you wait for the result.

301
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,950
Okay.

302
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,660
Thank you for putting this together.

303
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:42,529
I apologize for getting mad at you,
although I had no information.

304
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,730
The chairwoman asked me to do this.

305
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,759
You don't have to thank me.

306
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,430
- You should go.
- Okay.

307
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,970
Goodbye.

308
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,910
She has zero expectations.

309
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:03,910
She's too unambitious.

310
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,789
But she'll believe it
once she sees the test result.

311
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,160
She'll have to.

312
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,500
- Goodness.
- Ta-da!

313
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,029
Is that a bidet?

314
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,069
Isn't it a surprise
to have a tushy warmer at home?

315
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,269
Mr. Han bought this
as his move-in gift.

316
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:27,569
He did?

317
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,769
Well, it was to treat
his hemorrhoids,

318
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,809
but we use the bathroom together,
so we got to enjoy it, too.

319
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,880
It was so nice
to feel warm in the butts, Auntie.

320
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,319
Hey, my man. Where?

321
00:19:51,329 --> 00:19:53,059
Goodness, sir.

322
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,029
We feel like we owe you so much.

323
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,900
You painted the vegetable garden,

324
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,200
picked up Eun Chong,
and gave us that bidet, too.

325
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,369
I got it because I needed it,
so there was no pressure.

326
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,680
But still.

327
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:08,049
Anyway, come
and have some fish buns with us.

328
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:09,680
This way, please.

329
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:11,980
All right! Fish buns.

330
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:17,750
Gosh, there are
1, 2, 3, and 4 fish buns.

331
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,319
Your bestie bought it for you.

332
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,089
The chairwoman is awesome,

333
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,829
and so are you, Grandpa.

334
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:30,470
Does she know
Eun Chong is her grandson?

335
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,440
Grandpa, you should have one.

336
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,109
Sure. Thank you.

337
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:40,279
It's not usual for the chairwoman
to meet with an employee in private.

338
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,849
She must think very dearly of you...

339
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,309
if she even cares about Eun Chong.

340
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,579
Yes, I'm very grateful.

341
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,190
When will she visit us at home?

342
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:52,059
I'll ask her.

343
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,930
The chairwoman will come here?

344
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:58,660
Eun Chong
and the chairwoman are besties,

345
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:01,400
so she says she wants to come,
but who knows?

346
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,970
Eun Chong, let me go get changed.

347
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:05,369
Okay.

348
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,039
It seems like she doesn't know
Eun Chong is her grandson.

349
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,279
Has she not told her
because she was cautious?

350
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:18,980
If she canceled the video call
to meet Ms. Goo,

351
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,180
it must've been something serious.

352
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,210
May I hold you in my arms?

353
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:50,150
She seemed moved
as if she met her real daughter.

354
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,819
She'd be greatly disappointed
if she found out I wasn't her girl.

355
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,119
Did she buy me this dress...

356
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,230
because I reminded her
of the daughter she lost?

357
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,029
I'd love to be her daughter
for her sake.

358
00:22:11,099 --> 00:22:14,640
So, what if I am
the chairwoman's daughter?

359
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:19,680
Gosh, no. Let's not get hopeful.

360
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,079
Goodness.

361
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,549
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na are
biologically related.)

362
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,250
Ms. Goo, for you,

363
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:33,220
for the chairwoman,
and for Eun Chong,

364
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,930
I thought this was the best choice.

365
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,769
But I won't let anyone notice.

366
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,809
When will Yali get discharged?

367
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,150
This week.

368
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,619
Have you found a temporary guardian?

369
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,049
Not yet.

370
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,250
Bring her home.

371
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,019
That kitten lost its mother.

372
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,559
I'll keep her here
until she gets adopted.

373
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:07,920
Thank you, Mom.

374
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,640
We didn't get anything.

375
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,299
We came in vain, got caught,
and my car got ruined, too.

376
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,710
Good grief. What a day.

377
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,680
Aunt Yeo Jin must be
suspicious of us, right?

378
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,250
The more she gets suspicious,
the more we must remain indifferent.

379
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,579
If you act suspiciously,

380
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,720
people will be suspicious
even if you don't do anything.

381
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,759
Were they really there for lunch,
just as Ms. Jang said?

382
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,390
I'll go to the restaurant tomorrow
and find out.

383
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,960
No, don't do that.

384
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,269
If she wanted to hide something from us,
she would've taken action.

385
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,799
That punk who ran into my car
ruined everything.

386
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,670
That person better hope
I never catch them.

387
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,079
Gosh, my head hurts.

388
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,940
Eat up.

389
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,480
I talked to the driver.

390
00:24:06,819 --> 00:24:08,690
We'll have to see
if she'll handle it...

391
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,990
with the insurance company
or if she'll want to meet.

392
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,289
All right.

393
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,519
Listen up.

394
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,990
Go drive into Yoon Se Young
and her mother's car or something...

395
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,500
to stop them
from tailing Chairwoman Shin.

396
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,569
Why did Mr. Han stop Yoon Se Young
and her mother from tailing her?

397
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:27,339
It'd help us to find out
who she was with.

398
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,769
If she found out about the tail,
she'd increase her security,

399
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:32,410
which could interfere
with our business, too, right?

400
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,480
But it was still a shame we didn't see
who the chairwoman was with.

401
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,809
It could've been her daughter.

402
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,029
If I were the chairwoman's daughter,

403
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:53,059
it'd be great for Eun Chong,

404
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,769
Ji Eun, Ji Chang,

405
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:57,430
and Ji Seok, too.

406
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,339
We won't have to worry
about money anymore,

407
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,109
and I'll get to adopt Eun Chong.

408
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,049
Why am I suddenly getting hopeful?

409
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,579
I told Mr. Hwang
that I didn't expect anything.

410
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,190
Let's not get hopeful.

411
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,990
If I get hopeful,
I'll face a great disappointment.

412
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,730
Stop thinking about it.
I need to sleep.

413
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,569
I need to sleep.

414
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,750
Hello, Mr. Hwang.

415
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,849
Yes, hello.

416
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,859
It looks like
you haven't slept well.

417
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,019
No.

418
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,170
Right. My mom said she'd be
Yali's temporary guardian.

419
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,529
Really?

420
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,769
I'm so grateful.

421
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:10,609
The hospital texted me and said
Yali could leave in two days.

422
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:11,910
I'm glad.

423
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,579
Will you take her home right away
from the hospital?

424
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,349
Yes, I'll call you after she leaves,
so come out for a moment.

425
00:26:19,849 --> 00:26:21,250
You should see her
after she left the hospital.

426
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,190
Okay.

427
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:35,200
- Ms. Yoon.
- Hello, Mr. Hwang.

428
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,230
Hello.

429
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,700
Ms. Yoon, report the marketing materials
for the New York branch...

430
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,069
as soon as they're ready.

431
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,970
Yes, I'll submit it soon.

432
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,910
Please take good care of Ms. Yoon.

433
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:47,809
Why did she postpone the video call?

434
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,680
I need to know the reason
to mitigate the incident.

435
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:52,579
Aunt Yeo Jin postponed it?

436
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,119
It wasn't Richard Han?

437
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,490
I'm sorry. If Richard Han was
to return to Korea soon,

438
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:01,420
I didn't think
a video call would be necessary.

439
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:04,960
- He'd come soon, right?
- I don't have the exact date.

440
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,970
- Will he come at all?
- Is there a reason not to?

441
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:20,240
Hey, it's Ji Seok and Ha Na.

442
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,380
Darn it. Yoon Se Young
and Hwang Jin Goo, too.

443
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,420
She's dressed in luxury brands
from head to toe.

444
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,019
Wait, those heels...

445
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,670
Those heels were limited edition,
so they weren't easy to come across.

446
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,039
No way.

447
00:27:53,509 --> 00:27:55,150
Your aunt postponed the video call,

448
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,549
not Richard Han?

449
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,650
Who told you that?

450
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,549
I heard Goo Ji Seok
talking to Jin Goo.

451
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,920
He asked why the call was postponed.

452
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,890
What's going on?

453
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:09,029
Who did she have to meet in such a hurry,
postponing that video call?

454
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,529
Who do you think it is?
It had to be Yu Jin!

455
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,400
Calm down.
We don't know anything yet.

456
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,500
I'll go to the restaurant.

457
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,940
It can't be Yu Jin.

458
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:30,009
Did she meet someone
who looked like her?

459
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,980
She'd be impossible to find
by using her DNA.

460
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,150
Look what happened
to the fireplace and the swing.

461
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,289
How can fate be so cruel?

462
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,930
The least it can do is
bring her daughter home.

463
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,900
All life ever does is
hurt the chairwoman even deeper.

464
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,670
Tell me about it.
She used to look at those...

465
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,240
and console her longing for Yu Jin.

466
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:57,240
Or she might see a better day
after the darkest times.

467
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,980
When bad things happen in a series,
it always ends in a good event.

468
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:05,009
Maybe this is all happening
to lead to her daughter...

469
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:07,519
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

470
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,720
Why did you shudder?

471
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,319
Gosh.

472
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,559
Darn it.

473
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,730
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na are
biologically related.)

474
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,390
She'll believe it
when she sees this.

475
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,059
When it comes to adopting Eun Chong,

476
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:23,329
economic stability is important
for a single woman to adopt a child.

477
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,299
Once she becomes your daughter,

478
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,940
she'll be able to adopt him, too.

479
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,099
All right.

480
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,710
It's a holiday in two days,

481
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,339
so you can meet her that day
and tell her the news.

482
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,980
Ask her to keep it a secret...

483
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,410
from her siblings,
including Mr. Goo,

484
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,119
- because of my situation.
- Yes, ma'am.

485
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:42,019
Do not let anyone else find out.

486
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:44,349
You must keep everything
highly confidential.

487
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,559
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:49,430
It has to be fixed tightly...

489
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,599
to help it fly higher
without falling apart.

490
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,400
I hope it flies up and up...

491
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,670
and reaches the sky.

492
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,940
Think of what you'll write down
as your wish.

493
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,009
Okay!

494
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:07,210
Eun Chong, I heard you were
looking for your grandmother.

495
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:08,980
Have you heard anything?

496
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,349
No.

497
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:13,349
It's really hard.

498
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,349
What's hard, Eun Chong?

499
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,450
Looking for my grandmother.

500
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,490
It's not easy, is it?

501
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,759
No, it's tough to find her
just by using his DNA.

502
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,500
So, Yeo Jin didn't mention
she was Eun Chong's grandmother.

503
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,839
Then, why did she meet her
in such a hurry?

504
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,039
Eun Chong,
I need to go out for a moment.

505
00:30:38,109 --> 00:30:40,480
- You can make kites with Mr. Han.
- Okay.

506
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,250
Yali is practically born again.

507
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,819
Look at how bright her eyes are.

508
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,690
It's all thanks to you.

509
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,259
And you, Mr. Hwang.
You paid for the hospital bill, too.

510
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:01,730
Please give this to Yali.

511
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,099
Good for her.

512
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:10,240
Yali, have a great time at his place
until you meet your forever mom.

513
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,769
Hey.

514
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,880
The parentage test result came out.

515
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,549
I wasn't her, right?

516
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,720
Do you want to be
her daughter or not?

517
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,160
I really want to know that.

518
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,759
You didn't seem too hopeful.

519
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:31,589
Of course, I hope I'm her daughter.

520
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,200
I didn't want to be disappointed
after getting my hopes up.

521
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:38,500
And honestly, expecting this
to be true seems too ambitious.

522
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:40,670
Take a look at it for yourself.

523
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,410
(Secret Biogen)

524
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,910
Just tell me.

525
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:54,920
The chairwoman...

526
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,190
turned out to be...

527
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,789
Not my mom, right?

528
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,230
She is.

529
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,299
No way.

530
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,470
Stop lying.

531
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:12,640
I'm not lying. I'm serious.

532
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:16,740
Congratulations. I mean it.

533
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,049
So, the chairwoman is...

534
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,180
my birth mother?

535
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:27,980
If you don't believe me,
you can see it for yourself.

536
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:39,930
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na are
biologically related.)

537
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,670
So, I really am...

538
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,839
the chairwoman's daughter?

539
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,319
(Cinderella Game)

540
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,230
I found Yu Jin.

541
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,460
I can't believe
I'm Hyesung Group's daughter.

542
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,630
What do you mean she found Yu Jin?
Are you serious?

543
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,099
- Pull yourself together.
- What's wrong?

544
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,900
Chairwoman Shin found her daughter?

545
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,799
She wasn't the type
who'd get conned.

546
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,140
It'd make sense if Chairwoman Shin
made a fake daughter for herself.

547
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,309
You can't do this to me, Yeo Jin.

548
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,940
Come live with me.

549
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:03,079
Bring Eun Chong and move in with me.
