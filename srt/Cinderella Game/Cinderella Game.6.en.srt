00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,260
Only ten minutes left
before the boarding closes.

5
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,270
I hope your mother gets well.

6
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,240
- We'll pray for her.
- Thank you.

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,820
No worries. Mr. Hwang will be fine,
as he's a professional.

8
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,049
Take good care of this,
President Hwang.

9
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,439
(Episode 6)

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:07,939
Hey! You!

11
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:11,609
If you were wrong,
you should apologize...

12
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:13,409
instead of flipping me off
and running away.

13
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,650
Did you think
I'd drive off and call it a bad day?

14
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,379
I didn't flip you off and run away.

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,549
You drive recklessly,
flip people off, and lie?

16
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,219
Look at everything you've done.

17
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,459
Apologize for doing this!

18
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,989
I didn't do this.

19
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,060
Sorry.

20
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,299
- I did this.
- What?

21
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:37,739
I said sorry, not this.

22
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:42,640
These are the same!

23
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
No, they're totally different.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,280
One of them is offensive,
and the other one is apologetic.

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,150
All you had to do was
just apologize.

26
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,150
I'll go straight to the hotel.

27
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,180
Please keep my entry to Korea
confidential for a while.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,189
Yes.

29
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,460
I apologized, and you misunderstood.

30
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,930
It's completely absurd...

31
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:41,669
for you to follow me here
and demand an apology.

32
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,169
Don't you think so?

33
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,939
I'll be completely absurd,

34
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,870
so apologize to me!

35
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,650
(Police)

36
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:02,620
License plate numbers 7538 and 8061.
Those are your cars, correct?

37
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:05,620
You were both speeding.
I need your driver's license.

38
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,830
Well, what happened was...

39
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,400
Here it is. I'm sorry.

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,169
My clients' lives depended on this,
so I had to get them here on time.

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,469
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,169
You continuously ignored us
when we asked you to stop.

43
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,009
I need your driver's license.

44
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm sorry,

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,250
- but he suddenly cut in, so I...
- Your driver's license.

46
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:30,110
He almost caused an accident,

47
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:32,219
but he flipped me off and ran away
instead of apologizing.

48
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,319
I apologized.

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,460
You should be grateful
your licenses weren't revoked.

50
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,530
Please drive safely from now on.

51
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:45,530
Yes, sir. Have a great day.

52
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,930
A hundred and fifty dollars?

53
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:54,870
Where do you think you're going?

54
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,639
What more do you need from me?

55
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:59,580
A hundred and fifty dollars is
almost my day's wage.

56
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,610
So what?

57
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,810
You caused this.

58
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:05,050
You're also responsible,

59
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,620
- so please pay half the fine.
- What?

60
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,419
If you didn't cut in,
I wouldn't have been fined.

61
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:15,530
And 150 dollars
may be nothing to you,

62
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,100
but it's a huge amount to me.

63
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,629
It's a lot of money for me, too.

64
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,370
Do you think I can afford this fine
because I'm rich?

65
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,699
I had to risk my life
and drive here for my clients.

66
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,800
If my apology wasn't proper,
I apologize.

67
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:27,769
But why would you risk your life
and chase after me...

68
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,970
for not turning the blinkers on?
How unnecessary is that?

69
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,250
Yes, all right. Okay.

70
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:38,879
I'm a busy man, so excuse me.

71
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,050
Where are you...

72
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,629
Hey, Hyun Ju.

73
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,730
Yes, I arrived.
I'll go inside now. Bye.

74
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,769
(Good Day Tour)

75
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,240
Hello, everyone.

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,050
Are you Mr. Wang Jia Wei
and his family?

77
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,180
Yes, that's me.

78
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,649
Welcome, everyone.

79
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,480
My name is Goo Ha Na,
and I'm your guide to your hotel.

80
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,250
It must've been a close call.

81
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,160
Please take your time
on your way back.

82
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,029
Goodbye.

83
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,300
They did not miss their flight,
Ms. Chairwoman.

84
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:28,600
Get him a more durable car.
I can't live with such anxiety.

85
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,500
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,209
Hello?

87
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,279
It's Richard Han's agent.

88
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:42,250
Hello.

89
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,750
Is Richard unavailable?

90
00:05:48,189 --> 00:05:50,089
It's also my first time
receiving an investment...

91
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:51,389
without knowing
what the investor looks like.

92
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,160
The board doesn't know yet...

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,560
about the recruitment
of the head director.

94
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,889
I'll inform them soon.

95
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,500
He's coming into the country today?

96
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,370
Chairwoman Shin will
keep this confidential for a while.

97
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,579
President Hwang Jin Goo was
supposed to take that position,

98
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,709
so the board and her niece's side
would protest...

99
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,209
if they heard you were
recruited from the outside.

100
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,279
Things are more fun
with competition.

101
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,129
What do you think?

102
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:34,430
Ms. Bride?

103
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:39,240
I'll take this.

104
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:41,339
No.

105
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,639
The one before this was better.

106
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:47,910
You need to have
a fancy wedding photo shoot.

107
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,180
You'll have
an elegant wedding anyway, right?

108
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,550
Jin Goo doesn't like seeing
a lot of cleavage.

109
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:57,889
I don't care what he likes.
Do something you like.

110
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:00,629
It's not what I like, either.
It's what you like.

111
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,100
Se Young, once you get older,

112
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,829
you won't be able to show cleavage
even if you want to.

113
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,600
It's not your fault
you're young and youthful.

114
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,139
- Why would you hide that?
- Mom, please.

115
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,040
Let me pick my dress.

116
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,069
I did everything else
as you wanted, Mom.

117
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,579
And did anything ever go wrong
after you did as I asked?

118
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:26,720
I have to go back to work.
What about you?

119
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,689
I'm out here anyway,
so I'll browse some hanbok.

120
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:32,519
Don't get anything too showy.

121
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,490
You may stand out
and look ridiculous.

122
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,759
It's not that I stand out.
I capture people's attention.

123
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,029
Jeez. If you want attention,
pick something sophisticated.

124
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:42,970
Jin Goo's mother has
such a simple taste.

125
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:49,470
Hey, her taste is too simple,
so it's almost nonexistent.

126
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,110
His family isn't a big deal.
Don't make me feel conscious.

127
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,850
It's not like
you have nothing to offer.

128
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,879
Jin Goo is amazing, though.

129
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,620
He better prove how amazing he is.

130
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,629
We're looking for a guide,
so please buy us some time.

131
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:12,459
Yes, what about Choi Yoon Jung?

132
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,600
What about Han Jin Su?

133
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,470
It's the guide's day off? I see.

134
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:19,600
- What's going on?
- We're looking for a substitute...

135
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,769
because the ski guide
at Pyeongchang got injured.

136
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,939
What happened?
Was the guide badly hurt?

137
00:08:22,939 --> 00:08:25,180
Yes, the guide was
giving a lesson to the tourist,

138
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,839
then got hurt
while protecting the guest...

139
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,680
from someone who charged downhill.

140
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,220
I told the guide to visit
the resort's emergency center.

141
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,519
Good work. Have you contacted
all tour guides in Gangwon Province?

142
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,950
Yes, but no one is available.

143
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,220
The guide was Hee Sung
at Daegwallyeong Ski Resort, right?

144
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,190
Was the guest booked all day?
Isn't it almost over?

145
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,330
The guest was booked all day.

146
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,629
Then, let's find a ski guide
who can speak English.

147
00:08:45,929 --> 00:08:47,799
I don't care how much they charge.
Let's find someone...

148
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:49,470
and wrap up the tour
for the guest's convenience.

149
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,500
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,009
Give the guests a free attraction
of their choice tomorrow,

151
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,639
and find out how badly
the guide in Pyeongchang...

152
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,139
- was injured.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:03,450
Right. I'll soon be an expert
at getting a speeding ticket.

154
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:08,590
Hey, 150 dollars?
The damage wasn't so bad.

155
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,220
A hundred and fifty dollars is
almost my day's wage.

156
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:14,129
You're also responsible,

157
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,830
so please pay half the fine.

158
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,759
What a silly woman.

159
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:25,639
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

160
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,840
Why did something urgent happen
to Aunt Ji Eun, too?

161
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,210
It's all right.

162
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,039
There will be many more chances.

163
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,740
Right?

164
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,279
The application for extracurricular
activities is due on Friday.

165
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:39,779
It seemed like Eun Chong
didn't mention it to you.

166
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,519
Eun Chong.

167
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,730
Isn't it fun
to do extracurricular activities?

168
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:52,129
You said you had fun
learning English, PE, and arts.

169
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,799
You'll also go to a strawberry field
when strawberries ripen,

170
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,029
dig up sweet potatoes,

171
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,700
and visit all kinds of places.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,470
I don't have to go.

173
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,370
What? I want you to go.

174
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:05,610
Please go.

175
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,549
It'll cost a lot.

176
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,320
It doesn't cost much.

177
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,350
And I'm a talented tour guide.

178
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:15,220
I agree with that.

179
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,090
You have to go to
all your extracurricular activities.

180
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,460
But you have to have a lot of fun...

181
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,159
and not worry about money.

182
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,929
And you have to tell me whatever you need
at the kindergarten. Okay?

183
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,299
- Promise me.
- I promise.

184
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,210
(Eun Chong's Vegetable Garden)

185
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,080
(Lettuce, Chicory)

186
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,620
(No rain, no flowers.)

187
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,789
What happened to you?

188
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:52,019
Where did you go instead
of going to the kindergarten?

189
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,090
One of the hotel staff
suddenly had to go...

190
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,330
to the emergency room,
so they called me.

191
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,299
What can I do? I work there.
I had to do as they said.

192
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,029
Give me the 50 dollars.

193
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,129
It wasn't like I did it on purpose.
Please cut me some slack.

194
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,539
No, you cut me some slack.

195
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,899
You know, 50 dollars can get us
20kg of rice.

196
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,470
I'm sure you made money today
during your tour guide gig.

197
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,610
I didn't.

198
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,639
I have to pay 150 dollars for speeding,
so I lost money.

199
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,809
No way. You were speeding?

200
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,220
You never do that
because you're stingy.

201
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,850
Anyway, give it back.

202
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,289
You can work as an agent
and make up the difference.

203
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:24,559
You can take the easy road,
so don't make this hard.

204
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,360
I quit doing that ages ago.

205
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,159
Everyone else does it,
so why won't you?

206
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,230
Right, and you're meeting
Seok Ki's mother tomorrow.

207
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:33,759
You'll be a rich family's
daughter-in-law soon,

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,399
so don't be so obsessed
over just 50 dollars.

209
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,370
I have to pay for Eun Chong's
extracurricular activities.

210
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:45,840
All you care about is Eun Chong.

211
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,909
You're so cheap.

212
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:51,779
I hope you two have a great life.

213
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:56,419
Why would you throw
this sacred money?

214
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,820
I'll get my revenge with money...

215
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:59,659
as soon as I marry.

216
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,529
These are all one-dollar bills.

217
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,700
- Can you reach out to Ji Seok?
- He's doing well.

218
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,370
Did you talk to him? When?

219
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:11,669
A few days ago.

220
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:13,299
Did he say he'd come back?

221
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,779
No, and leave.

222
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,750
Can you ask when he'll come back?

223
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,820
He won't pick up my calls.

224
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,649
Cover yourself well when you sleep.
It's cold in the night.

225
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,149
Jeez. Come on.

226
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,960
I give her credit
for relentless stinginess.

227
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,799
Gosh. Please.

228
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,299
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,240
I'll set up a meeting
with Chairwoman Shin soon.

230
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,039
We'd feel each other out,
so I wouldn't need to be nervous.

231
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,070
Seoul?

232
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,779
Things seemed to have changed a lot,
but they also looked the same.

233
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,279
But the night view
became more dazzling.

234
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,429
Make sure the shoes look
spick and span.

235
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,100
She's meeting
her potential mother-in-law...

236
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,139
on the same day
she receives a bouquet.

237
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,840
I have a good feeling about this.

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,409
As soon as she sees Ha Na,

239
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,940
she'll go,
"Yes, you're my daughter-in-law!"

240
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,309
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

241
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:31,850
Why? Because she'd adopt you
once she got married?

242
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,320
Stop mooching off my sister...

243
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,350
and go find your grandmother, kiddo.

244
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,419
I need to find the DNA
that matches mine,

245
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,519
and it's not that easy!

246
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,129
You little... Take this.

247
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:44,960
Uncle Ji Chang!

248
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,659
Polish her shoe.

249
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,669
I'll take the photo now.
One, two, three.

250
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,340
One more time. One, two, three.

251
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,779
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

252
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:01,309
Congratulations, Manager.
You look beautiful.

253
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,480
You shouldn't wait too long.

254
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,149
If you're with someone,
you should marry soon.

255
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,320
All right.

256
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:08,620
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

257
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,419
Hey.

258
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,659
Hey, Seok Ki.

259
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,600
Anyway, she's such a talented woman.

260
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,129
Her boyfriend works
at a foreign bank in Korea,

261
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,070
- and he's from a good family.
- Yes.

262
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,299
What's her secret?

263
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,570
What secret?
You can date just about anyone.

264
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,639
Ha Na will marry soon.

265
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,840
She's meeting
her potential mother-in-law today.

266
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,509
Just meeting her
won't make things happen.

267
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,279
I don't think it's likely.

268
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,450
No parent-in-law will be okay
with bringing a seven-year-old kid...

269
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,149
into the marriage.

270
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,190
- Yes.
- Gosh, and?

271
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,289
I see. Really?

272
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:46,559
Thank you.

273
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,100
He hasn't been coming lately.

274
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,600
That tall, ripped,
and handsome guest.

275
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,139
Who?

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,879
He's a regular at our hotel,
the rich guy from Cheongdam-dong.

277
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,809
He said he was visiting America.

278
00:15:07,809 --> 00:15:09,480
Is that so?

279
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,419
He said his mother lived
somewhere in America.

280
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,720
I hear he'll marry soon.

281
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,720
What?
Why are you telling me that now?

282
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,789
Why did I have to share that?

283
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:20,889
Darn it.

284
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:27,029
Hello, you have reached
the front desk.

285
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,399
Yes, that's me.

286
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,169
Ji Seok?

287
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,009
Where are you?
Why are you calling me here?

288
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,350
Ji Seok!

289
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,750
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

290
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:47,850
What's going on?
You said nothing on the phone.

291
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,490
Are you here for good?
Or are you visiting?

292
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:51,759
- For good.
- Really?

293
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,559
Then, why are you at a hotel
and not home?

294
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,960
Is Ji Chang well?

295
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:59,000
He's still reckless.

296
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,669
He's getting practical training
at Hyesung Group's cafeteria.

297
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's eat dinner with Ji Chang
in two days.

298
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:06,240
Okay. Are you inviting
Ha Na and Eun Chong, too?

299
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:08,639
Just the three of us,
you, me, and Ji Chang.

300
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,370
I have something to say, too.

301
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:13,679
And for a while,
don't tell Ha Na that I'm back.

302
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,950
- Why not?
- I'll tell her.

303
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,350
And keep Ji Chang's mouth shut.

304
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,450
All right.

305
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,090
She's been dying to know
how you were doing.

306
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,190
Does she
still keep Eun Chong around?

307
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,090
That's not all she does.

308
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,159
She'll take him with her
when she marries.

309
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:32,799
"When she marries?" Is she marrying?

310
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,899
You lowlife brat!

311
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,740
How dare a girl like you...

312
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,740
want to marry Seok Ki
with that ridiculous background?

313
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,580
I heard you were
an adopted orphan...

314
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,710
and the breadwinner for your family.

315
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,289
- Mother.
- I'm not your mother!

316
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:58,360
Not only do you have
several siblings to look after,

317
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,860
but you want to adopt
your friend's son, too?

318
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,230
Good grief.

319
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:06,000
If you enjoy such an awful life,
feel free to do it alone.

320
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,230
Why are you
dragging my son into this?

321
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,769
Are you using your pretty looks
to snatch a man...

322
00:17:10,769 --> 00:17:12,170
and turn your life around?

323
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,509
How crude are you?

324
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:16,039
Seok Ki wanted to marry me...

325
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:18,039
You must've urged him!

326
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,279
Seok Ki can never look away
from women who need help...

327
00:17:22,349 --> 00:17:24,980
because he's too soft-hearted
and kind.

328
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,750
That's not love.

329
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,720
It's just pity and sympathy.

330
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,549
Well,

331
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,220
when he returns...

332
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,690
- from his business trip...
- Are you that slow?

333
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,890
Do you not get it? No?

334
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,599
Do you think I'm a joke...

335
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,599
because I sit here at a cafe
and talk to you with elegance?

336
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,170
I can always raid your place.

337
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,339
I'll expose you
for who you really are...

338
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,670
in front of your siblings
and your neighbors.

339
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,539
I'm trying my best to stop myself...

340
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,180
from pulling your hair out.

341
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,309
Get out of Seok Ki's life
as of this hour...

342
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,710
before you face anything worse.

343
00:17:57,549 --> 00:18:01,690
How dare a girl like you
want to be with him?

344
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,259
Mom.

345
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,230
- Did you talk to her?
- You.

346
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,670
Seok Ki.

347
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,640
Why do you date a girl like her?

348
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,269
You're breaking my heart.

349
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,940
Ha Na...

350
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,950
I told you to stay in the car.
Why did you come out?

351
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,079
What an idiot. Goodness.

352
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,990
You said your mom was an angel.

353
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:46,029
You said you would
get her permission.

354
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:48,970
Ha Na, my mom is
the normal one here.

355
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,339
Do you know what my friends say?

356
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,369
They called me
a new kind of nutcase.

357
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,410
These days, marriage is like
an investment and a business,

358
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,769
so a girl in your situation...

359
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,579
But of course, many people marry
without considering such things.

360
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,619
There are single men who marry...

361
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:07,849
single mothers and divorcees.

362
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,890
But he's not even your kid.

363
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,289
Isn't it weird for you to adopt
your friend's son?

364
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,359
Forget it.
I never asked you to adopt him.

365
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,299
I didn't want to marry you, either.
You wanted this.

366
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,329
So, stop using him as an excuse
and tell me how you really feel.

367
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,400
My mom told me to break up with you.

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,170
But I'll marry you
as soon as Eun Chong is out of your life.

369
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:34,680
I mean the world to my mom.

370
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,950
My mom and I are family,

371
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,420
but Eun Chong and you aren't.

372
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,549
Eun Chong and I are family, too.

373
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,890
It's my mom. I have to go.

374
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:53,329
I'm done.

375
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:56,400
I just had a reality check.

376
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,640
I was an idiot for believing you...

377
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,440
and coming all the way here.

378
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,339
I was stupid for getting hopeful.

379
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,579
You love your family dearly, right?

380
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:08,549
I love my mom very dearly, too.

381
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,750
You need to understand my situation.

382
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,549
Call me within the week
after you're done thinking.

383
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,720
I'm already done thinking.

384
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,019
Really?

385
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,420
And?

386
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,430
You and I are...

387
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,829
too different to spend
the rest of our lives together.

388
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:30,569
I also realized this just now.

389
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,099
I must've liked you...

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,369
out of gratefulness, not love.

391
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,440
- What?
- You liked...

392
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,349
my family wholeheartedly...

393
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,779
without holding prejudice.

394
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,119
You were nice to me
without wanting something in return.

395
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,250
I rarely had
someone like that in my life.

396
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:55,690
I must've been so grateful
and thought it was love.

397
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,000
So, you didn't love me?

398
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,599
You didn't love me?

399
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,940
We're breaking up,
so that's not important now.

400
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,170
Thank you for everything. I mean it.

401
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,410
It was all in vain,
but I even considered marrying you.

402
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,210
Let's each live a good life
from this moment on.

403
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,380
Hey, Ha Na.

404
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,150
Did you think
you'd be less embarrassed...

405
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,250
if you said you didn't love me
at this point in time?

406
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:26,059
Okay, fine.
I didn't love you, either.

407
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,630
I pitied you
because I felt bad for you.

408
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,059
I mistook sympathy for love!

409
00:21:31,059 --> 00:21:32,200
That's enough.

410
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:35,930
Hey, only someone like me would
even bring up marrying you.

411
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,369
You'd never marry anyone
with Eun Chong in your life.

412
00:21:38,369 --> 00:21:42,470
- I was just worried about...
- I told you to stop! Enough!

413
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,740
You!

414
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,950
My aunt will be my mommy soon.

415
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,390
Once she got married,

416
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,519
Mr. Seok Ki said he'd be my daddy.

417
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,660
She's a fake mommy anyway.

418
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,490
Your real mommy is dead.

419
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,400
Your mommy will die soon, too.

420
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,430
Why would my mommy die?

421
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,869
She'll die, too.

422
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,069
She will.

423
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,839
Mommy!

424
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:18,779
Mommy...

425
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:19,839
Don't be stupid.

426
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,609
Everyone dies.

427
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,309
Mommy...

428
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,190
Yeo Jin.

429
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:33,220
I told you not to take in
something like this again!

430
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,690
Bang Ul...
I mean, Ms. Sim received it...

431
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,559
You told me to receive it.

432
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,170
She may hate him,
but he's still her husband.

433
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,740
At least she can break the pottery
and relieve her stress.

434
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,039
I don't think it's helping her.

435
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,210
It must've given her
higher blood pressure.

436
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:54,710
This always happens on her birthday.

437
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,779
Clean it up quietly and go home.

438
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,539
What an evil man.

439
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,839
Why would a mother
who lost her child celebrate her birthday?

440
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,450
If you're going to send anything,

441
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,109
send me an update on Yu Jin!

442
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,819
Are you all right, Yeo Jin?

443
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:37,849
Let me check your blood pressure.

444
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,890
Now, come on.

445
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:51,369
You should just let him be.

446
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,109
He's trying to express his feelings.

447
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,509
What feelings?

448
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:00,710
It must be longing
for you and Yu Jin.

449
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,880
If he felt that way,
why hasn't he come for 20 years?

450
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,650
Who knows where he is
and what he's doing?

451
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:07,880
I find it hard to believe
that he's looking for Yu Jin.

452
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,650
You should believe him.

453
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,390
Who knows?
He may return tomorrow with her news.

454
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,960
Well, your blood pressure is
a bit unstable,

455
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:21,769
but you'll be fine.

456
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:26,240
I must be getting old.

457
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,539
I just want to know
if she's alive or dead.

458
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:32,380
I'm sure Yu Jin is alive.

459
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,319
I'm sure you'll meet her.

460
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,980
Isn't that so, Yu Jin?

461
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,289
Sung Ho, just keep making
and sending those potteries.

462
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,990
Don't ever show up.

463
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,079
Seok Ki can never look away
from women who need help...

464
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,680
because he's too soft-hearted
and kind.

465
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,519
That's not love.

466
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,319
It's just pity and sympathy.

467
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:16,819
Did you think
you'd be less embarrassed...

468
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,960
if you said you didn't love me
at this point in time?

469
00:25:19,259 --> 00:25:21,660
Okay, fine.
I didn't love you, either.

470
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,329
I pitied you
because I felt bad for you.

471
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,559
I mistook sympathy for love!

472
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,829
Hey, Hyun Ju.

473
00:25:57,829 --> 00:25:59,130
Do you want to do a night tour gig?

474
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,569
The guests wanted to find
a cheaper club.

475
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,940
- I don't work as an outside agent.
- I checked just in case.

476
00:26:07,369 --> 00:26:08,940
- All right. Goodbye.
- Wait.

477
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,309
The application for extracurricular
activities is due on Friday.

478
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,779
For how many people?

479
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,279
Three men? Where are they from?

480
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,619
Are you in or not?

481
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,089
Okay. I'll do it just once.

482
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:26,619
Where do I meet them?

483
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,309
Enjoy it,

484
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:49,480
- and I'll be right back. Okay?
- Okay.

485
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,650
- Okay.
- Okay.

486
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,079
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

487
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,390
So, this entire hotel will belong to
Jin Goo soon?

488
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,890
Man, I'm so jealous.

489
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,299
Se Young is a sly woman, too.

490
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,230
She knew she couldn't do it alone
and held onto Jin Goo as a strategy.

491
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,170
He also would've considered that.

492
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,869
It's a win-win situation.

493
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,109
Over here, Se Young.

494
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,680
- Where's Jin Goo?
- He's taking a call.

495
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,019
Yoon, did you check the arrangement
for the Mudin family in two days?

496
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:31,859
Check the Quran again.

497
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,559
Make sure we have Hassan's favorite water,
whiskey, and perfume.

498
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,690
And check
the room condition once again,

499
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,359
including the blanket weight
and the pillow height. Yes.

500
00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,769
There are 3 of them, so 180 dollars.

501
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,470
I made enough to pay
for Eun Chong's extracurriculars.

502
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,450
Jin Goo must've saved a country
in his past life,

503
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,750
and it must've been a huge country.

504
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,720
That was why he got to be
with a beauty like you, Se Young.

505
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,319
Then, I must've saved
many different countries...

506
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,630
to end up with Jin Goo.

507
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,029
My gosh, you're too modest.

508
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,170
I guess your character is
as wonderful as your looks.

509
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,740
Please excuse me for a moment.

510
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,809
Myung Soo, you're trying too hard
to get on Jin Goo's good side.

511
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:28,109
I was just stating the facts.

512
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:30,480
- Jeez.
- Jeez.

513
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:33,680
Hey, sweetie.
Do you want to join us?

514
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,190
Why are you playing hard to get?
Hey, join us.

515
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,819
- Come on.
- Se Young!

516
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,390
Have you lost your mind?

517
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,160
- Get up, guys. Now!
- Let go of me, you punk.

518
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,900
- Let go of me. Let go!
- Hey!

519
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,269
Get out of here, you punk!

520
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,940
Let go of me!

521
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,440
What's going on?

522
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,009
Are you okay, Se Young?

523
00:28:59,009 --> 00:29:00,440
- Jin Goo...
- Stay inside.

524
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,980
- Hey!
- Hey, guys.

525
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,410
Hey, break it off.

526
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:08,319
- No!
- Myung Soo.

527
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:10,720
- Stop!
- You punk!

528
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,289
- Get him.
- Myung Soo.

529
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,390
Stop!

530
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,059
Gosh, I'm bleeding.

531
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,130
Are you okay?

532
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,539
- It's you from yesterday, right?
- What?

533
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,210
Oh, my gosh.

534
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:43,250
Your guests
made a pass on my girlfriend.

535
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,990
Should I have just sat around, then?

536
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,589
Let's take them
to the police station, Jin Goo.

537
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:50,329
I'm so sorry.

538
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,000
My guests were very wrong.

539
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,299
They were sorry for what they did,

540
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:58,200
and they apologized to you, too.

541
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,500
So, could you please
show your mercy and settle this?

542
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,170
You're a guide, so stay out of this.

543
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,640
I'll talk to the CEO of your agency.

544
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,279
- No, you can't!
- Why not?

545
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,609
There's a personal reason.

546
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,779
Let's just talk to the police.

547
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:16,750
Are you working as a private agent?

548
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,960
No! My goodness.

549
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,960
They found the clubbing option
a bit expensive,

550
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,799
so I had to bring them here
to a cheaper club.

551
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, so you're a subcontractor.

552
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,539
And the club in this hotel
isn't cheap.

553
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,069
How much did you get?

554
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:39,680
Hey, Reporter Kim.
Are you on your way?

555
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,309
We're going somewhere else.

556
00:30:52,990 --> 00:30:54,259
Can you publish an article for me?

557
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,359
Yes, there's a tour guide
who's ruining the industry.

558
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,029
Here's the title.

559
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,829
"International Tourism Tainted
with Subcontractor Guides..."

560
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,599
"and Group Assault."

561
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:09,069
If you were a subcontractor,

562
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:11,269
you should've been on stand-by
and stayed right next to them.

563
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,339
Weren't you too irresponsible
as a tour guide?

564
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,710
How much did you get?

565
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,980
I never work as a private guide.

566
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,279
It was a special occasion.

567
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,420
I suffered from a huge loss today.

568
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,089
I didn't make anything off them,

569
00:31:27,089 --> 00:31:29,730
and I had to pay
for the club's damage.

570
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,259
A guide should
never suffer from a loss.

571
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,000
It's harder than you think
to work as a tour guide.

572
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,700
There are all kinds
of crazy situations.

573
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:41,599
And there are things I must put up with
because I'm a woman.

574
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,710
I know that very well.

575
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:47,980
If you know that very well,

576
00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:51,079
please show me your kindness.

577
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,849
So, you're with Good Day Tour?

578
00:31:55,589 --> 00:31:57,319
No, please.

579
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,390
Are you an actual guide?
Do you have the license?

580
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,660
Yes, of course, I do.

581
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,789
Let me see it.

582
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:05,829
Do you have to see it?

583
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,299
- So, you don't have it.
- I do.

584
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,269
Here. It's my tourist guide license.

585
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:20,779
(Tourist Guide License, Chinese
Name: Goo Ha Na)

586
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,200
(Good Day Tour)

587
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,529
(Cinderella Game)

588
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,660
Just trust me.

589
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,869
In the end,
Hyesung Group will belong to you.

590
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:19,099
So, that person is
the most likely to succeed?

591
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,299
Have you been digging up my back?

592
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:22,170
Spread the word
so that Hwang Jin Goo will hear it.

593
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Richard Han recommended him to me.

594
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,809
I am a little curious.

595
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,339
I'm fired?

596
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,349
Se Young showed she could end
someone's life if they crossed her.

597
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,319
The Internet was full of my photos
and articles about me.

598
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,180
Please let me off this once.

599
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,819
Do I have to drag you out?

600
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,119
Now!
