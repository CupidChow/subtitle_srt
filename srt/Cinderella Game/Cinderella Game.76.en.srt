1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,910
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,910 --> 00:00:03,710
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,310
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,880
Did you tell him...

5
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,450
- I faked my pregnancy?
- Yes.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,490
I said you couldn't get married.

7
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,150
You should've noticed.

8
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,320
Then, you wouldn't have been
abandoned...

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,660
in your bridal room.

10
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,790
You!

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,740
You've lived your entire life
trampling on others.

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,310
So, it's your turn to see
how it feels...

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,840
to be trampled on.

14
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,790
Stop right there.

15
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,660
Stop right there!

16
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,700
I'll kill you.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,270
Goo Ha Na, I'll kill you!

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,640
Die!

19
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:13,140
You!

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,200
The wedding was called off?
What are you talking about?

21
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,630
And where's Jin Goo?

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,270
Why is Ms. Sim mad?

23
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll tell you when we get home.

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,910
Did Se Young do something?

25
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,340
Se Young...

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:45,840
I'll bring Se Young.

27
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,180
Hey, how's Se Young?

28
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,080
It seemed like
she was in great shock.

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,550
You should go.

30
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,490
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Hey.

31
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,830
What's going on?

32
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,860
Se Young faked her pregnancy.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,570
What? She faked her pregnancy?

34
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:11,470
Things will be grim at home tonight,

35
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,470
so I'll let Eun Chong come
and stay at my place.

36
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,310
I'll take him to school in
the morning...

37
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,610
and come to your place.

38
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,980
Says who?

39
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,480
Me and Eun Chong.

40
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,880
The marriage is called off,

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,650
so they can't adopt Eun Chong
anymore.

42
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,150
So, there's no reason
for me to stay away from him.

43
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,890
Come with me.

44
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,160
- Let go of her hand.
- I don't want to.

45
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,700
You don't hold an edge over me
other than you two's blood relation.

46
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,060
Right.

47
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,900
You got money.

48
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,000
Say goodbye to her.

49
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,670
Goodbye, Grandma.

50
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,660
It was that brat, Goo Ha Na?

51
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,690
Yes!

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,400
She knew everything,

53
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,430
but she played dumb
to expose me at my wedding.

54
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,070
I told you that it seemed like
she knew I was faking it.

55
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,570
I won't let her live.

56
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,080
Call Jin Goo now.

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,550
He won't pick up.

58
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,910
That punk.
If he chose to call the wedding off,

59
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,880
he should
at least pick up his phone!

60
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,810
(Se Young)

61
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,860
Those jerks.

62
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,100
How can they pull this marriage fraud
on my son?

63
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,480
Mom.

64
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,050
You were home?

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,980
- I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

66
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,420
Those two evil women are at fault.

67
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,490
It's such a relief
you found out before marrying her.

68
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,000
What if you found out
you were deceived after marrying?

69
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,860
That sounds much more awful to me.

70
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,370
When did you find out?

71
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,540
Just before
I went to the wedding hall.

72
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,200
It must've been so shocking.

73
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:02,710
How did you find out?

74
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,610
Someone I know told me.

75
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,910
Did you confirm everything?

76
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,980
Yes.

77
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,480
Well, there was no need
to confirm this.

78
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,880
I knew it was true
as soon as I saw Myung Ji's face.

79
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,560
Goodness. That evil brat.

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,390
Even back when we were in school,

81
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,290
she always had the smartest move
when it came to evil things.

82
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,030
Old habits die hard.

83
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,230
Anyway, why didn't that person
tell you sooner?

84
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,440
Why wait
until the day of your wedding?

85
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,510
Who was this?

86
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,580
Are you okay, Mom?

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,050
You must be in a tough spot
because I called the wedding off.

88
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,610
Who cares about saving my face?

89
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,350
The more I think about it,
the more mad I am at this injustice.

90
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:51,560
If I could, I'd run over
to those two women...

91
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,760
and pull out all their hair.

92
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,500
Ha Na ruined my life. It's over.

93
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,340
It's not over yet.

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,850
I'm getting a headache.

95
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,520
Yes, Director Choi.

96
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,060
The wedding isn't off.

97
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,290
There was an issue,
so we had to postpone it.

98
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,230
I should've left you a text message,
but things were quite hectic.

99
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,400
All right. I'll reach out later.

100
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
Come on.

101
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
(Power Off)

102
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,050
It wasn't called off, but postponed?

103
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,490
But he knows
about my fake pregnancy.

104
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,650
What now?
Can you hold Jin Goo back?

105
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,260
We need to ask your aunt for help.

106
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,370
A fake pregnancy?

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,210
Come in.

108
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,850
I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

109
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,950
I'm speechless
with this ridiculousness.

110
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,620
She faked her pregnancy?

111
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,890
How did you know?

112
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,430
Did Ha Na tell you?
Was it that brat?

113
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,700
That's enough.
How dare you deceive me, too?

114
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,140
We weren't trying to deceive you.

115
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,710
She didn't fake
her pregnancy, though.

116
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,910
Well, she was pregnant,

117
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,450
but she lost her baby.

118
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,380
We were worried Jin Goo
would call off the wedding,

119
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,750
so we had to keep it quiet.

120
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,350
They can always have another baby.

121
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:07,590
Even so, how can he call this off
on the day of the wedding...

122
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,630
without talking to her?

123
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,830
Don't tell that lie to Jin Goo.

124
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,970
"That lie?"

125
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,200
What if he wants to go to the doctor
and confirm the miscarriage?

126
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,210
He must've had hard evidence
to call it off on the day.

127
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,440
What if he met with the doctor?

128
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,510
Did you bribe the doctor, too?

129
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,390
It's getting even more ridiculous.

130
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,920
Well, that was the wedding.

131
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,560
But what about Eun Chong's adoption?

132
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,890
My daughter's life is
about to be ruined for good.

133
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,360
Who cares about
the adoption falling through?

134
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,640
Yes, so she should marry quickly
to adopt him.

135
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,610
Ha Na is always
looking for a chance to take him,

136
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,740
so what if you lose him to her?

137
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,810
How's Se Young?

138
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,520
Jin Goo won't see me anymore, right?

139
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
Will he marry Ha Na?

140
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,800
I can't let them marry
and adopt Eun Chong.

141
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,500
No.

142
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,540
Hello?

143
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,540
Jin Goo.

144
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,480
I'm sorry.

145
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,580
Let's talk in person.

146
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,920
I'm in front of your place now.

147
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,950
Okay.

148
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,230
I'm sorry. It must've been shocking.

149
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,100
We weren't trying to deceive you
from the start.

150
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,830
I'll talk to Se Young
after I speak with the chairwoman.

151
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,870
Yes, sure.

152
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,720
I apologize for causing this shock.

153
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,850
It had to be worse for you.

154
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,450
And Ms. Sim must be in shock, too.

155
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,960
I understand how you feel.

156
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,960
Faking her pregnancy?

157
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,490
It's embarrassing
to say it out loud.

158
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,930
You must feel betrayed,

159
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,370
but she did this
because she wanted to be with you.

160
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,870
Can you forgive her this once?

161
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,610
Is this
because of Eun Chong's adoption?

162
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,240
I can't help it,
even if you call me selfish.

163
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:43,750
Eun Chong has a right to grow up
with wonderful parents.

164
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,650
Even if Se Young and I marry,
we won't be good parents for him.

165
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,890
Everyone will be miserable.

166
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,620
Eun Chong is
involved in this matter, too.

167
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,460
Why don't you give it time
instead of coming to a decision now?

168
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,570
I will not marry her
just to adopt Eun Chong.

169
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,900
If you're worried about him,
let him go with Ha Na.

170
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,070
You must stay...

171
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,940
on good terms with her for his sake.

172
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,740
I don't want to hear anything
about Ha Na.

173
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,080
Then, I have nothing more to say.

174
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,020
You seem to have changed.

175
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,590
Is it because of Ha Na?

176
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,760
I told you
I was disappointed in myself,

177
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,060
but frankly,

178
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,260
I was
also greatly disappointed in you.

179
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,860
That's all I'll say.

180
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,770
And I want this...

181
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,540
to be the last day
we speak of my marriage.

182
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,780
I hope what Yeo Jin says works.

183
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,380
Should I kneel?

184
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,020
Should I hold his leg
and drag him down?

185
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,790
Even pretend like
you'll kill yourself.

186
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,220
Come in.

187
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,830
Jin Goo, it's all my fault.

188
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,630
Se Young just did as I told her.

189
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,410
I'll kneel before your mom
and apologize.

190
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,210
I want to talk to Se Young.

191
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,340
Okay.

192
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,620
Jin Goo, I'm sorry.

193
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,830
I must've been crazy.

194
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,260
- Se Young.
- Yes?

195
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,000
We're over.

196
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:44,500
It's better to end it now
than become miserable...

197
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,600
after we marry.

198
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,840
No.

199
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,980
I dreamed of making a happy family
with you and Eun Chong.

200
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,310
You're only marrying me
because of Eun Chong.

201
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,080
There will be another way
to take Hyesung...

202
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,420
other than me.

203
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,790
We're done.

204
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,600
No. I can't give up on you.

205
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,240
No, you can't give up on Hyesung.

206
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Both Hyesung and you are dear to me.

207
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,210
No, only Hyesung is dear to you.

208
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,050
Let go of me.

209
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,050
- I won't.
- Se Young.

210
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,320
Just let me go now.

211
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,920
If you want to go, kill me first.

212
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,350
Why would I kill you?

213
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,230
I don't want to question
the good days we shared.

214
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,530
Let's end this on a good note.

215
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,360
There is no such thing
as a good breakup.

216
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,570
You can't go.

217
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,270
- Move aside.
- Kill me if you want to go.

218
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,260
Jin Goo, can we talk?

219
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,700
Please comfort Se Young.

220
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,270
You can't do this to her.

221
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,640
You can't leave like this...

222
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,840
after not showing up at your wedding
and making her miserable.

223
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,940
Console her before you leave.

224
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,680
Se Young and I are over.

225
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,880
There's nothing between us.

226
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,010
You should comfort your daughter.

227
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,820
Will you really be like this?

228
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Gosh, it's been so long
since I've been home.

229
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,860
Hey, there.

230
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,670
- Grandpa!
- Eun Chong.

231
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,740
Were you and Auntie Ha Na
at the wedding?

232
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,170
Yes, I was
supposed to be the flower boy,

233
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,210
but I couldn't do it.

234
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,780
I see.

235
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,580
We couldn't eat any food, either.
Right, Auntie?

236
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:10,880
Are you hungry?

237
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,650
We couldn't even eat lunch.

238
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,350
Yes, I'm hungry.

239
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,520
- I'll treat you to something good.
- Okay!

240
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,960
Come with us.

241
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,090
No, I'll get some rest.
You should go.

242
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,860
Get some rest, Auntie Ha Na.

243
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,200
Okay. Have fun.

244
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,360
Let's go.

245
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,240
Hey, Ji Seok.

246
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,250
Now?

247
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,180
It felt like I paid her back...

248
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,220
for everything she did to me
with interest on top.

249
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,990
It was exhilarating and gratifying.

250
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,020
- Really?
- Of course.

251
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,260
You should've seen my face
as I walked away...

252
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,900
with Se Young behind my back.

253
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:00,530
How was it for you?

254
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,500
I felt similar to how you felt.

255
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,400
- Really?
- Of course.

256
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,880
How do you
honestly feel about Se Young?

257
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,650
I get that you're using her
to get revenge.

258
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,020
But do you like her?

259
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,550
I'm not sure.

260
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,290
I'll think about it
after the revenge is over.

261
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:28,190
You said you'd do the same
about Eun Chong.

262
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,560
So, Se Young is
on par with Eun Chong.

263
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,700
No, that's not what I mean.

264
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,970
I don't think so.

265
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,940
When I show up as the chief auditor,

266
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,440
what kind of faces will
Chairwoman Shin, Hwang Jin Goo,

267
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,940
and Yoon Se Young make?

268
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,310
You'll want to take a photo
and cherish those faces forever.

269
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,620
Do you think
Chairwoman Shin will change...

270
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,750
if she finds out
we came in to get revenge?

271
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,660
I don't know.
People don't change that easily.

272
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,830
What animosity do...

273
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,230
Richard Han and Mr. Goo hold
to harass me like this?

274
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Did you find anything
after Mr. Goo's background check?

275
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,170
I found something odd.

276
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,540
Last time, his father's company was
called Youngshin Distribution,

277
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,140
but this time,
it changed into Youngshin Fashion.

278
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,750
"Youngshin Fashion?"

279
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,350
I'll look more into that business.

280
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,320
But I still have nothing
on Richard Han's personal information.

281
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,390
But people said he had gone around
helping victims of corporate raids.

282
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,430
He helped corporate raid victims?

283
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,000
I'll have to confirm
if the words are true.

284
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,500
I think I know...

285
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,800
why Richard Han
wants to take me down.

286
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,780
He could be one of the victims
of my corporate raids.

287
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,380
(No rain, no flowers.)

288
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,780
Eun Chong, your garden shows
that spring is really here.

289
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,220
No rain, no flowers.

290
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,920
What does that mean?

291
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,420
If it doesn't rain,
flowers don't bloom, either.

292
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,130
That's a wonderful saying.

293
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:14,160
Eun Chong,
are you not depressed anymore?

294
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,500
Will you be okay
even if Auntie Ha Na isn't with you?

295
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,540
It's okay
because we're always together,

296
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,840
even when we are apart.

297
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:24,140
I have a kids' phone now,

298
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,610
so I can call Ha Na...

299
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,050
and meet her
when I want to meet her.

300
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,550
May I call you, too?

301
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,450
Yes, should we exchange numbers?

302
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,590
Hey, that sounds great.

303
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Eun Chong, I'll meet your grandma...

304
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,460
and tell her everything...

305
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,530
about the Goo family.

306
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:51,100
I hope she hears me out...

307
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,740
and changes her attitude.

308
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,080
- What?
- What do you mean?

309
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,450
I'm sorry, Bang Ul.

310
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,650
I wasn't trying to deceive you.

311
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,120
Keep it short.

312
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,660
Well, we should meet.

313
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,030
You'll understand
once we talk in person...

314
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,290
I'll meet you
at their newlywed home tomorrow.

315
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,460
Do you want to do that?

316
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,700
Sure, I'll be there
whenever you can come.

317
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,440
All right. I'll see you then.

318
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,810
Are you meeting her tomorrow?

319
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,080
I'll do whatever it takes
to meet and convince her tomorrow.

320
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,350
- She faked her pregnancy?
- She faked her pregnancy?

321
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,650
Yes, she couldn't even enter
the wedding hall.

322
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,560
Goodness, that girl is something.

323
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,190
I mean, that woman is quite amazing.

324
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,200
This was
Hwang Jin Goo's punishment, too.

325
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,360
He deceived Ha Na
and said she was a fake daughter,

326
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,770
then he got deceived
with a fake pregnancy.

327
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,900
Serves him right.

328
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,140
Hey, how can you compare
some wedding to Ha Na's thing?

329
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:04,210
Also, Hwang Jin Goo was saved
from ruining his life,

330
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,340
whereas Ha Na
had to hit rock bottom.

331
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:10,150
You're right.
I didn't think that through.

332
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,920
If the wedding is off,
Se Young can't adopt Eun Chong.

333
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,020
This means Ha Na has a chance!

334
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,960
Oh, my. You're right.

335
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,390
This means we might raise
Hyesung's successor.

336
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,630
Hey, Danny.

337
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,430
You can be a part of Hyesung
if you marry me.

338
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,300
"A part of Hyesung?"

339
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,010
How did you reach that conclusion?

340
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,380
Girl, you're something.

341
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,650
Eun Chong.

342
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,150
I won't be there tomorrow
when you return from school...

343
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,020
to your grandma's home.

344
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,260
Why not?

345
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,160
I told you before, right?

346
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,960
That I'd stay only for a month.

347
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,230
Has it already been a month?

348
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,170
Then, did we escape successfully?

349
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,070
Not yet.

350
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,070
There's one last important thing
I must do,

351
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:11,840
and we have to stay apart
during that time.

352
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,080
Can I just live here?

353
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,280
Later.

354
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,020
The lying game isn't over yet.

355
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,950
I see.

356
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,390
But you and I can
talk on the phone every single day.

357
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,920
Can you be brave
while you wait for me?

358
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,260
Yes.

359
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,830
I'm sorry
for leaving that place alone.

360
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,170
Then, promise that
you'll come for me.

361
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,710
I promise.

362
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,520
Can I really keep this promise?

363
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,630
Stop right there!

364
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,480
I've lived my entire life
just to get Hyesung.

365
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,380
If I lose it, I'll just kill myself.

366
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,120
Se Young...

367
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,390
won't give up on Hyesung.

368
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,940
It's been a month.

369
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,140
I'll leave just as I promised.

370
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,840
So, will Eun Chong be fine
without you?

371
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,910
Yes.

372
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,050
From now on,
you need to respect him as a person.

373
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,480
He may be your grandson,
but he's not your possession.

374
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,260
If you keep treating him like that,
his depression may relapse.

375
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
Are you blaming
his depression on me?

376
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,160
He became depressed
after moving here.

377
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,090
So, who else's fault is it?

378
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,360
I'm not here
to place the blame on you.

379
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,870
But you need to earn
Eun Chong's heart first...

380
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,740
if you want to get along with him.

381
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,740
You seemed unaware of such basics,
so I wanted to give you a tip.

382
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:26,840
I'll pack up and leave.

383
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,880
Yeo Jin!

384
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,450
She's the culprit.

385
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:40,360
She was the one who told Jin Goo
about her fake pregnancy.

386
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,960
- Is that true?
- Yes.

387
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,430
I thought of keeping it quiet,

388
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,370
but it hit my conscience very hard
on the day of the wedding.

389
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,170
Why should Mr. Hwang
get into a marriage like that?

390
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,870
You.

391
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,770
Who do you think you are
to ruin my daughter's life?

392
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:01,910
Why do you think
only her life is valuable?

393
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,710
Why do you reckon
another man's life is a joke?

394
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,950
You little...

395
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,450
Did you just hit me?

396
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,050
Have you lost your mind?

397
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,890
Yes, I've lost my mind.

398
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,860
So, stop messing with me.

399
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,490
Goodness.

400
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,160
Why does this family
always blame the others...

401
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,670
after they do something wrong?

402
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,270
The eldest of the family is
doing that,

403
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,170
so her minions will
never learn any better.

404
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,740
"Minions?"

405
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,480
There's the other minion.

406
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,510
You little...

407
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,780
Come here.

408
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,220
- Just talk it out.
- No, Mom! Let go of me.

409
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,160
Who do you think you are
to ruin my wedding?

410
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,720
Who do you think you are
to ruin my life?

411
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,760
I may have ruined your life,

412
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,260
but I saved Mr. Hwang's life.

413
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,600
No, never mind.

414
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,570
You ruined your life.

415
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,240
Stop blaming others.

416
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,600
Everyone, enough!

417
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,410
Why are you all making this scene?

418
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,340
Why did you fake your pregnancy
to begin with?

419
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,840
Stop causing more problems
and calm down.

420
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,080
You need to pack up and go.

421
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,550
Let her go quietly.

422
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,790
Don't rub her the wrong way
and make her more spiteful.

423
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,230
You dropped it on the day
of my wedding on purpose.

424
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,230
You wanted to do it
when I was the happiest.

425
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,400
You did the same to me.

426
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,400
You exposed me as a fake daughter...

427
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,070
on the day I would've been happiest,

428
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,570
the day I was to go public
as Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

429
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,280
Do you have evidence
that I was behind it?

430
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,780
I have more than enough evidence.

431
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,880
Wait, are you...

432
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,050
trying to work things out
with Jin Goo?

433
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,920
He was the one
who made you the fake daughter.

434
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,150
- How is that possible?
- I wonder.

435
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:50,390
That's one thing that bothers me,

436
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,420
but I like Mr. Hwang.

437
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,860
I won't have to fight my feelings
because of someone.

438
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,560
I won't let that happen.

439
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,300
I won't go down alone.

440
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,770
Watch and see
who I take down with me.

441
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,270
Do you really think this is the end?

442
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,900
What?

443
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,910
Look forward to it, Se Young.

444
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,510
You'll be my first target...

445
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,750
as soon as I take office.

446
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,490
Ha Na, who do you think you are
to take what's mine?

447
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,730
Jin Goo, Eun Chong,
and Hyesung Group are all mine!

448
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,500
I'll have them all.

449
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,570
(Jin Goo)

450
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,310
Darn it!

451
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,520
Goodness.

452
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,120
Hello?

453
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,490
Did you get home safely?

454
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:01,860
I'm sorry
for making you come in vain.

455
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,400
It's off. The bride had a problem.

456
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,230
I'll tell you later.

457
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,670
All right. Bye.

458
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,370
I can't just turn off my phone.

459
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,880
Hey.

460
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,610
Goodness.

461
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,410
What are you up to, Mom?

462
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,150
I'm about to take out the garbage.

463
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,180
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

464
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,220
I'm throwing out
everything Se Young brought.

465
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,260
I don't care if she cries a river
and does the most ridiculous thing.

466
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,190
You cannot feel weak.

467
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,430
- That won't happen.
- You never know.

468
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,460
That sly Myung Ji is behind her.

469
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,520
Hello?

470
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,860
Mr. Hwang, can we meet right now?

471
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,940
(Se Young)

472
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,240
- Hello?
- Jin Goo.

473
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,180
- What?
- Where are you?

474
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,610
I came to the newlywed home
to get my things, then came out.

475
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,250
Already?

476
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,690
You're here.

477
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,490
I ran late. I'm sorry.

478
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,620
Ha Na?

479
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,430
He went to our newlywed home,
then came out to meet her?

480
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,960
- Bye.
- Hello?

481
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,600
Darn it.

482
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,170
I like Mr. Hwang.

483
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,170
I won't have to fight my feelings
because of someone.

484
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,880
They're meeting just one day
after the wedding was called off?

485
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
If I can't have him,
I can't have him.

486
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,420
But I won't let
Ha Na have him, either.

487
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,060
I was going to call you, too.

488
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:25,600
I thought you'd want to know
why I did that.

489
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,440
I also felt bad
for not telling you sooner.

490
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,740
I apologize for dropping the news...

491
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:36,550
on the day of your wedding,
even though I knew it before.

492
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,310
Why did you go that far?

493
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,620
To get revenge.

494
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,250
I'm sorry for using you
to get my revenge.

495
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,190
Aren't I a part of your revenge?

496
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,320
Se Young is at fault,

497
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,990
but I'm also greatly responsible.

498
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,260
In a way, it feels like...

499
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,630
you saved me from...

500
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,170
getting into the wrong marriage.

501
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,610
If that's how you want to take it,
then go ahead.

502
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,740
Instead, you can
take advantage of me from now on.

503
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,380
You want to take Eun Chong back.

504
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:13,680
I felt all kinds of things
after what happened yesterday.

505
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,120
Shock. Betrayal. Rage.

506
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:21,820
Dejection. Grudge. Regret.

507
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,660
And sorriness.

508
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,800
Then, I thought of you.

509
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,870
How would you have felt...

510
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,270
when you found out
you were her fake daughter?

511
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:39,040
The shock and pain must've been
incomparable to me.

512
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,010
I realized my pain was nothing
compared to you.

513
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,120
If you can use me
to get your revenge, do it.

514
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,950
I'll gladly take part.

515
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,590
You don't know how I'll use you.
Do you really dare to say that?

516
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,790
I don't know.

517
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,800
But what I do know is...

518
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,770
I want to do something for you,

519
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,100
especially so if it'll help you
get Eun Chong back.

520
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,210
Jin Goo.

521
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,020
He just took his stuff and left?

522
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:43,610
I can't end it like this.

523
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:50,450
Will your revenge end...

524
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,050
after you take Eun Chong back?

525
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,780
- No.
- Then?

526
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,920
I still have to get
my biggest revenge.

527
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,430
(Se Young)

528
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,540
- You should check.
- I'm sorry.

529
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,880
I'll kill myself!

530
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,940
(I'll kill myself!)

531
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,380
What's wrong?

532
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,080
Se Young...

533
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,450
Se Young!

534
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,920
Se Young, wake up.

535
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,350
(Cinderella Game)

536
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:39,620
- You've gone insane to get revenge.
- I put my life into this.

537
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,260
Ha Na is getting her revenge on me?

538
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,230
Why don't you
send Eun Chong abroad to study?

539
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,430
- What now? You brat.
- My gosh! Bang Ul!

540
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,760
This must be a bolt out of the blue
for Ms. Yoon while she's away.

541
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,200
Have you seen the article?

542
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,430
Was it that brat again?

543
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,070
You know Jin Goo likes you, right?
How do you feel about him?

544
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,870
Was this person
related to Du Na's accident?

545
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,170
That's what I want to find out.

546
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,370
I'll take Hyesung.

547
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,340
Once you take it,
will you give it to me?

548
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,510
Only if you agree to join me.
