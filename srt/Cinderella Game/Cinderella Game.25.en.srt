1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,140
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,679
Should I go inside?

5
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:12,150
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,089
There's Eun Chong, Ms. Chairwoman.

7
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,370
Eun Chong.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,740
It's me, Grandma.

9
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:36,340
Please look up at me.

10
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,579
Ms. Chairwoman,
do you want to get out and meet him?

11
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:50,010
Eun Chong!

12
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,150
Auntie!

13
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:55,689
Why were you out here
in this cold weather?

14
00:01:55,689 --> 00:01:56,959
I was waiting for you.

15
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:58,189
Let's go to the supermarket.

16
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,430
Okay. Let's go there
and eat chicken, your favorite.

17
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,459
Okay!

18
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:06,000
Right. The landlady was here.

19
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,370
The landlady?

20
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,599
We can't find a home
in just a month.

21
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,710
The prices changed drastically
compared to four years ago,

22
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:16,770
- and the days are cold.
- That's what I'm saying.

23
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:18,780
Is she telling us
to leave Gyeonggi Province...

24
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,150
and go even more north
in this freezing winter?

25
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,080
Can we talk to the new homeowners
and stay...

26
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,819
But it's just not enough time.

27
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:31,090
We still have a while left
on our lease.

28
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,599
What am I going to do, Jin Goo?

29
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,469
I can't go into Eun Chong's life,

30
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,300
but I also can't just sit back.

31
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,599
You can watch how things unfold
and think about what you'll do.

32
00:02:45,969 --> 00:02:48,610
I'll keep you updated
on Eun Chong...

33
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,169
through Ms. Goo.

34
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,080
But he grew up well
with a warm family,

35
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:55,680
receiving lots of love.

36
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,780
He did. It seems so.

37
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,030
Ms. Chairwoman,
Eun Chong came back out.

38
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,669
Come, now.

39
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,650
It's me. Can we meet now?

40
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,419
Let's eat lunch.

41
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,789
We have to get tofu.

42
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,229
This one? Do you want this?

43
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,810
Do you want to go and talk to him?

44
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:56,069
Will it be all right?

45
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,479
I'll pretend
like it's a coincidence.

46
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,219
Put it inside. Let's go.

47
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,120
Ms. Goo.

48
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,659
It's Mr. President.

49
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,889
- Hello.
- Hi, Eun Chong.

50
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,100
- Did you go home safely last night?
- Yes.

51
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,939
I gave your coat to your mother.

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,339
Right. I see.

53
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,639
I'm here with the chairwoman.

54
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,310
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

55
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,180
Hello.

56
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,550
You're the chairwoman
of Auntie Ha Na's workplace.

57
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,959
Hello!

58
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,230
Yes. Hello, Eun Chong.

59
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,029
Hey, you didn't forget my name.

60
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,370
Of course not.

61
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,470
How can I forget such a pretty name
like Eun Chong?

62
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:13,350
If you're free,
do you want to eat lunch together?

63
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:31,240
Do all of these taste different?

64
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,610
Yes, everyone can eat
whatever flavor they want.

65
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,379
It's hot, so eat slowly
and chew well.

66
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,980
Auntie, you should eat, too.

67
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,180
Thank you for lunch.

68
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:46,379
Sure.

69
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,790
Did you say
his mother was your friend?

70
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,029
- You two must've been close.
- Yes.

71
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:57,699
My mommy
and Auntie Ha Na were besties.

72
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,699
Do you know what that means?

73
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,730
- Best friends?
- Yes.

74
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,500
Ji Soo is my bestie.

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,939
- Really? Is she a girl?
- Yes.

76
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,910
Ms. Chairwoman.

77
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,939
Do you have a bestie?

78
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,449
No, I don't have any friends.

79
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,389
I can be your friend.

80
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:25,790
Auntie Ha Na said...

81
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,759
people could be friends
regardless of age.

82
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,730
- Isn't that so, Auntie Ha Na?
- Yes.

83
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,529
If you want to befriend someone,
you can be friends with anyone.

84
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,199
If you and the chairwoman
become friends,

85
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:42,639
you'll be on Guinness World Records
as friends with the biggest age gap.

86
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,139
Gosh.

87
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,019
Try some.

88
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:14,709
You got lots of groceries.

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,579
Tomorrow is
my parents' memorial service.

90
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,410
They were Grandma and Grandpa to me,

91
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,850
although I've only seen them
in pictures.

92
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,519
Do you feel unwell?

93
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,360
No, I need to go
to the ladies' room.

94
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,459
Ms. Chairwoman, are you all right?

95
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,399
Yes, you don't have to follow me.

96
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,170
I'll go.

97
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,620
Ms. Chairwoman.

98
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,389
Are you all right?

99
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,230
Do you feel unwell?

100
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,730
You seem troubled.

101
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:13,500
Ms. Chairwoman...

102
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,100
I had trouble controlling
my feelings.

104
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,910
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do to help.

105
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,820
- Ms. Goo.
- Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

106
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,700
Thank you.

107
00:09:02,179 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm glad you're brave and smart,
Eun Chong.

108
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,950
- All of a sudden?
- Yes.

109
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:11,090
You've been looking
for your grandma, right?

110
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,759
What do you want to do
when you meet her?

111
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,460
I'm not sure.

112
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,330
- You haven't thought about it?
- No.

113
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:21,070
It's not going to be that easy
to find my grandma.

114
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,370
I don't have to find her.

115
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,000
All I need is Auntie Ha Na.

116
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,809
- Do you like her that much?
- Yes.

117
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:29,809
She's the best!

118
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,980
Mr. President,
are you getting married?

119
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,450
- All of a sudden?
- I suddenly got curious.

120
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,879
Yes, I am. Why?

121
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,490
I see. So, it's true.

122
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,440
You knew of a place like this?

123
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,299
You're here.

124
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,309
Hey.

125
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,279
I came here from time to time
while my parents were still here.

126
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,710
- The place is 40 years old.
- I see.

127
00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:12,980
Thank you for inviting me
to a wonderful restaurant.

128
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,820
I hope you'll like it.

129
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,090
Yes, I love something like this.

130
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,389
- Do you still travel these days?
- Yes.

131
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:22,889
I travel here and there
and live a leisurely life.

132
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,100
You were that handsome young man
who came last time.

133
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,100
You must've come
with your father today.

134
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:32,100
Yes, he's my son.

135
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:34,740
Enjoy.

136
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,080
The seasoned chives
and radish kimchi are great here.

137
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,519
I could tell
why you'd miss this flavor.

138
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,929
Let me also do this
for the first time in a while.

139
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,399
So, is something going on?

140
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:08,070
No, it's nothing.

141
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,539
Yes, tomorrow is
your parents' death anniversary, right?

142
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,909
Yes, you remembered.

143
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,679
Your siblings would
all get together.

144
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,990
Right. Did you say your older sister
works at Hyesung Tour?

145
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:24,460
- Yes.
- You two seemed quite close.

146
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,690
Why don't you two live together?

147
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,889
I was too indebted to her,

148
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:29,889
so I didn't think
I could live with her.

149
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,559
- When I see her...
- Does your heart break?

150
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:43,440
Ms. Goo worked as a tour guide
to raise Eun Chong...

151
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,740
and her siblings all alone.

152
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,610
- What's your sister's name?
- Goo Ha Na, sir.

153
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,820
Are you all right?

154
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,549
Yes, I'm fine.

155
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,990
Right. I'll look for a place
for you to stay, sir.

156
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,460
It must feel uncomfortable
to live at a hotel for too long.

157
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,789
I'll find my own place.

158
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,600
You'll do that yourself?

159
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:07,129
I have the most time on my hands.

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,029
Yes, sir.

161
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,269
Ji Seok's older sister was
the one who raised Eun Chong?

162
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,490
Thank you.

163
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,330
Did she cry
because she thought of her daughter?

164
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,899
So, why did she thank me?

165
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,899
You had lunch with the chairwoman?

166
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,870
Were you dreaming
in the broad daylight?

167
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,009
You don't seem feverish.
Why are you talking nonsense?

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,980
It's true.

169
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:57,080
And President Hwang was there, too.

170
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,019
Do you know who Auntie Ha Na
ate pork belly with yesterday?

171
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,149
- Hwang Jin Goo?
- Bingo.

172
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,289
But he's getting married.

173
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:07,360
I know.

174
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:11,700
She's from an affluent family,
and she's freaking...

175
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,669
She's very beautiful.

176
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,940
Anyway, why did you look
so discouraged?

177
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,870
Auntie Ha Na is the prettiest.

178
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:28,879
Wait, were you trying to make
Ha Na and Mr. Hwang date?

179
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,279
You're so ridiculous.

180
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,720
Hey, Ha Na and Mr. Hwang have...

181
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,820
just an employee-boss relationship,
nothing more. Wake up.

182
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,129
Call Ji Eun and ask
when she'll come tomorrow.

183
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,159
Okay.

184
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:46,460
Ha Na, how did you end up
eating lunch with the chairwoman?

185
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:49,799
We ran into each other by chance,
and she invited us to lunch.

186
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,070
The chairwoman must have
her eyes on you.

187
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:57,240
She got you that dress
and treated you to lunch.

188
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,009
- What if she buys you a house...
- Stop talking nonsense and call.

189
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,110
Okay.

190
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,450
You must be tired
after your trip to the temple.

191
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,259
Should I draw a bath?

192
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,860
- I'll get some rest first.
- Okay.

193
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,330
Yeo Jin, what's that on your hand?

194
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,299
It's my present.

195
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,639
A boy monk put it on me
at the temple.

196
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,379
You should take it off.

197
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,080
Get some rest, then.

198
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,500
Yu Jin, I met Eun Chong today.

199
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,740
You couldn't have...

200
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,509
passed away in peace,
leaving that precious boy behind.

201
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,409
My heart just breaks
to think of you.

202
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,419
Why did you have to pass away...

203
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,419
in that dreadful accident
and leave Eun Chong here?

204
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,429
Mommy will find the culprit.

205
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:28,570
And I'll do it for Eun Chong, too.

206
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,450
I'll use Eun Chong's hair
and your hair...

207
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,950
to run a DNA parentage test.

208
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,389
I don't have to do the test.
I already know.

209
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,460
He is my grandson.

210
00:15:55,129 --> 00:15:56,289
I should...

211
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,429
bring Eun Chong home.

212
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:03,730
The child's safety is
the most important.

213
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,669
He may fall into danger
if people find out...

214
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,840
that he is your grandson.

215
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,340
I'll find a way to bring him home...

216
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,149
without telling people
that he's my grandson.

217
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,320
She wasn't at the temple?

218
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,860
Right. I must've been confused.

219
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,460
She planned to go,

220
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,860
but something came up,
and she had to reschedule.

221
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,929
All right. Goodbye.

222
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:41,370
Where did she go with Jin Goo
if not the temple?

223
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,110
Just wait until I open the safe.

224
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,909
Are you at Jin Goo's place?

225
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,450
Aunt Yeo Jin wasn't at the temple.

226
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:56,950
She lied again?

227
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,419
Try to persuade Jin Goo
to tell you everything.

228
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:02,490
Bye.

229
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:06,299
- You're here.
- Hey.

230
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,730
- Where's my mom?
- She's in the kitchen.

231
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:15,910
What are you up to, Mom?

232
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,109
You're here.

233
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,609
Se Young likes braised ribs,
so I'm making some.

234
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,880
You should ask her to help.

235
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,150
Don't say anything.
She doesn't know how to cook.

236
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,119
It'll be much faster
for me to do this alone.

237
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,019
Mom, we can eat this tomorrow.
Let's go out for dinner.

238
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,089
Do you want shabu shabu?
You love that.

239
00:17:32,089 --> 00:17:33,490
I'm done cooking.
Why should we go out?

240
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,589
Go and wash up.

241
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:39,900
Hey, she got me a cashmere coat.

242
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,200
It was really nice.

243
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,670
Really?

244
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:52,680
Were you at the temple until now?

245
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,410
It takes her a while
to finish all 3,000 bows.

246
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,750
Has she recently heard
an update on Yu Jin?

247
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:03,349
She didn't mention anything. Why?

248
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:04,960
She suddenly seemed to be busy.

249
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,490
She was visiting her customers
and the temple.

250
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,559
Again, she only took you
to the temple today.

251
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:12,930
Some may see that and think
you're her nephew.

252
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,430
It's because
I'm easier to order around.

253
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,869
You're a princess,
and I'm a servant.

254
00:18:17,869 --> 00:18:19,369
You'll continue to lie to me?

255
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:21,869
You can't do this to me, Jin Goo.

256
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,309
You're just a servant.

257
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,680
I want to go with her
whenever she goes to the temple.

258
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:28,880
And everywhere else, too.

259
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,519
- Okay?
- That'd be great for me.

260
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,250
You should talk to the chairwoman.

261
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,450
You can tell me
where to go in advance.

262
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,390
I can decide
what her schedule will be.

263
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,289
And she has
lots of undisclosed meetings, too.

264
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:41,490
So, you'll continue
to treat me like an outcast?

265
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,759
What's wrong?

266
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,730
You were with Goo Ha Na yesterday.

267
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:48,630
She brought your coat back.

268
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,630
Yes.

269
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,269
I felt bad for the Dubai contract,
so I offered to treat her to a meal.

270
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:54,369
I heard.

271
00:18:55,069 --> 00:18:57,069
- But, why did you lie?
- What?

272
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,609
You said you left your coat
in the car.

273
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,410
You gave it to her
to use instead of an umbrella.

274
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:04,980
I didn't want you to be concerned.

275
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:06,319
It wasn't important anyway.

276
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,519
Why would I care
about someone trivial like her?

277
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,950
Why do you say it like that?

278
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,420
What's wrong
with calling her trivial?

279
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,859
Are you taking her side?

280
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,990
This is why you
keep making me look weird.

281
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:19,029
You told me not to care,
but you kept making me concerned.

282
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:20,500
My mom is here. Lower your voice.

283
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,170
- I'm sorry.
- Get your act straight.

284
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,569
Trust can collapse in an instant.

285
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:28,509
If a man takes his coat off
for a woman in the rain,

286
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,440
it will look like
he has ulterior motives.

287
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,109
And it wasn't something
for an engaged man to do.

288
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,650
Goodness, what's wrong?

289
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,049
- Are you two in a fight?
- No, Mom.

290
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:44,690
No, Mother. We were just talking.

291
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:48,359
The man always has to be good
to the woman.

292
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:49,990
Okay.

293
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,029
The braised ribs are done.
Come on out.

294
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,460
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

295
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,029
Okay.

296
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,769
I'm sorry. There was no umbrella,

297
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,069
so I gave it to her as one
without meaning anything.

298
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,180
I should've thought it through.

299
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,380
Did you two put it over yourselves
and run in the rain?

300
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,109
This isn't a drama.

301
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:11,319
Be careful if you don't want to be
in some kind of a soap opera.

302
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,049
If people begin to talk
about you two, I won't let it go.

303
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,589
There's nothing to talk about.

304
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:29,029
Yes, Ms. Jang.

305
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:31,400
The chairwoman?

306
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,240
Sung Ho, I met Eun Chong.

307
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:38,240
I have no idea...

308
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,009
what I can do for him
and how I can do it.

309
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,680
You are in America, right?

310
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,720
Come back to Korea.

311
00:20:45,819 --> 00:20:48,490
Stop sending me letters,
and let's talk in person.

312
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:50,950
I want to live with Eun Chong.

313
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,460
So, please reply to me, Sung Ho.

314
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,390
We couldn't keep Yu Jin safe,

315
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,759
but we must do that for Eun Chong.

316
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,700
(Send)

317
00:21:03,869 --> 00:21:05,940
(Your e-mail has been sent.)

318
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,710
Come in.

319
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:19,220
Mr. Hwang will deliver the food
for the memorial service tomorrow.

320
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,750
Have you tracked where Sung Ho
sent the message from?

321
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:25,259
I just received a call.

322
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,960
Where was he?

323
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,829
It was the same as the e-mail.
He sent the message from America.

324
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,230
Why is he still in America
while Eun Chong is here?

325
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,910
I want to live with Eun Chong.

326
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,240
So, please reply to me, Sung Ho.

327
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,650
We couldn't keep Yu Jin safe,

328
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,750
but we must do that for Eun Chong.

329
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,750
Yeo Jin.

330
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,059
Do you know who raised our grandson?

331
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:03,859
She is the daughter of a family you ruined
by doing evil things.

332
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:05,630
She had no idea...

333
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,230
she took in
the blood of her sworn enemy.

334
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:14,099
- How could you let this happen?
- It's still far from now.

335
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,940
What will happen to Eun Chong
from now on?

336
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,079
It's so pretty.

337
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,410
What will happen...

338
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,910
to Eun Chong?

339
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,630
What did Jin Goo say?

340
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,460
He just repeated the same thing.

341
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,329
It kills my pride to ask him now.

342
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,329
That cheap punk.

343
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,170
I'll make sure he speaks.

344
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:47,970
Just open that safe quickly.

345
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,970
I found a technician.

346
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:52,339
I'll open it when she isn't home.

347
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,109
Anyway, how are we
less trustworthy...

348
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:57,880
than Jin Goo or Ms. Jang?

349
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,420
After all, we're still related.

350
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:02,619
If you do this,
you will pay for it, Yeo Jin.

351
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,920
You have a plan B, right?

352
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,089
We can't just sit around and take it
if Aunt Yeo Jin betrays us.

353
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,589
It'd be too late
by the time she betrayed us.

354
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:12,400
You must always give
the first blow in a fight.

355
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,470
And stab that first blow
right in their back.

356
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,240
Jin Goo won't betray us, will he?

357
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,009
Betrayal isn't for everyone.

358
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:29,250
Yeo Jin wouldn't have brought him up
if she thought he could do that.

359
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,980
She only cared that
he was honest and smart.

360
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,019
That was why
I chose him as your spouse.

361
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,450
Are you sure he's honest?

362
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,920
Is there a problem?

363
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
It's Goo Ha Na.

364
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,160
I can't believe it,
but she's hitting on Jin Goo.

365
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,700
She's going around
flirting with him all the time.

366
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,460
He got caught up
and didn't even realize...

367
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,769
he stepped over the line.

368
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,170
That brat.

369
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,470
Did something happen
between those two?

370
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:57,440
Where are we going to move to
in this freezing season?

371
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,079
Lease or rent in Gyeonggi Province,
two rooms.

372
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,619
(Key money: 98,000 dollars
Rent: 970 dollars)

373
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:07,950
Why are they all so expensive?

374
00:24:08,819 --> 00:24:11,420
Gosh. What am I going to do?

375
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:16,430
Auntie, why are you lying down?

376
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:19,099
- Are you tired?
- What?

377
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,829
A little.

378
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,839
Should I give you a massage?

379
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,799
- Really?
- Lie down.

380
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,240
Okay.

381
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,309
All right.

382
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:37,210
Gosh, that feels good.

383
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,880
You're so good, Eun Chong.

384
00:24:40,349 --> 00:24:42,819
- I can make it feel even better.
- Okay.

385
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,319
- Gosh.
- Okay.

386
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,190
Gosh, I feel like
my fatigue is melting.

387
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,559
Eun Chong's feet are great remedies

388
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,000
They feel so good

389
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,730
You're so good at this, Eun Chong.

390
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:02,140
Up here, too.
Can you get me up here? Gosh.

391
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,549
Try one.

392
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,619
It's good!

393
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,190
Goodness,
I might run out of cooking oil.

394
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,690
I have to make
battered meatballs, too.

395
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,099
I'll go and buy another bottle.

396
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,099
You should go with Uncle Ji Chang.

397
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,000
- Thanks.
- Okay.

398
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:32,970
The house is up for sale?

399
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,369
What about the tenants?

400
00:25:35,369 --> 00:25:37,009
They'll have to move.

401
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,779
The landlady asked them
to move out within a month.

402
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,049
Why were you in the restroom
for so long today?

403
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:50,220
- One big cooking oil, please.
- Go in and pick it up.

404
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,250
Okay.

405
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,720
Yes, this young man lives
in that home with wooden gates...

406
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,059
He was here just now.

407
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,730
Anyway, I hear
your family is moving.

408
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:04,299
Yes, but the housing prices
have gone up so much,

409
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,500
so I was worried.

410
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,069
My gosh.
Why should you worry about that?

411
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:11,470
Goodness.

412
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:20,049
My gosh.
What brings you here, Mr. Hwang?

413
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,950
The chairwoman sent these.

414
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,420
You said today was
your parents' memorial service.

415
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,589
The chairwoman?

416
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,859
I shouldn't have said that.

417
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,029
Don't worry about it.

418
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,500
Mr. President.

419
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,569
Hi, Eun Chong.

420
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,099
Hello.

421
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:41,569
Hello.

422
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,710
You visit your subordinate's house
rather often.

423
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:44,980
What brings you here?

424
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,440
The chairwoman sent food
for the memorial service.

425
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,549
No way. She's totally digging you.

426
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,079
You might end up dating her!

427
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,250
Goodbye, then.

428
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,890
Mr. Hwang, one moment.

429
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,829
Ha Na had always been the type
that elders love,

430
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,660
but the chairwoman was
much more than I expected.

431
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:08,599
Goodbye.

432
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,539
Mr. President,
is your girlfriend pretty?

433
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:21,109
I've never seen anyone
prettier than Auntie Ha Na.

434
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:24,980
Auntie Ha Na is
all you care about, right?

435
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,450
What if...

436
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,359
And it's a big if.

437
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:36,190
If you find your grandma...

438
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:39,700
and she wants to live with you,

439
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,930
what will you do?

440
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,900
Auntie Ha Na, Grandma,
and I can all live together.

441
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,069
I see. You're right.

442
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,769
You're so smart.

443
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:55,750
Mr. Hwang, I packed some food.

444
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,450
I wasn't sure if you ate the dishes
made for memorial services.

445
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:01,619
I enjoy them. They're delicious.

446
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:03,720
Then, please share it
with your mother.

447
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,990
I always get something
whenever I'm here.

448
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,589
Thank you.

449
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,630
Oh, hello.

450
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,200
Who's that?

451
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:14,500
She's my younger sister.

452
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,430
I see. Nice to meet you.

453
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,900
Nice to meet you, too.

454
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,700
Is Ji Seok not here yet?

455
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,970
Mom, Dad. It's me, Ji Seok.

456
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:27,009
I'm sorry I'm late.

457
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:28,140
(The late Goo Young Min,
The late Cha Eun Jung)

458
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:31,579
You know I became the head director
of Hyesung Group, right?

459
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:33,720
Hyesung Group is...

460
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,220
Shin Yeo Jin's business.

461
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,420
(The late Goo Young Min,
The late Cha Eun Jung)

462
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,359
I'll get your revenge soon
and expose your unfair death,

463
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,460
so please...

464
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,359
wait a little longer.

465
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,779
Hey, turn it off.

466
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,440
That's Mom's theme song.

467
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,750
She loved it
whenever Ha Na played this.

468
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,450
She must've loved it so much...

469
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,980
if she asked us to play this
during her memorial services.

470
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,450
This song always reminds me
of the day they passed away,

471
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,619
so I hate it!

472
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:14,619
You may hate it, but Mom likes it.

473
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,230
Hey, what are you doing? Come on.

474
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,869
- Don't turn it off.
- Darn it.

475
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,829
If you don't want to hear it,
cover your ears or leave!

476
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,069
You always annoy me like this
at their memorial service!

477
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:49,490
I love your "Nocturne" the best.

478
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,400
It may not be fancy,

479
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:55,400
but it's stylish and classy.

480
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,170
You're such a biased mom.

481
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:03,170
After I pass away, please play this
at my memorial services.

482
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,519
Mom, Dad.

483
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,150
Ji Seok is coming today.

484
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,720
You'll get to see your eldest son
for the first time in five years.

485
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:31,130
Light up the incense
and the candles.

486
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,700
Okay.

487
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,470
Ji Seok is here.

488
00:30:36,009 --> 00:30:38,269
Hello, Uncle Ji Seok.

489
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,710
You're here.

490
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,319
What are you talking about?

491
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,490
Chairwoman Shin sent us what?

492
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,089
Food for the memorial service.

493
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:27,859
Fruit, drinks, and meat.

494
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,660
And they were top-grade beef.

495
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,960
Why would she do that?

496
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,160
I ran into her
at the supermarket yesterday...

497
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,430
and mentioned it was
my parents' memorial service today.

498
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,000
She remembered that
and sent it to me.

499
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:39,000
It's such a burden.

500
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,069
Did you...

501
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,009
Did you say the food she sent was
dedicated to Mom and Dad?

502
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:46,740
Mom and Dad are in for such a treat.

503
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:04,420
(Cinderella Game)

504
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,160
You'd be a better fit
as Chairwoman Shin's assistant...

505
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,490
than the president of Hyesung Tour.

506
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,460
The two had a closer relationship
than an actual mom and her son.

507
00:33:11,529 --> 00:33:13,730
Her nephew must be a troublemaker.

508
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,829
Look more into it.

509
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,230
And find out more
about her reputation.

510
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,430
Tell me what it is.

511
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,269
Nothing will change
even if you find out, Ha Na.

512
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,569
Find a way to bring Eun Chong home
as soon as possible.

513
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:25,240
I have no idea
how to resolve this tragedy.

514
00:33:25,609 --> 00:33:26,880
I have high hopes.

515
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,140
I'm also looking forward
to seeing...

516
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,480
how our ill-fated relationship
will end.
