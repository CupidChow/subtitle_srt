00:00:05,242 --> 00:00:06,572
(Episode 1)

2
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:10,483
There are three bears in a house

3
00:00:10,613 --> 00:00:14,512
Daddy bear, mommy bear, baby bear

4
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:18,623
Daddy bear is fat

5
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:22,593
Mommy bear is slim

6
00:00:22,922 --> 00:00:26,523
Baby bear is too cute

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:30,163
Shrug, shrug, great job

8
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:31,663
Wake up, you punk.

9
00:00:32,562 --> 00:00:33,672
- Good grief. - Ouch.

10
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,733
You were here dozing off?

11
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,303
You'll end up burning the stew!

12
00:00:38,642 --> 00:00:39,902
No, Mother.

13
00:00:39,903 --> 00:00:42,773
Jeez. Hurry up and make me a meal.

14
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:44,712
Yes, Mother.

15
00:00:47,653 --> 00:00:50,181
You keep mooching these off me.

16
00:00:50,182 --> 00:00:51,452
How annoying.

17
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:53,182
I can't let you become pretty all alone.

18
00:00:57,493 --> 00:00:59,123
- It was so great. - How can your hands not wrinkle?

19
00:00:59,562 --> 00:01:02,162
Gosh, be quiet.

20
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,061
- Hey, stop. - What's wrong?

21
00:01:05,062 --> 00:01:06,362
Do you think I'm an idiot?

22
00:01:06,633 --> 00:01:08,132
I'm someone who passed a state exam.

23
00:01:08,133 --> 00:01:10,072
Stop blaming the innocent again.

24
00:01:10,073 --> 00:01:13,171
- And we took the same test. - My gosh.

25
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:16,983
Then, are you saying those who don't have the GED don't get to play?

26
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,243
Enough is enough.

27
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:21,811
Don't you know my hands can deceive the eyes?

28
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:24,882
I say this is the November card, and I bet every penny I have...

29
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:26,183
Please have a meal.

30
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:28,692
and her.

31
00:01:30,993 --> 00:01:35,092
Hey, I heard you were the best housekeeper.

32
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,561
Your mom has been living in such luxury...

33
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:40,332
ever since you moved in with her.

34
00:01:42,032 --> 00:01:45,603
Feel free to move in with me if your mom abuses you.

35
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,641
What a load of bull.

36
00:01:47,642 --> 00:01:49,343
Do not touch the cards,

37
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:51,812
and let's eat first.

38
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,612
Hey! Go break this bill.

39
00:01:56,153 --> 00:01:57,883
- I want 50 cents and dollars. - Okay.

40
00:01:58,253 --> 00:02:00,293
And don't bring me the wrong change like last time!

41
00:02:00,522 --> 00:02:01,592
Okay.

42
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:04,522
- Hey, come here. Let's eat. - Okay.

43
00:02:04,793 --> 00:02:07,063
- My gosh. Let's eat. - Jeez.

44
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,563
- Here. - Thanks.

45
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,203
Anyway, how long will you keep her around?

46
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,431
It's been almost a year, right?

47
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:16,603
She says she's better than most adults.

48
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:18,972
You said she worked around the clock.

49
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,242
Go easy on her.

50
00:02:20,372 --> 00:02:24,042
I've seen many step-parents on the news for child abuse.

51
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,283
- My gosh! - I'm not abusing her!

52
00:02:29,453 --> 00:02:31,823
I had a dream I was in "Gulliver's Travels."

53
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:36,022
I was on the big ship Gulliver was on.

54
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:38,021
The sea was deep blue,

55
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:41,763
and the sky was filled with clouds that looked like cotton candy.

56
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:44,503
It was a dream, but it was still really exciting.

57
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,073
Really? It must've been great.

58
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:50,473
- Can you zip me up? - Sure.

59
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:52,943
Daddy and I waited for you,

60
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,913
but you just wouldn't come.

61
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:56,883
We kept waiting and waiting, then I woke up.

62
00:02:57,342 --> 00:03:00,483
But Gulliver's ship capsized.

63
00:03:00,953 --> 00:03:02,853
That only happens in the book.

64
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:05,483
Right!

65
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:09,453
You can have this.

66
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:12,422
- You said it was pretty last time. - Can I really?

67
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,362
I'll also give you this hat later.

68
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,462
Is there anything else you want?

69
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,133
- Tell me. - If I do, will you give it to me?

70
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:23,202
My princesses, are you all ready?

71
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,242
Daddy, how do I look?

72
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,913
Oh, my. I'll get an emergency call from paradise.

73
00:03:30,073 --> 00:03:31,182
Why?

74
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,753
Because one of their angels is missing.

75
00:03:35,853 --> 00:03:37,082
- Let's go. - Let's go.

76
00:03:40,793 --> 00:03:43,922
Se Young was also excited. She couldn't even sleep last night.

77
00:03:46,323 --> 00:03:50,332
Yeo Jin, I heard that island was incredibly beautiful.

78
00:03:52,003 --> 00:03:54,802
I'd also tag along if you went.

79
00:03:55,372 --> 00:03:57,741
I'm only letting Yu Jin go because she pestered me so much.

80
00:03:57,742 --> 00:04:00,341
She and her dad are the perfect duo.

81
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:02,112
If I could make the call, I wouldn't let her go.

82
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:04,883
Don't worry. They'll have fun and come home.

83
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,982
Isn't it wonderful...

84
00:04:09,453 --> 00:04:10,683
that Yu Jin and Se Young...

85
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:14,222
get along like sisters, although they're cousins?

86
00:04:20,162 --> 00:04:21,433
It's this month's living expenses.

87
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:26,732
Thank you, Yeo Jin.

88
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,443
If it hadn't been for you,

89
00:04:31,642 --> 00:04:33,912
how could Se Young and I have lived in this harsh world...

90
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:36,772
after my husband had passed?

91
00:04:37,842 --> 00:04:39,883
Just thinking about it makes me feel lost.

92
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:43,212
Mommy.

93
00:04:46,323 --> 00:04:48,222
Can you come with us?

94
00:04:49,092 --> 00:04:50,863
I have to work.

95
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:54,731
Put the motion sickness patch on before you get on the ship.

96
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:57,602
Don't walk around alone, and always hold your daddy's hand.

97
00:04:57,933 --> 00:04:59,363
- Okay? - Okay.

98
00:05:00,532 --> 00:05:02,432
Do you have to go today?

99
00:05:02,433 --> 00:05:04,142
You're too protective of her.

100
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:07,072
At Yu Jin's age, she must see and experience more.

101
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,872
You couldn't go with her, so at least I should.

102
00:05:09,873 --> 00:05:12,342
He's right about that.

103
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,282
Yu Jin, where's Se Young?

104
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:19,053
What? I thought she was coming with us.

105
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:20,392
What?

106
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:22,493
Goodness.

107
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:31,162
My princess, are you ready?

108
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,503
What are you doing?

109
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:40,073
Everyone's waiting.

110
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:41,712
Wait.

111
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:45,842
Gosh. I told you not to touch the bandage. It came off again.

112
00:05:49,652 --> 00:05:51,683
I need to remove this scar as soon as possible.

113
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,482
Do I have to get rid of it?

114
00:05:56,193 --> 00:05:57,693
Of course.

115
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:02,092
Your value can change completely depending on one little flaw.

116
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:06,032
Wait, what is this?

117
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:08,203
Isn't it Yu Jin's dress?

118
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,902
She gave it to me.

119
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,102
Isn't it pretty?

120
00:06:13,912 --> 00:06:16,912
She gave you her used clothes like you were a charity case?

121
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,342
You aren't her sidekick.

122
00:06:20,082 --> 00:06:22,211
It doesn't even fit you. It's too big.

123
00:06:22,212 --> 00:06:24,522
You told me to be good friends with her.

124
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:27,423
Se Young.

125
00:06:27,923 --> 00:06:29,322
There's a difference between being a good friend...

126
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,162
and treating you like a charity case.

127
00:06:32,222 --> 00:06:35,193
She gave you something she was already sick of...

128
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,303
because she thought you were insignificant.

129
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:39,433
Really?

130
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,972
If you two were close, she should give you...

131
00:06:43,133 --> 00:06:45,503
something you wanted, the best thing she had.

132
00:06:49,873 --> 00:06:51,743
Something like this. Okay?

133
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:04,493
Cuddles, are you hungry?

134
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:06,493
Do you want some milk?

135
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,242
Why did you make the baby cry? I was already stressed out!

136
00:07:23,243 --> 00:07:24,412
Cuddles must be hungry.

137
00:07:25,482 --> 00:07:26,613
I'll bring you some milk.

138
00:07:32,183 --> 00:07:33,623
Ha Na!

139
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:36,823
Yes?

140
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,462
Yes, Father.

141
00:07:46,832 --> 00:07:49,902
Hey, in "The Story of Sim Cheong,"

142
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,813
she even threw herself into the water for her father.

143
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:58,782
What can you do for me?

144
00:07:59,383 --> 00:08:03,482
I know you catch on quickly, but always play dumb.

145
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:07,492
Hey, I'm here having a drink,

146
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:10,923
so don't you think you need to sing me a song or something?

147
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:12,892
Okay.

148
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:17,063
When Mommy goes to the isle

149
00:08:18,563 --> 00:08:19,863
You're ruining my drink.

150
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:21,573
Something else!

151
00:08:22,773 --> 00:08:26,871
You'll see a bright new day again

152
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:29,772
- Louder! - I'm here with a dream

153
00:08:29,773 --> 00:08:32,341
- I came here - Hey!

154
00:08:32,342 --> 00:08:36,453
So, move aside, sorrow and pain

155
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:40,823
Everything will come to pass If you work hard

156
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,392
You'll see a bright new day

157
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,492
Be quiet!

158
00:08:46,163 --> 00:08:47,862
Go out and give milk to Cuddles.

159
00:08:48,063 --> 00:08:49,533
- Okay. - Now!

160
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,601
Why? Hey, wait.

161
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,101
Where are you going?

162
00:08:53,102 --> 00:08:54,672
- Good grief. - What's wrong?

163
00:08:54,673 --> 00:08:58,072
I was starting to have fun. Don't be so grumpy, Ms. Kim.

164
00:08:58,073 --> 00:09:00,302
- My gosh. - Hey, get back here.

165
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:02,972
- Come and finish your song. - My gosh. What song?

166
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:04,542
- Come! - Go, now.

167
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:06,212
Start singing that song...

168
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,953
What's going on?

169
00:09:08,283 --> 00:09:09,712
My gosh. Cuddles!

170
00:09:09,852 --> 00:09:11,621
Oh, no. Is that hot water?

171
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,652
Goodness. There, there.

172
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:15,323
My gosh. Oh, no.

173
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,092
My goodness.

174
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,393
- Cold water. My gosh. - Is the baby okay?

175
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:25,361
Are you trying to burn Cuddles to death?

176
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:27,002
You can't leave hot water just lying there!

177
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:28,432
I'm sorry.

178
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,372
You idiot! You did this on purpose!

179
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,971
No, I was trying to make formula, but you called me, so...

180
00:09:33,972 --> 00:09:37,481
- How dare you blame me? - Honey, call 911.

181
00:09:37,482 --> 00:09:38,582
Darn it.

182
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,283
There, there.

(Taesarang Seongmo Hospital)

184
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:53,023
Please say something.

185
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,262
It's Hwang Jin Goo, the lucky guy!

186
00:09:57,502 --> 00:09:59,403
You finally have the surgery date.

187
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:02,131
The most wonderful doctor will operate on you,

188
00:10:02,132 --> 00:10:04,002
so stay brave through everything, okay?

189
00:10:04,073 --> 00:10:05,303
You can do it!

190
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:08,573
Yes, and I am that wonderful doctor.

191
00:10:09,112 --> 00:10:10,881
Don't worry, Jin Goo.

192
00:10:10,882 --> 00:10:14,283
A doctor with a medical doctorate will do it, not this resident.

193
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:18,252
Then, Jin Goo, your heart will be made of iron.

194
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,023
Yes, I'm going to be Superman.

195
00:10:35,132 --> 00:10:36,372
You did that on purpose.

196
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,971
No, Mother.

197
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,612
You did.

198
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,043
All you ever do is lie!

199
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:50,183
How dare you cry on me?

200
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:53,652
You must've harassed Cuddles all the time while I wasn't looking.

201
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,153
- I see right through your slyness! - Don't do that!

202
00:10:58,823 --> 00:11:00,091
You can't hit a child.

203
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,662
Why do you care if I hit her or not? Move aside!

204
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,202
Child abuse is a crime.

205
00:11:04,203 --> 00:11:05,362
"Child abuse?"

206
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,601
That tiny head of yours must've watched some news,

207
00:11:08,602 --> 00:11:09,702
but I'm her mom.

208
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,241
I'm trying to discipline her, so how is that child abuse?

209
00:11:12,242 --> 00:11:14,342
Even parents aren't allowed to hit their children.

210
00:11:15,313 --> 00:11:18,282
How dare this little kid keep talking back at me?

211
00:11:18,283 --> 00:11:20,581
- I'll slap you, too! - You'd get aggravated punishment.

212
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:21,782
She got me as a witness,

213
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:24,023
- and I got it on the camcorder. - What?

214
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,481
Give me that.

215
00:11:26,482 --> 00:11:28,922
How dare you blackmail me, little punk?

216
00:11:28,923 --> 00:11:30,452
Do your parents know you act like this?

217
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,063
Taking this against my will is called extortion!

218
00:11:34,793 --> 00:11:37,602
I don't know who the heck you are, but stop acting so clever! Jeez.

219
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,163
Why did you knuckle me?

220
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:44,872
Is she really your mom?

221
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,072
You should dodge or run away when she hits you.

222
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:50,372
Why do you let her do that?

223
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:55,183
Where did you learn such difficult words?

224
00:11:55,453 --> 00:11:56,712
You can find them in books.

225
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:00,382
Honestly speaking, even adults don't know much.

226
00:12:03,852 --> 00:12:05,393
Are you unwell?

227
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,492
Yes, right here. My heart.

231
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:19,242
Yes, Mommy.

Thank you so much, Chairwoman Shin.

238

I'll never forget your generosity.

239

My fortune said our family would meet great help this year,

240
00:12:51,502 --> 00:12:52,872
and it must've been you.

241
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:54,472
Don't mention it.

242
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:56,673
Our children are the hope for our future.

243
00:12:56,913 --> 00:13:00,183
I find it rewarding to see them grow up in good health.

244
00:13:00,783 --> 00:13:02,182
And I look forward to seeing...

245
00:13:02,183 --> 00:13:04,752
how a smart child like Jin Goo would grow up to be a talented man.

246
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:06,552
Thank you, Chairwoman Shin.

247
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:09,592
I'll become fully well and show you how strong I can be.

248
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,761
You already seem so strong.

249
00:13:11,762 --> 00:13:14,023
How much stronger will you be once you get well?

250
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:17,903
- Please excuse me. - Yes.

251
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,033
How old are you?

252
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:23,372
I'm ten years old.

253
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:26,102
You're the same age as my Se Young.

254
00:13:26,443 --> 00:13:28,812

I'm not so bad.

256
00:13:31,283 --> 00:13:34,351
Hey, don't be so arrogant and study even harder.

257
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:37,682
Your real academic achievement will begin in high school. Okay?

258
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,982
Yes.

259
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:45,023

260
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,121
to have met someone like Yeo Jin.

261

That's what I'm saying.

262
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:51,803
I'll repay her for the rest of my life.

- Hey, get it. - Stop.

266
00:14:03,273 --> 00:14:06,043
By any chance, could you tell us who adopted her?

267
00:14:07,752 --> 00:14:10,653
I was not allowed to share information on adoptions,

268
00:14:10,813 --> 00:14:12,453
so I couldn't share it with you.

269
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:15,893
I really want to meet her, Reverend Mother.

270

- Do you pity me? - What?

282
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,943
Was that why you threw out the dolls and clothes...

283
00:15:40,242 --> 00:15:41,773
you were sick of?

284
00:15:41,972 --> 00:15:43,173
"Threw out?"

285
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:44,783
No way.

286
00:15:45,842 --> 00:15:48,081
You're my best friend...

287

This is a new hat, and you can have it.

It's my present.

292
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:06,232
Can I really have it?

293
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,972
Yes! It looks great on you.

294
00:16:10,472 --> 00:16:12,903
See? Seeing you smile makes me smile, too.

295
00:16:13,102 --> 00:16:14,512
I can give you everything...

296

- No. - No.

No.

303
00:16:36,632 --> 00:16:37,962
It was your present for me.

304
00:16:40,832 --> 00:16:42,033
I'll get it.

305
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,832
What? Oh...

306
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,552
- You should get in, too. - What?

307
00:16:56,752 --> 00:16:59,383
You don't want to? You said we were like sisters.

308
00:17:00,883 --> 00:17:01,953

Yu Jin, there's a room down here.

311
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,443
Do you want to play hide-and-seek?

312
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:24,883
Daddy is probably looking for us. Let's go.

313

You said you were happy when I was happy.

314

But we're playing just one game.

00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,762
once you enter the island. Is that all right?

318
00:17:42,863 --> 00:17:44,132
Is that so?

319
00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:46,632
Goodness gracious. The weather report isn't always right.

320
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,272
The weather on the sea changes many times a day.

321
00:17:50,072 --> 00:17:51,741
- Is that so? - Yes.

322
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:54,511
The clear sky would suddenly pour rain.

323
00:17:54,512 --> 00:17:57,782
Then, the thunder and rain would quickly clear up, too.

00:21:28,623 --> 00:21:31,052
Where is Yu Jin? You were with her, right?

366
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:36,193
Yu Jin.

367
00:21:39,262 --> 00:21:40,562
I'll get Uncle Sung Ho.

368
00:21:42,373 --> 00:21:44,203
- No. - No?

369
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:46,703
Then, where is she?

370
00:21:48,212 --> 00:21:49,873
- In the car... - She's not there.

371
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,413
Did she not tell you where she was going?

372
00:21:53,282 --> 00:21:56,052
I went to the restroom.

373
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:59,453
Where did she go all by herself?

374
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,123
I'll find her and come back,

375
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,722
so don't go anywhere and stay in the car.

376
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:08,732
Yu Jin.

377
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:10,792
Yu Jin!

378
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,472
Yu Jin!

379
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:24,112
- Excuse me. - Yes?

380
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,642
I'm looking for a girl this tall,

381
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:29,182
wearing a white dress with pink decorations.

382
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:30,353
Have you seen her?

383
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:34,423
All right.

384
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,593
Excuse me, sir.

385
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,462
Yu Jin!

386
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:40,363
Yu Jin!

387
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,673
Yu Jin.

388
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:55,142
- Hey. - Me?

389
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:58,311
- Have you seen a girl about your... - I got you, you brat!

390
00:22:58,312 --> 00:22:59,811
- Father! - Come here!

391
00:22:59,812 --> 00:23:00,882
Father...

392
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:02,152
- Be quiet and come! - Why are you doing that to her...

393
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:04,152
- Please stop, Father. - Sir!

394
00:23:04,153 --> 00:23:06,722
(Police)

395
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,892
Have you found my daughter?

396
00:23:08,893 --> 00:23:12,322
We combed through the port from there to here, but no.

397
00:23:12,522 --> 00:23:13,863
Where could she be?

398
00:23:14,462 --> 00:23:15,933
Please find her.

399
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:26,971
- No. - No.

400
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:28,342
- You should get in, too. - What?

401
00:23:28,343 --> 00:23:30,943
You don't want to? You said we were like sisters.

402
00:23:36,383 --> 00:23:38,722
Yu Jin, do you want to play hide-and-seek?

403
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,653
But we're playing just one game.

404
00:23:43,792 --> 00:23:45,093
Once he found Yu Jin,

405
00:23:46,022 --> 00:23:48,262
he'd find out that I lied.

406
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,292
What do I do?

407
00:24:20,863 --> 00:24:22,433
Daddy...

408
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:26,532
Daddy.

409
00:24:28,572 --> 00:24:30,731
Daddy.

410
00:24:30,732 --> 00:24:33,002
What? Who are you?

411
00:24:33,502 --> 00:24:36,613
Ouch. How did you get in here?

412
00:24:36,913 --> 00:24:39,211
Se Young... Where's Se Young?

413
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:40,312
"Se Young?"

414
00:24:43,153 --> 00:24:44,853
Where am I, sir?

415
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:47,382
Where's my daddy?

416
00:24:47,383 --> 00:24:49,522
How did you get inside the boat?

417
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:53,593
I came to get the hat, and...

418
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:55,433
I want to go home.

419
00:24:55,933 --> 00:24:57,062
Goodness.

420
00:24:58,403 --> 00:25:00,002
Mommy...

421
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:02,302
Mommy...

422
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:05,402
Daddy... Mommy...

423
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:09,072
Daddy... Mommy...

424
00:25:12,443 --> 00:25:13,542
Hey.

425
00:25:15,052 --> 00:25:17,853
She lost her husband two years ago,

426
00:25:18,113 --> 00:25:20,183
and I thought she'd end up losing her son, too.

427
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:23,152
She wasn't so lucky with her husband,

428
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:25,123
but her son just might turn out to be her blessing.

429
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:28,021
When we met last year,

430
00:25:28,022 --> 00:25:31,062
she was so worried about her son and looked worn out.

431
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:34,232
But today, she seemed very much at peace.

432
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:38,742
But she still has the same looks anyway.

433
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:44,042
She was known for looking much older since when she was younger.

434
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:48,613
I heard Jin Goo was quite clever and smart.

435
00:25:49,913 --> 00:25:52,422
Well, it doesn't matter how smart he is.

436
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:54,183
He doesn't have a great background.

437
00:25:56,752 --> 00:26:01,292
Will his heart be all right after the surgery?

438
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,833
The medical staff is the best in the country.

439
00:26:05,032 --> 00:26:08,873
Yeo Jin, you've done so much good,

440
00:26:09,173 --> 00:26:11,673
so you'd be blessed so much in the future.

441
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:18,042
I wonder if the girls have arrived safely.

442
00:26:18,413 --> 00:26:21,342
Yes, right. The news said...

443
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:23,752
there would be a high seas watch on the west coast tonight.

444
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:26,281
I wonder if they've arrived safely.

445
00:26:26,282 --> 00:26:27,822
You should call him.

446
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:29,453
But the weather was fine until the morning.

447
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,552
I guess.

448
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,502
(Yeo Jin)

449
00:26:42,703 --> 00:26:43,832
Hey, honey.

450
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,673
Did you arrive safely on the island?

451
00:26:46,603 --> 00:26:48,442
- Not yet. - There's a high seas watch...

452
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:49,673
on the west coast, right?

453
00:26:50,472 --> 00:26:52,583
The weather isn't great, so you should come back.

454
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,482
What's Yu Jin up to?

455
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:58,522
Honey.

456
00:27:00,423 --> 00:27:01,522
Sung Ho.

457
00:27:02,193 --> 00:27:03,522
Don't be alarmed and listen to me.

458
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:05,623
Yu Jin...

459
00:27:07,222 --> 00:27:08,363
is gone.

460
00:27:10,333 --> 00:27:13,302
What do you mean Yu Jin is gone?

461
00:27:18,002 --> 00:27:19,072
Get out.

462
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:20,943
You came empty-handed, so you'd leave empty-handed, too.

463
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:23,142
A girl who almost burned my child to death...

464
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,982
doesn't deserve to live under my roof.

465
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:26,981
I'm sorry, Father.

466
00:27:26,982 --> 00:27:28,241
Please forgive me, Father.

467
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:29,712
I'm not your father!

468
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:35,922
Father, I'm sorry.

469
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,892
Father, please open the door.

470
00:27:37,893 --> 00:27:40,021
I'm sorry, Father.

471
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:41,893
Please open the door.

472
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,232
I'm sorry, Father.

473
00:27:44,693 --> 00:27:47,333
Father, please open the door.

474
00:27:47,903 --> 00:27:50,873
I'm sorry, Father.

475
00:28:05,953 --> 00:28:07,552
- Sung Ho. - Hey, honey.

476
00:28:08,593 --> 00:28:10,551
What about Yu Jin? Where is she?

477
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:12,021
They're looking for her. We'll hear back from them.

478
00:28:12,022 --> 00:28:14,262
Why haven't they found her yet?

479
00:28:14,722 --> 00:28:15,893
Find her right now.

480
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:17,693
How did you end up losing her?

481
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,133
- Honey. - Oh, no.

482
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,203
We'll find her.

483
00:28:22,532 --> 00:28:25,403
We'll do whatever it takes to find her, so calm down.

484
00:28:25,742 --> 00:28:27,241
Fly a helicopter or whatever they have.

485
00:28:27,242 --> 00:28:30,173
Find her by all means!

486
00:28:30,413 --> 00:28:33,683
We're searching the wharf and the town, so they'll call soon.

487
00:28:33,913 --> 00:28:35,113
Please give us a little more time.

488
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:40,752
You've reached Seongbuk Police Station.

489
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:42,893
A girl?

490
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:45,492
- Is it my Yu Jin? - Is it Yu Jin?

491
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,193
Yes, I understand.

492
00:28:51,863 --> 00:28:54,402
A young girl who looks like your daughter is on a fishing boat.

493
00:28:54,403 --> 00:28:55,532
"A fishing boat?"

494
00:28:56,403 --> 00:28:58,603
Are you sure it's Yu Jin?

495
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:01,041
Her age, gender, and appearance seem the same.

496
00:29:01,042 --> 00:29:03,512
What about her name? What was the girl's name?

497
00:29:03,712 --> 00:29:06,282
- Yeo Jin... - Well, the communication was lost,

498
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,943
so they couldn't get more details.

499
00:29:09,853 --> 00:29:11,012
Where's the boat?

500
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,682
I'll go there now.

501
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:13,952
You can't go to the sea now.

502
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:16,352
Even the ones out there can't return because of the high seas watch.

503
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,892
Then, get a helicopter!

504
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:19,862
Even that is too dangerous to fly in this weather.

505
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:21,593
My daughter is the one in danger!

506
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:24,992
Please let us go find her.

507
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:28,362
I'll pay as much as you want, so let us go.

508
00:29:28,363 --> 00:29:30,702
We want to do that for you, but the best thing now is to wait...

509
00:29:30,703 --> 00:29:33,242
You say such carefree words because this isn't your daughter.

510
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:35,272
Get a chopper out there now!

511
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:36,913
- Goodness, Yeo Jin. - Honey.

512
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,482
- Goodness, Yu Jin. - Honey.

513
00:29:40,212 --> 00:29:41,312
Yu Jin...

514
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,782
Yu Jin...

515
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:47,083
Yu Jin!

516
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:06,302
Hey, by any chance, if you fall into the sea,

517
00:30:06,843 --> 00:30:09,041
make sure you hold onto this. Okay?

518
00:30:09,042 --> 00:30:10,972
Mister, I'm scared.

519
00:30:11,113 --> 00:30:12,312
Can you count to 100?

520
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:13,682
You'll be fine after you count to 100.

521
00:30:13,683 --> 00:30:15,982
- Now, 1, 2... - Mister!

522
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:17,352
I'll be back soon.

523
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:19,153
Mister...

524
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:30,061
Daddy... Mommy...

525
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:32,032
Father, I am sorry.

526
00:30:32,863 --> 00:30:34,762
Father, please forgive me.

527
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:37,203
Father, I am sorry.

528
00:30:37,972 --> 00:30:39,673
Please open the door, Father.

529
00:30:44,613 --> 00:30:47,012
No, Mommy...

530
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:50,812
Mommy...

531
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:54,022
I am sorry, Father.

532
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,653
Please open the door, Father.

533
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,893
(Cinderella Game)

534
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:35,593
We received a report of child abuse.

535
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,133
You hit her yesterday, too.

536
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:38,863
I recorded everything here.

537
00:31:39,203 --> 00:31:42,673
What will happen to me if I tell the truth?

538
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:45,072
I lied to Uncle Sung Ho.

539
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,041
I don't even know if my young daughter is...

540
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,613
alive or dead right now.

541
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,772
Please find her.

542
00:31:51,113 --> 00:31:52,211
Where's Yu Jin?

543
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:53,843
She was with you.

544
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:55,913
Is this your daughter's hat?

545
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,252
A body?

546
00:31:58,482 --> 00:32:00,082
Did Yu Jin die?

547
