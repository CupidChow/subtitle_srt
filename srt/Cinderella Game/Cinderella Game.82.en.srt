1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,440
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,340
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,110
(Episode 82)

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,590
Yeo Jin.

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,190
You knew about Yu Jin's adoption...

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,990
and her move to America.
Why did you keep it from me?

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,900
Why did you deceive me? Why?

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,700
What's wrong, Yeo Jin?

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,140
No, it's nothing.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:37,280
So, you met with reporters?

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,940
Yes.

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,910
I slipped
a little something to them...

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:43,250
and asked them to write
something favorable for you.

15
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,680
Okay.

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,920
Did you try to stop me
from finding Yu Jin? Why?

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,060
What are your true colors?

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,830
Yeo Jin.

19
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:57,130
Okay. Thanks.

20
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,200
What was that?

21
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,740
What's with that lukewarm response?

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,710
Hey, where has she been?

23
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:13,480
Near her office.

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,050
- She went to work?
- She wanted to see how things were.

25
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,590
If I could,

26
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,200
I wanted to tear her limb from limb.

27
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,000
If she...

28
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,540
hadn't interfered for 20 years,
I would've found Yu Jin ages ago.

29
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:47,280
Do I have to just sit here
and deal with her?

30
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:50,620
It was as Mr. Yoon said.
She wouldn't admit to this...

31
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,620
without clear evidence.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,060
How did I have such a wrong idea...

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,290
about her?

34
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:05,160
First, why don't you do some digging
on Choi Myung Ji?

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:09,130
As you just mentioned,
if you had the wrong idea about her,

36
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,470
you should find out
who she really is starting now.

37
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:17,580
Yes, I need to know who she is
to put up a fight.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,210
Start investigating quietly.

39
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,310
Put a tail on her,
find out who she's meeting,

40
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,950
and get your hands...

41
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,220
- on her financial transactions.
- Yes, ma'am.

42
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:30,890
You must continue to act like
you always have, ma'am.

43
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,520
I know.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,540
Something about Yeo Jin
didn't sit right with me.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,810
Did she lie
about going to the office?

46
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,210
Was she actually with Sung Ho?

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,590
Of course.
She would've slapped me already...

48
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,660
if she heard
about the hit-and-run accident.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,100
Yeo Jin, did Sung Ho
reach out to you again?

50
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,810
Why? Are you checking
if he told me about Yu Jin?

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,940
You cursed jerk.

52
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:29,150
Have you seen my phone?

53
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,480
No.

54
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,250
Why? Do you not have it?

55
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,420
It's gone.

56
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
He called Ms. Jang just to ask me...

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,260
to apologize to the Goo siblings
by using Yu Jin as an excuse.

58
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,230
He came to the police station
and our home to say that?

59
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,460
I don't want to talk about him.

60
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,470
Did she really not meet him?

61
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,140
How are the public responding
to the video?

62
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,110
They're showing a positive response.

63
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,170
Your plan worked like a charm.

64
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,110
You've become quite popular
with your looks.

65
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,310
People said you looked elegant
and luxurious without luxury goods.

66
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,780
Your outfit and earrings are
hard to get at the moment.

67
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:08,390
Did you cause Yu Jin's accident
and take her life? Why?

68
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,790
Did you want Hyesung?

69
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,960
Right, on my way home,

70
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,190
I met the teacher at Eun Chong's
international studies agency.

71
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,360
He could leave next month
at the earliest.

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,370
- Okay. You can handle that.
- Okay.

73
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,080
Stop the planning
for Eun Chong's study abroad.

74
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,180
She'll get suspicious
if you halt it without a reason.

75
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,950
Tell the international
studies agency...

76
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,590
to postpone the process
and stall for time.

77
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,750
Yes, ma'am.

78
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,990
People must've been paid to write comments
on Chairwoman Shin's video.

79
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,300
- Let's do the same.
- Okay.

80
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,430
The company's website is a mix of people
demanding her resignation...

81
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,740
and those who claim that
suspicions of her corporate raids...

82
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,300
are false propaganda against her.

83
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,780
How can they respond like this
even with the clear evidence?

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,610
At this rate, Chairwoman Shin
will never step down herself.

85
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,150
Is there a way
to overturn the public sentiment?

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,020
It won't be enough
to pay people to write comments.

87
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,960
We need to consider...

88
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,660
playing that last move
as the final resort.

89
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,830
- Here are your fritters.
- Thank you.

90
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:32,870
"The noble Chairwoman Shin
would never do corporate raids."

91
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,370
My gosh. "Everything was staged
by the Goo siblings?"

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,380
You idiot.

93
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,110
Go find the victims' interview
if you have eyes to see.

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Shin Yeo Jin is a corporate raider.

95
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,090
Are people still showing
the same response?

96
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,190
Yes, you need to refute them, too.

97
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,260
Grab your phone.

98
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,030
Darn it. Those jerks.

99
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,200
She should
reflect on herself, apologize,

100
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,500
and get punished for her crimes.

101
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,500
I don't want
to see Eun Chong anymore.

102
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,100
You idiot.
Were you going to meet him?

103
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,770
Ha Na took him in
and raised him with lots of effort,

104
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,540
not realizing
he was our enemy's blood.

105
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,610
Good luck growing up with a granny
who's a corporate raider.

106
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,380
Darn it.

107
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,820
I'm going to find out
whatever you're hiding.

108
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,590
You were the thief.

109
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,000
Your new phone, Ms. Chairwoman.

110
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,370
Thanks.

111
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:14,470
Myung Ji took my phone
and hid it in her wardrobe.

112
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,310
Why do you think
she took your phone?

113
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,810
She probably wanted to stop me
from contacting Sung Ho...

114
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,180
in case he talked about Yu Jin.

115
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,020
Her guilty conscience
needed no accuser.

116
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,690
Then, was
the hit-and-run accident also...

117
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,720
I'm 100 percent convicted.

118
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:34,360
Did you leave your phone there?

119
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,760
Yes, she'll get suspicious
if it disappears.

120
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,000
You made the right decision.

121
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,030
I put a tail on her,

122
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,900
and I brought the breakdown
of her financial transactions.

123
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Did anything seem odd?

124
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,570
She engaged in illegal activities
to embezzle funds...

125
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,580
from the travel agency.

126
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,580
Embezzlement?
Why didn't the audit catch that?

127
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,810
Goo Ji Seok must've let it slide.

128
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,750
After all, they were once together.

129
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,320
Is something going on
between them and Director Goo?

130
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,790
I need to go to the office.
Call Jin Goo.

131
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,190
Are you sure?

132
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,590
Protestors are still around.

133
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,590
It's my company.
Why am I not allowed there?

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,730
The chairwoman must've felt
greatly shocked and betrayed.

135
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,300
Yes, I had to stop her
from kicking them out right away.

136
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,610
It's too early to do that.

137
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,240
When I meet her,

138
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,040
I'll share the suspicious things
I found about Se Young and her mom.

139
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,750
For now, we don't have the evidence
that Ms. Choi is the culprit,

140
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,510
but there's a need for her...

141
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,280
to stay wary of them
for Eun Chong's sake.

142
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,550
Please do that.

143
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,720
Don't you think
Ha Na should know, too?

144
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,590
Not only is she
her daughter's friend,

145
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:44,230
but there are other things
she could do for him.

146
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,860
The reverend mother will
share it with her.

147
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Eun Chong's little grandma
came to the children's home?

148
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,340
Yes, she found out
Du Na was emigrating...

149
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,810
and had come over.

150
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,410
Then, why didn't she tell
Du Na's parents?

151
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:03,210
I'm not completely sure yet,

152
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,220
but when Du Na came to Korea,

153
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,950
she said she thought
she found her mom's home.

154
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,690
Yes, but she got into the accident
when she was on her way...

155
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,090
to meet the landlady.

156
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,230
If that place really belonged...

157
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,930
to Du Na's parents, then...

158
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,040
The landlady...

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,870
could've been
Eun Chong's little grandma.

160
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,010
Arrest Shin Yeo Jin immediately!

161
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,280
- Arrest her immediately!
- Arrest her immediately!

162
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,480
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

163
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,090
- Step down!
- Step down!

164
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:44,560
The board and shareholders are
still siding with the chairwoman.

165
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,860
- Step down from your office!
- Get some more protestors.

166
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,860
- Step down!
- And play the media, too.

167
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,390
Okay.

168
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,960
- Step down!
- Step down!

169
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,300
Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

170
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,200
- Step down!
- Step down!

171
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,400
- Step down!
- Step down!

172
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,540
Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

173
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,940
I heard you were cooped up at home
after the police investigation,

174
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,310
but you actually came to work.

175
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,810
Why not?

176
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,650
The court will decide
if I'm guilty of corporate raiding,

177
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,420
and it'll be a while
until they reach a verdict.

178
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,120
- Step down!
- Step down!

179
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,990
- Step down!
- Get rid of the protestors.

180
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,060
Step down from your office!

181
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,360
They're just loud and noisy
but not so threatening.

182
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,800
- Step down!
- Step down!

183
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,240
Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

184
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,000
- Step down!
- Step down!

185
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,170
I'll make her step down.

186
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,470
- Step down!
- Step down!

187
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,050
Leak a rumor that the board is
picking out new CEO candidates.

188
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you for coming.

189
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:47,220
I wanted to let you go,
but I ended up calling you again.

190
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,520
It's all right. You can talk to me.

191
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,090
Tell me everything you know
about Se Young and her mother.

192
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,990
I was going to tell you this.

193
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,930
Se Young and her mother told Ha Na
about the fake daughter project.

194
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,970
- Really?
- Yes.

195
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,640
When you wanted to make her public,

196
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,370
they sent her a scrapped flyer.

197
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,710
Se Young said that...

198
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:14,110
she couldn't watch
a fake daughter take Hyesung,

199
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,810
and that Hyesung was hers.

200
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,150
Then, she already knew
Eun Chong was my grandson?

201
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,490
Yes, I also think
they tried to stop his adoption.

202
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,030
It must be
because Ha Na could become...

203
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,200
Hyesung's owner
once she adopted Eun Chong.

204
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,900
They were after Hyesung.

205
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,040
They had been after Hyesung
since the day Yu Jin disappeared.

206
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,510
That was why
they interfered with finding her.

207
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,650
Was that why she caused
Yu Jin's hit-and-run accident?

208
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,590
If she killed Yu Jin...

209
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,930
just to get Hyesung and money,

210
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:06,230
she could do the same to Eun Chong.

211
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,430
I must kick them out immediately.

212
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,200
- Not yet.
- Why not?

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,370
I can't let them live
under the same roof as him.

214
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,510
She's the key culprit
in the hit-and-run accident.

215
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,770
I don't know what she'll do to him.

216
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,040
He'll fall into bigger danger
if she finds out about your suspicion.

217
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,280
You can't let her find out
until you have clear evidence.

218
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,020
Do you expect me
to sit and watch her?

219
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,790
She could be the one
who killed Yu Jin.

220
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,150
How can I live with her?

221
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,360
Just the thought
makes my heart beat so fast.

222
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,660
Send Eun Chong somewhere else.

223
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,160
You must separate him
from Se Young and her mom.

224
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,330
Send him where?

225
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,600
I will...

226
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,140
think about it.

227
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,040
And why don't you resign...

228
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,280
for Eun Chong's sake?

229
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,410
What are you talking about?
This is my company. Why should I go?

230
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,920
You need to apologize
to the victims...

231
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,650
and promise to make compensation.

232
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:01,650
Leave the business to a hired CEO...

233
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,590
and make protecting Eun Chong
your priority.

234
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,030
I'll protect
both the business and Eun Chong.

235
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,730
I won't let the Goo siblings
get me anymore.

236
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,800
Ms. Chairwoman.

237
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,700
Find a way to keep Eun Chong safe.

238
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,870
If Se Young's mom was involved in
the hit-and-run accident,

239
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,040
it'd be dangerous
for Eun Chong to live there.

240
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,580
- Mr. Hwang.
- Ha Na.

241
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,990
May I have a word with you?

242
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,020
Why? Is something going on?

243
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:43,890
Se Young's mom seems suspicious.

244
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,860
Because she kept the whereabouts
of Eun Chong's mom secret?

245
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,570
You knew about this?

246
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,370
I heard it from the chairwoman.

247
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:56,570
So, we should separate Eun Chong
from Se Young and her mom.

248
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,910
You're right.
I was worried about him.

249
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:03,650
The chairwoman refuses to admit
to corporate raiding or apologize,

250
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,820
yet you're worried about him?

251
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,650
Right?

252
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,360
Chairwoman Shin was
a tougher enemy than I thought.

253
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,390
She even said she'd sue the victims,

254
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,260
and she was great
at controlling the narrative.

255
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,400
Yes, and she came to work, too.

256
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,230
She's in her office?

257
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,740
I'll offer a huge incentive
to the board members...

258
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,540
as soon as this crisis is over.

259
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,670
You have our full support,
Ms. Chairwoman.

260
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,880
You always stay strong
through a crisis. I believe in you.

261
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,780
Don't worry, Ms. Chairwoman.

262
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,010
- Thank you.
- Sure.

263
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,590
How dare you sue the victims?

264
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,590
- Directors, you should go.
- Yes.

265
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,160
This isn't where you belong.

266
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,700
Leave.

267
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,070
You're the one who should leave.

268
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:02,540
You have no right to sit there.

269
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:03,810
Sue them?

270
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,680
Apologize to the victims
and resign immediately.

271
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:09,550
You can try whatever you want
to drag me down.

272
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,150
But you won't see me
walk out of here by myself.

273
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
And revenge?

274
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,690
Some kids like you two
can't lay a hand on me.

275
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,560
Do you have any idea
how I got to this place?

276
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,030
You took advantage
of others' blood, sweat, and tears.

277
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,090
Shut your mouth.

278
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:25,500
Everything you do adds to your sins.

279
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,870
You better pay for everything
before you die.

280
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,830
Otherwise, Eun Chong will
fall into bigger danger.

281
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,140
Do not dare speak of my grandson.

282
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,640
He has nothing to do with you.

283
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,480
You are the worst.

284
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,550
How much longer do you think
the world will revolve around you?

285
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,320
It doesn't matter
how the world changes.

286
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,120
You'll pay for everything you did
before your death.

287
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:53,390
I'll make sure you kneel before me.

288
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,030
Me? Kneel before you?

289
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,600
How long do you think
you'll continue to laugh like that?

290
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,310
We need to use our final move.

291
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,010
I never wanted to go there.

292
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,280
I'm worried
about Ji Eun and Ji Chang, too.

293
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,350
Let's do it.

294
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,020
They needed to know someday.

295
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,920
Chairwoman Shin wants to take this
to the end, and we can't avoid it.

296
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,670
That must be another act.

297
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,470
It must be a plan to control him
by getting him on her side.

298
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,000
I must separate them
as soon as possible.

299
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:46,780
Yeo Jin, do you have
something to say to me?

300
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,080
Eun Chong seems to be doing well,
thanks to you two. Thank you.

301
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,120
Don't mention it.

302
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,550
Something about her
just feels different.

303
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,590
What could it be?
Why do I feel so uneasy?

304
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:05,030
I heard you told Jin Goo
to come to your office.

305
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,160
Did you two reconcile?

306
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,830
It was never a fight.

307
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,740
I should've given you
a position at work, too.

308
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,640
It would've been great
if you were at work in times like these.

309
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,910
Gosh, if I were there,

310
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,250
I would've been
your right-hand woman, not Jin Goo.

311
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,250
Se Young will do a great job
for my sake.

312
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,290
I admire you so much, Aunt Yeo Jin.

313
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,850
Female university students
picked you as the top role model.

314
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,020
It's nothing.

315
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,330
Yeo Jin,
you made a stunning comeback.

316
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,560
The Goo siblings thought they won,
but they've been humiliated.

317
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:43,230
You should kick them out
with this chance.

318
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,740
I should.

319
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,040
And I'll sue Richard Han
for breaching the investment contract.

320
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,210
Yes.

321
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,310
You should keep growing Hyesung
and leave it behind to Eun Chong.

322
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,750
Right, Eun Chong?

323
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,920
You probably mean you.

324
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,690
You deceived me for 20 years,
and now you wanted to use him to do it.

325
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,290
What a detestable woman.
She deserves worse than death.

326
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:19,000
Ms. Chairwoman, there's trouble.

327
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,640
It's a new news article.

328
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,940
("Shin Yeo Jin Kills Victims
Under the Guise of an Accident")

329
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,490
What's going on? It's still early.

330
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,160
The public is
responding negatively once again,

331
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:42,230
and reporters are returning
in front of your place.

332
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,930
- They look like reporters.
- Turn it off.

333
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,750
She even killed people?

334
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,750
How can she kill people over money?

335
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,720
That's the key reason
why people murder.

336
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:11,020
- Hey, you better be careful.
- Shush.

337
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:15,590
Do I have to return that money?
This doesn't feel right.

338
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,460
So, Eun Chong is now the grandson
of a corporate raider...

339
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,170
and a murderer?

340
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,100
I'm glad
we cut ties with him a while ago.

341
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,840
Ha Na, you cannot meet him anymore.

342
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,240
Don't call him, either.

343
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,170
Anyway, who were the victims?

344
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,580
My goodness.
She raided corporations...

345
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,120
and instigated murder?
Is this all true?

346
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,320
Stop reading these.

347
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,160
Is this really
the same chairwoman we know?

348
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,160
How can a woman who looks so elegant
do something this scary?

349
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,300
I'm so glad
you decided to leave her.

350
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,540
Wait, were the victims...

351
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,680
Ms. Goo's parents?

352
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,940
My gosh. What am I thinking?

353
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,980
Just the corporate raid alone is
dire enough to make them enemies.

354
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,920
It shouldn't be any worse.

355
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:17,120
Instigating murder is just a rumor.

356
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,560
Hey, it doesn't matter.
In this situation,

357
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,260
resigning would look
the most suitable.

358
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,730
You should be out there
trying to help her.

359
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,370
You can't say this to me.

360
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:32,070
The board is already picking out
new CEO candidates.

361
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,610
You should think wisely, too.

362
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,170
Are you serious?

363
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,940
Who are the candidates?

364
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,350
Director Goo is the most likely.

365
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,580
Goo Ji Seok?

366
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,750
I'm sure you expected it.

367
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,190
Wasn't that why you handed over
the security server's key to him?

368
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,420
"The security server?"

369
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,130
Did you hand over the key
to the security server to Ji Seok?

370
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,030
How did you know?

371
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,730
Have you lost your mind?

372
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,500
You betrayed your aunt.

373
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,240
That was where they found
all the evidence.

374
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,340
I handed it over to make Ha Na
give up on adopting Eun Chong.

375
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,350
Anyway, did Aunt Yeo Jin
really do that to Ji Seok's parents?

376
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,390
She raids corporations
and murders people?

377
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,550
It was an accident!

378
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:30,260
Everything came down to this,
so hold onto Ji Seok.

379
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:34,500
He may become the new CEO.

380
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,600
Really? Says who?

381
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
Director Choi.
It's highly confidential.

382
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:40,740
Yeo Jin is a goner now.

383
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,210
We need a sturdier connection.

384
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,980
Yeo Jin is a goner now.

385
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,510
We need a sturdier connection.

386
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,350
Se Young handed over
the security server.

387
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,160
Those two were
out to get their hands on Hyesung.

388
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,930
I was such a fool.

389
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,930
It's a relief
that you found out now.

390
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,330
Why don't you
send Eun Chong to Ms. Goo?

391
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,570
I can't send him to her.

392
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:13,870
How can I leave him
with the two who attacked me?

393
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,340
But she's the most trustworthy...

394
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,580
and safe choice at the moment.

395
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,750
Eun Chong won't have to adjust
to anything new.

396
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,110
How about Jin Goo's place?

397
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,520
There's no good reason
to send him to Mr. Hwang's place.

398
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,560
She'll think you got suspicious
and wanted to separate him from her.

399
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,520
Do you have a good reason
for sending him to Ha Na?

400
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,430
You can tell them
that Eun Chong wants to go...

401
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,760
and that you're using him
as a means to appease the Goos.

402
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,700
She wouldn't be too suspicious.

403
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,500
Will they even accept him?

404
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:49,410
- Try to find another way.
- Yes, ma'am.

405
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:55,710
If Yeo Jin resigns
just as Director Choi said,

406
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,250
I'd be left without connections.

407
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,590
I need to find the right people now.

408
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:10,030
If he'll be the next CEO,
should I go and meet that punk?

409
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,900
Oh, my.

410
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,610
This was my first visit,
but I came empty-handed.

411
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,880
I'll have another chance, right?

412
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,080
Have a seat.

413
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,420
What brings you here?

414
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,160
I hear you'll be the next CEO.

415
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,960
Well, I haven't heard anything.

416
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:51,030
I heard you got the clearance
to the security server from Se Young.

417
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,570
You used that to get
the confidential files, right?

418
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,870
Did Se Young tell you that?

419
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,110
I had another way to find out.

420
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,480
All right. You can date Se Young.

421
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,050
To be honest, you're partially responsible
for the broken marriage.

422
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,720
How am I responsible
for her fake pregnancy?

423
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,420
She was under suspicion
because of you,

424
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:17,260
so she took things that far
and faked the pregnancy.

425
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,200
Are you asking me
to split Hyesung with you?

426
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,470
We seem to speak the same language.

427
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,740
You can have
both Hyesung and Se Young.

428
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,510
Isn't that wonderful?

429
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,210
You should show some love
to your daughter...

430
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,710
instead of taking advantage of her.

431
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,880
What do you mean by that?

432
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,120
I love her dearly.

433
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,420
- Do you know what I did for...
- It wasn't for her.

434
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,890
You're doing what you want to do
by using her.

435
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:53,060
It doesn't matter.
Whatever I get will...

436
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,900
go to her.

437
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,100
Even if I become the CEO,
the owner's family has a successor.

438
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,810
Who? Eun Chong?

439
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:06,880
He's an eight-year-old.
What can he do?

440
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,080
Yeo Jin will become a nobody
after she resigns.

441
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,250
They'll be just another grandma
and her grandson without any power.

442
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,420
You need to side with Se Young.

443
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,930
I'll get rid of whatever stands
in the way of your future with her,

444
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,860
no matter who it may be.

445
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,570
Are you talking about Eun Chong?

446
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,530
Eun Chong...

447
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,170
won't be an exception.

448
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,140
It's nice to hear you say that.

449
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,340
I'll consider it.

450
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,580
How was the camp?

451
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,490
There were lots of people
in front of Grandma's home,

452
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,090
people with cameras.

453
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,590
Really?

454
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:56,130
You can't look out the window
at those people, okay?

455
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,430
Why not?

456
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,100
It's just... It won't be good
if they take your photos.

457
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,470
Are you talking to Eun Chong?

458
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,270
Why are you talking to the grandson
of the woman who ruined us?

459
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,270
He doesn't know anything.

460
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,210
But still, Ha Na. This is betrayal.

461
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,710
We all stand against him now.

462
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,350
How can I keep seeing him
even after finding out everything?

463
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:22,590
You need to forget him, too.

464
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,160
Why won't you say anything?

465
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,590
You need to promise.

466
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,260
These are the times when she shows
that we aren't related by blood.

467
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,400
You wouldn't talk to him
if you thought of our parents!

468
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,700
Don't you know how they passed away?

469
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,400
Chairwoman Shin
practically killed them...

470
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,340
because of the shock
from the bankruptcy!

471
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,540
Fine.

472
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,540
Fine. I won't call him.

473
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,310
If I find you talking to him
or contacting him again,

474
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,380
I'll cut ties with you, too.

475
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,320
You need to side with Se Young.

476
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,990
I'll get rid of whatever stands
in the way of your future with her,

477
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,300
no matter who it may be.

478
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,760
Are you talking about Eun Chong?

479
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,130
Eun Chong won't be an exception.

480
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,870
Mr. Han, are you all right?

481
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,280
Yes, I lost my temper instinctively.

482
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,380
- How can she be like this?
- Right?

483
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,880
Even to a small child.

484
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,820
She must be blinded by money.

485
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:30,950
We need to find her slush fund
as soon as possible.

486
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,020
I'm looking for something
in the Bahamas.

487
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,360
I'll hear from them soon.

488
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,430
It'll be easy to take advantage
of Choi Myung Ji...

489
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,690
if she tries to play politics
on my side.

490
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,000
Yes, run with it for a while.

491
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
We'll find the perfect time
to stab her in the back.

492
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,970
Yes, sir.

493
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,010
Today, you'll learn
how to introduce your family.

494
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,510
Who's your favorite person?

495
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,610
Auntie Ha Na.

496
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:56,050
She must be
your one and only favorite.

497
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,110
Yes.

498
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,520
Where can I send him?

499
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,090
He'll have trouble adapting
if he goes to an unfamiliar place.

500
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,020
Ha Na's place does sound
safe and adequate.

501
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,160
(Voice Recording 0123)

502
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,570
(Voice Recording 0123)

503
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,910
Who? Eun Chong?

504
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,080
He's an eight-year-old.
What can he do?

505
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,280
Yeo Jin will become a nobody
after she resigns.

506
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,480
They'll be just another grandma
and her grandson without any power.

507
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,020
You need to side with Se Young.

508
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,590
I'll get rid of whatever stands...

509
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,990
in the way of your future with her,

510
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,930
no matter who it may be.

511
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,670
Yu Jin wasn't the end.
She's now after Eun Chong, too.

512
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,880
- Hello?
- Did you hear the voice recording?

513
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,480
What are we going to do about him?

514
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,350
You must send him to a safe place.

515
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,550
Do you know a place?

516
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,850
Ms. Goo Ha Na's place.

517
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,590
What do you mean
you want me to take Eun Chong?

518
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,990
It's the chairwoman's request.

519
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,790
Why is she suddenly asking for this?

520
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,760
What's she going to do by using him?

521
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:25,870
It's not that. She can't leave him
with Ms. Choi anymore.

522
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,740
She showed her intention
to hurt him too.

523
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,280
What are you talking about?

524
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:36,550
Ms. Choi is someone...

525
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,220
who can get rid of Eun Chong
just to get Hyesung Group.

526
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,150
The chairwoman couldn't leave him
with someone like her.

527
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,990
She said she could get rid of him?

528
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:51,390
Yes, will you take him?

529
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,930
If I find you talking to him
or contacting him again,

530
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll cut ties with you, too.

531
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,880
I don't want to be involved
with Chairwoman Shin,

532
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,680
and my siblings
will be against it, too.

533
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,380
I'm sorry.

534
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,020
- She refused?
- Yes.

535
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,320
- What was the reason?
- She doesn't want...

536
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,760
to be involved with you,

537
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,030
and her siblings are
against it, too.

538
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,330
Did you tell her about Myung Ji?

539
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:28,230
She refused even after hearing
that he was in danger?

540
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,670
Yes.

541
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,180
I will...

542
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,020
keep you safe.

543
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,690
I will keep you safe...

544
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,460
even if I must sacrifice my life.

545
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,140
Ms. Choi is someone
who can get rid of Eun Chong...

546
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,010
just to get Hyesung Group.

547
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,880
The chairwoman couldn't leave him
with someone like her.

548
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,280
Think of Mom and Dad.

549
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,390
Remember how they passed away.

550
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,220
Eun Chong is my enemy's blood.

551
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:31,360
I can't hurt my siblings again.

552
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,350
Leave.

553
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,520
You must know why I'm here.

554
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,890
Leave right now.

555
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,250
Please take Eun Chong.

556
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,990
Why should I?

557
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,860
He has nothing to do with me.
He's your blood.

558
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,600
Find a way to protect him
on your own.

559
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,300
I will resign...

560
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,070
and apologize.

561
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,050
So, please keep Eun Chong safe.

562
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,190
I beg you.

563
00:33:31,450 --> 00:33:33,520
(Cinderella Game)

564
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,320
Something about Yeo Jin has changed.

565
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,590
You won't get to live
a peaceful life under my roof.

566
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,490
Eun Chong, you can't come here.

567
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,360
Do they hate me now?

568
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,990
Do you think we're a joke?

569
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,830
How dare you bring us
the blood of our enemy?

570
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:49,100
What I did made their lives torture.

571
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,170
I never knew
Choi Myung Ji could be so scary.

572
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,070
You're resigning?

573
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,140
I apologize with all my heart.
