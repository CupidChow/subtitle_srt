00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:02,791
(Episode 39)

2
00:00:20,172 --> 00:00:22,211
(Incoming call)

3
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:28,442
Hello?

4
00:00:30,751 --> 00:00:31,882
Hello?

5
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:34,352
It's me.

6
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:41,291
Sung Ho?

7
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,861
Where are you right now?

8
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:45,232
Are you in Korea?

9
00:00:45,562 --> 00:00:48,772
Yes. I want to meet you today.

10
00:00:49,302 --> 00:00:51,501
I'm bringing Eun Chong home soon.

11
00:00:51,501 --> 00:00:53,071
We'll talk in person.

12
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:55,171
Where should we meet?

13
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:58,681
I'll meet you in one of my hotel rooms at 11am.

14
00:00:59,082 --> 00:01:01,282
I'll text you the room number.

15
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:24,071
What do you think? Do I look okay?

16
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:29,171
I knew it was yours the moment I saw it, and I was right.

17
00:01:29,942 --> 00:01:33,382
You're pretty, just like the way you did on the first day we met.

18
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:35,181
Do I look 18 to you?

19
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,811
You should see an eye doctor.

20
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,121
What? I like my eyes just the way they are.

21
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:45,222
Yeo Jin, congratulations on our tenth wedding anniversary.

22
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,492
And to you, too, Sung Ho.

23
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:51,332
Yu Jin, you, and I, the three of us, will live happily ever after.

24
00:01:52,532 --> 00:01:53,662
Thanks.

25
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:03,342
Yeo Jin, in the afternoon, the chef from Jun Hotel will...

26
00:02:03,912 --> 00:02:05,511
Are you going out?

27
00:02:07,842 --> 00:02:11,152
Yeo Jin, isn't that...

28
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:13,051
your old coat?

29
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:15,122
You have good memories.

30
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:17,291
Of course. That coat was...

31
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,451
What about this afternoon?

32
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:23,092
The chef from Jun Hotel will come and prepare the ingredients.

33
00:02:23,532 --> 00:02:24,932
And we'll have a florist, too.

34
00:02:25,092 --> 00:02:26,361
Okay. Sure.

35
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:29,331
Are you seeing Yu Jin?

36
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:33,741
What? No. I have to stop by my office.

37
00:02:43,712 --> 00:02:47,821
How can I not remember this coat?

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,491
I heard that coat was your wedding anniversary gift,

39
00:02:54,062 --> 00:02:56,592
so I felt devastated as a widow...

40
00:02:57,162 --> 00:02:58,861
and bought the same style out of spite.

41
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:02,331
Ever since you and I fell into the same fate,

42
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:05,701
I didn't have to think about this, so I had stashed it all along.

43
00:03:08,842 --> 00:03:09,942
Wait.

44
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:15,712
Why did she suddenly pull out that coat?

45
00:03:18,812 --> 00:03:21,352
Wait, is she meeting Sung Ho?

46
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:26,162
Does this mean the two of them are...

47
00:03:27,662 --> 00:03:29,632
faking this daughter together?

48
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:34,562
Mom, I'm going to work.

49
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:35,771
Jin Goo left for work, too.

50
00:03:36,502 --> 00:03:39,071
Is that so? That's good news.

51
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:41,602
Your aunt said she was going to her office,

52
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:46,212
but it seemed like she was going out to meet Sung Ho.

53
00:03:46,782 --> 00:03:47,981
Is Uncle Sung Ho back?

54
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:50,981
No, we don't know for sure. It's just a hunch I have.

55
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,652
Go to work and find out who she's meeting.

56
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,092
All right.

57
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,032
What are you up to, Eun Chong?

58
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:15,501
I'm packing my stuff to take to bestie granny's house.

59
00:04:16,072 --> 00:04:18,241
Auntie Ha Na will adopt me...

60
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,611
after moving to her place,

61
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:22,352
so Tae Hoon will no longer make fun of me.

62
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,082
I see.

63
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,551
Eun Chong, what if...

64
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,491
And this is a big if.

65
00:04:31,621 --> 00:04:32,962
How would you feel...

66
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,561
if you couldn't go to the granny's place tomorrow?

67
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:36,931
Why couldn't I?

68
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,962
It's an if question, so please think about it.

69
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,402
It'll be really sad.

70
00:04:43,772 --> 00:04:44,871
Right?

71
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,342
You were looking forward to this.

72
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:49,142
No, I mean Auntie Ha Na.

73
00:04:50,772 --> 00:04:54,412
Auntie Ha Na will be really sad...

74
00:04:54,412 --> 00:04:55,912
if she can't live with her mom.

75
00:04:57,912 --> 00:04:59,121
I see.

76
00:05:00,522 --> 00:05:04,152
If I meet your grandma and tell her everything,

77
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,392
you may not get to live with Auntie Ha Na.

78
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,361
What do I do?

79
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:15,102
- Are you going out? - Yes.

80
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,231
Auntie Ha Na, what's this?

81
00:05:17,431 --> 00:05:19,072
A gift I'll give my mom tomorrow.

82
00:05:19,301 --> 00:05:23,712
Why did you prepare two sets of the muffler and gloves?

83
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:27,311
One of them is for my dad.

84
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,681
- There's a grandpa? - Yes.

85
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:34,121
He's somewhere else now,

86
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:36,652
but he'll return home soon because I've been found.

87
00:05:36,952 --> 00:05:40,262
My gosh. Then, I'll have a grandpa, too?

88
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:41,361
Yes.

89
00:05:42,532 --> 00:05:45,392
Do you think he'll like it?

90
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:47,301
What do you think, sir?

91
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,671
He must be around your age.

92
00:05:49,832 --> 00:05:51,131
Would he like something like this?

93
00:05:53,342 --> 00:05:56,212
Yes, I think he will.

94
00:05:57,512 --> 00:05:58,842
I'm going out.

95
00:05:59,512 --> 00:06:01,842
It was supposed to be very cold today.

96
00:06:01,842 --> 00:06:03,352
Did you dress warmly?

97
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:06,051
Yes, thank you.

98
00:06:06,751 --> 00:06:07,852
Sure.

99
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:14,121
Eun Chong, you can play at Ji Soo's place.

100
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:16,262
- I need to go to work briefly. - Okay.

101
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:30,671
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

102
00:06:32,072 --> 00:06:36,012
I think it's only right to stop everything here.

103
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,621
That's the only way I can stop a worse tragedy.

104
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:52,532
It's locked.

105
00:06:53,602 --> 00:06:54,762
Where is she?

106
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:56,871
She wasn't at the restaurant or the cafe.

107
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,251
- Is the chairwoman at work? - No.

108
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:13,381
Then, what are you doing here?

109
00:07:14,282 --> 00:07:15,522
You seem like a spy.

110
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:17,551
Do you come to work just to pick a fight with me?

111
00:07:19,092 --> 00:07:21,621
Let's take the weekend off. Why are you at work?

112
00:07:21,621 --> 00:07:23,491
I've become busy with the disposal of Hyesung Tour.

113
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,592
Do you still think you're with Hyesung Tour?

114
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:28,202
Should I move your office next to mine?

115
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,801
You're still reluctant to give up that decaying lifeline.

116
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:34,102
I didn't have the evidence that the lifeline had decayed.

117
00:07:34,102 --> 00:07:35,702
It'd be too late by then.

118
00:07:36,311 --> 00:07:38,171
Yoon Yu Jin will come into the picture soon.

119
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:41,582
You'll lose everything to her and Hwang Jin Goo, to me.

120
00:07:42,412 --> 00:07:45,512
It'll be nice to see the two of you exit the scene hand-in-hand.

121
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:46,981
You'll end up going down...

122
00:07:46,981 --> 00:07:48,452
if you keep getting cheeky with Richard Han behind you.

123
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,421
The chairwoman is much scarier than you imagine.

124
00:07:52,421 --> 00:07:53,762
That's nothing new.

125
00:07:55,162 --> 00:07:57,231
You've lost your game, Ms. Yoon.

126
00:07:58,332 --> 00:08:00,301
Should I play a few rounds with you?

127
00:08:01,431 --> 00:08:04,501
Sure, why don't we do that? Let me up my game.

128
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,452
Did you finish your background check on the chairwoman...

129
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:17,981
when you sided with Richard Han?

130
00:08:18,111 --> 00:08:20,421
That's already a given. I don't even have an answer to that.

131
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:23,552
Why did you ask Goo Ha Na to cut ties with you?

132
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:25,861
Did you plant a bugging device at my place?

133
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:29,231
Your crazy siblings...

134
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:31,692
shouted it out loud in the corridor.

135
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:33,332
How ignorant.

136
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:38,432
- It was for a greater cause. - "A greater cause?"

137
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:42,001
What greater cause? Hyesung Group?

138
00:08:42,712 --> 00:08:44,342
Don't try to get this for free.

139
00:08:44,542 --> 00:08:46,281
If you want to know, change your horses to me.

140
00:08:47,212 --> 00:08:49,212
Come to think of it, you're just like Hwang Jin Goo.

141
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,281
You're feeling me out and prying.

142
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:53,981
Speak for yourself.

143
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:55,481
You honestly feel anxious, too, don't you?

144
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,751
"What if Goo Ji Seok gets ahead of Hwang Jin Goo?"

145
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:02,531
"What if I lose everything I have?"

146
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,901
"I can hear your thoughts, Se Young."

147
00:09:10,102 --> 00:09:11,172
You're right.

148
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:15,401
I'm being very cautious about the best timing.

149
00:09:15,942 --> 00:09:17,072
That was why...

150
00:09:18,011 --> 00:09:21,042
I hoped you'd pull me in more aggressively.

151
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,182
How?

152
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,082
Like this?

153
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:33,761
Did you think the second time would be easy?

154
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:35,661
I'm not into anything easy.

155
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:37,761
How do you plan to take Hyesung over?

156
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:40,202
You need to make me believe to make a decision.

157
00:09:40,202 --> 00:09:42,302
You aren't holding onto Hwang Jin Goo because you trust him.

158
00:09:42,901 --> 00:09:44,432
You trust him because you're already holding on.

159
00:09:51,611 --> 00:09:53,212
If you upped your game, you should go.

160
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,082
Hello? You've reached Goo Ji Seok.

161
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:15,832
Chairwoman Shin booked a room?

162
00:10:22,072 --> 00:10:23,172
Hey, Ji Seok.

163
00:10:23,172 --> 00:10:25,511
I heard Chairwoman Shin just booked a room at the hotel.

164
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:29,011
She must be seeing someone important if she had to get a room.

165
00:10:29,352 --> 00:10:32,511
I doubt it's her daughter, but it may be her husband.

166
00:10:33,151 --> 00:10:35,182
- "Her husband?" - She found her daughter,

167
00:10:35,182 --> 00:10:36,651
so she must've reached out to her husband.

168
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:39,391
There's a possibility her husband is back.

169
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:42,292
- What if it is him? - I had a feeling...

170
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,031
she already took a measure with the CCTV in the corridor.

171
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:46,102
So, I stationed some people...

172
00:10:46,401 --> 00:10:47,901
by the elevators and the parking lot.

173
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:52,031
Sir?

174
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,802
What will you do if she's meeting her husband?

175
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,111
Her husband and her daughter could be her biggest weakness,

176
00:10:58,111 --> 00:10:59,781
and they both have returned.

177
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:02,411
I'll use them as a tool to put pressure on Chairwoman Shin.

178
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:11,192
Let's talk again after confirming if she is seeing her husband.

179
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,761
All right.

180
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:00,202
If I go in now,

181
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,871
Ji Seok will find out I'm Yeo Jin's husband.

182
00:12:06,312 --> 00:12:08,582
I can't let him find out like this.

183
00:12:17,991 --> 00:12:19,462
(Yeo Jin)

184
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:40,981
I thought it'd be best for everyone...

185
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:44,052
if I exposed the truth right now.

186
00:12:44,751 --> 00:12:46,322
But is it really?

187
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:29,161
Please let me down.

188
00:13:29,731 --> 00:13:30,792
Right.

189
00:13:34,031 --> 00:13:35,131
Goodness.

190
00:13:39,472 --> 00:13:42,302
You can store the paper cups in the lower cabinet.

191
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,172
I'm not that small.

192
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:50,052
I heard you bought new shoes at the department store.

193
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,582
Why aren't you wearing those?

194
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:56,852
They were too expensive and fine, so they didn't seem like mine.

195
00:13:57,292 --> 00:13:59,192
You have to put them on to feel like they're yours.

196
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,722
It's better to use it than lose it.

197
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:05,192
Well, I guess I'll put them on often.

198
00:14:06,861 --> 00:14:08,562
Anyway, why are you in the office?

199
00:14:08,631 --> 00:14:11,231
I wanted to take some files to look at over my break.

200
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:12,631
It's your break, so just relax.

201
00:14:12,942 --> 00:14:15,202
It'll be a lot of work to adapt to a new setting.

202
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:18,572
Tomorrow is finally the D-day.

203
00:14:19,141 --> 00:14:21,881
I'll be at your place tomorrow with Ms. Jang.

204
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:23,511
Okay.

205
00:14:26,052 --> 00:14:27,151
What are you two doing?

206
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:35,692
I said I'd pick you up at home. Why did you come?

207
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:39,702
We're preparing a party for Yu Jin, so things are hectic at home,

208
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:40,802
so I decided to come.

209
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:44,401
- And I wanted to ask you something. - What is it?

210
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:46,641
Can I trust you, Jin Goo?

211
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,342
Are you sure you won't let Ji Seok take anything from you?

212
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:52,212
What is it?

213
00:14:54,342 --> 00:14:56,281
The cat at your place was...

214
00:14:56,651 --> 00:14:58,511
the same one Goo Ha Na took to the vet, right?

215
00:14:58,952 --> 00:15:00,052
Yes.

216
00:15:01,021 --> 00:15:03,352
Wasn't it enough that she used her nephew to flirt with you?

217
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:05,491
She's now even using animals?

218
00:15:05,751 --> 00:15:07,692
And why are you letting her do this?

219
00:15:08,462 --> 00:15:09,731
Flirting? Hardly.

220
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:12,901
My mom volunteered to take her before she got adopted.

221
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:14,261
We felt bad for her.

222
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,832
Sure, everyone is kind except for me.

223
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,302
Ms. Goo's nephew wanted to see her, so how could I say no?

224
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,241
Forget it. You know that she's moving, right?

225
00:15:24,812 --> 00:15:25,911
Yes.

226
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,442
People may think she's your girlfriend.

227
00:15:28,141 --> 00:15:31,151
It must be sad for you to see your dear neighbor move.

228
00:15:31,151 --> 00:15:33,151
- Se Young. - Why is she here?

229
00:15:36,422 --> 00:15:38,322
She's taking a week off starting tomorrow,

230
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:40,062
so she's here to grab some things for work.

231
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:41,292
"A week off?"

232
00:15:47,962 --> 00:15:49,871
A contract worker like you got to take a week off?

233
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:52,031
You have such an easy time at work.

234
00:15:53,001 --> 00:15:55,072
This other girl met a rich mother...

235
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:57,511
and shopped at a department store as a VIP,

236
00:15:57,942 --> 00:15:59,942
but this other girl is wearing a knockoff bracelet.

237
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:02,082
You're highly interested in me.

238
00:16:02,082 --> 00:16:04,411
Does irritation also count as interest?

239
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:06,922
If you find me irritating, it means you care about me,

240
00:16:06,922 --> 00:16:08,182
so it does count as interest.

241
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:11,692
But why do you care so much about me?

242
00:16:12,092 --> 00:16:14,222
I couldn't care any less about you.

243
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,991
I don't care about you, either.

244
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:21,661
What's your delicious treat today?

245
00:16:22,102 --> 00:16:24,371
What? Whatever you want.

246
00:16:26,542 --> 00:16:27,702
Goodbye, then.

247
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:29,972
Yes, goodbye, Mr. Hwang.

248
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:41,452
The more I get to know her, the more I can't understand.

249
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:45,092
Gosh, I have to live with her starting tomorrow.

250
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:47,021
Hang in there, Ha Na.

251
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:55,161
Hey, Mr. Han!

252
00:16:57,532 --> 00:16:59,572
Were you meeting someone here?

253
00:16:59,971 --> 00:17:02,742
Yes, Ms. Goo. You must've come to work.

254
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:06,342
Yes, are you leaving? Or...

255
00:17:06,911 --> 00:17:08,012
No, not yet.

256
00:17:08,181 --> 00:17:10,451
Then, do you want to eat dinner with us today?

257
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:14,181
Gosh, I'm sorry. I think I'll be late.

258
00:17:14,651 --> 00:17:18,121
I also have to leave early tomorrow, so I won't get to say goodbye.

259
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,292
Is that so?

260
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:23,191
Please look after Ji Chang.

261
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:26,602
I almost had to leave him alone, so it was a relief you were here.

262
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:30,671
He may seem silly, but he's a good kid.

263
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:34,002
I like how he makes me laugh a lot when I'm with him.

264
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:38,911
It's such a shame I have to say goodbye now.

265
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,881
Then, do you want to get a cup of coffee?

266
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:50,992
I thought it'd be nice to talk to you before you left.

267
00:17:53,661 --> 00:17:54,762
Do you remember...

268
00:17:56,062 --> 00:17:59,931
that I once said there was someone I wanted to meet?

269
00:18:01,002 --> 00:18:02,131
Of course.

270
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:05,532
Your words gave me courage.

271
00:18:06,871 --> 00:18:11,512
By any chance, did you find the courage to meet that person?

272
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:13,982
No.

273
00:18:14,542 --> 00:18:16,852
If I took courage and met her,

274
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:22,052
it could take away happiness from someone...

275
00:18:22,052 --> 00:18:23,752
who had a hard time finding it.

276
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,721
Do you think it's still right for me to take courage?

277
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:30,861
That's a hard question.

278
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:35,102
If you meet that someone, you'll take someone's happiness?

279
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,671
I think you already know the answer.

280
00:18:40,941 --> 00:18:42,401
- I do? - Yes.

281
00:18:42,701 --> 00:18:45,211
Remember what you told me?

282
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:48,411
You told me to do as I wished.

283
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,881
You should consider which one you care more about,

284
00:18:52,052 --> 00:18:53,881
between the person...

285
00:18:54,022 --> 00:18:57,552
who found their happiness and the one you wanted to meet.

286
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,562
I'm sorry. That's about all I can say.

287
00:19:01,822 --> 00:19:05,391
No, I think I finally know the answer...

288
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:07,961
after hearing it from you.

289
00:19:10,032 --> 00:19:12,832
It'd be much better if everyone could be happy, right?

290
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:15,602
Did you feel happy to have met your mother?

291
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:17,272
Yes.

292
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:22,312
I always made a huge effort to be loved.

293
00:19:23,042 --> 00:19:24,911
I pretended I wasn't sick when I was,

294
00:19:24,911 --> 00:19:26,381
pretended I wasn't mad when I was,

295
00:19:26,621 --> 00:19:28,151
and even pretended I wasn't annoyed.

296
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:32,292
So, I was always jealous of others who'd be adored by their parents...

297
00:19:32,522 --> 00:19:35,092
even after they cried, threw a fit,

298
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,691
and got irritated at them.

299
00:19:38,861 --> 00:19:42,661
I won't have to walk on eggshells around my birth mother...

300
00:19:42,861 --> 00:19:46,032
because she'll love me just the way I am.

301
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:48,802
Just that fact is already wonderful for me.

302
00:19:49,572 --> 00:19:51,941
I hope only happiness awaits...

303
00:19:52,542 --> 00:19:54,941
both you and Eun Chong in the future.

304
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:57,381
Thanks. And you, too.

305
00:19:58,482 --> 00:19:59,812
If I meet her,

306
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:04,052
your and Eun Chong's happiness will end right here.

307
00:20:05,221 --> 00:20:08,121
Letting you two enjoy this happiness a little longer is...

308
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:11,062
the best I can do for you.

309
00:20:26,242 --> 00:20:27,711
I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

310
00:20:28,012 --> 00:20:30,411
It's not time for me to meet you yet.

311
00:20:30,852 --> 00:20:32,352
Please take good care of Eun Chong.

312
00:20:38,052 --> 00:20:40,661
The number you have dialed does not exist.

313
00:20:41,161 --> 00:20:42,262
Please check...

314
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:51,901
Ms. Chairwoman, are you all right?

315
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,802
"It's not time?"

316
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:58,072
I waited 20 years, and it still wasn't time?

317
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:01,012
If he won't show up even with Eun Chong here,

318
00:21:01,012 --> 00:21:02,482
then when is that darned time?

319
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:05,651
Don't ever come back into my life.

320
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,522
I won't even see you on the other side.

321
00:21:09,381 --> 00:21:10,522
Not even over my dead body.

322
00:21:15,092 --> 00:21:16,191
Ms. Chairwoman!

323
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:20,832
They're done preparing the ingredients.

324
00:21:20,931 --> 00:21:22,631
The Korean beef is getting dry-aged,

325
00:21:22,631 --> 00:21:25,802
and the sea breams are lightly marinating in lemon juice...

326
00:21:25,971 --> 00:21:28,201
- Just do your thing. - Yes, ma'am.

327
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:31,411
Who cares about what that fake daughter eats?

328
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:36,611
Please make sure the flowers stay fresh until tomorrow.

329
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:38,282
Yes, ma'am.

330
00:21:38,411 --> 00:21:40,221
I'll check everything tomorrow morning...

331
00:21:40,221 --> 00:21:41,852
and replace the wilted flowers.

332
00:21:42,322 --> 00:21:43,921
Yes. Okay.

333
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:45,992
Yeo Jin.

334
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,022
What do you think about the flowers?

335
00:21:49,262 --> 00:21:50,562
It's nice and beautiful.

336
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:52,262
Aren't you happy with my suggestion?

337
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:55,401
And you'll like the course meal, too.

338
00:21:56,401 --> 00:21:59,631
Yeo Jin, did something happen? You don't look so well.

339
00:21:59,631 --> 00:22:01,971
No, thanks for your hard work.

340
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:05,211
I have to pay attention since Yu Jin is coming home.

341
00:22:06,911 --> 00:22:09,711
Did she get into a huge fight with Sung Ho or what?

342
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:17,022
Throw that out.

343
00:22:22,292 --> 00:22:26,562
Don't you think Mr. Yoon will be near Eun Chong?

344
00:22:27,102 --> 00:22:29,062
He's probably watching him in hiding.

345
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:32,502
Once Eun Chong moves here, he'll never get to see him again.

346
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:33,671
I won't let him do that.

347
00:22:34,941 --> 00:22:38,012
He contacts me for the 1st time in 20 years and stands me up?

348
00:22:38,911 --> 00:22:41,812
He ran away like a coward when we lost Yu Jin,

349
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:43,852
and even now, he was hiding like a coward.

350
00:22:44,512 --> 00:22:46,852
I have no regrets or feelings for him.

351
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:48,121
We're done.

352
00:22:55,621 --> 00:22:56,762
Goo Ji Seok!

353
00:22:57,762 --> 00:22:58,891
Open the door!

354
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,671
Stop hiding like a coward and open the door!

355
00:23:03,871 --> 00:23:06,072
I have no time to put up with your drunk nonsense, so go.

356
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:16,181
Look how chilly your place is.

357
00:23:16,782 --> 00:23:20,221
It's because the owner of the house is cold-blooded.

358
00:23:21,621 --> 00:23:23,391
There's no warmth here.

359
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,992
I'll grab you a cab. Go home.

360
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,361
I won't.

361
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:30,691
Apologize.

362
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,661
Apologize for telling me to cut my ties with Ha Na.

363
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:38,732
Who do you think you are to tell me to cut my ties with her?

364
00:23:38,832 --> 00:23:41,102
Don't. I'll do it alone.

365
00:23:41,102 --> 00:23:43,042
People have a harder time going off booze and smoking.

366
00:23:43,911 --> 00:23:47,181
Hey, did Ha Na mean less than alcohol and cigarettes to you?

367
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:50,852
Honestly speaking, what did Ha Na ever do?

368
00:23:51,651 --> 00:23:55,181
Say something if she ever did anything wrong.

369
00:23:55,252 --> 00:23:57,391
Say something, you rude punk of a little brother!

370
00:23:57,391 --> 00:23:58,822
It's because I'm evil.

371
00:23:59,951 --> 00:24:01,092
So,

372
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:03,631
go be with Ha Na.

373
00:24:04,832 --> 00:24:07,102
- Don't run away like a coward. - Will you hit me again?

374
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:09,532
Go ahead.

375
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:13,441
Go ahead and hit me, you crazy punk!

376
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:16,572
I won't force you to do this.

377
00:24:17,742 --> 00:24:19,111
Have a good life with Ha Na.

378
00:24:19,441 --> 00:24:20,812
Just consider me abandoned.

379
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:24,012
Darn it!

380
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,792
Ji Seok, I'm sorry.

381
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:36,861
Please don't do this.

382
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:39,332
I beg you.

383
00:24:41,532 --> 00:24:44,802
You loved her, too.

384
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:48,342
You used to get mad at other kids who teased her for getting adopted,

385
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:51,441
and you'd clean up the house...

386
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:55,012
when she lost the ghost leg game and had to clean up.

387
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,752
You stayed up all night...

388
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:00,782
and looked after her when she was sick.

389
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:04,092
You even asked Mom to give her more pocket money...

390
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:07,461
when it seemed like she needed some more.

391
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:10,191
- I never did that. - You did. I remember that.

392
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:11,532
Shut your mouth and get up.

393
00:25:12,332 --> 00:25:14,661
Take back what you said about cutting ties with her.

394
00:25:16,102 --> 00:25:18,871
I'm not getting up before you do that.

395
00:25:19,732 --> 00:25:20,842
Do that.

396
00:25:22,302 --> 00:25:23,742
Take it back!

397
00:25:23,842 --> 00:25:25,842
- Let go. - I won't.

398
00:25:25,842 --> 00:25:28,812
I'll stay like this all night if you don't take it back.

399
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:37,421
Ji Seok. Let us...

400
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:41,421
send Ha Na away with a smile.

401
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:47,161
Our poor sister suffered all her life,

402
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:49,361
and she finally got to see better days.

403
00:25:50,102 --> 00:25:52,931
We'd get cursed by fate if we didn't do that.

404
00:25:53,572 --> 00:25:55,401
Fate would punish us.

405
00:26:15,461 --> 00:26:18,292
Man, why isn't he coming? He even ignored my text.

406
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:19,562
He wanted to eat dinner first.

407
00:26:21,401 --> 00:26:22,502
It's Ji Seok.

408
00:26:24,201 --> 00:26:25,701
Ji Chang is at my place.

409
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:27,572
He got drunk and passed out.

410
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,171
He got drunk and went to Ji Seok's place.

411
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,911
He must've gone there and thrown a tantrum.

412
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,082
Forget him.

413
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:37,312
Let's leave out those two old men...

414
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:38,651
and enjoy dinner as two beautiful women.

415
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:40,651
I'm here, too.

416
00:26:40,782 --> 00:26:41,852
Right. Sorry.

417
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,891
Two beautiful women...

418
00:26:45,992 --> 00:26:48,492
- and a jolly kid. Happy? - Yes.

419
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:52,762
Here.

420
00:26:52,762 --> 00:26:53,861
Let's eat.

421
00:27:02,772 --> 00:27:04,141
Goo Ji Seok!

422
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,441
I'll always be Goo Ha Na,

423
00:27:07,441 --> 00:27:09,782
even if I live as Yoon Yu Jin!

424
00:27:11,082 --> 00:27:13,352
You can push me away all you want,

425
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:15,982
but you can't change the fact that we're family!

426
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:21,292
One day, you'll realize how sincere I am about this.

427
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:25,762
Have a good life until then!

428
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:28,332
I'll also have a good life!

429
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:41,012
Wake up, Ji Chang.

430
00:27:43,752 --> 00:27:45,951
What? Why are you here?

431
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:50,852
Wait, why am I here?

432
00:27:50,852 --> 00:27:53,552
Don't you remember? You got drunk and made a scene.

433
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:56,022
Did I punch you?

434
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:57,262
Get up and relieve your hangover.

435
00:27:57,492 --> 00:28:00,292
Darn it. What time is it?

436
00:28:00,732 --> 00:28:02,461
- It's 10am. - It's 10am?

437
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:06,032
Ha Na! She's moving into the chairwoman's place today!

438
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:08,871
Why didn't you wake me sooner? Good grief.

439
00:28:23,421 --> 00:28:25,322
Call me if anything happens.

440
00:28:25,322 --> 00:28:27,461
Don't worry. I'll call you every day to check-in.

441
00:28:28,191 --> 00:28:29,292
Ha Na!

442
00:28:32,762 --> 00:28:35,431
I was so scared thinking you had already left.

443
00:28:35,431 --> 00:28:36,502
You reek of alcohol!

444
00:28:37,532 --> 00:28:39,871
How much did you have to drink?

445
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:43,272
If you go around getting drunk just because I'm not here,

446
00:28:43,572 --> 00:28:45,042
then I'll move in again.

447
00:28:45,141 --> 00:28:47,881
This is my first time living away from you.

448
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:49,012
Will I be okay?

449
00:28:49,542 --> 00:28:50,582
Stop overreacting.

450
00:28:50,582 --> 00:28:52,951
Eun Chong, what did I tell you...

451
00:28:52,951 --> 00:28:55,752
about surviving with a rich family? Tell me!

452
00:28:55,752 --> 00:28:58,092
- One. - Do not run.

453
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,961
Even dogs only walk when they're kept by rich families.

454
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:02,992
- Two. - When I address someone,

455
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,961
I must call them ma'am.

456
00:29:05,062 --> 00:29:06,131
Good job.

457
00:29:06,131 --> 00:29:09,832
Right. Don't even dream of eating fried chicken, pizza, or ramyeon.

458
00:29:10,161 --> 00:29:11,732
What if someone asks for your favorite dish?

459
00:29:11,732 --> 00:29:15,772
I like foie gras with a side of truffle sauce.

460
00:29:17,171 --> 00:29:18,641
Hey, that's so ridiculous.

461
00:29:18,641 --> 00:29:20,842
You make him do the weirdest things.

462
00:29:22,181 --> 00:29:24,312
Bye, now. You don't have to come out.

463
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:27,221
Goodbye, Uncle Ji Chang and Auntie Ji Eun.

464
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:31,792
I really won't see you off.

465
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,191
Gosh, I must have something in my eyes.

466
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:38,032
Ms. Ha Na, you should...

467
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:39,732
- get in the car with Eun Chong. - Okay.

468
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:41,431
Bye.

469
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:43,532
Bye.

470
00:29:47,671 --> 00:29:49,971
These credit cards are from the chairwoman.

471
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:53,272
- Credit cards? - Credit cards?

472
00:29:54,782 --> 00:29:56,681
Do you still feel anxious after taking the pills?

473
00:29:57,651 --> 00:29:59,151
Have they not kicked in yet?

474
00:29:59,852 --> 00:30:03,552
Are you sure you can keep Yu Jin under control?

475
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:07,361
Of course. You just have to put on a good act.

476
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:09,421
I'll handle everything else.

477
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:12,592
Now, take a big breath.

478
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:14,901
Drink some water.

479
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:24,641
How did that shatter?

480
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,411
That was made of crystal.

481
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:34,052
She must be here.

482
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:42,161
My gosh.

483
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,631
Welcome, Eun Chong.

484
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:47,631
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

485
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,861
You should call me Grandma from now on.

486
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,701
Okay, Grandma.

487
00:30:52,201 --> 00:30:54,572
- Auntie Ha Na, I have to pee. - I see.

488
00:30:54,842 --> 00:30:55,941
Come with me.

489
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:07,181
Welcome home, Yu Jin.

490
00:31:12,151 --> 00:31:13,592
Thank you for coming.

491
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:16,661
Thank you.

492
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,602
Is Yu Jin here?

493
00:31:23,871 --> 00:31:25,002
Oh, my.

494
00:31:26,471 --> 00:31:28,772
Let me see you, Yu Jin.

495
00:31:31,342 --> 00:31:33,611
You should meet your aunt.

496
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:41,052
Hello.

497
00:31:42,052 --> 00:31:43,151
What?

498
00:31:44,852 --> 00:31:49,361
You're... You're Head Director Goo's...

499
00:31:50,732 --> 00:31:53,032
It's nice to see you, Yoon Se Young.

500
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:55,602
You're...

501
00:31:58,002 --> 00:32:00,742
Yu Jin? You're Yu Jin?

502
00:32:03,742 --> 00:32:04,871
My goodness!

503
00:32:04,871 --> 00:32:07,941
Se Young.

504
00:33:05,971 --> 00:33:07,941
(Cinderella Game)

505
00:33:08,102 --> 00:33:10,602
Goo Ha Na is the princess, and I'm her lady-in-waiting?

506
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,572
Why did it have to be that brat?

507
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:15,111
It's all or nothing. I've been cornered.

508
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,141
You shouldn't have moved in.

509
00:33:17,141 --> 00:33:18,982
I risked my life to come to this moment.

510
00:33:19,151 --> 00:33:20,852
I do not intend to stop in any way.

511
00:33:21,052 --> 00:33:23,022
If he really holds a grudge against Hyesung,

512
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:25,651
it'll be so tragic for Ms. Goo.

513
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,792
The silent war begins now.

514
00:33:28,121 --> 00:33:29,221
Hey, Goo Ha Na.

515
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:30,992
Yes, Yoon Se Young!

516
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:33,391
This is my home now.

517
00:33:33,592 --> 00:33:34,802
My mom's home.
