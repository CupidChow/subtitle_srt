1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,840
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,439
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,849 --> 00:00:08,849
(Episode 29)

5
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:12,679
I don't think
I can stop minding you.

6
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:14,990
Why not?

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,920
I don't like to owe anything.

8
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:20,629
First, let me pay you back
for what I owe.

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,859
Did you think I was beaten
because of you?

10
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,429
Let's call it even
for showing me consideration...

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,699
and caring about me to this day.

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,740
I may call what I owe even,
but you're still my responsibility.

13
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,340
How can the president
stop caring about his staff?

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,979
Then, please treat me
as a member of Hyesung Tour.

15
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:44,280
Don't you think this is unfair?
Aren't you angry?

16
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,750
So what if I feel
this is unfair and get angry?

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:48,590
Would anyone care?

18
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,689
Would anything change?

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,490
I also do not plan to put up...

20
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:56,130
with this injustice
and humiliation from now on.

21
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:58,060
So, let me handle this.

22
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,600
Also, I'd like to take an early leave.

23
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:14,879
That family is just mad!

24
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:16,209
How could a mother come
to her daughter's office...

25
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,219
to beat someone up?

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,950
I won't let this slide.

27
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,450
I'm going to sue that woman.

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,790
No, I'll put the mom
and the daughter behind bars!

29
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,159
Why was she beaten?

30
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,959
She probably had a reason
for hitting her.

31
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,189
I don't know.

32
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,799
I was so mad that I forgot to ask.

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,230
You idiot.

34
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:34,530
If I'm an idiot,
you're a super idiot...

35
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,870
Darn it. Why do you always hit me?

36
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,540
Does Ji Seok know?

37
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,670
Darn it.

38
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,340
Would Ji Seok get her revenge
if he found out?

39
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,239
You should tell him.

40
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,750
Have you apologized to him?

41
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,280
You didn't.

42
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,390
I turned in a written complaint
against Ms. Choi Myung Ji...

43
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,989
for assault
and causing bodily injury.

44
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,920
Authorities will contact Ms. Choi
once the investigation begins.

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,659
Take in-house measures as well.

46
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:03,260
Ban her from entering the building.

47
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,329
The perpetrator's daughter
is also a witness,

48
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,069
so ask the police
to keep things confidential.

49
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:08,169
Yes, sir.

50
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,969
It's wonderful to have you
pick me up this early, Auntie.

51
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:16,669
I also think it's wonderful
to go home early with you.

52
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:20,280
But I don't like
how you hurt your face.

53
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:22,110
I hope it doesn't scar.

54
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:26,120
I'll be fine if I disinfect it
and keep applying ointment.

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,090
Hey, it's Ms. Sim.

56
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,120
- Goodness.
- Ms. Sim!

57
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,789
It's you, Eun Chong.

58
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,430
Are you coming back
from the kindergarten?

59
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,060
Yes, what about you?

60
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,659
Hello.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,539
I'm a little busy. Goodbye.

62
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,469
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

63
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:54,449
Excuse me.

64
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,319
Yes?

65
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,289
I just wanted to say this
because I was concerned.

66
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:09,659
Jin Goo will get married soon.

67
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:12,930
I hope you don't do anything
to cause a misunderstanding.

68
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,370
I'm not everyone's punching bag.

69
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,270
If I still had my mom and dad,

70
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:25,280
they wouldn't have let me suffer
all alone.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,379
Auntie, a hole!

72
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:30,520
What?

73
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,349
It's a hole.

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,060
Hey, what is it?

75
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,629
Dinner?

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,340
I thought we were eating
something simple.

77
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,669
What's the occasion?
We're eating shabu shabu?

78
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,280
It's the day you got beaten up.

79
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,650
I won't let her get away with this.

80
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:02,379
Shut your mouth, and let's just eat.

81
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,050
How am I going to eat
if I shut my mouth?

82
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:07,849
I've been here with Auntie Ha Na.

83
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:09,590
- Isn't that so, Auntie?
- Yes.

84
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,120
What? Just the two of you?

85
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,560
When?

86
00:04:23,569 --> 00:04:24,670
It's suspicious.

87
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:26,740
You could run into her
by coincidence,

88
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,670
but why would the chairwoman
eat lunch...

89
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,310
with just another employee?

90
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,139
I was a little perplexed too.

91
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:33,139
She gave you that dress
and sent you food...

92
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,149
for the memorial service.

93
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,579
It'd be perfect
if she bought you a house.

94
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,050
Wake up from your dream.

95
00:04:38,819 --> 00:04:40,750
Dreams are supposed to be had.

96
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,089
Gosh, I hope it doesn't scar.

97
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:48,189
I think...

98
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,430
Mr. Hwang provided the reason
for this misunderstanding.

99
00:04:50,529 --> 00:04:51,930
He's partially responsible
for not keeping his fiancee...

100
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,769
and his future mother-in-law
out of this.

101
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,329
Don't even talk to him from now on.

102
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,139
Why not? Mr. Hwang is a nice person.

103
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:01,370
Hey, just eat your food.

104
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,310
You need to watch
what comes out of your mouth.

105
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,819
That's enough. Wasn't once enough?

106
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:13,720
It's all but a misunderstanding.

107
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,019
Please ask me first in the future.

108
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:20,730
And you need to apologize
to Ms. Goo.

109
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:33,540
He humiliated my mom and me...

110
00:05:34,569 --> 00:05:36,339
because of that pathetic girl?

111
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,779
Is Mr. Hwang not coming?

112
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:47,350
I wanted to drink alone today.

113
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,790
Director Goo also came by
to drink alone a few days ago.

114
00:05:57,629 --> 00:05:59,930
Was that his parents' deathday?

115
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,930
Do you want to stay the night?

116
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,339
He must've heard
that his sister was beaten.

117
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,509
Would he be mad at me?

118
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,029
Yes, Ms. Choi.

119
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,240
The mother and daughter took turns.

120
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:56,410
I won't let them beat me anymore.

121
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,129
So what if I feel
this is unfair and get angry?

122
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,930
Would anyone care?

123
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,100
Would anything change?

124
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,100
If Ms. Goo became a shield
for Eun Chong,

125
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,970
then I'd be her shield.

126
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,680
In a way, the two
could supplement each other.

127
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,450
But the approach is wrong.

128
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:49,799
Be careful. Having fun?

129
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,399
All right! This is awesome!

130
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,070
I want to ask you...

131
00:08:56,509 --> 00:08:59,539
to stop minding my business
as of this hour.

132
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,549
I want to,

133
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,450
but we still have to deal with
Eun Chong's issue and the assault.

134
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
I can't stop minding you.

135
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,210
Ms. Goo.

136
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,019
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:56,200
I'm not everyone's punching bag!

138
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,409
Yoon Se Young.

139
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,649
You aren't the only one
who has a mom.

140
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,289
I have a mom too.

141
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,460
Mom!

142
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,330
No rain, no flowers.

143
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:08,110
If it doesn't rain,
flowers won't bloom.

144
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:11,440
Doesn't your back feel cold?

145
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,309
Don't stay there for too long
before you go home.

146
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:14,610
You might end up getting frozen.

147
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,519
It's just a word
from a neighbor passing by,

148
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,580
so I hope
you don't feel too uncomfortable.

149
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:51,279
I don't need you
to do something like this.

150
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,159
"The police station?"

151
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,830
Yes, I called you
to investigate the assault incident...

152
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,399
at Hyesong Tour's office.

153
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,769
How did you know?

154
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,299
We received a written complaint
from Hyesung Group's head director.

155
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,039
The head director
filed a written complaint?

156
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,240
Yes, can you share the details
of the incident?

157
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:24,379
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

158
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,850
Drop the accusation.

159
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,919
The assault broke out in the office.

160
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,860
This isn't some mom-and-pop business.

161
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:35,129
We need to investigate
and punish who's responsible.

162
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,190
You should've talked to me first.

163
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,460
I filed the complaint
as the head director of the company.

164
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,039
Both Chairwoman Shin
and Hwang Jin Goo saw it.

165
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:47,299
Why won't they take a measure?

166
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:49,940
Because they're family?
Because they'll be family?

167
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,409
Why didn't you do anything?

168
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,509
That's why they keep harassing you.

169
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:56,509
I won't just sit around
and take this anymore.

170
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,450
I don't want to make a fuss at work
because of my business!

171
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,620
You need to make a fuss!

172
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,389
They need to be humiliated,
stand trial, and get fined!

173
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,490
File for compensation
for every injury you got.

174
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,629
And get a medical diagnosis too.

175
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,029
Why would I need that?
It'll heal if I put ointment on it.

176
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,169
So, you need to stop now.

177
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,039
It must've rang an alarm.

178
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,899
Is something going on
between you and Hwang Jin Goo?

179
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,710
Nothing is going on!

180
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,840
If nothing is going on,
why do you let them harass you?

181
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,840
Why is Hwang Jin Goo doing nothing
after putting you in trouble?

182
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,509
He's having a tough time too.

183
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,679
You're worrying about him right now?

184
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,850
Drop the complaint, Ji Seok.

185
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:35,919
I ask of you.

186
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Please.

187
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,590
Do you want me to repeat it?

188
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,929
I did this as the head director,

189
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,299
not as your younger brother.

190
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,210
Where did she hide those files?

191
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,850
Darn it. These are all locked.
I can't destroy them.

192
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,620
Come on.

193
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,759
Goodness.

194
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,500
What are you doing?

195
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:22,700
Yeo Jin asked me
to bring a file to her.

196
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,539
But I don't see it here.

197
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,639
She must've left it somewhere else.

198
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:30,039
Gosh. Where is it?

199
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,149
What was she looking for?

200
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,879
She's acting really suspicious.

201
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,029
A children's sticker?

202
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,200
Yeo Jin, what's that on your hand?

203
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:59,070
A boy monk put it on me
at the temple.

204
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,169
I told her to throw it out,
but she put it on the mirror.

205
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,940
She has developed an odd interest.

206
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,350
Right.

207
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,659
If it's not in the safe,
it must be in her office,

208
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,820
not at home.

209
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:23,590
I should go there.

210
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,129
Who filed the complaint?

211
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,000
Ha Na?

212
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,539
Then, it'd be a lawsuit,
not a written complaint.

213
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,870
I hear Ms. Choi
may face legal punishment.

214
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:38,879
I hope I don't end up suffering
for stating the facts.

215
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,610
Would you rather tell a lie
and get punished?

216
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,409
Let's pretend
that we don't know anything for now.

217
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,690
Anyway, who do you think
reported Ms. Choi?

218
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,789
What did you just say?

219
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,289
Did you just say
someone reported my mom?

220
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,070
What is this?

221
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,600
Don't you know me?

222
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,669
I'm sorry, ma'am.

223
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,970
You've been banned...

224
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,009
from entering the company building
starting today.

225
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,980
Who did?
Who would dare to do that to me?

226
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,509
It was Head Director Goo Ji Seok.

227
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,509
I can't believe this nonsense.

228
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,779
Who does he think he is to stop me?

229
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,720
- Move aside.
- I'm sorry, Ms. Choi.

230
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:23,190
How dare you touch me?

231
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,659
Get Goo Ji Seok here immediately.
Right now!

232
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:29,559
I can't believe this.

233
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,070
Yes, you came right away.

234
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:39,200
Hey, who do you think you are
to stop me?

235
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,570
The measure was taken
after an assault incident at work.

236
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,139
Please go home.

237
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,639
Did you do this
because I beat your sister?

238
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:50,250
Keep a professional attitude
while you're at work.

239
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,820
You should pick up your phone.

240
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,450
I can't believe this.

241
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,519
Hello?

242
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,220
Yes, I'm Choi Myung Ji.

243
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,490
The police station? Why...

244
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:06,029
Someone reported me?

245
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,769
Darn it.

246
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,079
The police took witness accounts
from everyone in the office.

247
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,240
The police also told them
to keep it confidential...

248
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,410
because I'm her daughter,
and you're her future son-in-law,

249
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,809
The police probably didn't want
false witness accounts.

250
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,420
Who reported her?

251
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:28,490
It must be Goo Ha Na.

252
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:29,819
Or she must've made someone do it.

253
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,019
- It's probably Director Goo.
- Are you serious?

254
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:38,299
Ms. Yoon, I think
you should go down to the lobby.

255
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:41,900
- Why?
- Ms. Choi was banned from entering.

256
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,230
What?

257
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,069
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

258
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,140
Come in.

259
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,269
Yeo Jin.

260
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,609
I can't handle this amount
of injustice and anger.

261
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,049
What's going on?

262
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:00,720
I have to be at the police station
at 10 a.m. to make a statement.

263
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:05,289
Please tell Mr. Goo
to drop the complaint.

264
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:08,460
She doesn't even want money.
What am I going to do?

265
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,130
You should've apologized
to her first.

266
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,059
Why did you assault her anyway?

267
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,769
Mr. Goo had to take a measure...

268
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,299
not just because Ms. Goo
was his sister...

269
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:17,839
but because it happened at work.

270
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,299
Yeo Jin!

271
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,809
Will you make her
go to the police station?

272
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:24,509
Yeo Jin, this is heartbreaking.

273
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,380
I'd only end up getting fined
even if the complaint goes through.

274
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,150
Make an official apology to Ms. Goo
and try to settle the case.

275
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,150
- Even if I do, she won't accept...
- If she won't, kneel before her.

276
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,289
Yeo Jin.

277
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,059
I need to make her kneel
to apologize to her.

278
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,200
Ms. Goo is the only key for me
to bring Eun Chong home.

279
00:18:48,829 --> 00:18:50,069
She's never helpful.

280
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,710
I couldn't believe
she told me to kneel.

281
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,779
This is nonsense.

282
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,009
I'll talk to Mr. Goo.

283
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,579
- Will you?
- I'll do it.

284
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,720
It's better for the daughter
to ask for a favor.

285
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:09,250
I don't want to see you
asking him for a favor.

286
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,019
- I'll go with you.
- It'll be ridiculous if we both go.

287
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,289
Mom, you can go to the restaurant.
I'll send Goo Ha Na there.

288
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:19,059
All right. She'll settle the case...

289
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,059
if Yeo Jin intervenes.

290
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,500
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,170
No, what are you doing, Ms. Yoon?

292
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:28,369
What if someone saw you
rudely barging into my room?

293
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:30,869
Do you want to tell everyone
about our relationship?

294
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,910
Please drop your complaint.

295
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,720
My mom will apologize to Ms. Goo
and give her compensation.

296
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,089
Ms. Goo wouldn't care for that.

297
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:44,660
Then, you'll take this to the end?

298
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,190
Even if you did, she'd be
put on probation or get fined.

299
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,230
What does Goo Ha Na get
from this anyway?

300
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,289
Maybe that was why...

301
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,000
she came to see me
and told me to drop the complaint.

302
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,730
If that's what she wants,
you need to do it.

303
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,230
Why are you insisting on this?

304
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:01,269
- It's fun.
- Is it fun to harass my mom and me?

305
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,609
Is it fun for you and your mom
to harass Ha Na?

306
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:05,609
Do you have evidence?

307
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,650
Did Hwang Jin Goo and Ha Na
hold hands and kiss each other?

308
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,109
What grounds do you two have
to make this kind of fuss?

309
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,750
There was
enough circumstantial evidence.

310
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,589
Much more happened between us
when it comes to circumstantial evidence.

311
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,690
I wanted to spend the night with you.

312
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,059
You're crazy.

313
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:24,359
What are you talking about
in the office?

314
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:26,299
- You feel the same way.
- You've gone crazy.

315
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,000
This is sexual harassment.

316
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,099
Stop this nonsense
if you don't want to get sued,

317
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:32,269
and drop the complaint right now!

318
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:34,240
Then, why were you at my door
after you got drunk?

319
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,809
- When did I do that?
- It was thrilling...

320
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,809
to hear the sound of your heels.

321
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:41,609
Clack.

322
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,049
Clack.

323
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,319
I could hear what was in your heart
just by hearing that sound.

324
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,750
So what?

325
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,660
Stop taking it out on others
and look inside your heart.

326
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,859
Who should you side with...

327
00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:56,029
to get Hyesung Group
that you wish to have?

328
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,400
Is it Goo Ji Seok?

329
00:20:58,559 --> 00:20:59,660
Or is it Hwang Jin Goo?

330
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,200
Why do you think I'm here?

331
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:05,240
To get my revenge on you?

332
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,640
It's more like the opposite.

333
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,950
You asked Mr. Goo
to drop the complaint?

334
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,819
Don't you want her apology?

335
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,420
Or, at the very least,
you should get the compensation.

336
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,160
I don't want her to think
she has done her part...

337
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,859
after paying me a few pennies
and blurting out a few words.

338
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,460
Even if she apologizes,
I know she doesn't mean it.

339
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,930
Then...

340
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,529
what is it that you want?

341
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,339
Tell me what you want.

342
00:21:40,339 --> 00:21:43,670
I asked you
to stop minding my business.

343
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,180
This also concerns our company.

344
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,410
And I said I'd pay you back first.

345
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,109
I'll stop minding you
or caring about you,

346
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,119
but you need to tell me first.

347
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:54,720
If Ms. Yoon hears this conversation,
she'll misunderstand me again.

348
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,450
Next time, it won't be a simple beating.

349
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,559
I can't even talk the way I want.

350
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,059
I don't know what I want.

351
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:06,200
But I don't want
to make a fuss at work.

352
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:11,329
Also, I'm not sure
if I should settle the case.

353
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,700
Do whatever you want.

354
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,569
You can decide to settle or not.
Do whatever you want.

355
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:21,339
What's your wish, Ms. Goo?

356
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,710
My wish? That was random.

357
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,150
I guess it was.

358
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:28,349
But, for example,
you may wish to be rich.

359
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,319
Or you may wish to have rich parents
and live a comfortable life.

360
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,690
Or you may wish
your late foster parents...

361
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,589
to come back to life.

362
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,259
If I had to choose one,

363
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,769
I'd want my late foster parents
to come back alive.

364
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,069
I'd be so happy
if I could go back to those days.

365
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,180
Just imagining it makes me happy.

366
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,180
I also want
to see you happy, Ms. Goo.

367
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:00,779
Will you be happier
than you are now...

368
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,450
if you become
the chairwoman's daughter?

369
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,289
I arranged this meeting
because I thought I should intervene.

370
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,259
It happened at my business,

371
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,569
and my family did that to you,
so I was also responsible.

372
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,940
I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

373
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,809
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,410
Even if there was a misunderstanding,

375
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,980
I shouldn't have resorted to violence.

376
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,349
I apologize wholeheartedly.

377
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,950
Mothers always end up
becoming self-centered...

378
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,150
when it comes to their children.

379
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,920
No mother will remain sane...

380
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,329
if she thinks
her child is in trouble.

381
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,099
You must know that too.

382
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:48,670
You're a woman like me,
and you're raising your nephew.

383
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,500
Enough. She needs to be ready
before she can accept your apology.

384
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,839
- Don't rush it.
- I won't.

385
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,640
Why wouldn't she say anything
even after her elder apologized?

386
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,349
She must feel awkward
and uncomfortable to be here...

387
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,720
because she grew up in misfortune
without the care of her parents.

388
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,150
She's young,
but she isn't frivolous.

389
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,490
She's rather brave.

390
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,230
Hey, did you hear
that Yoon Se Young's mom...

391
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,390
wasn't allowed to go
into the company building?

392
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,900
I should've been there to see it.
What a shame.

393
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:21,869
Ji Seok ordered it.

394
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:23,630
He said
he'd teach her a legal lesson.

395
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,970
She's been reported to the police,
so she'll be interrogated.

396
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,039
Really? Goo Ji Seok did...

397
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,039
I mean, Ji Seok did that?

398
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:32,609
- For Ha Na?
- I'm telling you.

399
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,109
The anchor of our family
is no longer Ha Na, but Ji Seok.

400
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,019
So, you need to stop
messing with him. Okay?

401
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,849
- If you got it, nod, you idiot.
- Darn you.

402
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:45,420
You punk.

403
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:48,359
You have to apologize to Ji Seok!
Darn it.

404
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,759
You have to do it!

405
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,660
My younger brother?

406
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,470
- Let him in.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:02,970
(Head Director's Office)

408
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,710
Do you have anything else
to nitpick with me?

409
00:25:09,849 --> 00:25:11,920
I heard you reported
Yoon Se Young's mom...

410
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,420
and banned her
from entering the company building.

411
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,250
I did my part as a head director.

412
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,559
No, you must've stepped in for Ha Na
before you did that as a director.

413
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,720
We're at work.

414
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,029
Why did you come here?

415
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:28,970
Well, I gave this a bit of thought.

416
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:31,500
No, I gave this a lot of thought.

417
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,539
I went over the line
on our parents' deathday.

418
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,109
I shouldn't have punched you
no matter how angry I was.

419
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:41,210
I realized
violence must be eradicated...

420
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,950
after Ha Na was assaulted.

421
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,549
I was wrong, Ji Seok.

422
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,160
Forget it.

423
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,460
May I take your words
as an acceptance of my apology?

424
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,170
Please accept this apple
as a token of my apology.

425
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,440
You just chuckled.
That means you aren't mad anymore.

426
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:13,880
Bye. Have a great day.

427
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:16,450
Keep it going, Goo Ji Seok!

428
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:27,920
"As a token of my apology?"

429
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,900
Why do you think I'm here?

430
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,369
To get my revenge on you?

431
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,200
It's more like the opposite.

432
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:44,170
Was he serious?
Or is he trying to confuse me?

433
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,710
Here. Please eat up.

434
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,319
You can only have these lobsters
at market price.

435
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,519
Why won't you eat some more?

436
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,630
I understand
what you and Ms. Choi mean.

437
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,099
I accept the apology,
and I'll sign the settlement.

438
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,230
Thank you.

439
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,069
Who do you think you are
to say you accept my apology?

440
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,839
How can I repay you?

441
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,609
You said you wouldn't accept money.

442
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,210
Do you still feel the same way?

443
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:29,119
May I ask for something else
other than money?

444
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:32,990
Instead of money, what do you want?

445
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,160
You'll want a raise
or a permanent position.

446
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,630
Tell me.

447
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,200
I'd like to be separated...

448
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,529
from Ms. Yoon at work.

449
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,269
What do you mean?

450
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:49,569
Are you saying you want Se Young
to be appointed somewhere else?

451
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:52,009
Or do you want to go elsewhere?

452
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,480
I'm not sure how it'll unfold.

453
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:54,680
Let's do that.

454
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,980
Why don't we send Se Young
to the hotel resort?

455
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,119
Goodness, that sounds wonderful.

456
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,619
We plan to begin aggressive tactics
to attract overseas guests,

457
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,589
so she can assist Director Goo
in the marketing process...

458
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:09,529
No, Yeo Jin.

459
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:12,630
Why not? Se Young would love that.

460
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:13,960
Well...

461
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,569
Really?
I'll be sent to the hotel resort?

462
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,940
I wasn't sure
if we should be celebrating.

463
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,279
The hotel is a much better place
than the travel agency.

464
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:27,480
I won't have to see Goo Ha Na.

465
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:32,349
You'll be working with Goo Ji Seok.

466
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:33,950
What are you talking about?

467
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:37,519
- Why should I work with him?
- No idea.

468
00:28:37,619 --> 00:28:40,619
That was Goo Ha Na's condition
for the settlement.

469
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,089
I really hate the Goo siblings.

470
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,559
"The condition for the settlement?"

471
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:48,259
Stop taking it out on others
and look inside your heart.

472
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:50,369
Who should you side with...

473
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,200
to get Hyesung Group
that you wish to have?

474
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,740
Is it Goo Ji Seok?

475
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,069
Or is it Hwang Jin Goo?

476
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,740
Wait, did Ji Seok
have everything planned?

477
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,990
There is one thing
about Yoon Se Young that I envy.

478
00:29:11,619 --> 00:29:12,759
That she has a mother.

479
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,289
I don't know how she is to others,

480
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,630
but to Yoon Se Young,

481
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:20,730
she's such a caring mother.

482
00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:30,740
I heard you settled.

483
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,309
Yes.

484
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,279
Goodbye.

485
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,619
Just as you said, if Ms. Goo
became a shield for Eun Chong,

486
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:44,990
then I'd be her shield.

487
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,420
She won't have to suffer
from nonsense like today,

488
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,960
be put to sorrow
because of her parents' absence,

489
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,900
or live a difficult life again.

490
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,269
I was going to buy a fan heater
from an online secondhand market,

491
00:29:58,269 --> 00:29:59,500
and I was supposed
to meet the person in ten minutes.

492
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:03,640
But our boarder came here,
so I couldn't go out.

493
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,109
Hello.

494
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:08,380
Where are you meeting the person?

495
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,920
"Gureum Apartment?"

496
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,490
That's where Mr. Hwang lives.

497
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,930
I hope it's not his place.

498
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,430
Please don't be his family.

499
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,109
Oh, hello.

500
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:37,869
Are you here with the fan heater?

501
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,740
It was you, Eun Chong's aunt.

502
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:43,650
My younger brother was the one
who did the transaction online.

503
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:46,920
It was ten dollars, right?

504
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:52,019
I hope you put it to good use.
It's as good as new.

505
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:54,619
Thank you. Goodbye, then.

506
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,089
Wait.

507
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,099
Let me ask you to do this
one more time.

508
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,670
- Jin Goo and you...
- Don't worry.

509
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:05,839
Don't be so offended by what I said.

510
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,900
That's how mothers feel.

511
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:10,970
Mothers always end up
becoming self-centered...

512
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:13,279
when it comes to their children.

513
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:20,049
No mother would sit around...

514
00:31:20,049 --> 00:31:23,390
and watch her child being gossiped about.

515
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,619
Please understand what I said.

516
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,019
I said that because I'm a mother
who worries about my son.

517
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:30,259
Yes, don't worry.

518
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,900
- Let's go inside, Mom.
- You're here.

519
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,130
- I was talking to Eun Chong's aunt.
- It's cold.

520
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:39,599
Let's go inside.

521
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,970
What's wrong? Hey.

522
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,509
Ms. Goo.

523
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:53,420
I'm sorry.
Let me apologize on her behalf.

524
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,319
Let me apologize
both for Ms. Yoon's mother...

525
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:58,450
and my mom.

526
00:31:58,819 --> 00:32:01,390
She shouldn't have done that to you.

527
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,859
Stop it. It's true
that I don't have a mother.

528
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,730
You can find your mother.

529
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,230
Have you ever looked
for your biological mother?

530
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,039
Do you want to look for her?

531
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,970
The mother who gave you birth.

532
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,660
(Cinderella Game)

533
00:33:12,099 --> 00:33:14,329
Are you sure
you'll be fine working with Ji Seok?

534
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:17,269
It's a great chance to find out
what he's up to.

535
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:19,539
Did you decide to side with me
instead of Hwang Jin Goo?

536
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,640
The Dubai contract
was pushed back by three months,

537
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,009
and so did the second payment
of the investment.

538
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,609
Will you go after Hyesung Group
after you put Hyesung Tour down?

539
00:33:26,779 --> 00:33:28,339
I'm sure my sister
would've won the grand slam...

540
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,480
if suffering were a sports event.

541
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,319
Ms. Goo, if I can help
with your happiness...

542
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,119
by keeping this secret forever,
then I'll do that.

543
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,319
Someone is looking for you.

544
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,789
Who?
