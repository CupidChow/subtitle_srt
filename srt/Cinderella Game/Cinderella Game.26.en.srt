1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,439
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:07,950
Chairwoman Shin sent us what?

5
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,150
Food for the memorial service.

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,880
Fruit, drinks, and meat.

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,550
And they were top-grade beef.

8
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,949
Why would she do that?

9
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:16,019
I ran into her
at the supermarket yesterday...

10
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,260
and mentioned it was
my parents' memorial service today.

11
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,960
She remembered that
and sent it to me.

12
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,859
It's such a burden.

13
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:22,960
Did you...

14
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,870
Did you say the food she sent was
dedicated to Mom and Dad?

15
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,600
Mom and Dad are in for such a treat.

16
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:10,780
Have you gone crazy?
Have you lost your mind?

17
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:14,049
Did you return after five years
to their memorial to do this?

18
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,150
How can I not go crazy?

19
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:17,980
How can I not go crazy
after seeing you acting like a bum?

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,049
What?

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,290
Have you lost your mind?
You can't do that to your brother!

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,519
"A bum?"

23
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,560
Yes, we're all nothing but bums.

24
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,329
Then, what makes you so great?

25
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,430
Who do you think you are
to act so high and mighty?

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,060
You need to go to your room.

27
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,769
Are you okay? Oh, no.

28
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,530
You must've cut your lips.

29
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,000
If you were that big a deal,

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,709
then why did you return
instead of enjoying your life in America?

31
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,709
Just go to your room. Please!

32
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:45,510
Let go of me.
You need to wake up, Ha Na.

33
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,909
The Goo Ji Seok
you love and adore so much is...

34
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,719
nothing more than this.

35
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,890
Hasn't he done enough damage to you?

36
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,319
How dare he do this
at Mom and Dad's memorial service?

37
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,829
He has lost his mind.

38
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,710
What he said was right.

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,080
Wait, Ji Seok...

40
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,490
You can start cleaning up.

41
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,689
Ji Seok.

42
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,159
Darn it.

43
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,099
Why does my family always do this,
even during a memorial service?

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,300
This is so annoying! Darn it.

45
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,409
Hey, Eun Chong.

46
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,840
Ji Seok.

47
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,349
What's wrong with you?

48
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,780
Why did you ruin the table
dedicated to our parents?

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,150
- As Ji Chang said, I was crazy.
- Tell me what's going on.

50
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:03,389
You wouldn't do this for no reason.

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,219
Is something going on
between you and the chairwoman?

52
00:03:09,729 --> 00:03:11,699
Nothing will change
even if you find out, Ha Na.

53
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
Ji Seok. Goo Ji Seok!

54
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,500
Eun Chong just wet his pants.

55
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,740
It's all right.

56
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,580
Kids your age can wet their pants
when they're in shock.

57
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,250
There are lots of kids
who still wet their beds in sleep.

58
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:35,620
I'm sorry, Auntie Ha Na.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,789
No, I'm sorry.

60
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,889
I didn't know you were in shock
and had to shout so loudly.

61
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,560
And your uncles were
such fools, too.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,270
They were adults,
but they got into a fight in front of you.

63
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Was Uncle Ji Seok mad...

64
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,610
because of the chairwoman?

65
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,439
I have no idea, either.

66
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,479
Nothing will change
even if you find out, Ha Na.

67
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:05,080
But he seemed to have a reason.

68
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,569
Chairwoman Shin. Please hear me out.

69
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:23,529
Chairwoman Shin!
Please let me talk to you!

70
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,300
- Please, Chairwoman Shin!
- Stop it!

71
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,740
So, my father was victimized?

72
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,970
I heard Shin Yeo Jin...

73
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,240
has been purposely bankrupting...

74
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,480
small businesses to sell them.

75
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,750
In a nutshell,
she's a corporate raider.

76
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,040
I can be your friend.

77
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,269
Try some.

78
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,310
Are you thinking of Eun Chong?

79
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,579
Yes.

80
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,720
He said he'd be my friend.

81
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,350
That young boy had
such a sweet way of talking.

82
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,160
I kept thinking about him...

83
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,730
ever since I met him yesterday.

84
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,500
I couldn't get any sleep.

85
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,029
You need to get some sleep tonight.

86
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,730
You can't stay up
two nights in a row.

87
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,899
I miss him.

88
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:33,839
I want to see him.

89
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,009
I just want to look at him
all day long.

90
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,709
That day will come very soon.

91
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,350
I'll keep him by my side,
sleep next to each other,

92
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:46,050
eat together, and laugh together.

93
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,550
So,

94
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,930
I need to find a way
to bring him home.

95
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,269
No.

96
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:09,610
It's not going to be that easy
to find my grandma.

97
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:14,079
I don't have to find her.

98
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,509
All I need is Auntie Ha Na.

99
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,850
If you find your grandma...

100
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,290
and she wants to live with you,
what will you do?

101
00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:28,060
Auntie Ha Na, Grandma,
and I can all live together.

102
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,730
Will Eun Chong come
with the chairwoman...

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,699
when she tries to take him home?

104
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,670
Eun Chong and Ms. Goo come as a set.

105
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,439
Hey, Jin Goo.

106
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:42,370
Put the fan heater up for sale
on the online secondhand market.

107
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,240
- For how much?
- I'll just take ten dollars.

108
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,579
What's all this?

109
00:06:48,579 --> 00:06:49,850
Ms. Goo gave these to us.

110
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,980
Today was
her parents' memorial service.

111
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,689
Why were you at their place?

112
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:56,889
I had to drop off something
as an errand.

113
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,990
- Whose errand?
- Someone at work.

114
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,769
It's good. You should try one.

115
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:09,100
No, I don't want to.

116
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,870
And you need to stop eating
this late in the night.

117
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,370
Ms. Goo is a good cook, too.

118
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,139
Good grief.
You know what the woman is like.

119
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,180
How could you eat what she made?

120
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:24,279
Be careful with women.

121
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,379
That was random.

122
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,360
Sir, we're here.

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,329
I'll leave the key here and go.

124
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,060
Get up, Ji Seok.

125
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,490
How much did you drink?

126
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,399
Wake up, Ji Seok.

127
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,240
How did you hurt your lips?

128
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,980
You need to wake up.

129
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,259
He can't even take his alcohol.
How much did he drink?

130
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,039
Mom...

131
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:04,279
Father...

132
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,139
It must've been hard for you...

133
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:37,250
if you cried every single time
you saw them in your dream.

134
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,179
Well, I got...

135
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,320
used to it now.

136
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:45,860
Don't cry alone from now on.

137
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,990
I'm here with you. Okay?

138
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,179
Stay still.

139
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,320
She left.

140
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,350
Are you living with someone?

141
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,559
My younger sister.
She probably saw your shoes.

142
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,360
Why are you here?

143
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,929
I saved you from freezing to death,
and what now?

144
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
You should've left me to die.

145
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,740
I should have.

146
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,429
Do you want to stay the night?

147
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,110
You were crying in your sleep.

148
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,450
You must've dreamt
about your parents.

149
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,200
Ms. Chairwoman.

150
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,600
I have the result
of your DNA test with Eun Chong.

151
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,470
Tell me.

152
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,940
He is...

153
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,879
your grandson.

154
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,289
(DNA Parentage Test Report)

155
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:34,590
(Client 1 and Client 2 are
biologically related.)

156
00:12:36,929 --> 00:12:39,200
- Eun Chong...
- Congratulations, Ms. Chairwoman.

157
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:41,769
Thank you.

158
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,169
I'll bring Eun Chong home
as soon as possible.

159
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,370
How do I begin, Jin Goo?

160
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,379
Eun Chong is your only blood.

161
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:55,250
Everything was a speculation,

162
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,750
but there was DNA contamination
and the hit-and-run accident.

163
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,279
You must take
long-term safety measures...

164
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,350
before you bring him home.

165
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,889
I plan to keep his identity...

166
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:07,159
as my grandson a secret
for his safety.

167
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,259
But how do I bring him home
if I keep it a secret?

168
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,629
Tell Ms. Goo that
you're Eun Chong's grandmother,

169
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,000
then e-mail Mr. Yoon
and ask him to return.

170
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,399
The three of you should discuss
Eun Chong's situation...

171
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,509
I e-mailed him.

172
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,039
I pleaded for his return to Korea,

173
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,340
but he never answered me.

174
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
He will reply.

175
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:31,649
It doesn't matter.

176
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,720
I don't need him.

177
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,289
I'll live with Eun Chong anyway.

178
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,960
Then, you should tell Ms. Goo
that you were his grandmother...

179
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,059
and find a way.

180
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,000
You said she had been looking
for Eun Chong's grandmother, right?

181
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,100
Ask what she plans to do
if his grandmother...

182
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,870
wants to take him.

183
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,700
Yes, ma'am.

184
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,440
Ms. Chairwoman.

185
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:58,840
What's that?

186
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,580
Ms. Goo sent you
a basket of flowers.

187
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,049
Ms. Goo?

188
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:16,190
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

189
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,860
Thank you very much for showing
your warm consideration yesterday.

190
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,169
I might not be able to do much,

191
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:25,639
but I thought about what I could do
to repay you even a little.

192
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,210
The first theme of
the mother-daughter therapy tour...

193
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,039
is the first trip.

194
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,409
The daughter who became of age
will take her first trip...

195
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:35,909
with her mother.

196
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,279
And because this will be
their first trip together,

197
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,480
I want to provide
custom-tailored activities...

198
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,220
to turn this trip
into special memories.

199
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,419
- Because this is a trip...
- I thought the best way would be...

200
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,190
- between a mom and a daughter,
- to do my best at work.

201
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,230
we can use time travel
as our main theme.

202
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,929
- We'll take the photos they take...
- I'll do my best to live up...

203
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,730
- and turn them back in time.
- to your expectations and concerns.

204
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,730
Once again, I truly thank you.

205
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,970
I hope you always stay healthy,

206
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:00,200
and I pray that...

207
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,740
everything you wish for
will come true.

208
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,840
From Goo Ha Na.

209
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,950
It was nothing compared
to the kindness you showed me.

210
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,720
How could I ever repay you?

211
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,120
So, let me take Eun Chong now.

212
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,990
The lease for a unit
with two rooms is listed...

213
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:23,789
at 100,000 dollars of key money
and 1,000 dollars of rent?

214
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,500
We need a place for 50,000 dollars
and 500 dollars of monthly rent.

215
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,370
Please look more into it.

216
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:32,539
We have to move out in a month,
so I need one as soon as possible.

217
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,669
Bye.

218
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,409
Hello? Yes, ma'am.

219
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,179
Your place was already sold?

220
00:15:42,549 --> 00:15:46,220
I've been looking, but I don't think
we can move within a month.

221
00:15:47,419 --> 00:15:49,450
All right. I understand. Goodbye.

222
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,090
Gosh, the place was sold so quickly.

223
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,029
Are you moving?

224
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,799
Mr. Hwang.

225
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,570
She has to move in this cold winter
with a kid?

226
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,269
Does she have a place to go to?

227
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:05,500
She had been looking,

228
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,970
but the housing prices went up,
so it didn't seem too easy.

229
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,039
It's not like
I can just buy her a place.

230
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,580
What if I buy that house?

231
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,110
The house was already sold.

232
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,549
People could also grow suspicious
if you bought that house.

233
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,450
What if we let her take out a loan
through our business?

234
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,019
Please do that for her.

235
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,360
Ms. Goo, I talked
to Human Resources,

236
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,200
so you should apply
for a lease loan.

237
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,200
I was only a contract worker,
and I just started.

238
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,870
- Do I have that option?
- Yes.

239
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,870
Really? Thank you.

240
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,940
You don't have to thank me.

241
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,480
Anyway, have you made
any progress in your search...

242
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:48,110
for Eun Chong's grandmother?

243
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:51,649
- No.
- What if she wants...

244
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,789
to take Eun Chong when you find her?

245
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:57,919
Have you thought about
what you'd do then?

246
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:00,990
No, it all seemed too vague.

247
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:06,359
What's important is that
I'll do whatever Eun Chong wants.

248
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,700
Then, you already know the answer.

249
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:10,269
He'll want to stick around
next to Auntie Ha Na.

250
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:13,740
- Do you really think so?
- Everyone who knows you and him...

251
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,470
will all think so.

252
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,309
The Dubai thing happened ages ago.
Why haven't you reported sooner?

253
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,150
Have a seat.

254
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,420
It took me longer because
I wanted to come with alternatives.

255
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,150
Weren't you busy
doing something else?

256
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,289
The Dubai tourists were
postponed by three months,

257
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:34,789
and so was our bet.

258
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,660
What else would get postponed?

259
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,299
Was there something else
that could be postponed?

260
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,369
If you know what it is,
a tip-off will be nice.

261
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:44,670
If I knew what it was,
why would I let you know?

262
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,839
Well, I thought I'd ask.

263
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,240
How will you make up
for three months' vacancy?

264
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,740
We're planning
a mother-daughter therapy tour.

265
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:51,809
It was proposed by Ms. Goo,

266
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,579
and the chairwoman also had
high expectations.

267
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,650
This is the proposal.

268
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,049
Is Hyesung Tour unable to function
without Ms. Goo's projects?

269
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:01,019
She was a talented staff member,

270
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,690
but things functioned perfectly well
even when she wasn't here.

271
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:06,460
And it still does.

272
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,529
Does it?

273
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,599
You'd be a better fit
as Chairwoman Shin's assistant...

274
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,930
than the president of Hyesung Tour.

275
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,369
Your focus seemed to be
something else other than work.

276
00:18:20,539 --> 00:18:23,009
If it's the chairwoman's privacy,
it must be about her daughter.

277
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,579
I don't know about me,
but shouldn't Ms. Yoon know?

278
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,539
After all, she's the heiress.

279
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:31,680
Does her hierarchy come...

280
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,690
after you and Ms. Jang?

281
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:38,519
You must be busy with your work,

282
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,029
but you were worried
about Ms. Yoon's hierarchy.

283
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:44,160
Should I be grateful?

284
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,730
I didn't say that
to make you thank me.

285
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,329
I ran into her
at the apartment yesterday.

286
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,700
If we're done discussing work,
please excuse me.

287
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,109
I'll let you know as soon as
the official papers arrive from Dubai.

288
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,789
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

289
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:19,660
Do you want to stay the night?

290
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,410
What's wrong?

291
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:34,880
- Is something not working out?
- No.

292
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:38,279
- Did you meet with Mr. Goo?
- Yes.

293
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,079
I told him about
the mother-daughter therapy tour,

294
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,319
and he asked if Hyesung Tour
couldn't function without her.

295
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,490
He's crazy.

296
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,630
Were you
at our newlywed home last night?

297
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:51,299
What? Yes.

298
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,529
I wanted to start moving
some of my stuff.

299
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,970
- Why didn't you go with me?
- It wasn't that big.

300
00:19:57,069 --> 00:19:59,299
- Anyway, how did you know?
- Mr. Goo saw you.

301
00:20:00,269 --> 00:20:02,109
We brushed by each other
in the parking garage.

302
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,339
Did he say something?

303
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,279
- He told me to be good to you.
- What?

304
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,950
That's ridiculous.
Who does he think he is?

305
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,420
Hello? You've reached Hyesung Tour.
Team Leader Yoon Se Young speaking.

306
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,430
The chairwoman?

307
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,480
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

308
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,720
Thank you for the food you sent
for our memorial service.

309
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,980
It wasn't a big deal.

310
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,390
I heard you lost your parents
when you were young.

311
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:53,490
I felt concerned to see the siblings
remember their parents...

312
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,329
all by themselves.

313
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:58,130
It was because of you.

314
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,769
Next time,
let us just take the thought.

315
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:06,500
Both you and your sister have
a tough time receiving things.

316
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:11,069
Ms. Goo sent me a flower basket...

317
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,880
with a thoughtful
handwritten letter.

318
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,450
A flower basket
and a handwritten letter?

319
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,279
Both you and your sister are
with Hyesung now.

320
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,089
Our families must have
a deep connection.

321
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,490
I have high hopes for the future.

322
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:25,720
Yes.

323
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,920
I'm also looking forward
to seeing...

324
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,930
how our ill-fated relationship
will end.

325
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,730
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Ms. Yoon, you may go inside.

326
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,670
- I need to go to the ladies' room.
- Yes, ma'am.

327
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,210
Did you get home safely last night?

328
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,980
We're at work.

329
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:58,720
Ms. Goo?

330
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,759
She's under your order,
so you must know her well.

331
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,059
She seemed diligent
and talented at work.

332
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,430
I was wondering what she was like.

333
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,099
Why are you asking me about her?

334
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:13,900
- I want to arrange her match.
- "Her match?"

335
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,109
Someone thought highly of her,
so I'd just be the matchmaker.

336
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,380
I needed to know her character
before I set her up with someone.

337
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,250
I haven't known her for a long time,

338
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,680
so I don't know that much about her.

339
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:30,220
But she did seem
a little calculating.

340
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I understand.
She was an adopted orphan,

341
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,990
so she must've had a tough life.

342
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,799
- That's her background?
- Yes.

343
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,599
Are you sure about this?

344
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,930
What's important is
if she's trustworthy.

345
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,839
For example,
is she a woman of her word?

346
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,509
Does she have good discretion?

347
00:22:49,009 --> 00:22:50,440
There's a bit of a problem.

348
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:51,940
What is it?

349
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,079
Actually, an envelope with money...

350
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,309
once disappeared in our office.

351
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,150
Ms. Goo was a key suspect,

352
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,750
but we let it go
because there were no CCTVs.

353
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,960
Did that really happen?

354
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,390
Her ex-boyfriend also came
and made a scene...

355
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,829
as soon as she started here.

356
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,259
She raises her nephew,

357
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,660
and he causes
a lot of trouble at work.

358
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,200
Whenever he gets in trouble
at the kindergarten...

359
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,839
"Trouble?"

360
00:23:18,869 --> 00:23:21,400
Was it because
he grew up without his parents?

361
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,940
He must be a troublemaker.

362
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,079
She often gets calls
from the kindergarten.

363
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,410
She was never well-off,
so she had this tenacious nature.

364
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,210
You never know how she'll change.

365
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:34,480
She calls him a nephew,

366
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,450
but he's pretty much her son.

367
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,660
You should reconsider.

368
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:41,960
All right.

369
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,430
Gosh, lovely flowers.

370
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,269
Those are from Ms. Goo.

371
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:51,269
"Ms. Goo?"

372
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,200
Is Head Director Goo in the office?

373
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,509
He's out of the office for a moment.
May I ask who's calling?

374
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,710
I'm his sister.
He wouldn't pick up his phone.

375
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,279
- Please ask him to call me.
- Yes, one moment.

376
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,210
Your sister is calling.

377
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,289
It's me. Come to my office.

378
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:11,119
Okay. I'll be there now.

379
00:24:20,329 --> 00:24:22,230
You sent a flower basket
to the chairwoman?

380
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:25,170
You're dying
to get on her good side.

381
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:29,009
It wasn't like that.
I wanted to thank her...

382
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,869
Who do you think you are
to thank her?

383
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:34,210
Did she have to take the flowers
just because you sent them?

384
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,880
Did she say something to you?

385
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,019
It must be wonderful
to be such a simpleton like you.

386
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:45,319
You only care about the chairwoman,
the president, and your nephew.

387
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,930
You couldn't flirt and get your way
with the president,

388
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,490
so you switched horses
to the chairwoman right away.

389
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,430
You wouldn't believe me
even if I denied it.

390
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:57,269
Think as you like.

391
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,670
You're becoming
more and more unruly!

392
00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:04,670
Why would anyone like her
and want to set someone up?

393
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,480
Ms. Goo said she'd do
as Eun Chong wanted...

394
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,210
if his grandmother
wanted to take him.

395
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:14,450
So, she can let him come to me
if Eun Chong wants that?

396
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:18,259
He said he could live with Auntie Ha Na
and his grandmother.

397
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,289
How adorable.

398
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,829
It won't be easy to separate
Ms. Goo and Eun Chong.

399
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,029
From what I've seen,

400
00:25:26,029 --> 00:25:27,730
the two had a closer relationship
than an actual mom and her son.

401
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,700
It'd be better
if Ms. Goo accompanied him...

402
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,569
for Eun Chong's
psychological stability.

403
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:36,670
I'll have to find a way
to bring both of them in.

404
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:38,940
You'll take Ms. Goo in, too?

405
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,180
If she can act as a safety net...

406
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,980
and protect Eun Chong,

407
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,349
then I must take her in.

408
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,720
Let's find a way
to bring in the two of them.

409
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:52,960
Ms. Goo as his safety net?

410
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,230
Ms. Jang, find out
where Yu Jin is resting.

411
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,730
Now that I found Eun Chong,

412
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,170
I must go meet her.

413
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:05,670
Yes, I'll look into memorial parks
and natural burials...

414
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,339
in Gyeonggi Province and the area.

415
00:26:11,009 --> 00:26:12,809
What did you mean by that yesterday?

416
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,509
Why would nothing change
even if I found out?

417
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:18,779
Is something going on
between you and the chairwoman?

418
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,089
Chairwoman Shin was our enemy
who caused our parents' death.

419
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,789
She was the reason
our family turned out like this.

420
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,119
I said I'd destroy Hyesung Tour.

421
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,160
I'm promoting a business...

422
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,190
with an investor I met in America,
and our goal is Hyesung Group.

423
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,660
Chairwoman Shin and I are
technically enemies.

424
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,769
I didn't want her
to be involved with our family.

425
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:40,099
Hyesung Group is your goal?

426
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,569
Is your business like
a merger and acquisition?

427
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,609
Or are you a corporate raider?

428
00:26:48,579 --> 00:26:50,950
- Why do you do that kind of work?
- "That kind of work?"

429
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,980
Okay. It's all good. It's your work.

430
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,519
But the chairwoman has no idea
what you're thinking.

431
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,720
She sincerely wanted
to show her concern...

432
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,359
- for our parents' memorial...
- You need to stop.

433
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,690
No, you need to stop.

434
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:05,500
You must do the minimum as a human,
no matter how important work is.

435
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,630
What do I have to do?

436
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,099
You need to have respect for others.

437
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:12,400
And you sent her flowers
and a handwritten letter to do that?

438
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,069
Our parents
would've praised me for it.

439
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,740
- You're driving me crazy.
- What's wrong with you?

440
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,779
Our parents didn't teach us...

441
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,549
to forget our respect,
duties, and common sense...

442
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,319
just to become a success.

443
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,519
Our father was also in business,

444
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,990
but he was always concerned
about the less fortunate.

445
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,190
- What was that smirk?
- You can live that life.

446
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,690
Live that pure,
innocent, and kind life,

447
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,460
trusting everyone
who comes into your life.

448
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:40,799
It'd hurt a lot
if you got your back stabbed.

449
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,970
Are you saying
the chairwoman is not trustworthy?

450
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,569
I don't know
what you know about her,

451
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,569
but do you enjoy
becoming a success like that?

452
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:50,710
What's your definition of success?

453
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,680
Just making lots of money?

454
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,779
That's enough.

455
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:56,680
We can each live however we want.

456
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,380
I'll take my journey,
and you can take yours.

457
00:28:00,849 --> 00:28:01,990
Please leave.

458
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,230
Why have you changed like this?

459
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,160
Where did that Ji Seok go,

460
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,829
the warm-hearted, sweet,
and kindest boy?

461
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,069
He doesn't exist anymore.

462
00:28:26,009 --> 00:28:31,150
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

463
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,190
Yes, Mr. Goo.

464
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,420
Please send a thank you gift
to Chairwoman Shin's place.

465
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,130
I need to shake her around.

466
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,130

467

468
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:08,819
The horrendous thing...

469
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,319
your mommy did
to Ms. Goo's family 13 years ago...

470
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:16,690
came back to haunt us like this.

471
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,900
I have no idea
how to resolve this tragedy.

472
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:23,799
What will happen to Eun Chong?

473
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,599
What about Ms. Goo and Ji Seok?

474
00:29:31,509 --> 00:29:35,009
What can I do to untangle
this ill-fated relationship?

475
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,279
What can I do?

476
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:44,220
(5 years ago, New York, USA)

477
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,029

478
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:58,970
Hey, are you okay?

479
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,299

Yu Jin won't return
just because I live a good life.

495
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,359
Then, I already lived a good life,
so why was she taken from me?

496
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:00,099
Living a good life...

497
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,559
just resulted
in the loss of my daughter.

Are you telling me
to live a good life?

You can do that if you want!

You shouldn't do that, Yeo Jin.

501
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,200
You should think of her...

502
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,410
and not do anything
that'd cause pain in others.

503
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,180

for what you have done!

Wait, was he the boy from that time?

514

What is this, Yeo Jin?

515
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:09,200
It must mean you should put
your death portrait in here.

516
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:13,269

would send something like this?

517

This had died down for a while,
but the blackmailing began again.

523
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:27,910
(Cinderella Game)

524
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:30,109
What's she looking at
with such loving eyes?

525
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,950
Why don't you
tell the truth to your family?

526
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,650
I'll open it at that hour.

527
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:36,450
I'm looking forward to this.

528
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,890
You must believe Ms. Goo.

529
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,390
I have to bring both of them.

530
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,720
It's opened?

531
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:44,059
It would've been wonderful...

532
00:33:44,059 --> 00:33:46,099
if you were by Eun Chong's side,
not Ms. Goo.

533
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,799
The truth behind Yu Jin's death
hasn't been revealed yet,

534
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,569
so it'll be dangerous
if you get too close to Eun Chong.

535
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,500
Eun Chong!
