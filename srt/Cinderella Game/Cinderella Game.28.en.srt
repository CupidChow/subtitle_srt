1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,509
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,619
Yu Jin would want me
to bring Eun Chong home.

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:17,960
No matter how close they were,
he still grew up with a stranger.

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:19,920
A child under foster care?

7
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:25,100
But how can I hide the truth
from Ms. Goo and bring him here?

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,969
Their eldest son
wasn't really his son!

9
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,939
His real son died,
so that man isn't his real son.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,679
The chairman's younger brother...

11
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,310
ran the parentage test
and found out.

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,179
So, the chairman also knew?

13
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,880
Yes, the two
staged everything together.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,920
He asked that man to be his son.

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,619
A fake son.

16
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:55,859
Yes.

17
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,500
There's nothing I won't do
to keep my grandson safe.

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,810
Ms. Goo. You said you wanted
to repay my kindness.

19
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,379
There's something you can do for me.

20
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,650
You need to be Yu Jin...

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,120
for Eun Chong's sake.

22
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:23,090
What's all this?

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,219
The borough office sent this
to foster homes.

24
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,560
"The borough office?"

25
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,930
I didn't hear anything about this.

26
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,269
Auntie Ha Na, may I try this on?

27
00:01:34,269 --> 00:01:37,099
Of course. Come here. Let's see.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,640
My gosh! It fits perfectly.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,680
I was going to buy you
a padded jacket. This is great.

30
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,709
It's so warm.

31
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,409
Rice. Meat. Kimchi. Snacks.

32
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:52,120
Your favorite, tangerines,

33
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,849
and Eun Chong's favorite,
strawberries?

34
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,390
Did they conduct a survey
to find out your preferences?

35
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,359
My gosh. Sneakers!

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,299
All right.

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,069
They're a perfect fit!

38
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,969
And the colors match.

39
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:15,509
How did they know
blue was your favorite color?

40
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,340
You're so lucky, kid.

41
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,750
If they were going to send us this,
why didn't they throw in cash?

42
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,979
Is there an increase
in the foster home benefits?

43
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,189
I found both Yu Jin...

44
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,659
and Eun Chong.

45
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:39,159
I just have to bring him home now.

46
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:41,830
What did you want to say to me?

47
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,139
I found a way to bring Eun Chong.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,909
I'll turn Ms. Goo into my daughter.

49
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,349
You'll turn Ms. Goo
into your daughter?

50
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,780
That's the safest way
to bring Eun Chong home.

51
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,689
If Ms. Goo becomes Yu Jin,

52
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,689
I can hide Eun Chong's identity
as my grandson and bring him home.

53
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,629
At this point, that would be
the most realistic solution.

54
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:13,800
Persuading Ms. Goo would be the key,

55
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:16,900
but if she had to do this
for Eun Chong,

56
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,169
then, in the end,
she'd do as you asked.

57
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,710
You should tell Ms. Goo that
you were Eun Chong's grandmother...

58
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,840
That's not what I mean.

59
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,449
Ms. Goo will become
my real daughter.

60
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:34,750
- Sorry?
- I'd turn her into Yu Jin,

61
00:03:36,289 --> 00:03:38,159
whom I lost 20 years ago.

62
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:40,789
What do you mean it's erroneous?

63
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:44,129
Recreating photos they took
with their moms as a child?

64
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,530
If that's the theme,

65
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,439
then people who don't have photos
with their mom can't do this.

66
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,909
Do you have
a lot of photos with your mother?

67
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,210
- No.
- People like you can't do this.

68
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,580
Why did you come up with an idea
you couldn't even do?

69
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,879
If you understand, do it over.

70
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,370
What are you saying?

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,569
Wait, do you want to deceive her?

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,939
She'll become the real Yu Jin,

73
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,110
and Eun Chong will remain
as her friend's son.

74
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:33,180
Yu Jin lived as Lee Du Na,

75
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:36,879
so no one would know
Eun Chong was Yu Jin's son.

76
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:39,279
How can you deceive her
and make her your daughter?

77
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,649
This would be hard
even if she cooperated.

78
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,889
It's impossible to deceive her, too.

79
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,759
Find out everything
about how she had lived...

80
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,629
to come up with a story.

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,100
- Please do that.
- This is nonsense, Ms. Chairwoman.

82
00:04:53,829 --> 00:04:57,100
Just tell her the truth and ask her
to live with you as her daughter.

83
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,339
If she must do this for Eun Chong,

84
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,470
then, eventually,
she'll do as you ask.

85
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,810
- Jin Goo.
- She raised Eun Chong.

86
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,149
You need to give her your trust.

87
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,319
This isn't the problem
of trusting her.

88
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,920
It's about Eun Chong's safety.

89
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:15,389
He had been safe all along...

90
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:19,290
because no one knew he was
Yu Jin's son, even Ms. Goo.

91
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:24,660
It's better to keep it a secret from her
to keep Eun Chong safe.

92
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:27,970
You said she was
very close to her siblings.

93
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,529
It wouldn't be easy
to keep it a secret.

94
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,139
It's a good deal for her, too.

95
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,569
She'll instantly be like Cinderella,
just like everyone's dream.

96
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,439
What if you were caught?

97
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,850
It'd hurt Ms. Goo and Eun Chong.

98
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,209
I wouldn't let it happen.

99
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,519
An orphan, an adoptee,
a young breadwinner,

100
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:47,819
and now, she's a foster mom.

101
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,459
How unfortunate.

102
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,189
Yet you want to deceive
and take advantage of her?

103
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:57,560
In the end,
this will be for her benefit.

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,769
Please turn a blind eye to it
for that poor woman.

105
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,740
Ms. Chairwoman.

106
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:07,410
Wouldn't it be good for her
if I became her mother?

107
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,459
It's a good deal for her, too.

108
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,959
She'll instantly be like Cinderella,

109
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,300
just like everyone's dream.

110
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,329
"Cinderella."

111
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,600
But if she found out,

112
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,540
it'd be like making a fool of her
and deceiving her life.

113
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,040
How will she handle this?

114
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,879
No, it can't happen.

115
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,290
Why did the chairwoman
want to see you?

116
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,389
She wanted to know
the status of our subcontractors.

117
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,959
I thought it was something serious.

118
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,000
Report on your revision
as soon as you're done.

119
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,600
Yes.

120
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,009
(Eun Chong's Vegetable Garden)

121
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,610
If that's the theme,

122
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,949
then people who don't have photos
with their mom can't do this.

123
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,189
That was an unexpected moment...

124
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,920
to feel the sorrow
of not having a mother.

125
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,430
How am I going to revise the theme?

126
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,569
- Ha Na, he came to see the place.
- Okay.

127
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,910
Hello. I just received a call
from the real estate agent.

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,209
This is the room.

129
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,180
He's Grandpa Beard, Auntie.

130
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,949
"Grandpa Beard?"

131
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:56,310
He was the one
who saved Eun Chong last time.

132
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,750
Really?

133
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,519
Goodness, thank you.

134
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,250
I've been wanting to meet you.

135
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,959
I didn't know
this was Eun Chong's place.

136
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,290
It was.
Please take a look at this room...

137
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:08,990
and take your time
with the rest of the house.

138
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,360
I like it.

139
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,529
Grandpa,
are you going to live with us?

140
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,339
If your family says yes.

141
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,509
Hey, nice jacket.

142
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:27,250
It was a present
from the borough office.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,819
First, we need a reference
for your identity...

144
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,120
and a copy of your bankbook...

145
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,820
to make sure
you won't be behind on rent.

146
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:36,590
I'll bring a copy of my resident register
and the bankbook.

147
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,519
Also, we all live here together,

148
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,789
so please do not cross the line.

149
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:43,590
We will not intervene
with each person's privacy.

150
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,500
Make sure you clean, do the laundry,

151
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,230
and recycle the trash accordingly.

152
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,429
Don't worry.

153
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,669
I'll abide by all your conditions.

154
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:00,379
Do you not have any family?

155
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:02,649
Well, no.

156
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:05,049
Are you also an orphan?

157
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:09,519
Yes, I'm an adult orphan.

158
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,559
So, they won't have to move?

159
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,330
No, the new landlord let us stay.

160
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,899
The rent remains the same,
and we can rent out my room, too.

161
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,429
We were so lucky.

162
00:09:20,669 --> 00:09:22,600
Make sure they find
a decent boarder.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,240
Yes, I'll hold an interview.

164
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,639
Now that we're on the topic,
I'll call them.

165
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,409
Ha Na, before you find a boarder...

166
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,779
What? Already?

167
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:36,110
What's the person like?

168
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:39,779
A grandpa? Are you crazy?

169
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,549
He's a volunteer
at Eun Chong's kindergarten.

170
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,429
I'm going to interview him,
so don't sign the contract until then.

171
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,289
We'll manage. Goodbye.

172
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,669
It'd be nice to have
an elder at home.

173
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:58,269
He could be
a grandfather to Eun Chong, too.

174
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,039
Okay.

175
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:07,509
Ms. Goo will become
my real daughter.

176
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,580
I'd turn her into Yu Jin,
whom I lost 20 years ago.

177
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,129
What's with that sigh?

178
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,230
Is something troubling you?

179
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,259
No.

180
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,230
Mom, if someone...

181
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,340
told you a lie...

182
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,009
to deceive you
and take advantage of your life,

183
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,409
how would you feel?

184
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,539
That sounds so evil.
I won't let it go.

185
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,049
But what if that person
told the lie for my sake?

186
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,820
Can you understand
and forgive that person?

187
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,090
If it really was for your sake,
I wouldn't care about my life.

188
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,960
I'd understand and forgive them
a hundred times and some more.

189
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:54,929
Anyway, why do you ask?

190
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,460
Is something going on?

191
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,559
No, I was just asking.

192
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,669
Right. I'm meeting Myung Ji
at your newlywed home tomorrow.

193
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,769
I'll bring over whatever you need.

194
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't have anything.

195
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:08,539
You have your son right behind you,

196
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,379
so don't lose your spirit
when you're with Ms. Choi.

197
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,710
I never let my spirit down
no matter where I am.

198
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,809
I let them have the best of me.

199
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,259
Why did you just walk out of there?

200
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,899
Because I live here.

201
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,769
You live here?

202
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,740
Darn it. Both of you!

203
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,639
Hey, do you and your sister...

204
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,370
always go around trying to take
someone who's taken?

205
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,610
You want your revenge
on Se Young, don't you?

206
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,850
That's why
you're using your sister, too.

207
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,190
How dare she flirt crudely
with her superior's man?

208
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,389
If you don't want the intranet
to flood with your sister's story,

209
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,360
keep her under control.

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,200
You need to keep
your daughter under control.

211
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:09,929
"Se Young's ex-boyfriend,
whom she lived with in America,"

212
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,100
"lives right next door
to her newlywed home."

213
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,269
Who'd suffer from more damage?

214
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,110
That little... You're just...

215
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,889
What's wrong? What is it?

216
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,549
Do you know him?

217
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,389
How would I know him?

218
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,659
Let's just go inside.

219
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,600
You found the place smoothly
without getting lost.

220
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,240
Of course.

221
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:47,000
It already looks great
from the entrance.

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,840
It's so nice.

223
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,110
We paid a lot for the place.

224
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,679
Who was that young man?
Why were you so mad at him?

225
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,019
An irrational neighbor. Good grief.

226
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,350
Bang Ul, I need to make a call.

227
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,860
- Please take a look around.
- Okay.

228
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,740
You need to move immediately.

229
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,470
Why didn't you tell me...

230
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:23,710
Goo Ji Seok lived next door?

231
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,309
He doesn't want revenge.

232
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,909
He doesn't care about me.

233
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:28,210
And you believed him?

234
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:33,350
He threatened me when I told him...

235
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,419
to keep Goo Ha Na under control.

236
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,490
He asked who'd suffer more...

237
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:40,320
if people heard the ex-boyfriend
you lived with in America was...

238
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,929
living next door right now.

239
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,259
His eyes were gleaming
with a menacing look.

240
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,399
He gave me such chills.
That evil punk.

241
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,799
You need to move immediately.

242
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,570
Jin Goo doesn't want to move,

243
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,840
and I don't want to, either.
We didn't do anything wrong.

244
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,509
You can't afford
to be so stubborn right now.

245
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:00,679
- What if people hear about this?
- I'm getting married soon, Mom.

246
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,809
I have no energy to spend
on some ex-boyfriend.

247
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,019
Jin Goo is enough trouble for me.

248
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:08,320
What about Jin Goo?

249
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:11,889
Was it that brat again?

250
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,019
I want to remove Goo Ha Na...

251
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,389
to a place where I can't see her.

252
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,860
I can't deal with the Goo siblings.

253
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,399
Myung Ji.

254
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,610
I'll be at the office later. Bye.

255
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:34,250
You know that female employee
who's been at your place, right?

256
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,350
Eun Chong's aunt?

257
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,779
She has hardly been there.

258
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,149
Did you know she had been
trying to flirt with Jin Goo?

259
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,559
Really?

260
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:48,029
Why would she do that
to a man who was taken?

261
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,059
I heard she was really cunning.

262
00:14:51,429 --> 00:14:53,730
A few days ago,
she gave Jin Goo some food...

263
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,200
she made for her parents'
memorial service.

264
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:58,200
What's she up to?

265
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,269
Jin Goo was at the memorial service
for that brat's parents?

266
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:08,480
She grew up with an only father
without a mother on paper.

267
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,519
She went to the children's home
after her father died at age seven,

268
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,419
then Mr. Goo's family
adopted her at age ten.

269
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,350
So, she's completely out of touch
with her mother?

270
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:20,059
That's right. She's not on
her family relation certificate,

271
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,960
so I can't find any updates on her.

272
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,559
That's even better.

273
00:15:25,059 --> 00:15:26,929
If she remembers anything
about her parents,

274
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:29,500
it'll only hinder the process
of turning her into Yu Jin.

275
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:33,000
The problem was that
she went to the children's home...

276
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,570
at age seven
after her father died in a fire.

277
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,210
But Yu Jin got lost
by the sea at age ten,

278
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:40,539
then was sent to a children's home.

279
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,210
There's an age difference.

280
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,549
How am I going to change her age?

281
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,129
(Family Relation Certificate,
Name: Lee Ha Na)

282
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,570
- You may leave, Ms. Jang.
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
Why do you have
that document on Ms. Goo?

284
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,710
I need to begin the process
of turning her into Yu Jin.

285
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:17,820
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- If you don't do it, Ms. Jang will.

286
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,320
Would you rather
have someone else do it?

287
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:27,559
If you really want to keep her safe,

288
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,960
then please do this for me.

289
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,399
You need to reconsider,
Ms. Chairwoman.

290
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:32,629
There are no secrets in this world.

291
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,269
I just need to keep it a secret...

292
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:37,200
until Eun Chong turns 20
and becomes of age.

293
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,370
What about after that?

294
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,610
What about Ms. Goo when she found out
she was used as a fake daughter?

295
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,340
You may put Ms. Goo in danger...

296
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:45,710
in return
for keeping Eun Chong safe.

297
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,049
You're going to use her
as Eun Chong's shield?

298
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,409
She'd be compensated.

299
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,580
Compensation isn't everything.

300
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:55,720
This is about her life.

301
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:01,230
He'll move in as soon as possible.

302
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,690
We won't have to redo the wallpaper
and the flooring, right?

303
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,160
Bye.

304
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,900
Have you found a place to move to?

305
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,539
Right. Did you take out a loan?

306
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:16,609
I forgot to tell you.

307
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,980
I won't need a lease loan.

308
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,980
The new landlord let us stay
without raising the rent.

309
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,880
I'm glad.

310
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,480
- A great start to a new year.
- Right?

311
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,789
I consider myself blessed.

312
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,619
Thank you for your concern,
Mr. Hwang.

313
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,859
I hope you are
greatly blessed from now on.

314
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,289
Thanks.

315
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,430
Have you had lunch?

316
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:41,400
Yes, I already ate.

317
00:17:41,569 --> 00:17:43,069
I see. What did you eat?

318
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,339
I just made do with what I saw.

319
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,640
We're ready to begin
the meeting, Ms. Yoon.

320
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,720
- Look. Hello.
- Hello.

321
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,779
- Hello.
- Hello.

322
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,920
- Mom.
- Ms. Goo Ha Na.

323
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,519
Yes, Ms. Choi.

324
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,329
What are you doing right now?

325
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,559
Don't you know?

326
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,099
Don't you know what you did?

327
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,000
How dare you covet after
your superior's man?

328
00:18:18,369 --> 00:18:19,500
You crazy brat.

329
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,539
You're a crude piece of trash.

330
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,009
- I'll teach you a lesson today.
- My gosh.

331
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,710
What are you doing?

332
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,250
Yeo Jin.

333
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,789
What's going on?

334
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:39,720
Ms. Goo, are you okay?

335
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:40,890
Mr. Hwang.

336
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,759
- Ha Na, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

337
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,630
Check and see
if she's hurt in any way.

338
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,769
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

339
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,299
I'll see you outside.

340
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,569
You should sit here.

341
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,880
- Oh, no. You're bleeding.
- Are you okay?

342
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,049
What did you tell your mother?

343
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,779
I just shared the facts...

344
00:19:08,049 --> 00:19:10,890
about the things that happened
between you and Goo Ha Na.

345
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,390
- Is that my fault?
- Did you only share the facts?

346
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,690
Were you sure
you didn't put any emotions in?

347
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:18,299
Let's say something was suspicious,
just as you claimed.

348
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,430
Then, she should've
checked the facts with me first.

349
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:23,730
She shouldn't have come
to the office at your words...

350
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,269
Are you blaming my mom right now?

351
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:28,970
No, are you blaming me
and my mom at the same time?

352
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,740
- I can't commend her for this!
- Stop badmouthing her!

353
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:34,440
She must've had a good reason
for doing this!

354
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,450
What did you say whenever I asked
why you were so lenient toward her?

355
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:41,349
You said you would've done the same
for any other staff member.

356
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:42,519
Then, tell me.

357
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,289
Who else have you shown
such kindness and leniency?

358
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:49,690
The staff are all talking
about how you're always taking her side!

359
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,960
Have you ever considered
how I felt as I listened to that?

360
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,529
If you trusted me,
you should've just let it go!

361
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,740
So, it was my fault
that I couldn't trust you?

362
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,009
It's your fault
for destroying my trust!

363
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,779
Try to take my side
just as you take Goo Ha Na's side.

364
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,539
Then, I wouldn't have told my mom,

365
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,950
and she wouldn't have come and...

366
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,279
Good grief.

367
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,079
Why am I explaining myself?
I didn't do anything wrong!

368
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,619
- Se Young.
- Do you think I feel great?

369
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,720
I was also humiliated
in front of the chairwoman,

370
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,589
the staff members, and you!

371
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,490
I was also heartbroken
and irritated to death!

372
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,000
When I said it wasn't so,
you should've believed me and let it go.

373
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,329
If she came and hit me,
it would've ended between us.

374
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,500
Why did she blow this up?

375
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:32,299
You shouldn't have done anything
to cause a misunderstanding...

376
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,599
before you said something like that.

377
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:37,039
All right.
I won't let it happen in the future.

378
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,579
You need to stop telling your mom
everything that happens between us.

379
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:43,380
It won't help for her to know.

380
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,549
You need to stop taking
Goo Ha Na's side first.

381
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,450
Even if I'm at fault and she's not,
you need to take my side.

382
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,920
If you don't want to do that,
turn a blind eye and shut your mouth.

383
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,299
If an employee and the president
live in the same neighborhood,

384
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,670
they can eat a meal together.

385
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:07,400
Was that a reason to come
and beat up the employee at work?

386
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,839
It rained after dinner,

387
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:11,140
so she went home
with Jin Goo's coat over her head.

388
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,779
She's also been to his house,

389
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,109
using her status as a neighbor
as an excuse!

390
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:17,650
Then, you should've asked Jin Goo
instead of beating her.

391
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,519
How can you beat up
someone else's child like an animal?

392
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:24,660
If your child is dear to you,
so are other people's children.

393
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,759
My child isn't the same
as other people's children.

394
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,490
And why are you getting so mad
over that brat's business?

395
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:33,230
The least she can do is
get along with Ms. Goo.

396
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,200
She's not helping.

397
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,799
What you did
wouldn't help Se Young in any way.

398
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,869
You just humiliated your child
in front of the entire staff.

399
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,210
Why are you so thoughtless
as a mother?

400
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,640
I saw those two chat and giggle...

401
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,109
right in front of me
with my own two eyes.

402
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,279
How could I hold back?

403
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,549
He even went to the memorial service
for her parents!

404
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:58,519
How is this a normal relationship
between a president and a staff?

405
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,759
How dare she flirt
with her superior's fiance?

406
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,329
Jin Goo is another problem.

407
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,329
That foolish punk fell
for that sly girl's moves.

408
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,700
It was your misunderstanding.

409
00:22:13,069 --> 00:22:15,069
I know Jin Goo isn't like that,

410
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,210
and the same applies to Ms. Goo.

411
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:19,109
I get Jin Goo,

412
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,980
but what do you know
about Goo Ha Na?

413
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,950
Why do you keep taking her side?

414
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,980
I can already tell
if she's like that or not.

415
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,589
Then, what about Se Young?

416
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,190
Do you think she gets suspicious
without any grounds?

417
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,690
It must be a misunderstanding.

418
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:38,700
It may be a misunderstanding,

419
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,369
but Goo Ha Na is just a worker
on contract, and Se Young is...

420
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:46,670
your only niece and family.

421
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,109
What's more important
than your family and your blood?

422
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,579
Yes, nothing is more important
than your blood.

423
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,180
So, apologize to her
like an elder...

424
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:01,589
for Jin Goo and Se Young's sake.

425
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,660
"Apologize?"

426
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,099
Let's go, Mom.

427
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,609
Did Head Director Goo
make you do this?

428
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,380
Did he tell you
to make a move on Jin Goo?

429
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,950
Why would he
make me do something like that?

430
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,220
That's enough. We're at work, Mom.

431
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,279
You may leave.

432
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:36,190
Because the siblings are
acting exactly the same way.

433
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:39,259
You should be thankful
because this was just a warning.

434
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,990
What crude scumbags.

435
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:43,859
I will let it go today,

436
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,400
but not anymore.

437
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,869
What can you do
if you don't let it go?

438
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,930
Are you going to sue me?

439
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,170
- Yes.
- What?

440
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:54,440
You need to watch
what comes out of your mouth.

441
00:23:58,609 --> 00:23:59,710
That's enough.

442
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,910
- Wasn't once enough?
- Let her go, Mr. Hwang.

443
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,089
Was it because you grew up
without proper education?

444
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:11,119
How dare you
talk back to your elder?

445
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,559
Be careful, Jin Goo.

446
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:16,529
You should find a better woman
than a lowly girl like her.

447
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:17,660
It's all but a misunderstanding.

448
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,559
Please ask me first in the future.

449
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,170
And you need to apologize
to Ms. Goo.

450
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,269
"Apologize?"

451
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,470
You're adding to this mess, too.

452
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,680
If you have time to mind someone like her,
look after Se Young.

453
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:33,940
You should be ashamed.

454
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,049
Mom.

455
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:59,339
- Ha Na.
- Ha Na.

456
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:03,269
Will it leave a scar?

457
00:25:03,569 --> 00:25:05,279
I said I'd go with you.

458
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,279
Is there something going on
between Mr. Hwang and you?

459
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,380
Nothing's going on.

460
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,549
If nothing is going on,
then why did Ms. Choi...

461
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:16,289
come all the way here
and do that to you...

462
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:18,859
Why aren't you working?

463
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,690
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

464
00:25:28,299 --> 00:25:31,299
That's for your treatment,
including psychological compensation.

465
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,609
What are you doing? Take it.

466
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:37,140
You love money.

467
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,539
I do,

468
00:25:39,309 --> 00:25:41,140
but I don't take just any money.

469
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,019
Are you asking for more?

470
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,779
How much do you want?

471
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,059
Why are you so insecure?

472
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,029
- What?
- You already know...

473
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,700
nothing is going on
between Mr. Hwang and me.

474
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,410
Why do you feel insecure
over someone petty like me?

475
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,670
I just don't get it.

476
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,609
You already have everything.
Why do you care about me?

477
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:17,410
Yes, it was just as you said.
Why would I feel insecure about you?

478
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,519
You just...

479
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,089
make me feel rotten.

480
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:25,890
I dread that someone petty like you
keeps coveting after what's mine...

481
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:27,460
and keeps getting involved with him.

482
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:32,630
Do you really have
zero feelings for Mr. Hwang?

483
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,430
- You do.
- No.

484
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,470
Forget it.

485
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,470
It may be a misunderstanding,

486
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,900
but don't be too sour
because you provided the reason.

487
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:42,470
If I catch you next time...

488
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:45,180
You'll frame me as a thief again
and try to kick me out?

489
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:49,309
It must've been disappointing
that your plan failed last time.

490
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,519
- What?
- You put the envelope in my bag.

491
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:55,519
How will you frame me this time...

492
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,420
if I take this money?

493
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,660
What is this nonsense?
Do you have evidence?

494
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,299
If you did,
you would've exposed me already.

495
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:06,599
Right?

496
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,500
What is she saying?

497
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,809
Why hasn't she lost her spirit
after being beaten?

498
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,579
How's Ms. Goo?

499
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,549
She received treatment
and returned to the office.

500
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,220
I considered
letting her leave early.

501
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:28,990
All right.

502
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,450
No one would treat her like this...

503
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:34,289
if she were my daughter.
How unfortunate.

504
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,130
Are you yet to make the decision?

505
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm sorry.

506
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,640
I've thought of you as my own
since when you were ten.

507
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:51,809
Have I ever made
a request like this to this day?

508
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,109
I had to let Yu Jin go, too.

509
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,480
This is my final wish.

510
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,319
I also thought of you
like my mother.

511
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:07,119
But what about Ms. Goo,

512
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:11,089
who'd live as your daughter,
not knowing that she was deceived?

513
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,259
What about me?

514
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,200
The daughter I've been looking for
in the last 20 years has died.

515
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,630
The least I want to do is find
and hold my grandson in my arms.

516
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,599
I kept feeling anxious,

517
00:28:18,599 --> 00:28:20,900
thinking the worst could happen
to my grandson, too.

518
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,470
I finally found a way to keep him safe
and asked for your help.

519
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,640
Is that so hard to do?

520
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:32,519
Just as you said, if Ms. Goo
became a shield for Eun Chong,

521
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,549
then I'd be her shield.

522
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,220
She won't have to suffer
from nonsense like today,

523
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,690
be put to sorrow
because of her parents' absence,

524
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,720
or live a difficult life again.

525
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:47,299
I always thought
we were like family.

526
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,500
But I guess...

527
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:51,769
I wasn't as close to you as Ms. Goo.

528
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,099
That's impossible.

529
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,910
You gave me a new life.

530
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,039
I need to spend the rest of my life
repaying your kindness...

531
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:00,940
Yes, Jin Goo.

532
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,180
Think of this as a chance
to repay my kindness.

533
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,450
I know what's concerning you,

534
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,690
but we won't get caught.

535
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,460
I'll keep Ms. Goo safe
and protect her from danger.

536
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:15,930
I'd treat her so well
as if Yu Jin came back alive.

537
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,099
So, please help me.

538
00:29:26,069 --> 00:29:27,170
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

539
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,680
Should we have forced
Ms. Goo to come with us?

540
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:38,250
She was beaten in front of us,
so how could she eat anything?

541
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,250
We should bring
some bread back for her.

542
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,220
Ha Na wouldn't have been beaten...

543
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,920
that helplessly
if Mr. Hwang was around, right?

544
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,160
How can she beat her with a bag?

545
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,390
Gosh, Ms. Choi has
such a hot temper.

546
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,900
I feel so bad for Ha Na.

547
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,400
Did you just say
Ms. Goo Ha Na was beaten with a bag?

548
00:29:58,700 --> 00:29:59,769
Ha Na!

549
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,480
Darn it. Look at your face.

550
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,910
I heard
Yoon Se Young's mom beat you.

551
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:10,180
Where is this crazy woman?

552
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,609
How dare she mess with my sister?

553
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,779
Come out, Yoon Se Young,
you evil brat!

554
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,250
Hey, be quiet!

555
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,789
Were you trying to announce
to everyone that I was beaten?

556
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:19,319
- Why did she hit you?
- Come here. Hey!

557
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:21,819
- I'll kill her. Stop it!
- Hey. What's with you?

558
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:23,359
Didn't you even feel wronged?

559
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,559
- Okay. Fine!
- Hey!

560
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,799
- Come.
- I'll kill her.

561
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:28,299
Ha Na, this was so wrong.

562
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:29,369
What's wrong with you?

563
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:34,599
Was Ms. Goo beaten by someone?

564
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,079
(Hyesung Group)

565
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:45,750
A misunderstanding?

566
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,789
You want your revenge
on Se Young, don't you?

567
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:51,190
That's why
you're using your sister, too.

568
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,690
How dare she flirt crudely
with her superior's man?

569
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,089
She messed with my sister?

570
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,730
Did you look into it?

571
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,430
Yes, she told the infirmary staff...

572
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,170
that she was hit in the face
with a handbag.

573
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:08,640
There's a scratch on her face,
and it's a little swollen.

574
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,170
Take legal action.

575
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,009
Do everything we can.

576
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,150
Don't you have to see a doctor?

577
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,279
Will it leave a scar?

578
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,180
No.

579
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,450
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

580
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,049
I'll have a talk
with Ms. Yoon's mother...

581
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,960
that she will
never misunderstand again.

582
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:29,359
I'll make sure
she apologizes to you.

583
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:33,859
Ms. Yoon's mother
will not apologize to me.

584
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,369
Although it wasn't your fault,

585
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,569
I thought Ms. Yoon could misunderstand
from her perspective.

586
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,740
So, I want to ask you...

587
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:48,240
to stop minding my business...

588
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,549
as of this hour.

589
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,750
We will have to associate
when it comes to work,

590
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:57,220
but I do not wish to cause
even the smallest misunderstanding.

591
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,759
It'll be good for you, too.

592
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:07,529
May I go if you're done talking?

593
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,000
Excuse me.

594
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,839
What if I can't do that?

595
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,910
I don't think I can...

596
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:22,009
stop minding you.

597
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,789
(Cinderella Game)

598
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,819
I'm not everyone's punching bag.

599
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:11,390
My mom and I were humiliated
because of that pathetic girl?

600
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:12,730
I just filed a written complaint.

601
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:15,299
I'm sorry, ma'am. You've been banned
from entering the company building.

602
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:17,299
Move aside.
Get Goo Ji Seok here right now!

603
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,440
I don't want to make a fuss at work
because of my business!

604
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,599
You need to make a fuss...

605
00:33:20,769 --> 00:33:21,900
to be humiliated,

606
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,809
stand in court, and get fined!

607
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,940
Do you enjoy
harassing my mom and me?

608
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,980
Stop taking it out on others
and look inside your heart.

609
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,680
Is it Goo Ji Seok?
Or is it Hwang Jin Goo?
