00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:07,750
(Episode 65)

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,230
Eun Chong!

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,700
Eun Chong!

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,840
- Auntie Ha Na?
- You can't go.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,040
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Eun Chong, no.

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,210
Eun Chong.

10
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,780
- Oh, no.
- Auntie Ha Na!

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,810
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,210
- Oh, no.
- Auntie Ha Na!

13
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,520
Auntie Ha Na!

14
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,620
Eun Chong. No.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,050
Please open the door.

16
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,420
Let me out! Open the door.

17
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,560
You can't go.

18
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,790
- Go.
- Eun Chong, I'm right here.

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,500
- Please open the door.
- Auntie Ha Na!

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,060
- Go.
- Auntie Ha Na!

21
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,030
No. Eun Chong!

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,800
Eun Chong!

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,870
- Eun Chong!
- Auntie Ha Na!

24
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,780
Auntie Ha Na!

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,880
Eun Chong! Please don't go!

26
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,310
Auntie Ha Na!

27
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,550
Auntie Ha Na!

28
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,790
Auntie Ha Na!

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,050
- Auntie Ha Na!
- Eun Chong!

30
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,990
Eun Chong...

31
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,200
Eun Chong!

32
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
Eun Chong!

33
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,350
It's President Hwang.

34
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,390
Did Jin Goo just block my car?

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,630
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Mr. Hwang.

36
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,870
I want to go to Auntie Ha Na.

37
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,870
- Eun Chong!
- I'm going to Auntie Ha Na.

38
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,840
Ms. Chairwoman,
please open the door.

39
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,480
- Eun Chong.
- No, Eun Chong.

40
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,550
Mr. Hwang!

41
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,620
- Mr. Hwang!
- Ms. Chairwoman!

42
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,750
Go.

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,290
- Auntie Ha Na...
- No, Eun Chong.

44
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:33,660
- Auntie Ha Na...
- Eun Chong.

45
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,830
Ms. Chairwoman!

46
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,380
Eun Chong...

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,690
Goodness. Are you okay, Eun Chong?

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,000
Eun Chong.

49
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,030
Why is he suddenly doing this?

50
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,630
He must have nausea
caused by anxiety.

51
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,200
- Call Dr. Hong.
- Yes, ma'am.

52
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,780
That little boy begged
so desperately.

53
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,850
How can she be so cold?

54
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,820
I'm guessing
you didn't get to see Eun Chong.

55
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,590
No.

56
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,030
You two were torn apart
right before each other's eyes.

57
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,270
Mom.

58
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,470
Why are you here?

59
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,600
Did you two come here together?

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,010
Is something really going on
between them?

61
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,680
We came together from the office.

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,710
Thank you for calling me.

63
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,010
How did you bring him here?

64
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,480
The chairwoman gave him permission
to go see Yali at my place.

65
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,820
Then, he asked me
to help him meet you.

66
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,960
He was so thrilled
he'd get to see you.

67
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,690
I should've come more quickly.

68
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,960
He'll need to see you
to get better from his depression.

69
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,800
"Depression?"

70
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,640
Okay.

71
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,280
Eun Chong, do you have
an upset stomach?

72
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,280
Do you have a headache?

73
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,050
Eun Chong.

74
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,060
Are you sure he doesn't need
to go to the hospital?

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,890
I talked to Dr. Hong.

76
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,830
I was told to keep an eye on him.

77
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,670
Dr. Hong will come over
if he begins to vomit again.

78
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
My goodness.

79
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,070
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Yes.

80
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,140
Eun Chong, have some warm water.

81
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,220
Eun Chong has depression?

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,220
I can't believe this.

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,030
Auntie Ha Na!

84
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,930
Auntie Ha Na!

85
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,500
Auntie Ha Na!

86
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,100
I need to bring him home.

87
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,210
Is this Eun Chong's social worker?
I need your help.

88
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,880
Eun Chong found his grandmother
and went to her place,

89
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,150
but he became depressed there.

90
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,050
I'm going to the police station now
to tell them I'm his foster mother.

91
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,490
I need to bring Eun Chong home.

92
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,920
I'll head over there now.

93
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,360
Please help me out.

94
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,990
Ha Na.

95
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,930
I'm telling you.
I'm his foster mother.

96
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,440
I have the documents to prove it,

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,240
and you just talked
to his social worker.

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,010
My nephew is stuck in that home.
Why can't you go and get him?

99
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,940
I understand what you mean.

100
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,910
But this isn't
just an ordinary home.

101
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,810
And this is Shin Yeo Jin's address,
Hyesung Group's chairwoman.

102
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,350
Who would believe
that Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin...

103
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,650
took your nephew by force?

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,590
Please believe me. Please.

105
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Lee Eun Chong is currently
at Chairwoman Shin's place.

106
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,230
Here.

107
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,530
I got the evidence that
she forcibly took him in her car.

108
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,580
The evidence seems solid.

109
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,410
You should go.

110
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,480
Let's go.

111
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,120
I'll go with you.

112
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,890
This is it for you.

113
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,000
Please stop minding my business.

114
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,180
My business was designated
as the hottest neighborhood destination!

115
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,210
Congratulations, Mr. Goo.

116
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25,250
Gosh, it's all thanks to you.

117
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,490
You helped me out with everything,
from decorating this place...

118
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,220
and choosing this
particular kind of food, too.

119
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,490
You're my savior.

120
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,290
I'm glad my help was worthwhile.

121
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,530
Eun Chong's uncle.

122
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,500
Yes, hello. Have you been somewhere?

123
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,330
I was at your place.

124
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,710
Why were you at my place?

125
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,910
Because of Eun Chong.

126
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,780
There was a whole scene.

127
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,480
Jin Goo called.

128
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,820
Did you two discuss
calling off the engagement?

129
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,650
He said he'd talk
after gathering his thoughts.

130
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,290
Why does he need to think
even after hearing...

131
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,990
that you're pregnant with his child?

132
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,690
Leave him be.

133
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,330
- He'll come back anyway.
- Gosh.

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,900
Right. Your mother-in-law
caused trouble.

135
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,700
- What did she do?
- She took Eun Chong to see Yali...

136
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,770
and helped him meet
Goo Ha Na in secret...

137
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,010
but got caught by your aunt.

138
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,540
Why is Mother doing that?

139
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,810
She knew we'd adopt Eun Chong.

140
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:28,350
She should keep him away from her.

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,190
The police?

142
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,420
Does a boy
named Lee Eun Chong reside here?

143
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,020
How may I help you?

144
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,230
We received a report that a boy
fostered by Ms. Goo Ha Na was here.

145
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,400
Who is it?

146
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,640
Call the head of our legal team.

147
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,810
Yes, ma'am.

148
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,140
Chairwoman Shin came...

149
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,640
and tried to stop Eun Chong
from seeing Ha Na?

150
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,950
Why is she trying so hard
to separate those two?

151
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,250
She should at least let the two meet
while they were under the same sky.

152
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,120
Gosh, that evil witch.

153
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,290
Where is Ha Na right now?

154
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,020
No idea. She's not home,
and she won't pick up her phone.

155
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,790
Did she go to see Eun Chong again?

156
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,990
I'll be home after work.

157
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,630
I told her to just let him go.
Why couldn't she do that?

158
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,560
(Ha Na)

159
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,570
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,110
We received a report,

161
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,210
so we had to locate
Lee Eun Chong's whereabouts first...

162
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,110
and then return him
to his foster family.

163
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,510
Please cooperate.

164
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,550
Eun Chong, Auntie Ha Na is here!
Eun Chong!

165
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,680
Wait.

166
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,350
Do you have evidence
that Lee Eun Chong is here?

167
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,820
We confirmed him getting into her car
on a dash cam footage.

168
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,960
That's her car.

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,960
Do you have evidence that he's here?

170
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,130
Did you bring your warrant?

171
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,330
Where is he?

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,300
I heard he was
suffering from depression.

173
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,830
This is child abuse!

174
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,640
Shut up. Child abuse?

175
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,400
That's what I want to say.

176
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,310
Before we continue, Ms. Goo.

177
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,610
Did you know you had reasons
for disqualification as a foster mother?

178
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,680
What are you talking about?

179
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,250
She was reported twice
for child abuse...

180
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,880
and almost lost him, too.

181
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,050
How can she be his foster mother?

182
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,920
Eun Chong is
Chairwoman Shin's grandson.

183
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,330
I have the parentage test result
and the request she filed...

184
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,630
to correct her family register.

185
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,730
But Ms. Goo Ha Na is
still his current guardian.

186
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,230
And he was diagnosed
with depression here.

187
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,440
He was never diagnosed
with depression. He's healthy.

188
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,510
And he chose to live here, too.

189
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,010
Did he say he'd live here?

190
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,710
Well, it's true, but...

191
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,550
If he chose to be here,

192
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,980
we wouldn't be allowed to intervene.

193
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:48,290
This is a request to issue
a restraining order...

194
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:49,820
against Ms. Goo Ha Na
from approaching Lee Eun Chong.

195
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,790
She may be his foster mother,

196
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,260
but she has committed fraud
against Chairwoman Shin.

197
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,500
"Fraud?"

198
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,160
You tampered
with the parentage test result...

199
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,300
and approached her
as a fake daughter.

200
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,140
She requested a restraining order
for that reason.

201
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,700
What are you talking about?

202
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,010
I was the victim of her scheme!

203
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,080
Ms. Chairwoman.

204
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,480
Then, that's another reason
for us not to intervene.

205
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,950
Please excuse us.

206
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,920
Let's go.

207
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,850
He's lying. Please help me.

208
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,890
Ms. Goo, if you leave now,
we'll consider this never happened.

209
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,830
You just slandered me
and committed calumny.

210
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,530
And you neglected Eun Chong
and abused him.

211
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,070
I'll report you for both.

212
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,340
"Neglected?"

213
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,770
You've become an expert
in blackmailing.

214
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,480
Yes, I've learned from the best,

215
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,240
so it came to me naturally.

216
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,950
Where's Eun Chong?

217
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,520
I need to see him.

218
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,150
Eun Chong!

219
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,260
Auntie Ha Na?

220
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,060
Eun Chong!

221
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
- Eun Chong!
- Drag her out.

222
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,700
Please leave.

223
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,640
If you hold out, we'll report you
for breaking and entering.

224
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,840
I'll leave today.

225
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,980
But as long as Eun Chong wants me,

226
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,650
I'll never give up on him.

227
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,290
Auntie Ha Na.

228
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,690
Eun Chong.

229
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,030
Auntie Ha Na.

230
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,460
You're up.

231
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,670
Do you feel unwell?

232
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,970
Auntie Ha Na.

233
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,040
Goodness.

234
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,210
Eun Chong, she's not here.

235
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,070
Were you dreaming?

236
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,210
Auntie Ha Na came to see me.

237
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,080
- Eun Chong.
- Eun Chong?

238
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,720
Auntie Ha Na.

239
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,630
Auntie Ha Na?

240
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,260
Eun Chong.

241
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,910
Stop that.

242
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,350
Come downstairs with me.

243
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,420
Are you mad at me?

244
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,660
You broke your promise,
so you left me no choice.

245
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,430
You got kicked out
before you saw him?

246
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,430
Gosh, how can they be so cold?

247
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:51,270
Why didn't you call me?

248
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,000
Make use of your brother.

249
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:55,570
I can't believe such a happy child
like Eun Chong is...

250
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,640
suffering from depression.

251
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,980
Right?

252
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,050
Depression sounds so unlikely
for a happy kid like him.

253
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,980
How is his grandmother
worse than us?

254
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,250
Ha Na and all of you, listen up.

255
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,920
Eun Chong is
Chairwoman Shin's grandson.

256
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,920
She won't give up on her own blood.

257
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,490
So, you need to let him go.

258
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll let him go if I can have
the guarantee that he'll do fine.

259
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,800
But he's unwell.

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,670
Yes, he won't eat or sleep,

261
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,340
and he doesn't talk a lot, either.

262
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,270
That's for that family to deal with!

263
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,570
No, I'm bringing him home.

264
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,980
Just get over him
and live your own life!

265
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,650
She didn't even give you anything
for raising him until this day.

266
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,320
No, rather, she's attacking you.

267
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,720
Yet you want to take in
that woman's blood?

268
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,820
That's her fault,
not Eun Chong's fault.

269
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,490
You couldn't say that if she were
the enemy who killed our parents.

270
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,900
Ji Seok, don't take things that far.

271
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,700
Yes, Eun Chong is our family, too.

272
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,800
Wake up.

273
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,970
Eun Chong isn't our family.

274
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,780
Don't get involved with him anymore.

275
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:14,050
Your relationship with Se Young is
considered love by most people.

276
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,620
And you'll have...

277
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,160
more important things in life
after your child is born.

278
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,820
She's now pregnant with your child.

279
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,930
Don't even mention
calling off the engagement.

280
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,430
Se Young recently bled
and developed morning sickness.

281
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,130
She's going through a lot.

282
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,540
Forget calling off
the engagement, okay?

283
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,040
I'll let you know
once I gather my thoughts.

284
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,310
What thoughts?

285
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,440
Just promise me now.

286
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,680
You will marry her, okay?

287
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,450
- Mom.
- Is it because of Ms. Goo?

288
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:44,080
Do you like her?

289
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,580
Answer me.

290
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,890
Yes, I do.

291
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,290
You can't just say
something like that.

292
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,330
Have you lost your mind?

293
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,060
My feelings for her have
nothing to do with the engagement.

294
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:01,530
And I'm not going to make a move
after calling it off, either.

295
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,870
I'm a sinner
who'll never be forgiven by her.

296
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,670
She doesn't even like me.

297
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,380
Yes, you're the only one
who has gone crazy.

298
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,710
Se Young didn't do anything wrong,

299
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,510
and you didn't want
to work things out with Ms. Goo.

300
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,920
So, what's the problem?

301
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,620
It's between Se Young and me.

302
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,560
What's the problem?

303
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,760
You can't call the engagement off!

304
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,290
My gosh.

305
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:47,540
I don't think
I can live with Se Young, Mom.

306
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,820
But I'll take responsibility
for my child.

307
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,600
Did Ha Na meet Eun Chong?

308
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

309
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:22,510
I shouldn't have left you there
before I came out.

310
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,180
I'll visit you every single day...

311
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,820
until I see you.

312
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,130
Did you see Eun Chong?

313
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,600
Lee Eun Chong is currently
at Chairwoman Shin's place.

314
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:46,070
Here. I got the evidence...

315
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,140
that she forcibly took him
in her car.

316
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,570
Eun Chong, did you wet the bed?

317
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,800
What do we do now?

318
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,570
His symptoms are worsening,
and he's now even wetting the bed.

319
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,180
Eun Chong, you should eat your food.

320
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,890
Eun Chong, try some fish.
You love this.

321
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,190
Have a bite.

322
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,130
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

323
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,700
If you have trouble eating,
go upstairs.

324
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,800
Are you sure you can work?

325
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,800
I'll feel better while I'm working.

326
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,630
I'll go upstairs and get some rest.

327
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,370
Okay.

328
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,610
Eun Chong, try a bite. Open up.

329
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:02,150
Come on.

330
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,020
You'll have to go to the hospital
if you don't eat anything.

331
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,960
Yes, that's it. Good.

332
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,860
- Good.
- That's it.

333
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,730
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

334
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,330
Are you all right?

335
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,770
Call a psychiatrist.

336
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,670
Okay.

337
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,280
I'll go to my room
and have some shake.

338
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,050
This is so ominous.

339
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,160
She came by this early?

340
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,290
Who is it?

341
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,760
Goo Ha Na.

342
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:57,600
Eun Chong!

343
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,480
Let me meet Eun Chong.

344
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,620
It's brazen of you to show up here
after making that scene yesterday.

345
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,790
I heard he was depressed.

346
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,760
Just let me meet him once.
He'll get better when he sees me.

347
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,560
Please?

348
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,830
How dare you touch me?

349
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,770
She's just awful.

350
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,400
Eun Chong is unwell right now.
What kind of a grandma is she?

351
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,110
Eun Chong!

352
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,940
What's your plan now?

353
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,510
I plan to get
into Hyesung's security server...

354
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,820
and secure confidential documents.

355
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,320
It won't be easy.

356
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,150
I'll try to find a way
by using Yoon Se Young.

357
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,960
Do you think she has
clearance to the server?

358
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
If not, I'll make her bring
someone else's clearance.

359
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,160
What about
Choi Myung Ji's slush fund?

360
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,700
Everything looks clean
on the outside.

361
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,430
She laundered everything,
so it'd take a while.

362
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,140
Hey, Ms. Yoon.
Would you like a cup of coffee?

363
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,210
That sounds great.

364
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,740
Right. I can't drink coffee.

365
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,890
What's wrong, Ms. Yoon?

366
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,220
Even the water smells.

367
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,730
This morning sickness is
making my life so hard.

368
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,130
Ms. Yoon, are you pregnant?

369
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,930
Keep it to yourself.

370
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,400
Okay.

371
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,170
- I heard Goo Ha Na resigned.
- Yes.

372
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,940
She wouldn't want to work here
after what Aunt Yeo Jin did.

373
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,410
How do you feel? Do you feel okay?

374
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,380
I'm all over the place.

375
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,780
I can't tell how I'm feeling
even though it's my body.

376
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,250
- Have you not eaten anything?
- No.

377
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:04,620
How much longer
will it take you to think?

378
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,990
I'm done thinking.

379
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,530
- Tell me.
- Let's call off the engagement.

380
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,400
I'll take responsibility
for the baby.

381
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,240
I'll be there as the dad.

382
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,370
I can't believe this.

383
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,340
I'm not going to let you be the dad.

384
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,640
My baby doesn't need a dad like you.

385
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,010
I'm raising the child
only as my own.

386
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,280
Don't ever dream
of seeing the child.

387
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,880
- Se Young.
- You called the engagement off...

388
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,880
after you got your fiancée pregnant?

389
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,650
You'll make the news!

390
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,260
If people hear about this,

391
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
you won't even be able
to come to work.

392
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,080
(Head Director's Office)

393
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,480
Let me get some rest.

394
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,050
You came faster than I expected.

395
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,050
I thought you were going to lie low
before your wedding.

396
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,160
- Are you mad?
- Instead of Hwang Jin Goo,

397
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,260
why don't you marry me
and adopt Eun Chong?

398
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,360
Is there a problem
between you and him?

399
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,670
My goal might be Hyesung Group,

400
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,840
but I should marry someone I love.

401
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,270
Call the engagement off first.

402
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:33,010
Right. Goo Ha Na
came to our place this morning.

403
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:36,750
She was begging in front of the gate
to let her see Eun Chong.

404
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,520
It seemed like she'd wait
until we opened the door for her.

405
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,550
Where's her pride?

406
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,420
She must've had enough
after yesterday, but she returned.

407
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:50,160
Did something happen yesterday?

408
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:53,200
Aunt Yeo Jin was such a scary woman.

409
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,070
She blamed Goo Ha Na
for the fake daughter scheme.

410
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,140
- What?
- On top of that,

411
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,870
she even filed a restraining order
against her for Eun Chong.

412
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,980
It seemed like
Eun Chong's condition was deteriorating.

413
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,250
He's suffering from a serious case
of separation anxiety.

414
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,450
He's refusing to eat, lethargic,
and choosing not to speak.

415
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,760
If his condition worsens,
he may even hurt himself.

416
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,860
What can I do for him?

417
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,400
You need to let him know
that his aunt is still there...

418
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,260
in his life and by his side.

419
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,630
That's the best solution.

420
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:40,510
Ms. Goo will also receive a copy
of the temporary restraining order.

421
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,580
Okay.

422
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,480
"Temporary restraining order?"

423
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,590
Mr. Hwang!

424
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,190
What is it?

425
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,360
You may leave, Ms. Jang.

426
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,590
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,030
Did you put Ha Na
under a restraining order, too?

428
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,640
She's Eun Chong's foster mother
and guardian.

429
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,800
"Guardian?"

430
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,740
She barged in yesterday
with the police...

431
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,940
and threatened me
to return Eun Chong to her.

432
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:17,150
She said she'd report me
for calumny and child abuse.

433
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,750
I filed that to prepare
for an incident like that.

434
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,220
She was there worried
about Eun Chong's depression.

435
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,120
You should've asked her...

436
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,330
to help you with Eun Chong.

437
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,760
It's not too late
to let her meet Eun Chong.

438
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,730
Was that why
you blocked my car yesterday?

439
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,400
Since when did you dare to defy me?

440
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,170
And you wanted to call off
your engagement, too.

441
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,140
Is Goo Ha Na more special
than our history?

442
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,720
I've sinned greatly against her.

443
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,820
You know that, too.

444
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,420
Let them meet.

445
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,590
This isn't for Ha Na,
but for Eun Chong.

446
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,060
He's my grandson.

447
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:06,130
I'll protect him my way.

448
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,470
I won't forgive anyone
who stands in my way,

449
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,570
even if it's you.

450
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,140
Do you know
what my biggest regret is right now?

451
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,240
Believing you...

452
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,840
and making Ha Na your fake daughter.

453
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,410
You promised not to hurt her...

454
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,220
and to make her happy.

455
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,420
But you didn't keep it.
No, you chose not to.

456
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,490
I told you already. I had no...

457
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:34,320
There's no logic
that can justify your choice.

458
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:37,060
Let Eun Chong...

459
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,160
go with Ha Na before it's too late.

460
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,100
I did not wish
to be disappointed in you anymore.

461
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,150
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

462
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,690
Find out if Goo Ha Na is
still in front of my place.

463
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,460
Eun Chong!

464
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,800
Auntie Ha Na is here!

465
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,300
Eun Chong!

466
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,040
Eun Chong!

467
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,780
Is Eun Chong...

468
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,790
Leave. Stop making a scene here.

469
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,060
What's he up to?

470
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,390
Why is he so quiet?

471
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,060
Let me see him just once!

472
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,900
Eun Chong!

473
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,810
I'm glad I put him to sleep.

474
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,780
If he found out his aunt was here,

475
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,190
he would've thrown a huge tantrum,
asking me to open the door.

476
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,300
How will you take responsibility?

477
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,970
For what?

478
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,300
How will you take responsibility
for my sister's life?

479
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,240
How is my sister the con artist?

480
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,370
What are you talking about?

481
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,310
Chairwoman Shin blamed her
for the fake daughter scheme.

482
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,050
She claimed Ha Na forged
her identity as her daughter...

483
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,980
and approached her first.

484
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,020
- Are you serious?
- You're her faithful dog.

485
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,220
Stop feigning ignorance.

486
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,330
Stop lurking around her...

487
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,000
if you can't take
any responsibility.

488
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,830
Stop pretending like
you're responsible and just...

489
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,170
because it's repulsive.

490
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,330
Watch what you say!

491
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,040
Right. Do you know that Ha Na is...

492
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,710
standing in front of her place,
trying to see Eun Chong?

493
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,910
See? You don't know anything.

494
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,480
Ha Na and Eun Chong are suffering...

495
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:15,950
because of your petty sympathy.

496
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,920
You're torturing them.

497
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,400
Ha Na.

498
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,010
How long have you been here?

499
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,310
You feel so cold.

500
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:45,080
What's this?

501
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,190
It's all your fault.

502
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,190
Why did you make me
her fake daughter?

503
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,490
I was living a good life
without my birth mother.

504
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,060
Why did you make me a fake daughter
and put me in this misery?

505
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,000
What did I do to you?

506
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,600
What did Eun Chong
and I ever do wrong?

507
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,170
We can't see each other...

508
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:10,270
or hear each other anymore.

509
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,940
We were torn apart before our eyes
because of you!

510
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,910
Who do you think you people are?

511
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:19,080
What right do you all have
to do this to us?

512
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,920
What did I do wrong to you?

513
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,760
Turn everything back.

514
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,760
Put everything back in its place!

515
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,730
Turn everything back.

516
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,970
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,040
I'm sorry.

518
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:53,080
It's all my fault.

519
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,310
(Cinderella Game)

520
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,780
What have I done?

521
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,480
Shut up! That is my grandson!

522
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,810
How dare you do that to my sister?

523
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,750
You two are over.

524
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,820
You have to get that first.

525
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,520
You need to get your hands
on the group's weakness.

526
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,190
Don't do anything
you'll regret, Yeo Jin.

527
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,150
We have already had
many regrets to this day.

528
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,860
Don't even dream
of harassing Ha Na with this.

529
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,890
It sounds like...

530
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,530
- you'd do anything for her.
- I'll do anything.

531
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,390
Are you calling off the engagement
because of Ha Na?

532
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,630
I'll let you meet Auntie Ha Na soon.

533
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,830
Give me just a little more time.

534
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,670
I miss Auntie Ha Na.
