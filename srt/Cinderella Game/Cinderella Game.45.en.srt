1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:01,909
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,909 --> 00:00:03,379
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,080
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,710
- I'll take that.
- Sure.

5
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:11,619
Hello?

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,919
Is this
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin's home?

7
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,250
Yes, that's right.

8
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,760
Who are you?

9
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:18,660
Who's calling?

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,789
- You should take that.
- Sure. Give me that.

11
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:24,600
There was a rumor that
the chairwoman's lost daughter died,

12
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:26,629
so I called to confirm the facts.

13
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:29,570
What did you say?

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:32,770
Chairwoman Shin's lost daughter...

15
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:35,740
died?

16
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,509
Who's on the other side?

17
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,280
Hello? Who are you?

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,420
There was a rumor that
her lost daughter died?

19
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,820
No, she's...

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,729
That isn't true.
It's far from the fact.

21
00:00:56,659 --> 00:00:58,630
If you release
even one sentence of that nonsense,

22
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,070
we'll sue you for defamation
caused by misinformation.

23
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:04,170
Which newspaper was it?

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,670
You should pretend like
you never heard that.

25
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,840
There's always a rumor
surrounding conglomerates.

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,810
Yu Jin came back to us like this,
alive and well.

27
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,849
That's complete nonsense.

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,120
Mom, are you okay?

29
00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:26,319
Have a good day.

30
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,829
Goodness, Yeo Jin seems odd.

31
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:35,530
Why was she concerned
about some rumor?

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,370
Isn't that so, Yu Jin?

33
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,310
Yes.

34
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,980
- Let's go.
- You should go.

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,079
Have another great day.

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,019
It looked like she took a good blow.

37
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,719
Yeo Jin, this is just the beginning.

38
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:00,430
Look forward to everything.

39
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,969
Who found out Yu Jin was dead?

40
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,340
How did that reach even reporters?

41
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:22,710
- Jin Goo.
- Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

42
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,419
Is something going on?

43
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:29,590
There's a rumor that
your daughter has passed away?

44
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,689
Only Sung Ho and we know
that Yu Jin is dead.

45
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,689
There's no way
Sung Ho will spread the word.

46
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:38,560
There was another person
who knew your daughter had passed.

47
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,729
- Who?
- The hit-and-run culprit.

48
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,900
Why would they do this?

49
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,800
The culprit would want to hide it.

50
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,969
That's usually the case.

51
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,039
It could simply be
a groundless rumor.

52
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,780
I'll ask other reporters I know.

53
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,740
I was worried
Ha Na might feel concerned.

54
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,849
She was startled after that call.

55
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,979
I'll talk to her, too.

56
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,780
Goodbye.

57
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,219
Why did a rumor like that
suddenly get around?

58
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,930
Yesterday,
a thief broke into my house,

59
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,199
and this morning,
I got that weird call.

60
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:17,300
I don't know about that thief,

61
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,710
but groundless rumors
always go around in this circle.

62
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:23,469
Commoners have so much interest
in conglomerates.

63
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:27,849
They'd go on and on
about things that didn't happen.

64
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,620
Why aren't you getting out?

65
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:35,349
Right. Thanks for the ride.

66
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,860
We're at work.
Keep work separated from personal life.

67
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,099
- All right.
- Ms. Goo, go now.

68
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,460
- Okay.
- Why aren't you addressing me?

69
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,370
Yes, Ms. Yoon.

70
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,110
I have to be her driver, too?

71
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:07,189
- Hello.
- Hello.

72
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,389
Hey, Ha Na. It's been a while.

73
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,189
Hello, have you all been well?

74
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,419
- Yes.
- What's going on?

75
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:13,830
Are you really the Ha Na we know?

76
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,889
Your face is radiating.

77
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:18,600
She's right.
Did you get something done?

78
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,399
No, it must be
because I got a good rest.

79
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,939
What do you mean, no?

80
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,399
You must've taken your break
at a department store.

81
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,709
Hey, that's a Verver bracelet.

82
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,439
Did you win the lottery?
Or was it cryptocurrency?

83
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,850
Goodness, no.

84
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,110
Wait, are you terminally ill?

85
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:37,420
- Are you using up your fortune?
- No, that's not it.

86
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,519
Get to work.

87
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,889
You may be the top dog at home,
but that changes when we're at work.

88
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,730
But I still can't treat her harshly
to her face.

89
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:52,329
How am I going to vent?

90
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,970
Yes, Reporter Han.

91
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,170
I heard there was a rumor...

92
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,439
about the death
of Chairwoman Shin's lost daughter.

93
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,639
Is this true?

94
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,980
I wanted to know
what backed up this rumor.

95
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,850
There was no ground,
but an anonymous report was made?

96
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,449
By any chance, is there anything
you know about the reporter?

97
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,730
The rumor of the death
of Chairwoman Shin's lost daughter?

98
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,490
Ha Na is her daughter.
What's he saying?

99
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,430
A rumor of her death?

100
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:29,600
I understood she was keeping
her daughter a secret.

101
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:32,970
But why does the rumor say
she's dead?

102
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,970
It was an anonymous report,
so please find out who it was.

103
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:38,709
Yes, sir.

104
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,350
I don't care if it was an anonymous report
or a groundless rumor.

105
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,149
The fact a rumor like that emerged
felt ominous.

106
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,319
You should ignore it,
and it'd pass quickly.

107
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:55,060
Mr. Hwang
and I'll talk to Ms. Goo...

108
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,800
and make sure
she doesn't get suspicious.

109
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,629
I need to move Yu Jin's remains
to the temple.

110
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,500
Have you thought of a way?

111
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,040
Mr. Hwang said it was impossible
to relocate her...

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,610
without Ms. Goo finding out.

113
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:12,740
- There is one way.
- What is it?

114
00:06:14,509 --> 00:06:15,680
Swapping.

115
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,420
She was worried you'd be startled
after that phone call.

116
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,250
I'm fine.

117
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,560
I'm perfectly alive,
so a rumor like that can't startle me.

118
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,889
Such rumors
always surround conglomerates.

119
00:06:30,829 --> 00:06:31,930
You're right.

120
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,500
Don't mind the rumors from now on,
no matter how absurd they are.

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,569
I want to tell the whole world
that I'm her daughter right now.

122
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,339
We can't do that
because it'll put you in danger.

123
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,980
I guess rich people don't make
such big money that easily.

124
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,620
Let me know
whenever you need customer service.

125
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,189
Right. There is something.

126
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,949
Well, this isn't
a customer service issue.

127
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,860
A thief
broke into my house yesterday.

128
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,860
Not Mom's house, but my old place.

129
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,899
It seemed like she kept
important things in that box.

130
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:14,939
That quick-witted brat
put it away already.

131
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,610
Nothing went missing,
but something was odd.

132
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:24,550
Actually, Aunt Myung Ji
once went through my room.

133
00:07:24,949 --> 00:07:27,790
Mother went through your room?

134
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:30,790
A photo recently went missing
from my room.

135
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,519
She said she wanted to find it...

136
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,029
and clear my suspicion for Se Young,
but it didn't seem like the reason.

137
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,060
I don't know.

138
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,069
What was the photo you lost?

139
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,639
A photo of Eun Chong's mom,
Eun Chong, and me.

140
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,310
Was that related
to the burglary at your place?

141
00:07:49,209 --> 00:07:52,610
Oddly, the thief didn't touch
my siblings' luxury goods.

142
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,740
He only went through my room.

143
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,279
And it seemed like he knew
the place was empty.

144
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:00,019
So, the thief knew
you invited your siblings over...

145
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,819
for dinner.

146
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:03,149
Probably.

147
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,519
That was something
only my family and siblings knew.

148
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:10,230
So, you're suspicious of Mother?

149
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,870
I wouldn't say suspicious.
It was an uncanny coincidence.

150
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,240
She was the one who suddenly decided
to invite my siblings over.

151
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,639
You should be suspicious
if it seems fit,

152
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,810
just to be careful.

153
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:27,810
If anything happens, let me know.
I don't care how trivial it may be.

154
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,949
Okay.

155
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,389
Do you have a countermeasure
if we don't find any evidence...

156
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,789
on Hojin Rent-A-Car?

157
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,120
It seemed like Mr. Goo was
persuading the board members.

158
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,990
I should counterattack.

159
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:44,100
The board is in a good relationship
with the chairwoman,

160
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
so he won't be able to sell it.

161
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:49,669
Let me know
if I can do anything to help.

162
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,299
Okay.

163
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,409
(Head Director's Office)

164
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,409
May I take a rest?

165
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,309
Is something bothering you again?

166
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:04,120
It's Goo Ha Na. She's back at work.

167
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:08,049
She's now stressing me out at work,
not just at home.

168
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:13,159
When will you release the article
about selling Hyesung Tour?

169
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:16,360
After I persuade
a few more members of the board.

170
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,830
I handed you the evidence
for the rent-a-car in vain.

171
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,029
The directors aren't budging,
trying to please my aunt.

172
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,340
Don't let me down.

173
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,000
If you've decided to take my hand,
then trust me.

174
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,370
Anyway, Hwang Jin Goo
seemed determined...

175
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,779
to find out
how the information leaked.

176
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,539
Is that okay?

177
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,879
He'll never be suspicious of me.

178
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:36,980
Are you that sure?

179
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,179
Once he trusts someone,
he trusts them forever.

180
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,190
He's different from you.

181
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,490
That's not something
a traitor can say.

182
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,419
And I came back.

183
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,159
So, is today
our day one as a couple?

184
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,590
Our D-day is
the day you sell Hyesung Tour.

185
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,230
Make haste if you're in a rush.

186
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,269
Why is there a rumor about the death
of Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

187
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,870
How did you know?

188
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,139
I heard Hwang Jin Goo
talking to a reporter.

189
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,710
He was looking
for an anonymous reporter.

190
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:05,879
Aunt Yeo Jin seemed weird.

191
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,879
It's not like Yu Jin is dead,
so she can ignore that.

192
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,549
Why was she so concerned?

193
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:13,419
- She must have a reason.
- Like what?

194
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:18,389
If she was that concerned,
she could reveal Ha Na as her daughter.

195
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:21,929
Is that a bit of a stretch?

196
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,759
Well, I guess Goo Ha Na is
an unsightly type.

197
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,730
She gives off that knockoff vibe.

198
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,200
Are you saying she's a knockoff?

199
00:10:31,539 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes, Venerable Monk.

200
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,970
I wish to enshrine
Yu Jin's remains at the temple.

201
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,539
I want to do it without anyone
at the temple or my family...

202
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,350
finding out.

203
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,049
- Let's go for lunch.
- Okay.

204
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,490
Ms. Yoon, we're all going
to the cafeteria.

205
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,320
Ha Na, are you coming along?

206
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,460
Yes, I missed the cafeteria the most
while sitting at home.

207
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,230
Right?

208
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,399
I should mess with Ha Na
at the cafeteria.

209
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,600
I'll join you.

210
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:08,110
Ms. Yoon, you don't like the food
at the cafeteria.

211
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:09,470
I'm craving some today.

212
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,279
Let me get some water.

213
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,519
Jin Kyung, you can do it.

214
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,850
Sorry? That's usually
the newest member's job.

215
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,750
- I'll do it.
- You do it, Jin Kyung.

216
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,460
Okay.

217
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,080
If you're done, you may go.

218
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,950
Okay.

219
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,419
Ha Na, take a seat.

220
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,070
What's with you?

221
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,940
I'm showing you my favor.
Do you not like that?

222
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:14,539
You're putting me in a tough spot.

223
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,710
Just go back to your old ways.
Don't make the team get anxious.

224
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,379
Then, you go back
to your old ways first.

225
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,409
Stop talking to a team leader
like I'm your equal.

226
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:27,320
Yes, Ms. Yoon.
I'll go back to my old ways.

227
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,350
- Please excuse me.
- Ms. Goo.

228
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,860
Can you get me more soup?

229
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,730
I don't want to.

230
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,500
- What?
- You can get it yourself.

231
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:41,870
You're to serve your own water
and food at the cafeteria.

232
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,570
- I'm not your personal assistant.
- You told me to go back.

233
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,940
I always express my opinion...

234
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,269
when I receive unfair orders.

235
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,980
Enjoy the rest of your lunch.

236
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:54,149
So, you'll make me mad
until the end?

237
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,480
Goodness.

238
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,019
Oh, no.

239
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,289
I was trying to get up, too.
It was a mistake.

240
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,789
Sorry.

241
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,399
Ha Na.

242
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,100
I said I was sorry.
Why are you glaring at me like that?

243
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,399
Was it really a mistake?

244
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,809
Then what?
Why would I do that on purpose?

245
00:13:24,379 --> 00:13:27,080
Ms. Goo, you have a knack
for blaming the innocent.

246
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,879
I better leave this place.

247
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,450
- What happened?
- What was that?

248
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,289
- Oh, no.
- That was rough.

249
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:36,419
What just happened?

250
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,360
Ji Eun...

251
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,230
- Who do you think you are?
- No, who do you think you are?

252
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,740
I just saw you tripping my sister...

253
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:55,669
on purpose.

254
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,210
"On purpose?"
What the heck is this nonsense?

255
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,950
Don't try to lie to me.

256
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,549
You also treated me with disdain
last night for buying a knockoff.

257
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:05,580
You have a thing for getting
on people's nerves on purpose.

258
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,019
I know your type.

259
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,490
You.

260
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,019
You're fired.

261
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,690
"Fired?"

262
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,269
How can you fire me?

263
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:26,639
- You need my sister's approval...
- That's enough.

264
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,970
You don't have a grasp
of this situation, do you?

265
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,879
My sister is the princess,
and you're the lady-in-waiting.

266
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,250
- Have you lost your mind?
- Oh, my.

267
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,679
- Yes, I've lost my mind!
- Ouch!

268
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,049
How dare you mess with my sister?

269
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,279
- Let go of me!
- Let go!

270
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,620
- Let go!
- What's with you?

271
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,850
- Please!
- Please stop!

272
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,850
You need to stop.

273
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,720
- Let go of me!
- Please don't do this.

274
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,289
- Goodness.
- You!

275
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,129
Let go of me.
When I think of yesterday...

276
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:50,029
- You!
- Stop it!

277
00:14:50,029 --> 00:14:52,159
You've been getting on my nerves
since last night!

278
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,529
You need to stop!

279
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,529
- Stop it!
- Ji Eun! Stop it, you idiot.

280
00:14:56,529 --> 00:14:59,100
- Come here.
- Let go of me. Let go!

281
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,539
Yoon Se Young! Mark my words!

282
00:15:00,539 --> 00:15:02,470
- Look back on yourself!
- You have to leave.

283
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,480
- Hey! Just go die!
- Are you all right?

284
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,139
Stop touching me!

285
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:13,120
Goodness.

286
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,460
Get her to the infirmary.

287
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,269
What's going on?
What happened to Ms. Yoon?

288
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:32,639
What's going on?

289
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,070
Ms. Yoon fainted.

290
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,740
Se Young.

291
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,639
- Get her to the infirmary now.
- Yes, sir.

292
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,779
- That's your problem.
- I knew you'd do this.

293
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,679
- You need to lose that temper.
- Darn it.

294
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,519
What? What happened to Se Young?

295
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,789
Did she faint?

296
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,889
Is she in shock
after Ji Eun pulled out her hair?

297
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,820
Or does she suffer
from a chronic illness?

298
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,860
- "A chronic illness?"
- I hope she'll be okay.

299
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,330
Why didn't you hold yourself back?

300
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,899
Darn it. Stop scaring me.

301
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,570
She's not putting on a show, is she?

302
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,299
Good grief.

303
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,710
What?

304
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,710
What's going on?

305
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,190
Are you okay?

306
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,830
Jin Goo...

307
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,929
I want to kill myself.

308
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:34,429
What's wrong?

309
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,600
How did you get into a fight
with Ms. Goo's sister?

310
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:42,769
She called me a lady-in-waiting.

311
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,779
She told me
to be good to her sister...

312
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,909
because I was
only a lady-in-waiting.

313
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,580
She yelled that out loud
while everyone was watching.

314
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,389
How can she say that?

315
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,049
Don't cry.

316
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,490
I need to talk to her.

317
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,090
Don't say anything.

318
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,690
Who knows what she'll say next
to slander me?

319
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,660
What did she do
to your face and clothes?

320
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,269
She hit my head with the food tray.

321
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:12,970
What?

322
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:15,809
How can she hit your head?

323
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,809
I loathe Goo Ha Na's siblings.

324
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,480
I'll sue her for assault.

325
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,150
I'll have a good talk with her.

326
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,019
Everything is too hard for me.

327
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,519
I don't want to go home...

328
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,029
or be at the office.

329
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,660
I don't want to do anything.

330
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,500
You poor thing.

331
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,670
You should take an early leave.

332
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:44,569
If you don't want to go home,
you can go to our newlywed home.

333
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:48,339
What if I run into Ji Seok?
It'll be so embarrassing.

334
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,980
Call my mom
and tell her to pick me up.

335
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,809
Her face completely changed...

336
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:57,680
when she heard of the rumor
of her daughter's death.

337
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,750
That fake daughter
didn't seem to think much of it.

338
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,920
It wouldn't be easy to go through
Goo Ha Na's place again.

339
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,759
They found a new tenant
in that while.

340
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,190
"A tenant?"

341
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,460
All kinds of things are
going wrong with this trouble.

342
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
Then, how are we going to find
more information?

343
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,109
You said Mr. Hwang knew
that Goo Ha Na was Yoon Yu Jin.

344
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,079
Why don't you feel out
your future son-in-law?

345
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,880
He's nothing but loyal
to the chairwoman...

346
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,950
And right on cue...

347
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,619
Hey, Jin Goo. What is it?

348
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,029
Se Young is what?

349
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,029
You hit Yoon Se Young's head
with a food tray?

350
00:18:44,259 --> 00:18:46,630
Have you lost your mind?

351
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,230
She tripped Ha Na first.

352
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,369
She fell flat on her face
with the tray in her hands.

353
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:54,569
Are you 100 percent sure?

354
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,839
It looked like it to my eyes.

355
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,609
Hey, why would
Yoon Se Young do that?

356
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,450
Why would she trip
Hyesung's daughter?

357
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:06,220
Do you think everyone in this world
is as thoughtless as you?

358
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,549
You only put Ha Na in a tough spot!

359
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,490
This is driving me crazy.

360
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,130
I'll check the CCTV footage
and set the record straight.

361
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:18,900
- That's what I can do.
- You two are the same.

362
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,599
You hit someone's head with a tray,
and she tripped someone...

363
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:23,170
in the office cafeteria.

364
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,740
She treated me in such disdain
even last night.

365
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,170
She told me off to my face
for buying a knockoff.

366
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,609
Yes, she thought
my tteokbokki vouchers were a joke.

367
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:35,349
- I still remember her mocking face.
- Gosh.

368
00:19:35,349 --> 00:19:36,549
You were at her place?

369
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,920
"Her place?" It's Ha Na's place.

370
00:19:39,049 --> 00:19:40,650
Hey, can we tell him this?

371
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,920
We were invited,
so we went once out of courtesy.

372
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,359
It won't happen the second time.
Right?

373
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,059
No, I'll go again
if Ha Na invites me.

374
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,130
- And I want to see Eun Chong, too.
- Hey.

375
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,970
Right. You know what, Ji Seok?

376
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,940
A thief
broke into our place at that hour.

377
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,569
"A thief?"

378
00:20:01,569 --> 00:20:03,410
Have you heard from the police?

379
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,140
There's no lead,
so it won't be easy to catch the culprit.

380
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,579
He wasn't caught on any CCTVs.

381
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,210
I see.

382
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,779
You should be careful, too.
Make sure you lock the door well.

383
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,049
Things are
quite hectic around me right now.

384
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:18,690
Is something else going on?

385
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,289
I got an odd call this morning.

386
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,160
There was a rumor that
I had already died.

387
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,130
Are you all right?

388
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:30,900
Well, I was told not to mind it
because rumors...

389
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,470
always surrounded conglomerates,
but it didn't sit right with me.

390
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,509
Why did this happen?

391
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,180
An odd rumor like that
will pass away.

392
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,079
Is Eun Chong doing okay?

393
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,509
Yes, he's fitting in
much better than I am.

394
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,480
Eun Chong and I will visit soon.

395
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,849
All right. Goodbye.

396
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,390
If the man
who came to the children's home...

397
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,630
also went through this place
and made that call, then...

398
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,240
Attorney Ko,
there's a rumor of Yu Jin's death.

399
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,970
It doesn't seem like a coincidence.

400
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:17,880
She won't pick up her phone.
Should I go to the infirmary?

401
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,279
She must've been in such shock
if she fainted like that.

402
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:26,119
Your younger sister must be
the YOLO type.

403
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:29,160
Where did she find the nerve
to fight Ms. Yoon like that?

404
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,960
What if she gets fired?

405
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,470
Wait, so why are you the princess
and she, the lady-in-waiting?

406
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,869
What was that?

407
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:41,509
My sister was talking nonsense.

408
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,970
Ms. Yoon
also couldn't say anything to that.

409
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:48,910
Look...

410
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,119
Mr. Hwang, how's Ms. Yoon?

412
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,759
I saw her knocked out.
Is she all right?

413
00:22:04,529 --> 00:22:06,599
Mother came by to take her home.

414
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,569
Anyway, why did your sister do that?

415
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:12,869
She wouldn't do that
without a reason.

416
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:15,440
I tripped on Ms. Yoon's foot,

417
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,809
and she thought
Ms. Yoon did that on purpose.

418
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,109
Did you fall?

419
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,779
Were you hurt?

420
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,950
No. You can already tell.

421
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,680
How did she have
such a misunderstanding?

422
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:31,150
Everything is hectic
both at home and work.

423
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,259
Tell me about it.

424
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,259
I should patch up
what my sister did.

425
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,900
Ms. Yoon must be in big shock.

426
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,170
Please ask your sister to apologize.

427
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,000
Okay.

428
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,210
I asked the police
about the burglary at your place.

429
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
But they didn't find any lead.

430
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,279
Yes, I got a call, too.

431
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,779
Please don't mind it.
We aren't missing anything.

432
00:22:56,009 --> 00:22:57,109
It must be a coincidence.

433
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,890
Yeo Jin!

434
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,960
- Goodness, what's going on?
- My gosh.

435
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:09,359
Oh, my, Se Young. What happened
to your clothes and face?

436
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,160
My gosh. What happened?

437
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,259
Mother...

438
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:16,529
You're covered in food.
My goodness, look at you.

439
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,670
Yeo Jin, look at Se Young.

440
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,009
What happened to you?

441
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:26,440
She was struck
with a food tray at the cafeteria,

442
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:28,809
got her hair pulled out,
and even got thrown on the floor!

443
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,079
I'm so angry right now.

444
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,380
My heart is racing so quickly.

445
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,680
Who did you fight?

446
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Wait, was it Yu Jin?

447
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,519
It was her sister.

448
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,789
That stepsister who doesn't share
a drop of blood with her!

449
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:44,960
That brat who brought
the knockoff scarf last night!

450
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,170
Ji Seok.

451
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,049
You refused to cut your ties
with my siblings,

452
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,049
invited them to that place,
and made this happen.

453
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,390
So, Ms. Yoon and Ji Eun's fight is
all on me, too.

454
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,450
How is it not?

455
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:13,960
Don't make a scene at work.

456
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,930
You aren't just an employee.

457
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,759
Yes, that's right.
I'm no longer just an employee.

458
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,630
Show your respect from now on.

459
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,569
Then, why don't you
make your identity public?

460
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,640
There's a rumor that
Chairwoman Shin's daughter died.

461
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,440
- Goo Ha Na was Yoon Yu Jin...
- Stop it.

462
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,339
Why? Were you scared
someone might hear me?

463
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,710
Did you do something wrong?

464
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,109
Just publicize it.

465
00:24:35,109 --> 00:24:37,049
She's trying to protect me.

466
00:24:37,349 --> 00:24:38,950
She'll make me public
when the right time comes.

467
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,450
How is it protecting you
if she keeps you hidden...

468
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:43,619
despite such a rumor?

469
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,019
You're not a ten-year-old.
You're a grown-up.

470
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:48,829
Every mother has a different way
of protecting her children.

471
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,259
I get her.

472
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:53,900
Bye.

473
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,140
It wasn't like you were adopted.

474
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:07,609
Yu Jin, I can't let this go.

475
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:12,049
She may be your stepsister,
but how dare she hit Se Young?

476
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:16,390
Yeo Jin,
you need to fire her right away.

477
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:20,589
No, before you do that,
I'll sue her for assault!

478
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:21,960
Let it go quietly.

479
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:25,099
I can't let this go quietly.
This is just wrong.

480
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,660
I'm sorry, Aunt Myung Ji.

481
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,130
I'm sorry, Se Young.
Let me apologize on her behalf.

482
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,299
An apology should be made
by the perpetrator, Yu Jin.

483
00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:33,569
She's right about that.

484
00:25:33,769 --> 00:25:34,869
Tell your sister...

485
00:25:34,869 --> 00:25:38,069
- to meet Se Young and apologize.
- Okay.

486
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,640
Yeo Jin, that's it?

487
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,880
That horrid girl...

488
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,319
Yu Jin's sister hit her
and even made her faint!

489
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,390
She wouldn't have done that
without a reason. What happened?

490
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,490
Yu Jin fell,

491
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,359
and she must've thought
I tripped her on purpose.

492
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:59,259
You fell down? Were you hurt?

493
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,960
No, I'm fine.

494
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm glad you aren't hurt.

495
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,539
Yu Jin, why don't you use this
as a chance...

496
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,640
to keep your siblings at a distance?

497
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,839
How can she be so unrefined
at her age?

498
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,140
She won't help you in any way.

499
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,279
If she wasn't your sister,
I would've sued her right away...

500
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,680
for assault
with a claim for compensation.

501
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,950
I'm letting this go because of you.

502
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,519
You know that, right?

503
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:25,559
Yes, thank you.

504
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,259
We should check the CCTV, Grandma.

505
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,190
Auntie Ji Eun may be right.

506
00:26:31,259 --> 00:26:33,829
Hey, stay out of this.

507
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,369
Goodness, you're so smart.

508
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,000
I should find out if you tripped her
or if Yu Jin slipped and fell.

509
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,339
That way, no one would feel wronged.

510
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:46,980
We don't have to broadcast
our family affairs to others.

511
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,279
Let's just call this
a misunderstanding...

512
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,650
and end it
with an apology for Se Young.

513
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:54,180
Se Young,
don't nitpick over this again.

514
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,990
Yu Jin said
she'd make her apologize.

515
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,460
- Okay.
- What do you want to do, Yu Jin?

516
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,789
I want my sister to apologize...

517
00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:06,130
and end this quietly.

518
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,970
If she's Yu Jin's sister,
she's your sister, too.

519
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,099
You have to get along with her,

520
00:27:12,269 --> 00:27:14,400
so act more mature
like the older sister you are.

521
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,710
Yes, Aunt Yeo Jin.

522
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:18,240
I heard from Jin Goo...

523
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,680
that the rumor was found to be
completely groundless.

524
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,210
That's the thing with rumors.

525
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,250
People need to know
that Yu Jin is still alive.

526
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,019
You should make her public
very soon.

527
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,190
I want to do that, too.

528
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,190
- Yu Jin, come in for a moment.
- Okay.

529
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,170
I'm sorry.

530
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,410
I'll talk to my sister.

531
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,450
You don't have to be sorry.

532
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,750
You ended up suffering between them.

533
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,720
That call about the rumor
must've startled you.

534
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,359
I can still feel my heart race...

535
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:12,960
whenever I hear such bad news
after 20 years of searching.

536
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,970
You don't have to mind it.

537
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,470
Don't worry.

538
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,039
Why don't you tell the public
that you found me?

539
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,710
Then, you won't hear
such rumors again.

540
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
It's still too early.

541
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,450
I know I'm not good enough.

542
00:28:29,109 --> 00:28:32,420
I'll do my best
to be a daughter you're proud of.

543
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:36,420
That's not the reason.
I'm not ready yet.

544
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,920
I don't want to put you in danger...

545
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,230
and lose you again.

546
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,789
You have to protect Eun Chong, too.

547
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:47,930
Okay.

548
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,339
I'm sorry for making you hear
something that awful.

549
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,740
It's okay.
I understand what you mean.

550
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,710
You couldn't find out
where the rumor came from?

551
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,380
No, all information about the reporter
seemed to be deleted.

552
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,690
She could've just ignored
that absurd rumor.

553
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,519
Why did Chairwoman Shin
tell Hwang Jin Goo...

554
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,990
to find out more about the reporter?

555
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,029
She must be sensitive
because it's about her daughter.

556
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:18,799
Then, she should want
to make her public.

557
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:23,200
Every mother has a different way
of protecting her children.

558
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:27,640
How is it protecting her daughter
to keep hiding her...

559
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,839
despite rumors of her death?

560
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,740
What if
the rumor of her death is real?

561
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,450
What do you mean?

562
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,789
Your daughter was enshrined safely
at the temple, Ms. Chairwoman.

563
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:50,329
Thank you. Are you sure
no one knows about this?

564
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:51,630
I am, ma'am.

565
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,299
Come in.

566
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:01,000
- I'm here, Ms. Chairwoman.
- Hello.

567
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,750
Yu Jin's remains were
enshrined at the temple.

568
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,650
- When?
- Ms. Jang got it done today.

569
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:14,849
How did you move her remains
without Ms. Goo finding out?

570
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:16,150
I'll tell you later.

571
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,420
Let's go to the temple
on the weekend.

572
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,160
I'll remove the altar
and the wishing tree.

573
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:24,460
Are you all right?

574
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,400
I thought that was the way...

575
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,500
Yu Jin would rest in peace.

576
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:44,680
Why don't you tell the public
that you found me?

577
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,220
Then, you won't hear
such rumors again.

578
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,119
I'm not ready yet.

579
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,759
I don't want to put you in danger...

580
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:55,119
and lose you again.

581
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,859
You have to protect Eun Chong, too.

582
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:02,869
I'll become a reliable daughter
who can protect you...

583
00:31:03,769 --> 00:31:05,470
from now on.

584
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,309
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

585
00:31:16,349 --> 00:31:18,279
Aunt Yeo Jin seemed weird.

586
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,950
If she was that concerned, she could
reveal Ha Na as her daughter.

587
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,490
Is that a bit of a stretch?

588
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,619
Also, Chairwoman Shin's daughter
went missing when she was ten,

589
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,029
but my sister lost her dad in a fire
when she was seven.

590
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,900
And she went to the children's home
and then got adopted by us at ten.

591
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,200
Let me check the news article.

592
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,740
It says she went missing
when she was seven.

593
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,339
(Yoon Yu Jin, age 7, went missing.)

594
00:31:44,009 --> 00:31:48,079
What if her death was real,
and she had the article fixed?

595
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,279
Wait.

596
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:52,619
Could Ha Na be fake?

597
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:48,369
(Cinderella Game)

598
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:51,039
Are you happy living in that house?

599
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,309
What more was there to you
that she had to deceive you...

600
00:32:53,309 --> 00:32:54,910
and have you as a fake daughter?

601
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:57,480
I should be sorrier, Ms. Goo.

602
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,220
This is so frustrating.

603
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,849
My family is
never in peace anymore...

604
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,390
because of you and your nephew!

605
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,890
- Where are you, Mom?
- Mr. Hwang.

606
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,490
The death of Chairwoman Shin's daughter
may be true.

607
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,730
Are you serious?

608
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:10,660
I'll find out starting now.
