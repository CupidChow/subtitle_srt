1
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:03,531
First, you were suspicious of me over that Kongkong or whatever.

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,771
And now, you're treating me like a thief.

3
00:00:06,901 --> 00:00:08,602
But I should still be patient.

4
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:10,971
You're Yoon Yu Jin, and I'm Yoon Se Young.

5
00:00:11,771 --> 00:00:13,711
You weren't even that patient.

6
00:00:13,712 --> 00:00:15,810
Don't you get how patient I am with you?

7
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:17,611
- No, I don't. - Unbelievable.

8
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,752
Auntie Ha Na.

9
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,452
We're just talking.

10
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:28,590
I never asked you to be patient.

11
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:30,291
You may have done that on your own,

12
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,090
but don't patronize me.

13
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:33,831
- "Patronize?" - Don't be patient.

14
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,231
It doesn't suit you.

15
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:36,401
Is that all you have to say?

16
00:00:37,432 --> 00:00:39,271
Do you really want me not to be patient?

17
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:41,871
I couldn't care less if you were patient or not.

18
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:45,111
- Let's go, Eun Chong. - I'm not done talking to you!

19
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:46,312
Let go of me!

20
00:00:49,352 --> 00:00:50,481
Are you okay?

21
00:00:51,252 --> 00:00:52,682
- You're bleeding. - You're bleeding.

22
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:54,781
- You're bleeding. - What?

23
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,692
Darn it. What is this?

24
00:01:00,222 --> 00:01:02,222
Hey. Did you just hit me?

25
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,861
Let go of me!

26
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,132
- What's with you? - You hit me first!

27
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:08,700
Let go!

28
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,700
Stop hitting my auntie!

29
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:12,171
Stop hitting her!

30
00:01:12,742 --> 00:01:14,500
- Let go of me! - No, you let go!

31
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:17,111
Let go!

32
00:01:17,112 --> 00:01:19,511
What are you two doing? Let go of each other!

33
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:21,640
Let go! Come on!

34
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:23,912
Please! Girls!

35
00:01:24,412 --> 00:01:26,851
Good grief. Let go of her, will you?

36
00:01:26,852 --> 00:01:27,951
What are you doing?

37
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:29,921
Let go of each other!

38
00:01:38,132 --> 00:01:39,261
Goodness.

39
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,041
I can't believe this.

40
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,481
How can two adults fight in front of a child?

41
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,251
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

42
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,712
What was the fight about?

43
00:01:58,311 --> 00:02:02,582
Yu Jin treats me like I'm a thief, Aunt Yeo Jin.

44
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,821
She said I stole the photo that was in the room.

45
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:10,661
Yu Jin. Did you really treat Se Young as a thief?

46
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:15,732
How dare a fake treat my daughter like a thief? That little...

47
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,070
Well, my words must've had room for misunderstanding...

48
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:21,571
I'm really upset and feel victimized, Aunt Yeo Jin.

49
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,142
Even so,

50
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:26,112
how can you fight with Yu Jin? She returned after 20 years.

51
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:28,311
And in my house, right before me.

52
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,112
No one should lay a finger on her.

53
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:34,052
But she's your fake daughter, Yeo Jin.

54
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,351
Stop overreacting.

55
00:02:36,522 --> 00:02:39,150
You've been praying for Yu Jin to come back home.

56
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:42,492
But was that all a lie, Se Young?

57
00:02:43,432 --> 00:02:46,101
Yeo Jin. That's going too far.

58
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:48,862
You know Se Young has been waiting for Yu Jin all along.

59
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,501
They may have met as a superior and a subordinate,

60
00:02:52,702 --> 00:02:55,142
but I'm sure they must've hugged joyfully.

61
00:02:55,542 --> 00:02:57,911
It won't be easy to adapt when their relationship...

62
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,712
has changed suddenly.

63
00:03:00,112 --> 00:03:01,841
As long as she has waited,

64
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,281
the two need time to adjust to the change.

65
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:07,182
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

66
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:11,992
I must've lost it the moment I saw my nose bleeding.

67
00:03:13,392 --> 00:03:17,031
Se Young is trying really hard...

68
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:19,332
to get along with Yu Jin.

69
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:22,462
You're well aware of that, right, Yu Jin?

70
00:03:23,631 --> 00:03:24,731
Yes.

71
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:27,802
Because Yu Jin accused her of being a thief...

72
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,611
and made her nose bleed today...

73
00:03:29,612 --> 00:03:31,672
Auntie Se Young started it first.

74
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:35,112
When Auntie Ha Na was leaving, Auntie Se Young grabbed her arm.

75
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:37,711
Auntie Ha Na was shaking her off...

76
00:03:37,712 --> 00:03:39,281
when Auntie Se Young got hit.

77
00:03:39,621 --> 00:03:41,351
Stay out of this.

78
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,021
I wonder who you take after to butt into the grown-up's affair.

79
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:47,691
How can you say that to a child when you're an adult?

80
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:53,000
Both of you were in the wrong.

81
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,630
Apologize to each other and make peace.

82
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:55,631
She's right.

83
00:03:55,632 --> 00:03:58,702
You two only have each other as sisters.

84
00:03:59,432 --> 00:04:00,471
Go on now.

85
00:04:01,302 --> 00:04:04,042
I'm sorry. It was a slip of the tongue.

86
00:04:04,772 --> 00:04:06,011
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:09,441
They say siblings grow fond of each other through fights, Yeo Jin.

88
00:04:09,881 --> 00:04:11,682
Please don't be so angry.

89
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,381
You'll do better from now on, yes, Se Young?

90
00:04:15,482 --> 00:04:16,552
Yes.

91
00:04:16,891 --> 00:04:20,820
By the way, what photo did you lose to cause such a fuss?

92
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:22,830
Tell us, and we can help you find it.

93
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:25,260
It's a photo of me, my mommy,

94
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:27,261
and Auntie Ha Na.

95
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:30,071
What? Who could've taken such a photo?

96
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:33,172
- Did you look everywhere? - I did.

97
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:36,871
It's inside a frame and impossible not to spot.

98
00:04:37,342 --> 00:04:40,782
Was there anyone other than Se Young who went into your room?

99
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,482
It'll appear out of nowhere someday.

100
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,521
You've disappointed me, Yu Jin.

101
00:04:46,621 --> 00:04:48,281
Eun Chong is practically your son.

102
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:51,621
How can a mother fight before her child?

103
00:04:52,922 --> 00:04:54,621
I'm sorry, Mom.

104
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:57,760
- You too, Se Young. - Sorry?

105
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:59,231
Must you have caused a stir...

106
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,732
when Eun Chong's accident was not too long ago?

107
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:02,802
Will we be able to live together?

108
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:04,001
What's this?

109
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:06,501
Is she going to kick me and Se Young out?

110
00:05:06,902 --> 00:05:09,401
If I hear another fight in this house,

111
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:10,972
I'll kick the both of you out.

112
00:05:12,112 --> 00:05:13,282
- Okay. - Okay.

113
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:16,581
To reflect on yourselves, I have homework for you two.

114
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:18,052
Help each other to complete it.

115
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,721
- "Homework?" - "Homework?"

116
00:05:20,722 --> 00:05:22,081
Tomorrow is a holiday.

117
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:24,851
Clean the whole house together.

118
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:25,992
"Clean the whole house?"

119
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,362
I'm sorry for letting you down.

120
00:05:34,432 --> 00:05:36,672
How dare she lay a finger on my daughter?

121
00:05:36,902 --> 00:05:38,571
And especially in my house.

122
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:44,972
- What? - I feel protected.

123
00:05:46,742 --> 00:05:48,842
After my foster parents passed away,

124
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:51,852
I've only ever lived as my siblings' and Eun Chong's guardian...

125
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,581
and never felt protected.

126
00:05:54,951 --> 00:05:56,821
I'm your guardian now.

127
00:05:57,121 --> 00:05:58,592
I'll protect you.

128
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:00,862
I'll protect you too.

129
00:06:01,422 --> 00:06:02,492
All right.

130
00:06:03,691 --> 00:06:05,732
- You too, Eun Chong. - Okay.

131
00:06:05,831 --> 00:06:08,862
When is Auntie Ha Na going to become my mommy?

132
00:06:09,532 --> 00:06:12,630
- What? - I heard I could get adopted...

133
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:14,941
if we came to your house, Grandma.

134
00:06:17,412 --> 00:06:19,571
I'll give you a hand.

135
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,081
Ms. Jang will be told to push ahead with the adoption.

136
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:29,521
Documents will be needed. Make sure to answer Ms. Jang's calls.

137
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,821
Really?

138
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:34,862
Thank you.

139
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:37,561
- Eun Chong. - Auntie Ha Na!

140
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,402
Thank you.

141
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:56,412
Even if it's all an act, she's a fake daughter.

142
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,182
How can Yeo Jin be so sincere?

143
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:04,852
Don't tell me she will accept her as a real daughter.

144
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:08,722
Maybe your secret fund got busted.

145
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:11,791
Knowing you'd packed some bucks,

146
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:15,302
she brought a fake daughter so as not to leave the money to you.

147
00:07:16,701 --> 00:07:18,131
Is that really it?

148
00:07:18,932 --> 00:07:21,141
In order to not leave the money to us.

149
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:31,711
Did you hear anything about Yali's adoption?

150
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,521
No. If nobody wants her, how about we keep her?

151
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:39,321
Sure. I've grown fond of her. Saying goodbye will be tough.

152
00:07:40,722 --> 00:07:44,191
By the way, I dropped by Chairwoman Shin's place.

153
00:07:44,891 --> 00:07:46,362
Eun Chong's aunt.

154
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:49,771
No. I mean the chairwoman's daughter.

155
00:07:50,172 --> 00:07:52,532
The more I get to know her, the nicer she is.

156
00:07:53,602 --> 00:07:56,711
Is that because she's the chairwoman's daughter now?

157
00:07:57,641 --> 00:08:00,441
No. Ms. Goo...

158
00:08:00,842 --> 00:08:03,612
always seemed genuine and kind.

159
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:06,352
It's Se Young and Myung Ji who said bad things about...

160
00:08:06,552 --> 00:08:08,852
What did Se Young and Mother say?

161
00:08:09,081 --> 00:08:10,422
Nothing much.

162
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,461
Come to think of it,

163
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:18,092
are you sure nothing happened between you and Ms. Goo?

164
00:08:19,802 --> 00:08:22,461
- Yes. - But what was that hesitation for?

165
00:08:23,231 --> 00:08:24,601
Is there something going on?

166
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,331
No.

167
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,111
She's warm-hearted and thoughtful. I like her.

168
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:31,871
If I had another son,

169
00:08:31,872 --> 00:08:33,382
I would want her as my daughter-in-law.

170
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,512
I can see what you're after.

171
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:36,912
It's only a dream.

172
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:41,081
What time did you go to the chairwoman's place?

173
00:08:42,182 --> 00:08:44,922
- Why do you ask? - I stopped by as well.

174
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,392
We could've bumped into each other.

175
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:49,022
Is that so? We missed each other then.

176
00:08:50,262 --> 00:08:53,101
Oh, right. Now that her daughter is found,

177
00:08:53,302 --> 00:08:56,331
the chairwoman is taking down the altar in the temple.

178
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:58,372
I see.

179
00:09:03,912 --> 00:09:05,012
Yes, Se Young?

180
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:08,882
Come by tomorrow? Did something happen?

181
00:09:10,311 --> 00:09:11,412
Okay.

182
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,422
You want me to clean the bathroom, storage, and utility room?

183
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:17,252
Why do I get all the sucky rooms?

184
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:20,721
It's you who drew those rooms.

185
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:23,132
Let's work hard and not fight today.

186
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:24,561
That's my line.

187
00:09:26,392 --> 00:09:27,632
That look suits her perfectly.

188
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:31,502
Where is he?

189
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,441
Is someone coming?

190
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:35,971
Oh, he's here.

191
00:09:38,012 --> 00:09:39,211
Jin Goo.

192
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:44,682
- Welcome home. - Thanks.

193
00:09:46,382 --> 00:09:49,922
Did you call President Hwang over to have him clean?

194
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:51,252
Today...

195
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,321
We're cleaning the whole house day.

196
00:09:56,831 --> 00:09:57,892
What...

197
00:10:03,872 --> 00:10:05,071
Did something happen?

198
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:09,071
Why did Chairwoman Shin make you two clean the house?

199
00:10:09,802 --> 00:10:13,741
She thought doing things together would help us get along.

200
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,811
There are many ways to get along.

201
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,412
Shopping, working out, watching movies, and traveling.

202
00:10:20,022 --> 00:10:21,251
But why cleaning of all things?

203
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:22,351
Do you hate the idea of it?

204
00:10:22,682 --> 00:10:24,422
Can't you see me working hard right now?

205
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:53,081
Is cleaning fun?

206
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,981
You're humming away so happily.

207
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:57,591
I should be happy about it if I'm doing it anyway.

208
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,021
It might be hard while you work, but once you're done,

209
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:02,591
it makes you feel so clean and fresh too.

210
00:11:02,892 --> 00:11:03,991
Is that so?

211
00:11:04,861 --> 00:11:07,501
I feel that way when I'm shopping, getting a massage,

212
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:09,632
or exercising.

213
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:11,831
Does cleaning feel that way too?

214
00:11:12,201 --> 00:11:13,672
Have you never cleaned before?

215
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,001
It's perfect for getting rid of stress.

216
00:11:16,002 --> 00:11:17,470
Why would I clean?

217
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,372
The housekeeper does everything.

218
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,182
Oh, right.

219
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:25,951
Hey, since you brought up the housekeeper,

220
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,451
why is Mr. Hwang's mother working here?

221
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:33,052
Be quiet. What if Jin Goo hears you?

222
00:11:33,191 --> 00:11:36,021
That's what I mean. What if Mr. Hwang finds out?

223
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:37,761
She's working here because she wants to.

224
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,101
Even so, that's just not right.

225
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,371
How upset would Mr. Hwang be when he finds out later?

226
00:11:43,372 --> 00:11:45,071
Are you worrying about Mr. Hwang right now?

227
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,872
It's none of your business.

228
00:11:47,042 --> 00:11:48,240
Stay out of it.

229
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,471
This is my house.

230
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,310
If you get married, she'll be your mother-in-law.

231
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:54,412
How does it make any sense to employ your in-law as a housekeeper?

232
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:58,252
Se Young, I'm done with the bathroom.

233
00:11:58,351 --> 00:12:00,321
Are you? Good job.

234
00:12:00,451 --> 00:12:01,621
Next, clean the utility room.

235
00:12:01,622 --> 00:12:03,421
I'll clean the utility room.

236
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:04,792
No, I'll do it.

237
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:08,422
By the way, where did all the elders go?

238
00:12:16,231 --> 00:12:17,730
You're eating so well, Eun Chong.

239
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:19,231
- Is it yummy? - Yes.

240
00:12:19,331 --> 00:12:21,301
We wanted to treat you to a meal,

241
00:12:21,302 --> 00:12:23,642
but we were surprised when you asked to meet here.

242
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,811
This is our favorite place.

243
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,581
Eun Chong said that he wanted to have yummy tteokbokki...

244
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:32,951
when he met his aunt and uncle.

245
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,221
Oh, my! Oh, no, Chairwoman Shin! What do we do?

246
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:39,752
Oh, it's okay. Just leave it.

247
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:42,891
Lee Eun Chong! What did you do to the chairwoman's shoe?

248
00:12:42,892 --> 00:12:46,632
I'm sorry. We should've taught Eun Chong better manners.

249
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,601
I'm sorry, Grandma.

250
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:55,471
You don't have to be sorry. I'll just get it washed.

251
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:01,211
Eun Chong seems very well-mannered.

252
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:05,552
If Eun Chong is Yu Jin's son, he's practically my grandson too.

253
00:13:06,182 --> 00:13:07,522
Please love and cherish him.

254
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,422
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

255
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:16,262
Do you like the tteokbokki?

256
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:20,831
Try dipping the rice cake in here.

257
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:22,831
It tastes amazing.

258
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:25,801
This tteokbokki is the business item that I'm interested in these days.

259
00:13:25,802 --> 00:13:27,902
You should give it a try. Don't worry about the money.

260
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:29,402
Really?

261
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,771
Thank you, Chairwoman Shin.

262
00:13:30,772 --> 00:13:34,182
I'll make this a success and give you a big return on your investment.

263
00:13:35,642 --> 00:13:37,912
And is there anything you want to do?

264
00:13:40,422 --> 00:13:43,321
I want to go abroad to study fashion,

265
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:46,961
but could I let you know once I have more specific plans?

266
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,792
All right.

267
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:58,132
Are you sure no one tracked the slush fund?

268
00:13:58,601 --> 00:14:01,402
It's been laundered into the Swiss bank account long ago.

269
00:14:01,672 --> 00:14:03,772
If it's not the slush fund, then what could it be?

270
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:07,241
Why would they hide Yu Jin's death and need a fake daughter?

271
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,211
Is there a problem?

272
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,652
What? Oh, it's nothing.

273
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:15,882
By the way, I'll go ahead and buy the real estate I mentioned before.

274
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:18,221
Did you come up with the money?

275
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:20,321
I put together about three big ones.

276
00:14:20,691 --> 00:14:22,991
Oh, three million dollars.

277
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,762
Try to come up with one more.

278
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:35,341
What?

279
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:40,841
It's a child's hat.

280
00:14:41,441 --> 00:14:43,012
It looks pretty old.

281
00:14:43,412 --> 00:14:44,882
Did I wear this when I was little?

282
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:47,321
Where is the glass cleaner?

283
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:49,581
I put it in the utility room.

284
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:59,961
- That... - Do you recognize this hat?

285
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:03,032
I must've worn it as a child.

286
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:06,002
Is that why?

287
00:15:07,772 --> 00:15:08,841
It seems familiar.

288
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:13,142
This hat is new. You should wear it.

289
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:15,741
It's a gift.

290
00:15:22,282 --> 00:15:24,191
- Oh, no! - Go away.

291
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:26,922
What's wrong with you?

292
00:15:32,292 --> 00:15:33,392
Don't come any closer!

293
00:15:37,432 --> 00:15:38,532
What's wrong with her?

294
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,302
What about the glass cleaner?

295
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:43,402
Hey, what's wrong?

296
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:45,611
Why are you shaking so much?

297
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:03,191
You don't have a fever.

298
00:16:03,861 --> 00:16:05,132
I must be coming down with something.

299
00:16:05,892 --> 00:16:07,432
Let me get some sleep first.

300
00:16:07,762 --> 00:16:10,932
I'm the one who cleaned. Why are you the one getting sick?

301
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,871
Take some medicine and sleep.

302
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,142
I'll take medicine if I need to.

303
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:16,441
- You can go. - Call me if you need anything.

304
00:16:16,841 --> 00:16:18,012
I'll be downstairs.

305
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,581
Do you recognize this hat?

306
00:16:27,922 --> 00:16:29,782
I must've worn it as a child.

307
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,652
Is that why?

308
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:33,691
It seems familiar.

309
00:16:34,221 --> 00:16:36,262
Is her memory coming back, perhaps?

310
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:49,402
Mom, what do I do?

311
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,471
Oh, hang on.

312
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,682
What's wrong?

313
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:02,922
She recognized the hat?

314
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:04,322
Yes.

315
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,521
What if Yu Jin's memory came back?

316
00:17:08,392 --> 00:17:10,530
I'm too scared to stay here.

317
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:11,632
Mom, where are you?

318
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:14,801
There's no way the fake daughter remembers that.

319
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,402
How does she know about that hat?

320
00:17:17,501 --> 00:17:18,932
Mom, are you listening to me?

321
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:22,572
Yes, I'm listening.

322
00:17:22,801 --> 00:17:24,142
Stay calm.

323
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,511
Did Yu Jin say anything else?

324
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:30,511
She said the hat seemed familiar.

325
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,721
What is going on? This is driving me crazy.

326
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:37,322
It's a common hat. She might be mistaken.

327
00:17:37,622 --> 00:17:39,251
I'll be home soon.

328
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,322
Take some medicine and get some sleep.

329
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,832
Is Se Young okay?

330
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:47,961
She must be coming down with something.

331
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:50,602
We're the ones who did the cleaning.

332
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:55,101
I know. What did you do so wrong that you're even cleaning here?

333
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:57,112
It's pretty fun, actually.

334
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:02,211
By the way, are you upset with me about something?

335
00:18:02,511 --> 00:18:04,182
No, why?

336
00:18:04,852 --> 00:18:07,321
You were rushing me to leave yesterday.

337
00:18:07,322 --> 00:18:09,221
I was wondering if I did something wrong.

338
00:18:12,622 --> 00:18:14,221
I just wanted you to be good to your mother.

339
00:18:15,392 --> 00:18:16,562
Out of the blue?

340
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:18,461
I know, right?

341
00:18:19,662 --> 00:18:22,531
My mother feels really bad for you.

342
00:18:23,162 --> 00:18:26,332
Because she misunderstood things between us and spoke harshly to you.

343
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:29,041
She apologized to me.

344
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,741
Tell her that I'm okay.

345
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,142
Thanks.

346
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:38,912
- One second. - Sure.

347
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:44,951
Yes, Director.

348
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,092
There are rumors about selling off the travel company?

349
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:49,761
They're false rumors.

350
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:50,931
I'll find evidence...

351
00:18:50,932 --> 00:18:52,291
of the cancellation with the cooperative firm.

352
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,931
Assistant Manager Yoon. Director Goo's people must be...

353
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:01,902
spreading rumors about selling off the travel company.

354
00:19:02,102 --> 00:19:03,201
Look into it.

355
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,842
Will Ji Seok really get rid of Hyesung Tour?

356
00:19:08,342 --> 00:19:11,112
Chairwoman Shin's husband seemed quiet since then.

357
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:12,951
Ever since her daughter went into that house,

358
00:19:13,112 --> 00:19:14,721
there hasn't been any movement.

359
00:19:15,251 --> 00:19:16,322
Right.

360
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:21,461
Didn't Chairwoman Shin ask to see me?

361
00:19:21,592 --> 00:19:23,191
She seems to be distracted from work...

362
00:19:23,521 --> 00:19:25,191
as she's spending time with her daughter.

363
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,031
She acted like she was going to meet with you as soon as possible.

364
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:30,771
It's a good thing that we don't meet.

365
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:35,072
I thought about a way to win without fighting.

366
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:37,471
I don't think now is the time.

367
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,010
Will you really fight your sister?

368
00:19:40,011 --> 00:19:42,240
I know what you're worried about,

369
00:19:42,241 --> 00:19:44,852
but I'll think about the issue with my sister...

370
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:46,551
after the revenge is over.

371
00:19:46,781 --> 00:19:49,781
If that's what you want, how could I stop you?

372
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:52,951
- Let me know if I can help. - Okay.

373
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,822
I'll meet with the board members and convince them...

374
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,461
about selling Hyesung Tour.

375
00:20:02,461 --> 00:20:04,902
Se Young. Get up.

376
00:20:06,932 --> 00:20:10,402
Why are you sweating so much?

377
00:20:10,541 --> 00:20:11,711
My goodness.

378
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,481
Mom.

379
00:20:14,642 --> 00:20:16,642
Yes, did you take some medicine?

380
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:18,551
- Yes. - Oh, good.

381
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:20,312
Oh, dear.

382
00:20:24,051 --> 00:20:27,922
What if Yu Jin's memories are coming back one by one?

383
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:30,021
I told you that wouldn't happen.

384
00:20:30,122 --> 00:20:32,031
What makes you so sure that it's not?

385
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,000
Yu Jin came back in the end too.

386
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:37,432
You're right. Yu Jin came back.

387
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:40,471
But what? Does that affect you at all?

388
00:20:40,941 --> 00:20:43,501
- It doesn't yet. - Why doesn't it?

389
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,172
I've become a servant girl now.

390
00:20:47,382 --> 00:20:49,811
I was humiliated in front of that mere Goo Ha Na.

391
00:20:49,812 --> 00:20:51,682
Consider the long run.

392
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:55,451
The person who's laughing in the end is the winner.

393
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:58,190
She will never remember what happened that day.

394
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,652
How do you know that?

395
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:05,162
Anyway, all that matters is that we take over Hyesung Group.

396
00:21:05,862 --> 00:21:06,991
Everything is so annoying.

397
00:21:07,902 --> 00:21:10,432
I wish I could just get rid of that hat.

398
00:21:10,531 --> 00:21:13,372
All right. I'll burn it.

399
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:17,041
So, you just feel better soon, okay?

400
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,011
You don't even know how hard it is for me.

401
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,882
You're always just telling me to trust you.

402
00:21:29,382 --> 00:21:31,451
Seeing you asleep off guard...

403
00:21:32,622 --> 00:21:33,822
reminded me of our old days.

404
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,791
You can come by often.

405
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,531
You can tell me things you can't tell Hwang Jin Goo.

406
00:21:40,801 --> 00:21:42,632
Come by if you need someone to talk to.

407
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,672
I'd rather feel more at ease by Goo Ji Seok's side.

408
00:21:58,682 --> 00:21:59,812
Yes?

409
00:22:01,751 --> 00:22:02,852
Mom.

410
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,362
- Have some jujube tea, Mom. - Okay.

411
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:10,892
Thank you.

412
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,531
Cleaning the house must've been hard.

413
00:22:14,701 --> 00:22:15,801
No, it wasn't.

414
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:20,672
I saw a child's hat in your closet while cleaning your room earlier.

415
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:23,672
You saw the straw hat.

416
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:28,011
You don't have to clean my room.

417
00:22:28,312 --> 00:22:29,642
Oh, okay.

418
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,981
Was it the hat I used to wear as a child?

419
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:37,451
Yes, you were wearing that hat when you went missing.

420
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,990
We only found the hat and not you.

421
00:22:41,991 --> 00:22:43,422
It made me so anxious.

422
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:47,832
I'm by your side now.

423
00:22:48,261 --> 00:22:49,932
You can stop being sad.

424
00:22:52,402 --> 00:22:53,471
I should.

425
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:57,142
Does Se Young know about this hat too?

426
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:01,441
She was with you on the day you went missing.

427
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:05,451
How did I go missing?

428
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,921
Se Young seemed to be...

429
00:23:07,922 --> 00:23:09,682
having a hard time with what happened to me.

430
00:23:12,221 --> 00:23:13,392
I told you.

431
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:15,822
We were on a trip to the beach.

432
00:23:16,922 --> 00:23:19,392
It's a heartbreaking memory. I don't want to remember it.

433
00:23:20,761 --> 00:23:24,102
You're back here now. Let's not speak about the past.

434
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:26,632
Okay.

435
00:23:26,633 --> 00:23:28,171
Grabbed her by the hair?

436
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,642
Yes, like this.

437
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:32,440
That's why Grandma scolded them...

438
00:23:32,441 --> 00:23:34,612
and had them clean the whole house.

439
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:35,912
I see.

440
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,082
Hey.

441
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:45,352
Do you need help with anything? Tell me whatever it is.

442
00:23:45,822 --> 00:23:47,152
I'll provide customer service.

443
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,761
"Customer service?"

444
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,521
Shall I say it's customer service for happiness?

445
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:53,190
I persuaded you that you'd become happier...

446
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:55,602
once you met your birth mom, so I should take responsibility.

447
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,572
Tell me right away if you seem to be growing distant from happiness.

448
00:23:59,902 --> 00:24:03,141
I'm plenty happy now. Both me and Eun Chong.

449
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:04,642
- Right? - Yes!

450
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:09,112
Things between you and Ms. Yoon will take some time, right?

451
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:12,181
Yes.

452
00:24:12,182 --> 00:24:14,122
I'll leave after I look in on Ms. Yoon.

453
00:24:18,322 --> 00:24:20,652
- How is Se Young? - She fell asleep.

454
00:24:21,221 --> 00:24:23,322
She's been under so much stress lately.

455
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:25,132
I was going to say bye to her.

456
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:28,301
Then I'll leave after saying goodbye to Chairwoman Shin.

457
00:24:28,432 --> 00:24:29,602
Yes, sure.

458
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:33,031
Yu Jin, could I have a word with you?

459
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:34,441
Okay.

460
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:40,941
Se Young's trauma from her childhood...

461
00:24:41,041 --> 00:24:43,281
must've come back after seeing that hat.

462
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,582
Oh, my.

463
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:47,422
It's awful that she's still struggling with that.

464
00:24:48,182 --> 00:24:50,582
I don't really know since I can't remember.

465
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:52,391
It's not that you can't remember.

466
00:24:52,392 --> 00:24:54,991
You don't have those memories, you shameless wench.

467
00:24:56,422 --> 00:24:58,432
Well, for Se Young,

468
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:02,031
that day must still be fresh in her mind.

469
00:25:02,632 --> 00:25:04,372
Please try to understand.

470
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:05,731
Okay.

471
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:07,970
A memory from when she was seven years old...

472
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:09,241
should be gone by now.

473
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,642
Seven years old?

474
00:25:15,312 --> 00:25:16,481
Auntie.

475
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:18,751
Yes, Eun Chong. Do you want something?

476
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,422
I'm sleepy.

477
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:23,382
Do you want to go and take a nap?

478
00:25:23,882 --> 00:25:26,251
- I'll head upstairs now. - Oh, sure.

479
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:30,862
Seven years old?

480
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,632
Did she say 7 years old instead of 10 by accident?

481
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,511
Se Young, are you feeling better?

482
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:46,941
If you're not well, you should take a sick day.

483
00:25:47,271 --> 00:25:49,241
No, I'm well enough to go to work.

484
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:52,451
Yu Jin had to work harder because of Se Young.

485
00:25:53,011 --> 00:25:55,122
You should buy her a meal sometime.

486
00:25:56,122 --> 00:25:57,651
- Okay. - It's fine.

487
00:25:57,652 --> 00:25:59,750
Come on. You don't have to refuse.

488
00:25:59,751 --> 00:26:01,491
That's how you will grow closer.

489
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:04,491
Eating together, having tea, going shopping,

490
00:26:05,632 --> 00:26:07,662
and even gossiping about other people too.

491
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,602
What's "gossiping?"

492
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,271
Oh, it's something a seven-year-old kid doesn't have to know.

493
00:26:16,201 --> 00:26:17,470
A memory from when she was seven years old...

494
00:26:17,471 --> 00:26:18,741
should be gone by now.

495
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:22,612
I doubt she'd mistake 7 and 10.

496
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:26,281
It didn't seem like she was lying either.

497
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:32,592
You met with Danny Jung.

498
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,721
Just tell me honestly.

499
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:37,991
How could you come here every single day?

500
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,862
It's harder for me to see you.

501
00:26:40,261 --> 00:26:42,761
- You should go. - Hyesung Tour is about to go down.

502
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:46,132
Your company grew a lot, thanks to us too.

503
00:26:46,332 --> 00:26:49,270
I'm not saying this to take credit or put pressure on you.

504
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:50,342
As if.

505
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,672
You came all the way to my house to pressure me.

506
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:55,882
So, please help me out.

507
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:06,791
Can you keep what I'm about to say a secret?

508
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:08,791
Of course, sir.

509
00:27:09,122 --> 00:27:12,662
As you said, Danny Jung came by.

510
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,332
When?

511
00:27:15,162 --> 00:27:16,730
As long as you agree with the selling of Hyesung Tour,

512
00:27:16,731 --> 00:27:18,801
which I will bring up at the board meeting,

513
00:27:19,031 --> 00:27:20,471
I'll guarantee your jobs...

514
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:23,001
until retirement and even pay incentives.

515
00:27:28,241 --> 00:27:29,312
One more thing.

516
00:27:29,812 --> 00:27:32,781
When we launch the new hotel brand, I will give you...

517
00:27:33,182 --> 00:27:34,382
ten thousand shares each.

518
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:45,662
I offered this much, but they wouldn't even consider it.

519
00:27:45,731 --> 00:27:47,602
Do you think Chairwoman Shin has something else?

520
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:57,240
- I think we can find the evidence. - Really?

521
00:27:57,241 --> 00:27:58,871
The president of Hojin Rent-A-Car admitted...

522
00:27:58,872 --> 00:28:00,511
that Director Goo was behind this.

523
00:28:01,142 --> 00:28:02,411
Did you get the evidence?

524
00:28:02,412 --> 00:28:04,412
I'll get the material tomorrow.

525
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,852
- And get a recording too. - Oh, that's good.

526
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:10,922
Director Goo's people have already spread rumors about the sale.

527
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:12,251
Really?

528
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:14,822
If we find evidence that Goo Ji Seok instigated this,

529
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:16,592
what will happen to him?

530
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:19,892
I'll be done for if Goo Ha Na's memory comes back.

531
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,230
If Goo Ji Seok is ruined too,

532
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:24,271
I might really be left without anyone on my side.

533
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:28,301
(Head Director's Office)

534
00:28:30,741 --> 00:28:32,241
You won't be able to take down Hyesung Tour.

535
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,142
- What are you saying? - Jin Goo said he found evidence.

536
00:28:35,342 --> 00:28:36,741
Evidence that you're behind all of this.

537
00:28:37,951 --> 00:28:39,711
You were so sure of yourself.

538
00:28:40,182 --> 00:28:42,780
Hyesung Tour won't go down if this deal falls through.

539
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:43,822
It'll be you.

540
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:45,951
I'm glad I didn't take your side.

541
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,862
I guess he hasn't gotten that evidence yet.

542
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:50,592
It wouldn't be this quiet if he had.

543
00:28:51,291 --> 00:28:54,162
So, will he be getting that evidence when they meet tomorrow or so?

544
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:56,562
I guess you still have a good hunch.

545
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:01,541
Then, I won't have to say any more.

546
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:05,210
- Why are you telling me this? - What do you think?

547
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,342
You want to switch over from Hwang Jin Goo's side to mine.

548
00:29:08,842 --> 00:29:12,051
Why? Did Goo Ha Na push your buttons or something?

549
00:29:12,582 --> 00:29:15,082
At 2pm tomorrow at Hojin Rent-A-Car.

550
00:29:15,751 --> 00:29:17,922
He's going to meet the president and get evidence.

551
00:29:18,592 --> 00:29:19,852
The evidence that you instigated this.

552
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,740
- Thank you. - Thank you.

553
00:29:35,741 --> 00:29:36,801
Bye.

554
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:38,971
- Eun Chong looks so cute. - Yes.

555
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:43,311
My daughter is bleeding dry each day,

556
00:29:43,312 --> 00:29:45,812
but that wench is full of smiles every day.

557
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:50,422
That wench has to be found out as a fake to save my daughter.

558
00:29:51,152 --> 00:29:53,451
But I can't reveal it on purpose.

559
00:29:55,662 --> 00:29:58,691
Why didn't I think of going through her room?

560
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,862
A genetic test?

561
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,341
Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na.

562
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,510
(Shin Yeo Jin and Goo Ha Na are blood-related.)

563
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,812
They are blood-related?

564
00:30:49,382 --> 00:30:52,551
What a meticulously forged document.

565
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:56,652
Why is she keeping it? Hasn't it been put to use?

566
00:31:00,622 --> 00:31:01,691
What are you doing?

567
00:31:02,521 --> 00:31:03,622
What?

568
00:31:06,362 --> 00:31:08,501
Did you just go through my room?

569
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,531
That's nonsense.

570
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:14,301
I was looking for your lost photo...

571
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,902
to prove Se Young's innocence.

572
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:25,182
Why do you treasure it so much?

573
00:31:25,382 --> 00:31:28,922
The document scientifically proves Mom and I are biologically related.

574
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:31,491
- It's only right to cherish it. - What?

575
00:31:31,622 --> 00:31:32,751
"Biologically related?"

576
00:31:34,021 --> 00:31:35,122
What is it?

577
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:41,261
Do you truly believe you're Yu Jin?

578
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,531
Are you being deceived as well?

579
00:32:44,021 --> 00:32:46,132
(Cinderella Game)

580
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,300
Where could that information have leaked from?

581
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,131
You won't get the answer by asking me.

582
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:52,331
About Yu Jin and Ms. Goo Ha Na?

583
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:53,701
Make sure to move quietly.

584
00:32:53,801 --> 00:32:56,401
I'll look into Goo Ha Na's siblings.

585
00:32:56,402 --> 00:32:59,611
Yu Jin drank spoiled milk?

586
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:02,081
Why don't you ask questions after our meal?

587
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:03,841
I must figure it out.

588
00:33:03,842 --> 00:33:05,581
Apologize to my siblings.

589
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:07,921
You're Goo Ha Na the moment you step into the office.

590
00:33:07,922 --> 00:33:10,352
- My subordinate. - I'm Yoon Yu Jin.

591
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,691
My daughter,

592
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:16,991
Ma Kwang Sook,

593
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,961
says she will haunt this house as a ghost.

594
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:21,661
It was short,

595
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:23,932
but you were the best husband.

596
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,131
You want to quit working at the post office...

597
00:33:26,132 --> 00:33:27,530
and become a distiller?

598
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,770
Why on earth?

599
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:30,571
Let's forget being my brothers-in-law...

600
00:33:30,572 --> 00:33:32,770
and call each other friends. Okay?

601
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:33,911
(February 2025)

602
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:35,842
- What will you do about this? - It's just money!

603
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,011
I'll give it to you.

604
00:33:37,642 --> 00:33:38,881
You're despicable.

605
00:33:38,882 --> 00:33:40,281
You coward.

606
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:42,280
Give me a break.

607
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:43,281
(The next chapter in her life begins.)

608
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:46,491
I want to start the next chapter of my life.

609
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,991
You are perfect as the Eagle Brewery's master.

610
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:50,362
The taste of the alcohol...

611
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:52,061
is impeccable.

612
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:54,392
(For Eagle Brothers)
