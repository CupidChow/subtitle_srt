1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,280
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,580
All right.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,580
Be careful.

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,720
Let's go.

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,420
("Goo's Parents Were the Victims
of Shin's Murder Instigation")

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,690
What is this?

9
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,730
The victims of the car accident
instigated by the chairwoman were...

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,000
our parents?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,270
Eun Chong's here.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,570
Uncle Ji Chang, Auntie Ji Eun.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,050
Did Chairwoman Shin cause...

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,120
our parents' car accident?

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,450
Is Chairwoman Shin the enemy...

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,290
who killed our parents?

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,690
Did you know about this?

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:57,360
- Tell me now!
- Ha Na!

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,200
Did you know or didn't you? Darn it.

20
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,800
Stop it. Eun Chong can hear you.

21
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,570
You knew that,
yet you chose to bring him here?

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,910
Take him and leave immediately.

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,980
Okay. Give me just 30 minutes.

24
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,650
Please don't let him find out.

25
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:27,230
Are Uncle Ji Chang
and Auntie Ji Eun mad?

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,870
How did this happen to our parents?

27
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,510
What's wrong?

28
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,280
What is it?

29
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,950
Ji Seok, did you also know?

30
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,320
- Know what?
- Did Chairwoman Shin...

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,290
cause our parents' car accident?

32
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,390
And did she do this intentionally
to take his business?

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,130
Did you also know about this?

34
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,130
Yes.

35
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,140
Yet you took her side
and decided to bring Eun Chong here?

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,010
You're both out of your minds.

37
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,150
Mom, Dad...

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,950
I feel so bad for them.

39
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,120
How did you know?

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,590
There was a news article.
Take a look.

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,630
("Goo's Parents Were the Victims
of Shin's Murder Instigation")

42
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,730
I have a favor to ask.

43
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,540
Can you let Eun Chong stay
at your place today?

44
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,410
I thought you brought him home.

45
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,010
I'll explain in person.

46
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,050
Bye.

47
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,090
I heard everything.
What about Eun Chong?

48
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,630
I can't send him back to that place,

49
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,660
so he'll stay
at Mr. Hwang's place tonight.

50
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,740
Come here, Eun Chong.

51
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,250
Eun Chong, you'll have to stay
in Mr. Hwang's place tonight.

52
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,420
Why?

53
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,350
It's a secret operation.

54
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,920
"A secret operation?"

55
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,890
Come on in.

56
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,860
- Goodness, Eun Chong.
- Hello.

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,300
- Hey.
- Hello.

58
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,130
Welcome, Eun Chong.

59
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,470
This little boy is
going through so much.

60
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,870
Is it okay for him to suddenly stay
at an unfamiliar place?

61
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,970
It's Yali!

62
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,510
I'm sorry I suddenly had to do this.

63
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,310
Feel free to call me
if he gets antsy at night.

64
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,810
So, what's going on?

65
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,120
I'll tell you, Mom.

66
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,120
Okay, then.

67
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,550
Can we talk for a minute?

68
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,820
I couldn't make myself
tell my siblings...

69
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,130
about our parents' accident.

70
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,860
I thought I'd tell them later,

71
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,900
but they found out
through a news article.

72
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:20,330
How was the article dropped?

73
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,970
The chairwoman said
she'd publish a correction.

74
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,300
I have no idea.

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,640
And it happened just before
I brought Eun Chong home.

76
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,840
Did you tell the chairwoman?

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,110
No, can you tell her?

78
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,680
- I have to go to my siblings.
- Okay.

79
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,920
You probably
can't take him home now,

80
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,550
but he can stay at my place.

81
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,220
That's what I'll tell
the chairwoman.

82
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,620
Okay.

83
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,720
Hey, Jin Goo.

84
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,130
There was a news article?

85
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,900
Okay. I'm hanging up.

86
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
There was a news article
on Ha Na's parents' accident.

87
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,070
This is it, Ms. Chairwoman.

88
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,140
("Goo's Parents Were the Victims
of Shin's Murder Instigation")

89
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:10,310
This is odd. It was published
right after Eun Chong left...

90
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,750
for Ha Na's place
as if they had been waiting.

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,490
Someone must've done this
intentionally.

92
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,360
Move more quickly
and find those loan sharks.

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,060
Without evidence, whatever I say...

94
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,760
and the correction I send out
won't have any effect.

95
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,000
("Goo's Parents Were the Victims
of Shin's Murder Instigation")

96
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,270
We dropped a bomb over that family,

97
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,670
so they'd fight each other,
then ruin themselves.

98
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,140
What if Aunt Yeo Jin
gets suspicious of us?

99
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,670
Are you sure
the reporter is on our side?

100
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,380
If the reporter says...

101
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,110
many anonymous reports came in,
how is she going to find us?

102
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,120
Then, will Eun Chong
return home today?

103
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,190
Why would they accept
their enemy's blood?

104
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,560
How can you deceive us
and bring Eun Chong home?

105
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,260
You were against having him here
because he was our enemy's blood.

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
So, why are you suddenly
acting like this?

107
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,270
Are you going to accept him
now that you got the revenge?

108
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,440
Why do you two
get to run everything?

109
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,070
Aren't we their children, too?

110
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,640
You two would've felt troubled
if you heard about it,

111
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,980
so I couldn't say anything.

112
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,080
We aren't kids. We had to know
no matter how troubled we'd be.

113
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,660
I'm greatly disappointed in you.

114
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,130
How can you sneak in
the blood of our enemy...

115
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,630
who didn't just take our parents' business
but also their lives?

116
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,370
- I'm sorry.
- That's enough.

117
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,930
You're becoming more like Ha Na.

118
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,740
What does he mean anyway?

119
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,370
I don't care that he lived with us.

120
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,540
This is just wrong.

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,820
Chairwoman Shin killed
our mom and dad!

122
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,190
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

123
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,860
Ji Seok had to lie because of me.

124
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,920
We didn't want to hurt you.

125
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,200
Cut your ties
with everyone in that family.

126
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,430
You need to get over Se Young.

127
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,600
And Ha Na, cut ties with Eun Chong.

128
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,470
Will it be Eun Chong or us?
Make your choice.

129
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,110
Why won't you say anything?

130
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,350
Are you going to choose Eun Chong?

131
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:24,320
- No.
- Then, what?

132
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,420
Tell us you'll cut ties with him!

133
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,820
Okay. I won't meet him anymore.

134
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,960
Do you mean that?

135
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,630
- It's a promise.
- Okay.

136
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,130
If you don't keep your promise,

137
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,070
I won't see you anymore.

138
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,140
I also won't see you anymore.

139
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,940
Let's go, Ji Seok.

140
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,010
You were against Eun Chong anyway,
so just go back to that time.

141
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,120
Mom... Dad...

142
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,260
I had no idea...

143
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,790
Mom and Dad died
such an unfair death.

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,170
It looks like
the article was published...

145
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,580
in the nick of time as Eun Chong
went back to Ms. Goo's place.

146
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,610
Do you have an idea
who could've done this?

147
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,710
It's probably Myung Ji.

148
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,850
I can look into this.

149
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,990
- Is Eun Chong all right?
- Yes.

150
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,920
There's a cat he can play with,

151
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,820
and he's on good terms
with my mom, too.

152
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,730
Thank you.

153
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,130
(Sung Ho)

154
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,330
- Hello?
- I saw the news article.

155
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:49,130
I found out through a reporter...

156
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,600
that Myung Ji was the informant.

157
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,710
Okay.

158
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,640
Call me as soon as you have
an update on Yu Jin.

159
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,010
Okay.

160
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,450
Myung Ji was involved in everything.

161
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,730
I should've noticed
your true colors a long time ago.

162
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,700
- Why isn't Eun Chong home?
- I wonder.

163
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,400
And Yeo Jin is quiet, too.

164
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,510
Maybe they didn't see the article.

165
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,780
They must have.
It was up on the main page.

166
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,510
They would never accept the blood
of their parents' murderer.

167
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,420
Sung Ho was right.

168
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,390
Should I call Eun Chong and ask?

169
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,920
Ask him what?

170
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,690
We were wondering
if he was happy at Ha Na's place.

171
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,800
This article came out, so he had to leave
and go to Jin Goo's place.

172
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,240
My gosh.
Who published an article like this?

173
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,540
What is it?

174
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,340
You did.

175
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,340
Someone who hates me,

176
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,440
someone who probably wishes
I were dead.

177
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,120
Gosh, these people sound evil.

178
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,950
You shouldn't leave him
at Jin Goo's place, though.

179
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,820
You should bring him home, then...

180
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,730
More reporters will swarm here
because of this cursed article.

181
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,030
How can he stay here?

182
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,300
That's true.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,130
Just wait.

184
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,840
I'll tear you into pieces
and destroy you.

185
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,860
You killed Yu Jin, didn't you?

186
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,130
- Why did you kill her?
- No, I...

187
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,730
Did you think you'd live...

188
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,800
after deceiving me for 20 years?

189
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,740
Die. Die!

190
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,830
Was that a dream?

191
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,330
Was Yeo Jin in here?

192
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,280
"Apologize?"
You're lying through your teeth!

193
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,520
Are you scared
you'll lose your family?

194
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,090
Do not resign or apologize.

195
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,690
Keep holding out.

196
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,890
Victims of your corporate raids
still live in that pain today.

197
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,060
It's your turn
to put up with that torture.

198
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,930
Do you know how tough
our childhood was because of you?

199
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,230
Ha Na became the breadwinner,

200
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,140
quit school,
and went out to make money.

201
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
Ji Seok took up manual labor...

202
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,170
Chairwoman Shin. Please hear me out.

203
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:21,210
Chairwoman Shin!
Please let me talk to you!

204
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,620
- Please, Chairwoman Shin!
- Stop it!

205
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,050
She needs to know...

206
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:29,890
she's why life was
miserable and tough for us.

207
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:55,780
We spent all night thinking.

208
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,720
About how we'll get revenge
for our parents.

209
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,220
And we came to a conclusion.

210
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,320
Our success would be
the biggest way to get revenge.

211
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,030
We're now done
venting our anger emotionally.

212
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,630
I won't waste my energy
doing that anymore.

213
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,230
You went to America
to become a success and get revenge.

214
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,240
You two got the first revenge,

215
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,070
so we'd succeed as business owners
and get the second revenge.

216
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,910
I'll start the second and the third stores
for my tteokbokki place...

217
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,650
and turn the brand
into a global success.

218
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,210
I want to be a fashion designer.

219
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,650
I'll launch my own brand
with the money to go study abroad.

220
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,420
Okay. Do whatever you want to.

221
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,350
I'll support you.

222
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,920
I thought you two would run over
to Chairwoman Shin right away,

223
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,960
but you came up
with such commendable ideas.

224
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:45,960
You're right. True revenge is
for us to live great lives.

225
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,430
That's what our parents
would want from us.

226
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,040
But still, you can't take
Eun Chong back.

227
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,310
Okay.

228
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,710
Who's that?

229
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,820
Why are you here again?

230
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,120
I came to explain the news article.

231
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,620
- Leave.
- Leave.

232
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,230
Come inside.

233
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,390
- Ha Na.
- Ha Na.

234
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,290
Aren't you two also curious...

235
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,130
about what happened
to our parents' accident?

236
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,820
You'll be cursed by fate.

237
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,650
I'll never forgive you
until the day I die.

238
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,390
Keep apologizing until you die,

239
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,530
both to our parents and us.

240
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,000
You were only trying to scare them?

241
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,340
You broke the perfectly fine brakes
and caused that accident!

242
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,080
I didn't know
they'd tamper with the brakes.

243
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,280
You didn't know?

244
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,680
Is that your excuse?

245
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,220
Our parents passed away
because you told those people...

246
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,180
to scare them.

247
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,820
It doesn't sound like
you're here to apologize.

248
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,820
You're still looking for ways
to evade the responsibility.

249
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:21,930
You came to end the discussion
by pretending to explain and apologize!

250
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,460
You're right. I don't believe you.

251
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,330
Everything is a lie
until you can prove it.

252
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,330
Ha Na and Ji Seok,
don't believe her.

253
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,940
I also stayed quiet to this day
because I had no way to prove it,

254
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,140
and that only caused more trouble.

255
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,910
You paid people...

256
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,840
to threaten my dad
to take his business.

257
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,950
It's on you if my parents
passed away in that process.

258
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,480
Who are you trying to blame?

259
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,280
Do you think
you can get out of this...

260
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,790
just because
you didn't actually kill them?

261
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,320
"I didn't know.
I didn't tell them to kill them."

262
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,560
Those excuses won't free you
from the responsibility!

263
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,130
I'm not trying
to avoid this like that.

264
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:59,230
I did this out of greed,
and everything is my fault.

265
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,500
I came to talk to you today...

266
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,470
to come clean
about everything I did wrong.

267
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,640
I don't expect you to forgive me.

268
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,380
You caused our parents' death,

269
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,680
but you didn't even remember.

270
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,180
When I went to beg you
to let us keep the factory,

271
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,980
you turned me down coldly
and looked away.

272
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,290
You weren't even sorry.

273
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,790
Back then,

274
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,590
I was a fool.

275
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,300
I had to think it wasn't my fault
to keep going on,

276
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,730
so I did my best
to ignore it and forget it.

277
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,970
But that accident...

278
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,670
never left my mind.

279
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,270
What about bribing the police
to end it as a simple car accident?

280
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,610
Was that someone else, too?

281
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,080
It was me.

282
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,520
I was frightened and scared,

283
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,980
so I denied everything to this day.

284
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,250
I thought everything would end
the moment I acknowledged it.

285
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,820
I had lost my daughter,
and my husband had left me,

286
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,830
so Hyesung was
all that was left in my life.

287
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,630
Since that day, I have been busy
trying to save and protect myself.

288
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,270
In the end, it all led to this.

289
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:14,970
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,580
I will live the rest of my life
apologizing to all of you.

291
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,380
It's already too late.

292
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,250
I know I can't be forgiven.

293
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:29,520
You can choose to believe it or not,

294
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,460
but I wanted to share
the truth on my side.

295
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,960
I wanted...

296
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,360
to pluck up my courage
for the first time.

297
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,150
Kneeling before you...

298
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,820
won't bring your late parents back,

299
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,060
but I...

300
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,490
truly apologize.

301
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,600
We've been looking for the people
who carried out her deeds.

302
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,640
Once we find them,
you'll be able to discern...

303
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,640
if she's telling the truth.

304
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,570
Myung Ji was the informant
for the news article.

305
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,970
I thought so.

306
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,180
Are you done with the audit?

307
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,910
Only Se Young remains.

308
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:03,110
We found evidence of embezzlement
during her time at Hyesung Tour.

309
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,420
She embezzled
a total of one million dollars.

310
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,550
It'll have an impact on you
when this is exposed.

311
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,990
She's your niece,
and this is your money,

312
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,590
so I'll let you choose
how you'll deal with her.

313
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:22,670
The news article had
no effect on her.

314
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,200
She took him to Hwang Jin Goo's place
instead of bringing him home.

315
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,810
Man, I didn't think of that.

316
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,280
I dropped a bomb,
but it wasn't strong enough.

317
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,940
Do you have anything more powerful?

318
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,580
But first, let's cut to the chase.

319
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,120
All right.

320
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,860
You need to stop taking so much.

321
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,590
It's not easy to live as a dad...

322
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,230
who sent his children
and wife abroad.

323
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,200
Have you found Sung Ho?

324
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,670
I didn't see any entry records
under Yoon Sung Ho's name.

325
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,970
What are you talking about?
He's in Korea!

326
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,600
So, I looked into it,

327
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,370
and he returned under an alias,
as Han Min Su.

328
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,310
His English name was Richard Han.

329
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,350
"Richard Han?"

330
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,320
- He's a detective?
- Yes, ma'am.

331
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,220
His name is Cho Byung Jin,
a detective at Anju Police Station.

332
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,130
You said the police seemed to be
involved in Yu Jin's accident.

333
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,700
Yes, but he wasn't in charge...

334
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,270
of her hit-and-run accident.

335
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,630
Is that so?

336
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,640
Why is she going around
meeting a detective?

337
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,370
I couldn't find out that much.

338
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,040
- But there was something odd.
- What was it?

339
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,080
His life seemed unlikely
with a detective's salary.

340
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,510
He currently lives in a penthouse,

341
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,280
owns two foreign cars,

342
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,420
and his wife and children are
studying abroad in New Zealand.

343
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,420
He may be from a rich family.

344
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,120
Well, his assets have increased rapidly
since six years ago.

345
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:57,260
Six years ago?
That's around Yu Jin's accident.

346
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,660
Yes, ma'am.

347
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:03,670
He must've done in-person transactions
with Myung Ji.

348
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,270
- Dig his back. Put a tail on him.
- Yes, ma'am.

349
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,410
- It's me.
- Yes.

350
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:20,320
Continue Se Young's audit
according to the law.

351
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,620
I shall.

352
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,490
Did Chairwoman Shin
finally decide to lose Se Young?

353
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,730
I was acquitted?

354
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,000
I admitted to using the funds.
How was I acquitted?

355
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,330
An anonymous informant...

356
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:39,870
provided evidence that Chairwoman Shin
misappropriated the funds.

357
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,270
"An anonymous informant?"

358
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,410
All right, then.

359
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,910
"An anonymous informant."

360
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:51,450
Gosh, these are my favorite snacks.

361
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,480
Call me and tell me
if you want to eat anything.

362
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,190
- I'll bring them over.
- Okay.

363
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,220
I heard I had to stay
at Mr. Hwang's place now.

364
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,260
It's only for a while.

365
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,900
It's a secret operation
with Auntie Ha Na, right?

366
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,800
Yes.

367
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,900
I'm glad he won't get bored,
thanks to Yali.

368
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,840
Yes, thank you.

369
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,140
Please take good care of him.

370
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,370
Don't worry.

371
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,780
If I disappointed you in any way,
I didn't mean to.

372
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,940
Please don't be angry.

373
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,850
I have so much...

374
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,250
to thank and apologize for
both you and Jin Goo.

375
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,120
All right.

376
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,120
Is it true that
she instigated the car accident?

377
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,730
She should put out
a statement as soon as possible.

378
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,230
What if Eun Chong finds out
after he grows up?

379
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,000
Let me bring
something for you to drink.

380
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:52,280
- Eun Chong, you got lots of gifts.
- Yes.

381
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,340
Ms. Bang Ul!

382
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:04,190
- Ms. Chairwoman, the police called.
- Yes?

383
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,860
An anonymous informant
turned in evidence...

384
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,330
for the misappropriation of funds
during the fake daughter project.

385
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,730
It looks like
you'll be charged instead.

386
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,800
What should I do?

387
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,730
Eun Chong may get exposed.

388
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,770
I can't hide that
he's my grandson forever.

389
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,670
I need to pay for my own crimes.

390
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,740
I'm sorry for making you do this.

391
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,250
It's all right.

392
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,980
Have you considered
staying at the company?

393
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,680
There's something I want to revert,

394
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,490
so I'll finish that and leave.

395
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,390
What is it?

396
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,300
Congratulations,
Chairman Goo Ji Seok.

397
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,900
People may be watching.
You could've come later.

398
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,030
Who cares?

399
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,600
Mom told me everything.

400
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,640
Are we on the same side now?

401
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,310
Are you changing horses
from Chairwoman Shin to me for good?

402
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,980
She resigned.

403
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:04,450
You're the only one for me now.

404
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:07,020
You're probably
going between me and her.

405
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,450
You won't give up
on Eun Chong, either.

406
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:14,260
If you side with me,
you'll be with Eun Chong, too.

407
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,860
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to bring him up as my successor.

408
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,430
But I have to go abroad
for about a year.

409
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,170
Why?

410
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,170
I can't believe
Director Goo became the chairman.

411
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,170
He must've come here
with that intention.

412
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,010
So, do you really think
the chairwoman instigated murder?

413
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,710
No way.
I'm sure it was a false report.

414
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,960
Hello? You've reached Yoon Se Young.

415
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,860
The investigation room?

416
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,130
I thought the audit was over.

417
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:57,270
Look forward to it.
This is just the preview.

418
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,340
Are you saying
you have something else?

419
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,540
What I do know is...

420
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,470
you'll miss the day
when you were questioned for power abuse.

421
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,250
This is a list of many illegal activities
you conducted...

422
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,650
while you were at Hyesung Tour,

423
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,090
including unfair transactions
and embezzlement.

424
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,860
Do you admit to everything?

425
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,930
Are you saying I did all this?

426
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,870
- Where's your evidence?
- Keep reading.

427
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,870
The computer access log
when you tried to manipulate the fund,

428
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,540
records of document forgery,
internal testimonies, and more.

429
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,110
Forcing subcontractors
to provide kickbacks,

430
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,650
inflating the tour price,

431
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,680
leaking funds
through a shell corporation,

432
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:49,390
and claiming false expenses.
Should I go on?

433
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,990
You did your best
trying to drag me into this.

434
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,300
You've embezzled
over a million dollars.

435
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,360
- It wasn't me.
- Then, was it your mom?

436
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,570
Or was there another accomplice?

437
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,970
This is just a ridiculous story.

438
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,210
Do whatever you want to.

439
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,350
Showing that attitude
won't get rid of your crime.

440
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,550
Haven't you learned anything
from seeing Chairwoman Shin?

441
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:23,350
The crimes you commit will return to you
like a boomerang,

442
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,220
but many times larger.

443
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,520
I won't just sit around
and let you do this.

444
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:32,200
Why? Are you calling your mom?

445
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,200
You aren't a kid anymore.
Stop calling your mom for help.

446
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,400
Look forward...

447
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,570
to how you'll end.

448
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,390
She found out everything
you told me to do! What do I do?

449
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,360
What are you talking about?

450
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,330
I was under audit for embezzlement.

451
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,260
She had all the evidence!

452
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,200
I should've killed that brat first.

453
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,330
Run to Ji Seok.

454
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,030
Ask him to destroy the evidence.

455
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,040
- How about the head director?
- No, thank you.

456
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,170
Then, the president of the hotel.

457
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,840
- No, thank you.
- Why not?

458
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,780
Do you plan to leave Hyesung?

459
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,610
I wanted to,
but there was something I had to do.

460
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,080
Will you let me do what I want?

461
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:27,950
Tell me what it is.

462
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,390
What is it?

463
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,890
Please leave.

464
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:51,780
- Tell me what it is.
- I like the travel agency.

465
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,250
Please revive Hyesung Tour.

466
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,980
Under one condition.

467
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,650
Turn
the mother-daughter therapy tour...

468
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,450
into a success
with the hotel guests.

469
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,790
- I'll consider your request after.
- That sounds great.

470
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,460
Please excuse me.

471
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,460
It probably wasn't easy
to betray Chairwoman Shin.

472
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,600
She'd feel deeply shocked
and betrayed if she found out.

473
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:23,470
Thank you for helping us.

474
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,940
How did you know
"no rain, no flowers?"

475
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,710
I just gave her a hint.

476
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,910
As I told Ha Na,

477
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:33,650
I thought this was
all thanks to your parents.

478
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,390
All thanks to my parents?

479
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,800
Is something going on?

480
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,510
Ms. Yoon was placed under audit
for embezzlement.

481
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,180
"Embezzlement?"

482
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,480
Will you help me?

483
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,120
How much did you embezzle?

484
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,790
About a million dollars.

485
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,430
You took a lot of money
from that tiny travel agency.

486
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,500
That's enough
to put you behind bars.

487
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,760
- You'll send me to prison?
- I can't do that.

488
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,470
Destroy the evidence first.

489
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,970
Let's talk again
when the audit report comes out.

490
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,040
Promise that you'll protect me.

491
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,210
I won't destroy you, Se Young.

492
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,510
I just have
to put my trust in you, right?

493
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,090
Eun Chong slept well,
ate well, and played well.

494
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,960
But he was disappointed
you wouldn't pick up your phone.

495
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,130
I promised my siblings that
I'd never see him again.

496
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,900
Can you do that?

497
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,070
I still miss him now.

498
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:01,240
Then, you should meet him,
even if you have to do it secretly.

499
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,080
Chairwoman Shin came yesterday,

500
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:11,080
explained our parents' accident,
and apologized to us.

501
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,050
Was there a misunderstanding?

502
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
According to her, yes.

503
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,950
But there's no evidence.

504
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,030
She says she'll prove it
as the truth, so I'll wait.

505
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,600
I guess that was
a tiny step forward.

506
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,830
Yes, a little.

507
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:32,670
So, what brings you here?

508
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,280
A million dollars?

509
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,840
When did she embezzle
that much money?

510
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,710
She used all kinds
of illegal methods and expediencies.

511
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,650
Se Young's mom will
try her best to handle this,

512
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,120
but it won't be easy.

513
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,390
I asked him to destroy the evidence.

514
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,860
What did he say?

515
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,630
He said he wouldn't destroy me.

516
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,360
Give him your trust for now.

517
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,800
Ms. Yoon Se Young.

518
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,070
- Yes?
- We're the police.

519
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:11,310
You're under arrest for violating...

520
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,910
the Act on the Aggravated Punishment
of Specific Economic Crimes.

521
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,910
What are you talking about?

522
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,450
You were charged with embezzling...

523
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,580
over a million dollars
of company funds.

524
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,750
No, that's a misunderstanding.
I never did that.

525
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,190
We already have
all the related evidence.

526
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,890
You saw everything
in the investigation room.

527
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,130
Ha Na, you.

528
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,990
The court issued an arrest warrant
citing concerns...

529
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,460
over your possible attempt
to flee and destroy evidence.

530
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,100
You're under arrest right now.

531
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:37,970
No, it wasn't me. No.

532
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:41,100
No!

533
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,980
I told you to look forward to it.

534
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,510
Goodbye, Yoon Se Young.

535
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,180
Goo Ha Na, you!

536
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,390
Let go of me. Let go!

537
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,820
Let go of me!

538
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,120
Let go!

539
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:01,790
Come with us.

540
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,790
Let me make a phone call.

541
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,860
I have to call my mom.

542
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,200
I have to call her!

543
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,700
Goo Ha Na! Let go of me!

544
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:19,510
Let go of me! Darn it!

545
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,380
Come on!

546
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,080
Ji Seok.

547
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,530
Ji Seok, please help me.

548
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,700
Goo Ji Seok!

549
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,510
Let go of me!

550
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,040
Goo Ji Seok!

551
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,930
(Cinderella Game)

552
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:46,000
You. Did you forget
how you got that position?

553
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,900
I have good news
and bad news for you.

554
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,340
I'll lock you
and your daughter up in prison.

555
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,940
I used you for my revenge.

556
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,840
Did you think
I really had feelings for you?

557
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,740
Who knows how I'll change my mind?

558
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,340
I can't believe
you and I faced a day like this.

559
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,550
I can be honest with you, right?

560
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,910
You can do as you like, Ha Na.

561
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,850
I'll be here for you.
