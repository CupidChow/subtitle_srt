1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,010
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,140
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,990
(Episode 99)

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:18,760
Where's your mom?

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,110
Get out.

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:42,550
- No.
- Get out of here.

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,180
- Get out.
- Let go of me!

9
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:45,950
- Go!
- No!

10
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,490
Get out of here!

11
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,320
You just destroyed the evidence.

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,930
What did you think this was?

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,900
I was just burning my stuff.

14
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,840
No...

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,280
No.

16
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,710
No.

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,920
No.

18
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:25,560
What am I going to do?

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,730
No. What now? No...

20
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,830
Are you satisfied now that
you've destroyed the evidence...

21
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,830
proving you killed my daughter?

22
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,430
What evidence?

23
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,930
Don't you feel bad for Yu Jin?

24
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,400
I would feel bad
if I really did something wrong.

25
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,570
- But I...
- Enough!

26
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Admit to what you did just once.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,050
Just apologize to Yu Jin...

28
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,420
with all your heart...

29
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,090
at least once.

30
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,160
That was the only evidence
that could help Yu Jin get justice.

31
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,830
I'm sorry, Yu Jin...

32
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,400
You don't seem well,
so you should stop here.

33
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,700
Help her get up.

34
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,240
Aunt Yeo Jin...

35
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,680
Get your hand off me.

36
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,350
Are you staying quiet,
knowing what your mother is like?

37
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,790
Do you want to live like her?

38
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,160
Yeo Jin, what's wrong?

39
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,890
What happened to the notebook?

40
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,130
Yeo Jin must be
too fixated on the notebook.

41
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,770
I burnt something else,
but she claimed it was the...

42
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,000
You burnt the notebook?

43
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,470
- She did.
- It wasn't a notebook.

44
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,570
You might as well rip apart
that evil woman's mouth!

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,340
Can you stand up?

46
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,080
Do you think you'll be fine...

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,420
now that you've avoided
human punishment?

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,920
If you continue
to evade your responsibility,

49
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,520
the universe will punish you.

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,330
I won't let you...

51
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,960
or your daughter live.

52
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,980
I'm now done
destroying the evidence for good.

53
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,050
We're free now.

54
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,250
Pack up your stuff.

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,890
We're leaving the country
as soon as possible.

56
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,010
Today is such a happy day.

57
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,010
Eun Chong, your English is great,
thanks to those lessons.

58
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,180
Yes, I feel nice today. Nice.

59
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:38,880
I feel nice, too.

60
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,220
Me, too.

61
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,360
What did you think about Eun Chong
and my secret operation?

62
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,490
It was very touching in a new way.

63
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,700
I was very grateful
to you and your friends, too.

64
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,030
I'll be the flower boy
when Auntie Ha Na and you marry.

65
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,940
I can do well
because I've already practiced once.

66
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,910
Yes, you're right.

67
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,050
You've prepared a wedding before,
so you must be an expert.

68
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,280
You can lead everything.

69
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:11,850
Well, the theme is different,

70
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,950
so it's as good as my first time.

71
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,590
You aren't carrying a baby, are you?

72
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,920
- What?
- Nice one.

73
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,130
You'll see a baby soon.

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,860
What are you saying
to a child like him?

75
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,330
Do you prefer
a younger brother or sister?

76
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,170
I just want lots of siblings.

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,270
No, that can't happen.

78
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,370
We should do good for our nation.

79
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,750
Yes, Mr. Yoon?

80
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,580
Eun Chong is with us.

81
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,920
The chairwoman collapsed?

82
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,830
Why is she sick?

83
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
She doesn't have enough energy.

84
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:05,100
Dr. Hong said
she became completely drained...

85
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,710
in her body and mind
because of excessive stress.

86
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,970
We should keep an eye on her.

87
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,380
She witnessed
the only evidence vanish.

88
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,550
It must've taken a toll
on her psychology.

89
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,680
Is there any other way?

90
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,390
That was the only evidence
that could punish Myung Ji.

91
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,520
The only way now is
for her to turn herself in.

92
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,730
Shouldn't you request
a travel ban on her?

93
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,160
She destroyed the evidence,

94
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,960
so she could end up fleeing.

95
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,400
I talked to the detective.

96
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,430
Se Young must've brought
the notebook from the safe.

97
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,800
Yes.

98
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,840
She even considered dying,
so I thought she'd change her mind,

99
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,240
but she listened to her mom again.

100
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:44,780
She even considered dying?

101
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,310
Yes.

102
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,190
Are you staying quiet,
knowing what your mother is like?

103
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,690
Do you want to live like her?

104
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,130
I can't do this to Aunt Yeo Jin.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Meet with the chairwoman
and pour out everything.

106
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,300
Apologize to her with all your heart
and ask for forgiveness.

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,210
Tell her everything honestly.

108
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,740
It's not for Chairwoman Shin.
It's for your sake.

109
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,410
For my sake?

110
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:29,520
There's an injunction on the house,

111
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,820
so I can't sell it?

112
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,300
Fine. I'll reach out again.

113
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,500
She wasn't just bluffing.

114
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,070
So, she won't even give me
that house...

115
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,000
in exchange
for my 20 years of service?

116
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,910
We lived off her.

117
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,980
You didn't serve her in any way.

118
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,510
- Compared to what we did...
- Just go and get your stuff.

119
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,220
I need to consider
if I'll stay in Korea...

120
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,490
or if I'll go with you.

121
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,200
No matter how much you think,
there's only one answer.

122
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,670
You can't live alone without me.

123
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,340
I lost three million dollars.

124
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,310
But I still have my slush fund,
so I'll be fine.

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,650
What about
Choi Myung Ji's slush fund account?

126
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,550
We're trying to hack into it.

127
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,520
If she destroyed the evidence,

128
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,990
she'd try to flee overseas.

129
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,820
We have to empty out her slush fund
to stop her from leaving.

130
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,960
- Please rush it.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,270
I wanted to tell the elders
that I proposed to you,

132
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,730
but I couldn't say a thing.

133
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,400
You picked the wrong day.

134
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,700
Gosh, that's one thing I regret.

135
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,110
But I'll tell my mom, though.

136
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,580
Do you think she'll be happy?

137
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,610
Actually, this morning,
she told me to get married soon...

138
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,650
if I planned on marrying you anyway.

139
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,750
Really?

140
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,920
Thank you for accepting my proposal.

141
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,520
Thank you for doing it.

142
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,220
I loved it.

143
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,190
You should go and get some rest.

144
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,030
I'll call you.

145
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,500
And this.

146
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,530
Bye, then.

147
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:32,310
Ha Na.

148
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,250
You got flowers?

149
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,580
And a ring?

150
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,920
My gosh. It's beautiful.

151
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,690
Mr. Hwang has such a great taste.

152
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,830
Did he use zirconia
because the gold price went up?

153
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,130
Hey, those are diamonds.

154
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,170
- What?
- Really?

155
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,600
Did you accept that
without realizing it?

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
I thought Ms. Pathetic...

157
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,340
would never marry,
but she found such a great guy.

158
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,070
Congratulations.

159
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,480
I'm not so sure
if you're teasing or celebrating.

160
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,940
Thanks.

161
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,280
So, that guy who was once a jerk
would be my brother-in-law?

162
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,580
I guess we should celebrate
Ha Na's marriage,

163
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,150
but I feel kind of lonely
to think she'll move out.

164
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,620
It's like he's stealing her from us.

165
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,190
- Hey.
- Gosh.

166
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,590
- Stop acting like her plus-one.
- Darn it.

167
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,500
Right. Does Ji Seok know?

168
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,130
Not yet.

169
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,670
Let me surprise him.
Don't call him, okay?

170
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,170
Okay.

171
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,000
Did you really?

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,140
I'm so glad.

173
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,510
We should set the date now.

174
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,640
Mom, you're so impatient.

175
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,350
- I'll come with her tomorrow.
- Okay.

176
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,820
- Jin Goo, are you happy?
- Yes.

177
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,950
There's no bigger blessing
than spending life...

178
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,590
with the one you love.

179
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,790
You'll start glowing soon.

180
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,060
That started a while ago.

181
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
That's true. You began to glow...

182
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,230
as soon as you held her hand.

183
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,800
Who else knows?

184
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,530
Did you tell the chairwoman?

185
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,070
Not yet.

186
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,610
Mom, she collapsed.

187
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,940
Wait, what happened?

188
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,850
I'm done.

189
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,620
Have just one more bite.

190
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,290
You have to eat and get more energy
to punish Myung Ji.

191
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,890
Can we really catch her?

192
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,160
Yu Jin must be watching us
from the other side.

193
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,470
What will she say
when she sees her parents...

194
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,600
looking like this?

195
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,240
I'll just kill Myung Ji...

196
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,510
and go to be with Yu Jin.

197
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,740
You're saying that again.

198
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,150
Yu Jin wouldn't want you to do that.

199
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,220
You must think of Eun Chong.

200
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
How am I going to face him?

201
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,460
I made him call his mother's killer
his little grandma,

202
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,460
and I couldn't lock her up, either.

203
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,530
We could get her to confess.

204
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:06,230
Confess?

205
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,230
It may be a slim chance,
but we have to try.

206
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,840
She burnt the notebook?

207
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,970
I brought...

208
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,010
that notebook and gave it to her.

209
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,480
She must've made you do it.

210
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,310
At first, I refused.

211
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,010
But in the end...

212
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,020
People never change easily.

213
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,250
I'm no different.

214
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,890
This was the result
of you two saving me from the sea.

215
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,760
This happened
because you and your sister saved me.

216
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,960
Do you regret
listening to your mother...

217
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,000
and getting the notebook?

218
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,770
I don't know how I feel.

219
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,870
I want some distance between us,

220
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,280
but I feel scared
and not confident to think...

221
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,010
I'll have to live alone
away from her.

222
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,320
Would it help...

223
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,620
if someone else who wasn't your mom
stayed by your side?

224
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,620
Someone else?

225
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,120
If you need help, I'll be here.

226
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,730
Ha Na said she'd help you, too.

227
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,090
It's the Goo siblings again.

228
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,930
Forget it if you don't want help.

229
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,900
If I had...

230
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:21,210
something I could use
to betray my mom,

231
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,040
could I really do it?

232
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,410
Do you have something
you can use to betray her?

233
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,010
It was an if question.

234
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,820
Thank you.

235
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,690
I always had my eyes on you...

236
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,130
for a very long time.

237
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,530
I'm far from perfect,

238
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,760
so thank you
for taking me in with a warm heart.

239
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,430
Please call me Ha Na from now on.

240
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,570
Should I?

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,170
Ha Na.

242
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,310
Yes, Mother.

243
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,040
My gosh. This is great.

244
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,250
Anyway, I can find
a good date for the two of you.

245
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,650
But who'll walk her in?

246
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:09,290
We'll walk down the aisle
at the same time.

247
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,890
That's a great idea, too.

248
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,860
- Give me a moment.
- Okay.

249
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,300
She's really happy.

250
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,300
I'm glad.

251
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,210
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

252
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:35,950
Jin Goo's dad...

253
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,980
gave me these rings
when he was with us.

254
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,520
I kept these with me
because I wanted to give them...

255
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,820
to my future daughter-in-law.

256
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,430
They'll look great
on your hands, Ha Na.

257
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,570
Can I really have
such precious rings?

258
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,600
You're such a precious person.

259
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,250
These are beautiful.

260
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:15,690
Thank you, Mother.

261
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,090
They look great.

262
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,720
His dad would've been happy
if he were still here.

263
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,500
From now on, you and I can
go to the marketplace...

264
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,800
and the sauna...

265
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,300
and then watch dramas together, too.

266
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:36,240
- Jin Goo, did you tell her?
- No.

267
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,540
How did you know?

268
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,810
Those are on my mom's bucket list.

269
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,910
Really?

270
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,650
I knew you and I spoke
the same language.

271
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,990
I can't let you two
become closer without me.

272
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,690
Your time is over.

273
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:57,190
You two are both mine.

274
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,330
Goodness.

275
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,030
- This is so nice.
- These are so pretty.

276
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,470
Goodness.

277
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,110
Are you sure you can go alone?

278
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,540
I'll try to do this alone.

279
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Okay.

280
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,080
I may arrive
at Aunt Yeo Jin's door...

281
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,780
only to turn back around
due to my lack of courage.

282
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,950
But still,

283
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,320
I'll try.

284
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,720
You've done pretty much everything
if you get to her place.

285
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,390
You can do this.

286
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,740
- Mr. Yoon.
- Yes?

287
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,440
How's the chairwoman?

288
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,270
She barely eats.

289
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,970
I'm worried.

290
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:46,640
And Se Young is here.

291
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,580
She looked hesitant outside,

292
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:51,980
so I came in with her.

293
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,290
Se Young.

294
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,300
What brings you here?

295
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,600
I know it's too late,

296
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,100
but I wanted to apologize
to you and Aunt Yeo Jin.

297
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
- Come to the study.
- Okay.

298
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,660
- You're here.
- Hello.

299
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,060
How's the chairwoman?

300
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,600
I heard she wasn't eating well.

301
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,100
Yes, she only has
a few bites of porridge.

302
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,970
Gosh. I made some pine nut porridge.

303
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,540
I'm not sure if she'll eat some.

304
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,140
Se Young is here.

305
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,950
She is?

306
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,480
Your aunt isn't doing well.

307
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,820
I'm sorry.
It's because of my mom and me.

308
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,120
Are you here to apologize
for that time?

309
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,690
Yes.

310
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,460
I know it's too late,
but I wanted to be honest...

311
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,640
You came to apologize for lying
at this point in time?

312
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,800
- Yeo Jin.
- Did your mom send you here?

313
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,640
Did she tell you to spy on me?

314
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:25,280
She doesn't know that I'm here.

315
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,020
Aunt Yeo Jin, Uncle Sung Ho.

316
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,020
I'm so sorry.

317
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,160
I lied when you lost Yu Jin.

318
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,290
You should sit down, too.

319
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,300
All right.
Let me hear this from you.

320
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,030
Why did you lie...

321
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
when you knew
Yu Jin was on the boat?

322
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,070
At first, I was just scared.

323
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,810
Yu Jin and I got on that boat...

324
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,350
while Uncle Sung Ho was gone.

325
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,620
It was like a joke.

326
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,790
I thought
we'd hop on it just briefly.

327
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,990
We played hide-and-seek on the boat.

328
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,020
Then, Yu Jin...

329
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,700
slipped down the stairs
into the cabin.

330
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,170
I shook her, but she didn't move.

331
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,480
I didn't realize it back then,

332
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,610
but she must've hit her head
and lost her consciousness briefly.

333
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,720
I got scared and went out
to look for Uncle Sung Ho.

334
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,320
But in that while,
the boat had disappeared.

335
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,560
You should've told him right away!

336
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,130
I was too frightened.

337
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:51,630
Yu Jin lost consciousness,

338
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,830
so I thought she could've been dead.

339
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,830
I was afraid I did that to her.

340
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,410
After a day or two,

341
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,970
I couldn't bring it up anymore.

342
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,080
Your mom told you
to stay quiet, didn't she?

343
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,910
She told you to keep lying, right?

344
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,150
Answer me.

345
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,680
Did she make you do that?

346
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:18,120
I'm so sorry.

347
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,890
I adored you like you were Yu Jin,

348
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:24,030
but you betrayed me instead.

349
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,100
What went through your mind
when you called me your aunt...

350
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,230
with a smile on your face?

351
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,200
What were you thinking
as you enjoyed your life...

352
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,370
in Yu Jin's place?

353
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,340
Did you and your mom conspire...

354
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,070
to find ways to be more prosperous
and to make sure...

355
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,010
Yu Jin was never found?

356
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,210
I'm sorry.

357
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,450
I'm so sorry.

358
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,990
How can you say that now?

359
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,720
You did that for 20 years!

360
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,720
You can't get worked up like this.
Calm down.

361
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,530
You also know
how Yu Jin passed away.

362
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,600
Do you have any idea
how painful I was every single day?

363
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,130
Not only did she lie,

364
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,700
but her mom instigated
the hit-and-run case...

365
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,200
and killed Yu Jin!

366
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,540
Why are you telling me to stop?

367
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,300
Se Young was a young girl.

368
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,110
A frightened child
couldn't have made a sound decision.

369
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,640
The fault is on the adults,

370
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,780
the adults who couldn't right
the wrong back then.

371
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:17,580
Yes. Your mother, Choi Myung Ji,

372
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,250
was the reason
behind all these tragedies.

373
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,250
- Yeo Jin.
- Aunt Yeo Jin.

374
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,430
Ms. Chairwoman.

375
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,580
How do you feel after apologizing...

376
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,180
to the chairwoman?

377
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,450
Well, I'm not sure.

378
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,580
I guess I feel both lighter...

379
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,720
and heavier.

380
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,920
The chairwoman will
open up again after some time.

381
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,460
I hope you found your peace, too.

382
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,060
My aunt seemed quite unwell.

383
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,770
That took
a strong psychological toll on her.

384
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,340
The notebook was the only evidence,

385
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,840
and she had put all her hopes in it,

386
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,610
but it came to nothing.

387
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,210
I was the one
who got that notebook for my mom.

388
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,320
I'll continue to commit crimes...

389
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,290
if I stay with my mom.

390
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,390
You don't want to live like that,
do you?

391
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:34,520
- No.
- You can make the decision.

392
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,490
It's your life.

393
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:54,580
I heard the chairwoman collapsed.

394
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:59,980
I need to meet Myung Ji.

395
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,320
What will you do?

396
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,190
I'll try to persuade her
to turn herself in.

397
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,420
Turn herself in?

398
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,420
Locking her up in prison is...

399
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,860
the only way
Yeo Jin will get up again.

400
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,160
Getting her to confess is
the only way right now.

401
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:16,400
We have to try whatever we can.

402
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,400
I got a call from the detective.

403
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,010
Her travel ban wasn't approved.

404
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:26,440
They can't do that
only on testimonies...

405
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,310
without hard evidence.

406
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,380
That darned hard evidence.

407
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,720
She had already destroyed it.

408
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,890
We may never get her
if she flees abroad.

409
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,730
I have to meet Myung Ji first.

410
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,250
(October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

411
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,460
(October 21, 1.23 million dollars,
balance for Yu Jin's accident)

412
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,560
(November 3, 80,000 dollars,
expenses for Yu Jin's accident)

413
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,160
(June 10, 2009, 5,000 dollars,
Yu Jin's whereabouts in the USA)

414
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,060
(May 22, 2010, April 14, 2011,
April 25, 2012, June 29, 2013)

415
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,870
(January 6, 2004, March 5, 2005,
April 10, 2006, January 29, 2007)

416
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,380
Can you make a copy of this?

417
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,450
Sure.

418
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,930
(October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

419
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,110
Hey, Mom.

420
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:11,850
What are you looking at?

421
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,520
It's nothing.

422
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,620
Are you going somewhere?

423
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,020
Your uncle wants to see me.

424
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,320
Uncle Sung Ho? Why?

425
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,560
No idea. I'll be back.

426
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,960
Bye.

427
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,340
What's going on?

428
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,210
Turn myself in?

429
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,080
Why would I do that
for something I didn't do?

430
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,050
Yeo Jin is very ill.

431
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,820
Will she feel better...

432
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,250
if she locks me up in prison?

433
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,460
What goes around comes around.

434
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,590
How can she
not even leave me a penny...

435
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,800
How can someone like you say
what goes around comes around?

436
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,230
If I become a murderer,

437
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,970
Se Young will have to live...

438
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,710
the rest of her life
as a murderer's daughter.

439
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,340
So, why would I turn myself in
for something I didn't do?

440
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,610
The lack of evidence
does not make you innocent.

441
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,350
Turn yourself in
and pay for what you did.

442
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,650
It's better for Se Young, too.

443
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,590
You got the wrong person.

444
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,990
Se Young came and apologized.

445
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,460
She blamed herself
for this tragedy that her lie...

446
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,360
had caused.

447
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,070
Did you know
she tried to kill herself?

448
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,040
She went to Seongbuk Port...

449
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,770
and tried to drown to death.

450
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,210
That idiot.

451
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,240
She looked very tortured.

452
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,450
It's belated,

453
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,050
but admit to what you did
and atone for everything.

454
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:58,320
Turning myself in,
confessing, and atoning...

455
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:01,490
all seem to have
nothing to do with me.

456
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,860
I'm innocent.

457
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,140
Hey, Myung Ji.

458
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,980
Uncle Sung Ho.

459
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,510
What brings you here?

460
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,350
I'm sorry.
I don't think my mom will change.

461
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,120
But...

462
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,960
I'll do what I can.

463
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,890
What can you do?

464
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,700
It's been a while.

465
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,400
Ha Na told me about you...

466
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,170
and about Seongbuk Port.

467
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,770
Why did you do that?

468
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,740
This is embarrassing.

469
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,340
Just don't have such an idea again.

470
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,440
This must be a tough time for you.

471
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,550
I'm sorry I can't be there to help.

472
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,650
Just be good to Ha Na.

473
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,520
Let me apologize
for how mean I was to you...

474
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,120
all this time.

475
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:12,800
And for how my mom
mistreated you and your mother.

476
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,960
It's all in the past.

477
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,900
Congratulations on your wedding.

478
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:19,040
Thanks.

479
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:24,310
I have a favor to ask you.

480
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,850
- What's this?
- I thought...

481
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,050
I could trust you with this.

482
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,690
- What is it?
- You can look at it later.

483
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,890
You can give it to my aunt.

484
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,020
- The chairwoman?
- Yes.

485
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,200
I hope you'll be happy with Ha Na.

486
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,700
Bye.

487
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,500
Se Young.

488
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,780
What is this?

489
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,990
Don't you think we'll be tailed?

490
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,360
Even if we are,
they can't hold us down.

491
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,000
But just in case,

492
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,170
I'll go downstairs
and grab a cab first.

493
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:25,840
- Come down when I call you.
- Okay.

494
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,740
- Mom.
- Yes?

495
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,580
Let's not sin anymore.

496
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,450
Let's atone for everything we did...

497
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,350
to this day.

498
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,650
I just want to live
an ordinary life.

499
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:45,260
Why are you talking like
a weakling again?

500
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,790
We aren't like ordinary people.

501
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,000
I'll go.

502
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,430
Okay.

503
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,100
Did I leave anything out?

504
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,550
Why isn't she calling me?

505
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,620
Is it hard to find a taxi?

506
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,390
- The person you have reached is...
- What? Why is she...

507
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,890
not picking up?

508
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,430
Gosh.

509
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:31,100
- What do you want?
- How dare you run away?

510
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,500
Why do you care where I go?

511
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,570
- Leave.
- I came to offer one last chance.

512
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,840
Chance?

513
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,680
What chance?

514
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,780
A chance for you to confess.

515
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,250
Goodness.

516
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,250
Why are you and Sung Ho
taking turns to ask me that?

517
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:50,350
I can only confess
to whatever I did wrong.

518
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,320
There's no evidence.
Why are you telling me to confess?

519
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,490
What do you mean
there's no evidence?

520
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,790
Because you burnt that notebook?

521
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,660
There was no notebook.

522
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,200
But look.

523
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,030
Gosh.

524
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,840
(Cho Byung Jin: October 7, 2018,
550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

525
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,940
This is...

526
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,510
It's a copy of that notebook.

527
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,250
- A copy?
- Yes.

528
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,680
It'll frighten you
more than the original.

529
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,320
Do you expect me to believe...

530
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,550
this fake document?

531
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,460
Ms. Choi Myung Ji.

532
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,690
What? What do you want?

533
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,900
- Move aside!
- You're under arrest...

534
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,730
without a warrant
for instigation of murder by accident.

535
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:38,970
No. I didn't do it!

536
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,600
I didn't do it!

537
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,710
Let go of me. Let go!

538
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,870
Everything was fabricated
and forged!

539
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,810
You should've confessed
when you had a chance.

540
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,280
You refused to take it.

541
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,450
No, it's not true!

542
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,750
Let go of me!

543
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,090
- Goodbye, Myung Ji.
- Let go of me!

544
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,490
Let go! I didn't do it!

545
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,990
I didn't!

546
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,760
I didn't do it! No!

547
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,910
(Cinderella Game)

548
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,110
- Congratulations, Ms. Chairwoman.
- Thank you.

549
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,650
- Take this!
- It's thanks to everyone's help.

550
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,150
I sent my mom there.

551
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,350
You've done well.

552
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,650
I have to call Hwang Jin Goo
my brother-in-law?

553
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,120
My eldest brother-in-law has
great taste.

554
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,720
He picked out a perfect one for me.

555
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,190
Did you withdraw everything
Choi Myung Ji had in her slush fund?

556
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,760
- What are you talking about?
- I came to see you one last time.

557
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,860
What?

558
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,130
From now on,
I won't live as your daughter.

559
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,500
- I'll live as Yoon Se Young.
- Se Young. Se Young!

560
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,070
Se Young.
