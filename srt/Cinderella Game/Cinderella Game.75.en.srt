1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,740
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,440
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,750
(Episode 75)

5
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,420
Did you say that
Jin Goo and I couldn't get married?

6
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:16,960
- What are you talking about?
- Did you tell Eun Chong...

7
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,860
that Jin Goo
and I couldn't get married?

8
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,360
What was your ground in saying that?

9
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:26,300
Why would I say that?

10
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,170
Eun Chong, Auntie Ha Na said
I couldn't marry Mr. Hwang, right?

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,410
Grandma is a liar, right?

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,710
So, I can't adopt you
while you're in this house.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,480
We have to tell a lie
and escape from this house.

14
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,720
No.

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,950
You said that back there.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,920
That Auntie Ha Na said
I couldn't marry Mr. Hwang.

17
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:57,400
He's saying no.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,400
Who told you this?

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,700
Eun Chong clearly said that.

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,270
Se Young, that's enough.

21
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,440
Eun Chong, why are you lying?

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Tell them what you told me before.

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,780
I don't know.

24
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,650
It's okay, Eun Chong.
She must've been confused.

25
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,320
Stop crying and say it!

26
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,960
Calm down, Se Young.

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,530
It's okay.

28
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,650
What do you mean
I can't get married anyway?

29
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,010
What do you mean?

30
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,290
What if Ha Na said that because
she knew about my fake pregnancy?

31
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,660
I'll buy you an herbal tonic
great for pregnant women.

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,660
No, it's okay.
I don't take herbal tonics anyway.

33
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,930
Even if you don't want to,
just take it...

34
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,400
for your baby.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,170
Do you want to listen to the story
I heard on the radio?

36
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,270
I'm not interested.

37
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,640
It was the story of a woman
who got married by faking her pregnancy.

38
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,880
Be careful.

39
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,510
If Jin Goo finds out,
he won't let this go.

40
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,350
Se Young,
do you feel anxious to death?

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Just wait until your wedding day.

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,660
She said
you couldn't marry him anyway?

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,700
Yes, but she lied and said
she didn't say anything.

44
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,870
Then, does this mean Eun Chong lied
and said something she didn't?

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,510
That's suspicious.

46
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,010
Eun Chong also gasped
after he said that,

47
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,240
as if he wasn't supposed to.

48
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,450
Has she ever mentioned
fake pregnancy after that day?

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,050
No.

50
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,690
I need to find out
if Ha Na really knows...

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,190
about the fake pregnancy.

52
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,760
Don't ever tell anyone that
Auntie Se Young and Mr. Hwang...

53
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
won't get married.

54
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,430
If anyone asks again,
tell them you never said that.

55
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay. That way, we can
escape from this place, right?

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,940
Yes. Just keep it a secret
until their wedding.

57
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,010
I need to show
that I believe she's pregnant...

58
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,280
to stop her from getting suspicious.

59
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,830
I sent you the photos from the camp.

60
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,960
- You should check.
- Okay.

61
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:52,370
About that fake pregnancy story
you heard on the radio.

62
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,070
How did it end?

63
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,540
They thought
she lied about her pregnancy,

64
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,280
but she had lost the baby.

65
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,350
So, they lifted the
misunderstanding,

66
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,480
got married, had kids,
and lived a good life.

67
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,920
You said the ending was cruel.

68
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,420
I meant that it almost became cruel.

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,860
You should've heard me out
to the end.

70
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,430
Okay.

71
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,960
You were good to Eun Chong.

72
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,730
Don't play favorites
even after Star is born,

73
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,130
and continue to be nice to him.

74
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,400
Of course.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Star and Eun Chong will be
really great siblings.

76
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,840
She's talking about Star, so does it mean
she believes I'm pregnant?

77
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,340
Will you really
stop seeing Eun Chong...

78
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,650
once I adopt him?

79
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,280
Yes.

80
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,390
I can't get used
to this sudden change.

81
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,720
I let it go.

82
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:45,260
I decided to help you become
Eun Chong's mom actively,

83
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,060
and I wanted to end this
on a good note for his sake.

84
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:50,660
That's a wise decision.

85
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,240
You said that back there.

86
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:06,540
That Auntie Ha Na said
I couldn't marry Mr. Hwang.

87
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,280
She said we wouldn't get married?

88
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,390
It didn't seem like
Se Young was lying.

89
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,390
Why did Ha Na say that?

90
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,290
It looks like you have a plan...

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,190
with Eun Chong's adoption
after we marry.

92
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,790
Can you tell me what it is?

93
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,460
It won't happen after you marry.

94
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,660
You'll find out soon.

95
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,670
Does she really have a plan?

96
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,970
I need to install
a wiretapping app on Ha Na's phone.

97
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,440
This is it.

98
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,650
I'll send a link to this number
for an illegal hacking app.

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,920
How can I make her
tap on that text message?

100
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,990
Yes, make it look like a message
sent from a school to the guardian.

101
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,490
Okay.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,310
Why did I get this message?

103
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,780
Did Eun Chong write down my number?

104
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,550
(Lala Elementary School
Notice App for Parents)

105
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,910
(Warning! A hacking attempt to
install an illegal wiretapping app)

106
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,050
What?

107
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,020
A wiretapping app?

108
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,490
(Warning! A hacking attempt to
install an illegal wiretapping app)

109
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,240
Hey, Ji Seok.

110
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,070
I just got an alarm on my phone that
a wiretapping app was installed.

111
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,270
"A wiretapping app?"

112
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,780
Who would tap you?

113
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,080
Someone who'll try to tap me
right now?

114
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,780
Did you say that
Jin Goo and I couldn't get married?

115
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,850
About that fake pregnancy story
you heard on the radio.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,620
How did it end?

117
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,690
It must be Se Young.

118
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,530
She tried to feel me out to see
if I knew about her fake pregnancy.

119
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,130
Then, you can show her...

120
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,430
that you believe she's pregnant.

121
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,540
Okay.

122
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,000
Did Ha Na click on the message?

123
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,840
Yes, I just sent you the recording
of her phone call to your number.

124
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,210
You can check.

125
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,510
Okay. Bye.

126
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,610
(Voice File)

127
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,580
Do you think Se Young will
take good care of Eun Chong...

128
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,220
while she recovers from childbirth?

129
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,660
He may become a nuisance
once his younger sibling is born.

130
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,090
They wouldn't do that
to Hyesung Group's successor.

131
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,490
Ha Na, will you really live
without seeing him from now on?

132
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,960
I have to do that
to save Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

133
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,500
It looks like she has no idea
about the fake pregnancy.

134
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,610
Hey, Ha Na isn't suspicious
of your pregnancy.

135
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,710
Really? How did you know?

136
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,220
I tapped her phone...

137
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,650
and heard her phone call
with Ji Seok.

138
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,650
She was worried...

139
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,690
Eun Chong would become a nuisance
after you give birth to another kid.

140
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,490
Really? She said that to me.

141
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,130
That means she believes this.

142
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,300
She would've exposed you already
if she knew. Why would she hold back?

143
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,800
Don't worry.

144
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,470
Are you yet to find out
who the chief auditor is?

145
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,610
No, it's a total mystery.

146
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,810
Would the money we siphoned off
not be a problem?

147
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,880
It looks clean in the books.
How are they going to catch on?

148
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,690
They really look like
mom, dad, and their son.

149
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,460
Great job taking the photos.

150
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,930
I had fun too. Excuse me.

151
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,270
You know you're his babysitter
until the wedding day, right?

152
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,370
Things will be hectic on that day,
so take good care of him.

153
00:08:57,210 --> 00:09:00,780
Sure. I'll do my best
until the last moment.

154
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,250
You probably can't understand me,

155
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,580
but I can't understand you
and your brother, either.

156
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,450
It was the wrong decision
to turn you into a fake daughter,

157
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,920
but I wanted to make you
my real daughter and Eun Chong's mom.

158
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,420
I was also hurt...

159
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,960
when you turned it down
and treated me like your worst enemy.

160
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,960
Did you just laugh?

161
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,470
I couldn't help but laugh
at those words, "worst enemy."

162
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:26,840
I also felt bad to see
this complete change in you.

163
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,010
At least you have a reason.

164
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,610
Director Goo was hostile
from the moment we met.

165
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,010
Because you're our family's enemy.

166
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,850
So, don't think of this
as entirely my fault.

167
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,290
You and your brother
provided the reason.

168
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,360
If you don't keep your promise
and lurk around Eun Chong,

169
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:49,460
I don't know what I'll do
to keep him away from you.

170
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:53,230
So, do not dream of appearing
before Eun Chong again.

171
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,930
Why are you so insecure?

172
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:58,440
You said
I could never win against you.

173
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:01,040
You said I'd end up
groveling before you.

174
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:04,080
You say you aren't afraid of me,

175
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,710
but in reality, are you afraid?

176
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,480
You think I'm afraid of you?

177
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,780
How cute.

178
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,860
- Take a look at these.
- Yes, ma'am.

179
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,630
I mentioned this to you before.

180
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,760
Chairwoman Shin!

181
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,170
How can you do this to us?

182
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,370
Do you know
how good Ha Na was to Eun Chong?

183
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,570
What's with our security?

184
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,010
Make sure there are no solicitors.

185
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,240
- Solicitors?
- Solicitors?

186
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,950
- Hey, let go of me.
- Wait.

187
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,750
- Chairwoman Shin!
- Let go!

188
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,950
- Chairwoman Shin!
- Come on!

189
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:49,120
- Chairwoman Shin!
- You need to let go of me!

190
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,220
Have you found anything else
on Richard Han and the external audit?

191
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,760
No, not yet.

192
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:57,730
If Richard Han is behind this,
he'll go after corporate raids too.

193
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,400
Make sure the security is tight
with our security server.

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,770
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:06,270
Have you heard?
There will be an external audit.

196
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,740
The company is in a frenzy
because of that.

197
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,910
Why are they suddenly holding this?

198
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,110
I don't know who'll go down
in this bloodbath.

199
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,350
Mr. Yoon, check and see if there's
more to report for the audit...

200
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,290
- other than what Ms. Yoon has now.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,760
We have zero information
on the chief auditor or the team.

202
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,060
It looks like
this audit is after me.

203
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,860
And it's over the disposal
of Hyesung Tour,

204
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,530
so Director Goo and Richard Han
must be behind this.

205
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,030
I agree.

206
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,370
I also thought so.

207
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,310
They sold the business
however they wanted.

208
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,010
Would they hold an audit for this?

209
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,980
What if this was a trap?

210
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,680
"A trap?"

211
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,780
We must be open
to every possibility.

212
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,780
It doesn't matter
even if they conduct an audit...

213
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,680
if there's no problem on our end.

214
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,650
There's no problem thus far.

215
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,290
Keep looking to make sure
they don't find any fault.

216
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,420
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

217
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,400
- Have you heard about the audit?
- Yes.

218
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,940
There must've been a problem
with Hyesung Tour's disposal.

219
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,770
You were the president,

220
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,980
so be ready for everything
with a sense of duty.

221
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,140
Was there a problem
with Hyesung Tour's disposal?

222
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,410
You did it, so you'd know.

223
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:23,380
I didn't think so.

224
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,220
But I began to get curious
now that an audit has begun.

225
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,020
You should ask Chairwoman Shin,
who initiated the process.

226
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,520
She didn't know.

227
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,160
But why do I keep seeing
Richard Han's shadow?

228
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,130
You're seeing whatever you want to.

229
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,230
Do you have a countermeasure
if Richard Han is behind this?

230
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,270
Nothing else
other than getting thoroughly ready.

231
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,100
Then, good luck with that.

232
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,440
I'll see you
at the wedding tomorrow.

233
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,420
There was a talk about
how they seized the chairwoman's weakness.

234
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,620
Did they set up this trap
by using that?

235
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:04,260
Mr. Hwang seemed to think...

236
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,920
Richard Han and I were behind
the external audit.

237
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,190
I think so too.

238
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,590
Everything seemed set up,

239
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,600
from Hyesung Tour's disposal
to this external audit.

240
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,370
We initiated this disposal.

241
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,430
There's no need...

242
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,770
to hold an external audit
and create this problem.

243
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,510
There must be another reason.

244
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,440
You mean the corporate raiding?

245
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,880
But Hyesung Tour's disposal
wasn't conducted like a raid.

246
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,520
I didn't expect you
to do the same to my siblings.

247
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,290
The chairwoman of Hyesung did that
against some little snack bar.

248
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,590
It's like using a sledgehammer...

249
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,430
to crack a nut.

250
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,730
I haven't used it in a while,
so my skills seemed outdated.

251
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,870
That was why I decided
to test it out.

252
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,670
You may leave.

253
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,080
Good luck getting ready
for the audit. Excuse me.

254
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,530
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman.

255
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:25,200
Have you found anything else
on Director Goo's parents?

256
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,510
No, everything is
still the same as before.

257
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,480
- Keep looking.
- Yes, ma'am.

258
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,210
Chairwoman Shin and Hwang Jin Goo
seemed to be suspicious that...

259
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,080
we were behind the external audit.

260
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,280
It was as we expected.

261
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,950
She probably began
a background check on us.

262
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,720
I'll reveal Youngshin Fashion
as my father's business.

263
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,030
When do you plan
to meet the chairwoman?

264
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,860
- The first day of the audit.
- Shall I accompany you?

265
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,800
No, I'll go with Attorney Ko.

266
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,870
Yes, sir.

267
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,240
Have you found
those confidential documents?

268
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,540
I found a portion,

269
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,910
but I need to dig some more
to find accounting files.

270
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,140
Everything will become chaotic
at the wedding...

271
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,550
once the news
of her fake pregnancy goes public.

272
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,980
Tonight will be
Se Young's last supper.

273
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,130
You shouldn't have come
near my place.

274
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,100
You'll be officially married
starting tomorrow.

275
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,170
I had to do this to see you.

276
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,940
The wedding was
almost called off because of you.

277
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,410
I have to be careful.

278
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,580
Is Richard Han
behind the external audit?

279
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,880
He's busy trying to take Hyesung.
Why would he hold an audit?

280
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,460
Will Hyesung Tour's audit
become a problem for you?

281
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,190
Did you take money?

282
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,090
What money?

283
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,330
An external audit
didn't sit right with me.

284
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,830
You'll be fine
if there's no problem.

285
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,840
What's your dream?

286
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,040
That was random. What dream?

287
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,040
Is there anything else you want
other than Hyesung?

288
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,240
Another dream...

289
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,310
- or goal?
- No.

290
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,620
I lived my whole life
just to get Hyesung.

291
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,520
If I lose it,

292
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,490
I'll just kill myself.

293
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,330
You need to think of life
without Hyesung.

294
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,090
Why should I?

295
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,760
Hyesung and I are one.

296
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:33,060
Or you can...

297
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:37,200
just live an ordinary life
with a man you love.

298
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,740
That's for ordinary people.

299
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,540
Why are you saying this
to someone who'll marry tomorrow?

300
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,880
I wonder.

301
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,620
If you want me, take Hyesung first.

302
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,620
Jin Goo will be the winner
in this life...

303
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,860
after we adopt Eun Chong.

304
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,360
Do you really think so?

305
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,200
What do you mean?
Are you saying it may not happen?

306
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,430
You never know
what will happen in life.

307
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,400
Who knows how things will change?

308
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,140
Stop jinxing this.

309
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,380
But Ji Seok, you have my heart.
You know that, right?

310
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,920
You said
your baby could sense everything.

311
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,030
I wonder how she'll respond...

312
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,000
once she loses Hyesung to me.

313
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,610
You look gorgeous, Yeo Jin.

314
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,380
Hey, Se Young.

315
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,990
Doesn't Yeo Jin look gorgeous
in Hanbok?

316
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,020
Yes, no one could guess
how old you were.

317
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,460
You look at least a decade younger.

318
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,990
Who cares if I'm gorgeous?

319
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,160
The bride and her mother
need to look beautiful.

320
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,760
It's so reassuring...

321
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,400
to have you behind us.

322
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,900
Se Young grew up without her father,

323
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,870
so the wedding...

324
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,910
would've been so empty
if you weren't here for us.

325
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,110
Don't end up crying tomorrow.

326
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,380
You'll be there,
and you're more trustworthy than any man.

327
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,080
I'm not going to cry.

328
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,660
Eun Chong,
you look so cool and cute.

329
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,120
- Did you practice as a flower boy?
- Yes.

330
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,990
He practiced sprinkling
flower petals.

331
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,090
Don't get nervous...

332
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,530
- and do a great job tomorrow.
- Okay.

333
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,470
Tomorrow is finally my wedding.

334
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:02,180
This doesn't feel real, Mom.
It's not a dream, is it?

335
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,980
It's reality,
and it's better than any dreams.

336
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,080
You've done so well, my girl.

337
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,050
And you, Mom.

338
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,690
- I'll be good to you from now on.
- Okay.

339
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,630
- Everything will go as we want now.
- Yes.

340
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,400
Yes, right.

341
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,830
Take this.
Tomorrow is your special day,

342
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,540
so make sure you put this on
before you sleep.

343
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,210
Look at me.

344
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,280
- Gosh. Try it yourself.
- Okay.

345
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,780
This is nice.

346
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,850
Make sure you use it tomorrow too.

347
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,120
You need to put
some caviar on your face.

348
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,060
You need to look
the most stunning tomorrow.

349
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,990
Thanks, Mom.

350
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,430
Come in.

351
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,040
It's my present.
I thought it'd look good with you.

352
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,480
I see. Red roses?

353
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,210
Do people use red bouquets?

354
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,350
I like it. Thanks.

355
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,350
I look forward to tomorrow.

356
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,800
She's even more suspicious
when she's obedient.

357
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,060
Don't mind her.

358
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,200
In the end, I took everything.

359
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:32,900
I'll be the happiest bride tomorrow.

360
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:36,140
- Of course.
- Yes.

361
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,850
After the wedding and the reception,

362
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,950
will you stay at the hotel?

363
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,750
Yes, we'll take a few days off
at the hotel instead of a honeymoon.

364
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,320
What's wrong, Mom?

365
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,790
You should look happy...

366
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,390
as a groom who's about to marry,

367
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,300
but you don't even look
excited, nervous, or cheerful.

368
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,000
You seem
even more nonchalant than usual.

369
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,270
It probably hasn't hit me yet.

370
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:11,140
It'll feel real by tomorrow.

371
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,210
You still need to show
a big smile tomorrow.

372
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,910
Of course. It's not like
I'm walking into my death.

373
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,420
We'll live a good life.

374
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,220
All right.

375
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,920
No, don't try too hard
to live a good life.

376
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,990
Just live your life
however you want to.

377
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,070
Come here, Eun Chong.

378
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,210
Did Se Young leave?

379
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,540
Yes, she'll be at the venue...

380
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,010
after going to the beauty shop
with Jin Goo.

381
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,880
I have to go somewhere
before I get there too.

382
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,580
- Where?
- I have a previous engagement.

383
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,220
You're all done.

384
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:01,730
Jin Goo, you can leave first
if you're done.

385
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:04,260
- Okay. Don't be late.
- Okay.

386
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,170
(Ms. Goo Ha Na)

387
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,080
- Hello?
- Mr. Hwang.

388
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,380
May I see you now?

389
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,380
Right now?

390
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,930
What is it, Ha Na?

391
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,700
I have to tell you something.

392
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,970
What is it?

393
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,940
Are you marrying Se Young...

394
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,980
because I told you to?

395
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,110
No, it was my decision.

396
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,580
Was it because of the baby?

397
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,850
Please be honest.

398
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,690
Will you call this off
if there is no baby?

399
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,220
Why do you ask?

400
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,260
What will you do
if Se Young isn't pregnant?

401
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,500
Will you still marry her?

402
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,400
Or will you call it off now?

403
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,900
If she isn't pregnant?
Why are you saying this?

404
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,370
She's pregnant, and...

405
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,940
Did you tell Eun Chong that
Jin Goo and I couldn't get married?

406
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,380
What was your ground in saying that?

407
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,880
- Is there a ground to this?
- Yes.

408
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,620
You don’t mean...

409
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,220
Se Young...

410
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,720
isn't pregnant.

411
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,160
I'll take the photo.

412
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,700
Please show a bigger smile.
Thank you.

413
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,470
- You look so great.
- Thank you.

414
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,200
- All right.
- Congratulations.

415
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,310
Thank you.

416
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,370
- See you later.
- See you.

417
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,380
Gosh, my eyes!

418
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,640
Where are you, Ms. Yoon?

419
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,650
- You're blinding my eyes.
- Congratulations, Ms. Yoon.

420
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,980
- You look great.
- You're so beautiful.

421
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,480
- Thank you.
- You're blinding my eyes now.

422
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,150
- Thank you.
- You look so great.

423
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,850
- White works really well on you.
- It does.

424
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,690
Mr. Hwang must be thrilled.

425
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,960
Good for him!

426
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:18,360
- You should marry soon too.
- Yes.

427
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,400
Let's not discuss
something that sad right now.

428
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,140
- I mean, it's a great day.
- It is.

429
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,470
You look way too beautiful.

430
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,770
- Thank you.
- You look gorgeous.

431
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,440
- You do.
- I always knew you were gorgeous,

432
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,450
but you almost blinded me
with your beauty today.

433
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,550
- She has a great complexion.
- You're like a goddess.

434
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,050
When am I going to get married?

435
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,020
She's just dazzling...

436
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,750
- in her white dress and makeup.
- You look so good.

437
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,060
- I wonder what her secret is.
- I wonder.

438
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,960
- What?
- Let's take a picture.

439
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,190
- Yes, of course.
- That sounds great.

440
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,300
- A photo.
- I'll take one now.

441
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,360
Okay.

442
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,130
I'll sit right here.

443
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:58,340
- Smile.
- I'll take it now. Smile.

444
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,970
Goodness, thank you.

445
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:03,740
It must've been a long journey.

446
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,840
You must be happy.

447
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,380
- We've been so busy.
- Thank you.

448
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,940
- I see.
- I'll see you later.

449
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,550
Goodness.

450
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,050
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

451
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,550
Congratulations
on the wedding, Ms. Sim.

452
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,750
Ms. Bang Ul,
congratulations on the wedding.

453
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,960
Thank you, Ms. Chairwoman.

454
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,230
Thank you, Eun Chong.

455
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,200
Yeo Jin, you should go inside
and have a seat.

456
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,600
Yes, and congratulations to you too.

457
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,030
Where's Jin Goo?

458
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,370
Jin Goo? Bang Ul...

459
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,740
I mean, Ms. Sim, where is he?

460
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,540
They both have no father,

461
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,580
so he should be here
to welcome his guests.

462
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,680
He said he was leaving a while ago.

463
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,350
He must be stuck in traffic.
My goodness.

464
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,860
She faked her pregnancy?

465
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,560
I went to the doctor
and saw the sonogram...

466
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,130
and heard the baby's heartbeat.

467
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,730
Why are you doing this?

468
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,400
Are you doing this to stop us
from adopting Eun Chong?

469
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,610
Even if that was so,
would I make up a lie like this?

470
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,340
Do you want to talk to a witness?

471
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,880
"A witness?"

472
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,850
Take your seat.

473
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,090
Yes, come in.

474
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,000
Doctor.

475
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,210
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,080
What do you mean?
So, she isn't pregnant?

477
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,610
What about the sonogram?

478
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,680
You let me hear
the baby's heartbeat too!

479
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,990
The videos were faked. I'm sorry.

480
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,800
The wedding will begin soon.
Why isn't he here yet?

481
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,410
I hope nothing happened to him.

482
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,810
You know, like an accident.

483
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,110
We would've received a call
if he were in an accident.

484
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,880
Then, why isn't he
picking up his phone?

485
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
My gosh.

486
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,660
Bang Ul, has Jin Goo reached out?

487
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,230
I can't reach him.

488
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:40,130
Did he not tell you
where he was going?

489
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,970
- He said he was coming here.
- My gosh.

490
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,000
Goodness, it's Jin Goo.

491
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,070
Where are you, Jin Goo?

492
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,870
Everyone is waiting for you.

493
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,480
Mom.

494
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,010
I'm not marrying her.

495
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,880
What? What do you mean?

496
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,780
Se Young lied...

497
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,690
about her pregnancy.

498
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,720
What?

499
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:07,060
What's wrong? Let me talk to him.

500
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,130
- What?
- What? What's going on?

501
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,230
What is this?

502
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,200
Goodness. What's with the lights?

503
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,570
Why did the lights go off?

504
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,640
The wedding has been canceled.

505
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,410
What are you talking about?
"Canceled?"

506
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,910
The groom called and said
he was calling it off.

507
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,650
The groom called it off?

508
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:32,380
No, something went wrong. No.

509
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,780
Se Young...

510
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,450
faked her pregnancy.

511
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,520
Bang Ul, what is he saying?

512
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,920
Give me...

513
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,940
- Bang Ul.
- Se Young isn't pregnant?

514
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,480
- Bang Ul.
- Did she fake her pregnancy?

515
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:06,680
Bang Ul, no. It's...

516
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,780
How do you call yourself human?

517
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,250
How dare you deceive us...

518
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,120
with faking her pregnancy?

519
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,660
You evil brat.

520
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,330
You're an evil brat.

521
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,730
You'll be cursed. You wicked brat.

522
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,460
- You.
- Goodness!

523
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,500
My goodness.
What's going on, Ms. Sim?

524
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,000
What is it, Myung Ji?

525
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,470
Yeo Jin.

526
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,270
I am...

527
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:33,980
calling this marriage off.

528
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,030
It was called off?

529
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,660
Yes, the groom just reached out.

530
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,800
Please excuse me.

531
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,240
The wedding was called off?

532
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,710
No, this can't happen.

533
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,950
(Se Young)

534
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,830
Please pick up!

535
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,440
Jin Goo, please!

536
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:39,280
Jin Goo, please pick up.

537
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,840
Please pick up!

538
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,810
Please pick up!

539
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,840
Why was the wedding called off?

540
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,270
Jin Goo won't pick up his phone.
What's going on?

541
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,740
Don't you know
why it was called off?

542
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,080
I told you that story
I heard on the radio.

543
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,680
The woman who tried to marry
by faking her pregnancy.

544
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,850
- You...
- That was you.

545
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,650
You knew?

546
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,790
You wanted to know
the ending, right?

547
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,260
The groom never showed up
at the venue,

548
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,600
and the bride was
miserably left alone in the bridal room.

549
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,460
That was the cruel ending.

550
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,570
Did you tell him...

551
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,210
- I faked my pregnancy?
- Yes.

552
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,140
I said you couldn't get married.

553
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,850
You should've noticed.

554
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,320
Then, you wouldn't have been abandoned
in your bridal room.

555
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,590
You!

556
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:05,500
You've lived your entire life
trampling on others.

557
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,930
So, it's your turn to see
how it feels...

558
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,570
to be trampled on.

559
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,450
Stop right there.

560
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,550
Stop right there!

561
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,460
It's my present.
I thought it'd look good with you.

562
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,830
I look forward to tomorrow.

563
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,400
I'll kill you.

564
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,800
Goo Ha Na, I'll kill you!

565
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,910
(Cinderella Game)

566
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,440
- What's going on?
- Se Young faked her pregnancy.

567
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,810
She's the culprit.

568
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,350
Who do you think you are
to ruin my daughter's life?

569
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,950
Why? Do you think
only her life is valuable?

570
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,090
Why do you reckon
another man's life is a joke?

571
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,690
You seem to have changed.
Is it because of Ha Na?

572
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,820
I can't give up on you.

573
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,260
Se Young won't give up on Hyesung.

574
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,490
I can't end it like this.

575
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,800
If you can use me
to get your revenge, do it.

576
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,500
Are you trying
to work things out with Jin Goo?

577
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,030
I like Mr. Hwang.

578
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,730
Look forward to it, Se Young.
