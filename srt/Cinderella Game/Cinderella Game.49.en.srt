1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:02,069
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:03,779
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,209
(Episode 49)

5
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:59,759
Was that not a dream?

6
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,469
Then, back then,
did Ms. Goo and I...

7
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,870
Wait. Hey.

8
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,280
I think the security guard is gone.

9
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:13,810
- Should we go out?
- Yes.

10
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,379
Then, I'll go first.

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,769
Mr. Hwang, you can come out.

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,180
- My gosh!
- Who are you?

13
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:52,180
Please let me go just once.
I had to handle something urgently.

14
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,120
I understand your situation,

15
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,859
but you weren't supposed
to come into the office.

16
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:58,260
It was just today, sir.

17
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,590
I won't sneak in again.

18
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,189
He's right.

19
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,329
We were done with everything
after tonight. We're about to leave.

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,930
Please have some.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,199
I'm so sorry.
We're causing you trouble, right?

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,099
All right.

23
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,439
I hope his punishment
is lifted soon.

24
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,939
You two should go.

25
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,610
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

26
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,050
Jin Goo had to work in the corridor?

27
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,780
I was already dumbfounded...

28
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,719
about how he was on suspension
after punching someone.

29
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,319
He's in the corridor?

30
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,490
You should've stopped him!

31
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,860
I tried,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,229
What does he do
sitting out in the corridor?

33
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,099
He was looking for the evidence...

34
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,099
that Mr. Goo postponed
the Dubai contract by three months.

35
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,669
He went home late
doing that yesterday, so again,

36
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,870
he must've been doing that today.

37
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:50,780
Will you let Jin Goo
get humiliated like this?

38
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:52,879
First, you should
lift his punishment...

39
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,509
and handle the disposal, too.

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,319
If you approve
the disposal of Hyesung Tour,

41
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:03,250
then I'll stay quiet
about your corporate raiding.

42
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,490
If I had to consider Jin Goo,
I would need to scrap that plan.

43
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,560
But I also can't let him expose
my corporate raids.

44
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,870
Grandma, where's my auntie?

45
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,909
Hey, Eun Chong. You're up.

46
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,379
Do you want to stay with me
until she gets home?

47
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,509
Come here.

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,330
Isn't it ridiculous how she cares
much more about him than Yu Jin?

49
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,430
Tell me about it.

50
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm sure she has a reason.

51
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,530
- Mr. Han said that?
- Yes.

52
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,340
He said he'd ask someone
in the police,

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,939
but it'd take some time, so he asked you
to finalize the sale first.

54
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,370
I'll do that.

55
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,439
It was worth the hard work.

56
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,349
The two must've worked overtime.

57
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,750
Yes, they must've finished putting
the shredded papers together.

58
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,889
(Quick Delivery)

59
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:10,460
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,459
Wait.

61
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,730
Chairwoman Shin once collapsed
after receiving a delivery, right?

62
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,970
How do you feel?

63
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,579
I was quite concerned after hearing
about your collapse yesterday.

64
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:34,209
I'm fine. Goodbye.

65
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:38,819
That was probably when she found out
about her daughter's death.

66
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,819
You said she wouldn't recover easily
if her daughter had died.

67
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:43,759
She must've received good news, too.

68
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,490
Something that could offset
her daughter's death.

69
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:49,589
We're back on ground zero.
What could that be?

70
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,060
If our presumptions are correct,

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,670
that must be the reason
Ha Na is her fake daughter now.

72
00:04:55,029 --> 00:04:56,930
She went to a children's home...

73
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:58,870
the day after she received
that delivery, right?

74
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,339
- Yes.
- Why did she go there?

75
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,379
Ha Na has never heard
of the name Yoon Yu Jin.

76
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,149
What if she used a different name
that wasn't Yoon Yu Jin?

77
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,019
"A different name?"

78
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,220
Cheers.

79
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,959
The file we put together
should be enough...

80
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,170
to get more board members
on your side, right?

81
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,269
There's enough evidence,
so we have a fighting chance.

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,370
I should also persuade them
as much as I could.

83
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,139
We looked at it until our eyes
got dry and almost popped out...

84
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:40,449
and put everything together
with so much effort.

85
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,680
I hope it goes well.

86
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,420
You make that look so delicious.

87
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,889
Come to think of it, we haven't had
a welcome dinner since you started.

88
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:55,089
Goodness, people don't have
company dinners anymore. I'm fine.

89
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,490
Have some food, too.

90
00:05:57,459 --> 00:05:58,600
Thank you.

91
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,970
Thank you.

92
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:28,129
Two days ago, you took me home...

93
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:30,329
after I got drunk, remember?

94
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,930
Right. Why do you suddenly ask
about that day?

95
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:39,069
By any chance, did...
Well, nothing happened, right?

96
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,310
Wait, does he remember?

97
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,949
Like what?

98
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,220
There was this moment,
and I wasn't sure...

99
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,050
if I was dreaming or if it was real.

100
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,189
Are you okay?

101
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,490
What was this moment
you weren't sure of?

102
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,060
Never mind. Later.

103
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,220
He must be talking about that.

104
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,129
It's not like I can tell him.

105
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,199
Why don't we clink our glasses
instead of clinking our lips?

106
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,610
What am I saying?
I must've gone crazy.

107
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:54,750
Gosh, I must be drunk.

108
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,310
I began to say total nonsense.

109
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,620
We should go.

110
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,779
So, it wasn't a dream.

111
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,120
What was that smile?

112
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:08,689
I'm suddenly craving a drink.

113
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,300
- Another bottle of drink, please.
- Sure.

114
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,769
Wait, you weren't supposed to drink.

115
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,110
Your mother told me.

116
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,379
I can take a glass or two of soju.

117
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,709
I deserve
this kind of small happiness.

118
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:29,079
You were completely knocked out
after half a bottle that day.

119
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:31,620
Well, that day, it was...

120
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,120
because I wasn't feeling well,
not because I was drunk.

121
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:37,860
I'm feeling great today, though.

122
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:40,860
We found the evidence, and...

123
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,230
I just feel great
about everything today.

124
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:01,210
My dear child, the apple of my eye.

125
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,480
I'll live the rest of my life...

126
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,220
for you.

127
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,399
What is it?

128
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,269
It seemed like Richard Han had
more information than we expected.

129
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,899
He had been digging up
other shell companies...

130
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,169
besides the one Mr. Goo showed you.

131
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:33,279
And you still don't know
who Richard Han is?

132
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,809
No, and it seemed quite suspicious
that he refused to do a video call.

133
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,389
Did Mr. Hwang say
he found the evidence?

134
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:44,490
I don't know. Yu Jin isn't home yet.

135
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,659
You should make a decision
by tomorrow.

136
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,669
A heart condition?

137
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,539
It must've been serious.

138
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:04,679
Well, the chairwoman saved me
from the brink of death.

139
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,610
So, I consider her my second mother.

140
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,750
My mom did such wonderful work.

141
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,320
Your second mother,
who gave you a heart.

142
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,789
Wait, that means
I'm your older sister.

143
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:21,929
I'm the older brother.

144
00:10:21,929 --> 00:10:24,529
- Why?
- I was born earlier.

145
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,230
- Show me your ID.
- I don't have it.

146
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,299
Also, why do you want to be
my older sister?

147
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,299
Aren't you sick
of having younger brothers?

148
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,600
Wouldn't it be nice to have
an older guy in your life?

149
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,940
"An older guy?"

150
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,549
It'd be nice
to have an older peer in my life.

151
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:44,149
Then, you can find one.

152
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:50,320
Right. I should date a guy
who was a year older than me.

153
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,830
You need to find a decent guy,
unlike that man last time...

154
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,789
Hey, don't bring that up again.

155
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:02,100
I already learned my lesson
deep inside my head...

156
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,169
No, deep inside my heart.

157
00:11:05,169 --> 00:11:06,240
I'm glad.

158
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,480
Right. When I was younger,
this guy I knew said...

159
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:17,309
he'd get heart surgery, too.

160
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:20,149
I wonder
if he's living a good life...

161
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:22,049
after a successful surgery.

162
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,950
He probably is, just like me.

163
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:25,990
I want to know.

164
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,690
Life happened,
so I had forgotten about him.

165
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:32,899
If you two were meant to meet,
you would, at least once.

166
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,830
It'd be nice to meet him
at least once.

167
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,100
He shared his luck with me, too.
He was a good kid.

168
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,870
- Was he your first love?
- No.

169
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,379
It was a trivial encounter,

170
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:47,450
but it was nice.

171
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,549
Let's have one last drink
before we go.

172
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:53,620
Okay.

173
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:55,919
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

174
00:12:10,169 --> 00:12:11,240
You came just now?

175
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:14,909
Did you drink?

176
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,610
Yes, I was a bit hungry after work.

177
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,950
- With who?
- Mr. Hwang.

178
00:12:21,009 --> 00:12:22,110
Just the two of you?

179
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,019
Other staff members
couldn't stay late.

180
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:29,649
All right. You could crave a cool
drink of beer after doing overtime.

181
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,389
How's putting the shredded file
back in one going?

182
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:35,490
If you were curious,
why didn't you help us out?

183
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,730
Mr. Hwang could've used
lots of help today.

184
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,899
I had a meeting
for the hotel yesterday,

185
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:43,470
and today, I felt under the weather,
so I came home early to rest.

186
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,370
What if they really put it together?

187
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,149
Bye.

188
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:00,620
Who were you talking to
about the shredded file?

189
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,919
- What are you talking about?
- You were on the phone...

190
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,720
in the break room, asking
what would happen if we put it together.

191
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,389
Was it about the shredded...

192
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:09,960
Do you enjoy
eavesdropping on my calls?

193
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,899
I wasn't eavesdropping.

194
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,899
You can't share work things
with random people.

195
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:17,169
I wasn't talking about
that shredded file or whatever.

196
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:20,000
Do you come to work
just to slander me?

197
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,440
- What?
- I'm not crazy.

198
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:26,809
Why would I share such
confidential information with another?

199
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,950
What did Mr. Hwang see in Se Young
that he decided to marry her?

200
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,639
Calm down.

201
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,549
No, that can't happen. Stop.

202
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,720
Then, would it kill me?

203
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,759
Are things not going well at work?

204
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,960
No, I found the evidence,
so everything would go well.

205
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,029
Gosh, I'm so glad.

206
00:14:22,669 --> 00:14:24,470
I believed in you.

207
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,639
And the chairwoman is
on your side, too.

208
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,169
- When do you receive training?
- Next week.

209
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,110
Thanks to you, I took great courage
in the latter years of my life.

210
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,350
That's so wonderful.

211
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:39,179
Shabu shabu is your favorite dish,
so I know you'll do well.

212
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,019
But you can't overstrain yourself.

213
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,990
Don't worry.

214
00:14:44,289 --> 00:14:45,759
I'll hire some staff,

215
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,990
and I also know
how to look after myself.

216
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,330
All right.

217
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,169
Now, take a good look.

218
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,000
This is the evidence
that you're behind everything.

219
00:15:02,139 --> 00:15:04,110
You're barging in without context.

220
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,980
You canceled the contracts
with our affiliated businesses,

221
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,950
abetted the forgery
of official papers,

222
00:15:09,049 --> 00:15:12,179
and usurped and destroyed
the evidence from Dubai.

223
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:16,149
I think the story is quite evident.

224
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,720
I commend you for your effort.

225
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,659
And the result
doesn't look so bad, either.

226
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:22,690
But I'm sorry.

227
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,330
The game has already ended.

228
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,970
- "Ended?"
- Then, please excuse me.

229
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,470
I have to be
at an important meeting.

230
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,840
Stop right there.
I'm not done talking to you!

231
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,580
I'm not done talking to you.

232
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,149
What did you mean,
the game has already ended?

233
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,559
Oh, there's Chairwoman Shin.

234
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,830
Come in, Mr. Goo.

235
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,600
- Mr. Hwang, wait here.
- Ms. Chairwoman.

236
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,279
But I'm sorry.

237
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,879
The game has already ended.

238
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,279
Wait, is the chairwoman giving him
the approval for the disposal?

239
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,090
You cannot go inside.

240
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,419
- Move aside.
- No, Mr. Hwang.

241
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,889
(Signed by: Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

242
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,789
President Hwang will
resist furiously.

243
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:33,029
Move aside!

244
00:16:33,029 --> 00:16:34,159
Mr. Hwang...

245
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:36,269
Move. Move aside!

246
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:43,669
Did you just sign
the disposal agreement?

247
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,950
This time, things went
as Richard Han wanted.

248
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:49,980
But tell him that
it won't be easy next time.

249
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,720
Yes, I'll relay your words to him.

250
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,120
Please excuse me.

251
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,740
Ms. Chairwoman, this isn't right.

252
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,980
I even found evidence
that Mr. Goo was behind this. How...

253
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,680
How can you
suddenly make this decision?

254
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,380
I'm sorry, Jin Goo.

255
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,819
But I made this decision
as Hyesung Group's chairwoman.

256
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,920
I hope you'll understand.

257
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,029
"Understand?"

258
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,029
You need to tell me
the reason first.

259
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,599
Give me a reason
so that I can understand!

260
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:46,799
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

261
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:51,940
I'll continue to dance
between Ji Seok and Jin Goo...

262
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,509
even after the business gets sold.

263
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:59,579
I don't know who'll take
Hyesung Group over at the moment.

264
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,859
Did she sign it?

265
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:10,130
Yes.

266
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,230
Congratulations.

267
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,099
- We're at work.
- You never cared about that.

268
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Shouldn't you worry more
about Hwang Jin Goo right now?

269
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,740
Keep a straight face.
Don't let him catch you.

270
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:23,640
Do you think he will?

271
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:29,109
I can't believe it.

272
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,319
It said we've been sold.
It must be true.

273
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,019
We went through so much trouble
to put the shredded file together.

274
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,490
How can this happen?

275
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,059
I'll send my resume
to other travel agencies.

276
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:41,930
You should start looking, too.

277
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,400
Why don't we wait
until the president gets here?

278
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,400
- Where's Mr. Hwang?
- He's not here.

279
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,539
Is it true
that the business is sold?

280
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:54,400
I guess so. How can this happen?

281
00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:00,440
- Mr. Hwang.
- Mr. Hwang.

282
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,809
It seemed like
you all heard the news.

283
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,079
How could our disposal
be decided this quickly?

284
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,119
We even found the evidence.

285
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,190
Have you met with the chairwoman?

286
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:15,289
I'm so sorry, everyone.

287
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,529
But I will find a measure...

288
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,900
to secure your next position.

289
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,079
Mr. Han, she signed
the disposal agreement.

290
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,420
Good work.

291
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,190
If we take the rest of the shares
other than what the chairwoman has,

292
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,529
that'll give us two more percent
in the entire Hyesung Group.

293
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,259
That'll get our total shares
up to ten percent.

294
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,069
Ms. Goo Ha Na is here.

295
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,200
Yes, sir. Goodbye. Yes.

296
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,609
How did you persuade the chairwoman?

297
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,049
Why did she decide
to sell the business?

298
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,250
Why are you asking me?

299
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,880
You're her daughter.
You can ask her yourself.

300
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,380
I thought it'd be more accurate
to hear it from the man...

301
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,160
who turned the evidence we put
back together into nothing.

302
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,190
Everything was already done.
Why is the reason so important?

303
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,190
I needed to know why it was done.

304
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,859
Only then would our staff
who worked hard...

305
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:29,000
to stop our business from disposal
feel less wronged!

306
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,269
That's all the more reason
not to come and ask me.

307
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,799
Yes, I did
make your evidence useless.

308
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,210
But Chairwoman Shin
probably has another intention...

309
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,809
for deciding to sell the business.

310
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,150
- What?
- Ask her yourself.

311
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,250
Ask her what weakness I found
that she had to sign the agreement.

312
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:47,819
But of course, she won't answer.

313
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:49,950
"Weakness?"

314
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,220
I'm...

315
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,160
here, Mr. Goo.

316
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,029
Wait a moment. I'll be done soon.

317
00:20:57,259 --> 00:20:58,359
Yes, Mr. Goo.

318
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,369
You may leave, Ms. Goo.

319
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:16,210
What did she say?
Was she mad because of the disposal?

320
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:22,920
What was that?

321
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,890
They seemed
much closer than I thought.

322
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,259
Did they become friends
while working together?

323
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,099
Why are you asking me?

324
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,599
You're her daughter.
You can ask her yourself.

325
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,400
Fine, I'll ask Mom.

326
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:43,509
(Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin)

327
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:45,339
- Who?
- Ms. Goo Ha Na.

328
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,049
She wants to talk to you
about your decision to sell the business.

329
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:55,420
Let her in.

330
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,019
I'm keeping
your identity a secret at work.

331
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,220
What if someone saw you here?

332
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,589
I'm sorry.

333
00:22:04,329 --> 00:22:07,400
I felt anxious,
so I came to ask you something.

334
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,329
Ask what?

335
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:14,000
I wanted to know why you agreed
to sell the business.

336
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,609
Why do you want to know that?

337
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:20,039
I already talked
to Jin Goo about that.

338
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,549
There was evidence,
but you suddenly decided to sell it.

339
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,250
Mr. Hwang didn't seem
to know the reason,

340
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,019
and Mr. Goo also wouldn't tell me.

341
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,490
I have a good reason
when I don't share something.

342
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:33,690
In that case, it's a good courtesy
to just let it slide.

343
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,390
I see. Right.

344
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,759
Ask her yourself.

345
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,569
Ask her what weakness I found
that she had to sign the agreement.

346
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,640
Does he really have
something on her?

347
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,009
Do you have any other questions?

348
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,109
What will happen
to the staff members?

349
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:57,579
They were all anxious
about their employment.

350
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:00,619
You're rather nosy.

351
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:04,119
You're my daughter.
You need to look at the big picture.

352
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,619
If you let personal feelings
get the best of you...

353
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,390
and don't know when to step in or not,
then you can't do anything big.

354
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,529
Refrain from visiting my office
in the future.

355
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,430
There are many eyes around.
We should be careful.

356
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,099
- Okay.
- I'll see you at home.

357
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:19,900
Okay.

358
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:42,859
Was it such a big mistake...

359
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,400
for a daughter to visit her mom?

360
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,670
What's wrong?

361
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,279
Were you heartbroken
about the disposal?

362
00:23:58,539 --> 00:23:59,640
No.

363
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,509
You don't know the reason yet,
do you?

364
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:05,420
On the surface, she said
it was because of the investment.

365
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,450
But I think there's another reason.

366
00:24:08,019 --> 00:24:12,160
Do you think someone holds
a weakness against the chairwoman?

367
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,619
"A weakness?"

368
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,630
Did you hear something?

369
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,160
No, I was just wondering.

370
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:23,529
I went to her office to ask for a reason,
but she got mad at me.

371
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,640
What if someone saw you?

372
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,740
Right?

373
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,769
I can't even call her my mom.

374
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,309
Why did I go there?

375
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:37,180
I'm sorry.

376
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,519
It's all right.

377
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,390
I was a little frustrated.

378
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:47,519
I wanted to speak to her casually,
but she still seemed distant.

379
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,200
I guess things must be
different at work than home.

380
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,359
I understand.

381
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,900
You're in need of customer service.

382
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:00,200
I think you need that
more than me today.

383
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,640
Why don't I make you
a cup of sweet coffee?

384
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,509
I'll have a cup.

385
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,210
One moment.

386
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:14,480
I'm sorry.

387
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:17,349
I made you stay up all night,
but it came down to this.

388
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,319
It wasn't even your fault.

389
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,559
- Have some.
- Thanks.

390
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,130
That's good.

391
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:30,970
If we can be this sweet...

392
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,869
Well, I meant...

393
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:40,910
it'd be great if things at work
could be this sweet.

394
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,809
Right. Yes.

395
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:44,809
That's what I want, too.

396
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,079
Then, let me make you some coffee.

397
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,049
No, I like it best when I make it.

398
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,500
I can't believe this.
What's the genre of this drama?

399
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,400
Total soap opera
around a family affair.

400
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,539
The younger brother sells
his older sister's business?

401
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,440
I've never heard
of anything like this.

402
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,349
I didn't think
Ji Seok could do so much damage.

403
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:17,710
Gosh, that sociopath.

404
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:20,920
It's frightening that
he and I share the same DNA.

405
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:24,349
Anyway, Ha Na won't have a problem
even if that company...

406
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,019
suddenly disappears, right?

407
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,759
Who'll mess
with the chairwoman's daughter?

408
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,700
Ji Seok must've known that
when he did this.

409
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,230
You're right. Innocent citizens
always end up suffering the most.

410
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,640
Right. Is everything going well
before the grand opening?

411
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,710
Of course. I'll probably
rake in money as soon as I open.

412
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,910
Once you do that,
what will you do for me?

413
00:26:45,609 --> 00:26:48,349
- What?
- Well...

414
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,150
Free coupons.

415
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,880
Or you can have a voucher
to get three bestselling fritters.

416
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,019
Forget that.

417
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,849
I'll keep siding with Ha Na.

418
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,519
See you on the day of the opening.

419
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,490
Hey, it's really good, though.

420
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,400
Don't tell Ji Seok!

421
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,470
I was suspicious
of that little kid she brought.

422
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:11,900
"Little kid?"

423
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,470
I told you that it was odd
how Yeo Jin was all over him.

424
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,809
Why does she care so much
about that completely strange kid?

425
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,349
It does seem odd
for a cold-blooded corporate raider...

426
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,420
to suddenly act like
she's now a humanitarianist.

427
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,750
Find out more about that kid.

428
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:32,490
How did she end up raising that kid?

429
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,430
And what did his parents do?
I want everything.

430
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:39,430
One moment.

431
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,670
Hello?

432
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,640
The disposal was finalized?

433
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:49,710
Did Richard Han...

434
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,910
hold you back
with his corporate raiding scheme?

435
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,279
Nothing good will come out
if those words get out now.

436
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,180
Both Jin Goo
and Se Young have no idea.

437
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,049
You're right.

438
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,950
Then, what will you do with Jin Goo?

439
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,160
He lost his travel agency,

440
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:09,089
so you should
bring him to the hotel.

441
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:13,500
You should drive out Mr. Goo
and put Jin Goo in his position.

442
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,630
I can't get rid of Mr. Goo.

443
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:18,869
Because of your corporate raiding?

444
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,839
Hey, wait.

445
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,279
Maybe Richard Han sent you
those death portrait photos.

446
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,549
Did he spread the rumor
of Yu Jin's death, too?

447
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:39,519
Goodness, would he start the rumor
on how you found Yu Jin, too?

448
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:42,359
"The rumor?"

449
00:28:42,529 --> 00:28:46,900
I'm so glad
Yu Jin is a grown-up now.

450
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:49,430
If she were as young as Eun Chong,
she could've been kidnapped or...

451
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,640
Goodness, Yeo Jin.

452
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:59,109
I'm just saying.

453
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,509
Who would kidnap
a grown-up like her?

454
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:11,119
Why did she look so startled
at the word kidnapping?

455
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,430
Was she worried about the boy,
not Goo Ha Na?

456
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,730
Where? Over there?

457
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,700
Where? Let's go.

458
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,099
Your mommy was very pretty.

459
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:28,839
Auntie Ha Na said
I took after my mommy.

460
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,609
Yes, you did.

461
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:35,809
What are you doing?

462
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,480
Nothing much.

463
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,619
- Go out and play. Go.
- Okay.

464
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,690
Why did Yeo Jin shudder
at the word kidnapping?

465
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:51,160
It'd make sense
if she was worried about that kid.

466
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,200
Don't you feel bad that
he doesn't have a mom? Be nicer to him.

467
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,039
Bang Ul, you can't afford
to worry about other people's kids.

468
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:01,769
Your son became unemployed.

469
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,069
What do you mean?

470
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,180
Why was Jin Goo unemployed?

471
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,640
Hyesung Tour would get sold.

472
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:07,910
What?

473
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,410
But Jin Goo said he found evidence,
so he'd be fine.

474
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,950
That evidence is useless now.

475
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:19,519
Yeo Jin reluctantly
had to make that choice,

476
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,990
so keep a straight face
when you're around her.

477
00:30:26,099 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, no.

478
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,309
It's ridiculous how the fake daughter
came with a kid.

479
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,539
It seems like
the fake daughter is just the front.

480
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,680
That kid seems like the real one.

481
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,119
Should I go through her room?

482
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,930
She still has
that ridiculous thing up there.

483
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,069
That means it must have
something to do with that kid.

484
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,910
She must have something here.

485
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,089
What's with this?

486
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:30,630
What is this?

487
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,960
What's this photo?

488
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,630
Wait.

489
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,569
She's...

490
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,309
Yu Jin.

491
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,809
By the way, what photo did you lose
to cause such a fuss?

492
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,680
Tell us,
and we can help you find it.

493
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,150
It's a photo of me, my mommy,

494
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,250
and Auntie Ha Na.

495
00:32:00,589 --> 00:32:01,619
Wait.

496
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,130
Then, this was the photo
she had lost?

497
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,769
Could it mean...

498
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:15,809
that you're Yu Jin's son?

499
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,150
Little Grandma, what are you doing?

500
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,210
(Cinderella Game)

501
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,980
Eun Chong might fall into danger
if the shell companies were exposed.

502
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,539
You were the real one.

503
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,980
You should be careful.
You found your daughter now.

504
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,250
Blackmailing won't work on me.

505
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,220
Everyone will become miserable
if you find out.

506
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,549
Can't you just stop here?

507
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:38,119
I'll go to the hotel.

508
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:40,759
I didn't expect him
to volunteer to work for me.

509
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:41,990
You're nearby?

510
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,789
You're crazy.
What if someone sees you?

511
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:47,630
Why is she seeing someone else
while dating Mr. Hwang?
