1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,970
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,179
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:08,449
Hello. My name is Lee Eun Chong
of Chamsae Class...

5
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:09,679
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:10,779
Hello.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,619
Are you Ms. Goo Ha Na,
his foster mother?

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,089
Yes, I'm his auntie.

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,129
This is nothing difficult.
You can just do things as usual.

10
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,059
You must be Eun Chong's family.

11
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,929
Yes, I'm his grandmother.

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,870
And I'm the second grandmother.

13
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,170
I'm his aunt.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,469
Then, we'll do the interview later.

15
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:35,439
Let me take a look
at his home environment.

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,479
Where's Eun Chong's room?

17
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:44,049
Who is it?

18
00:00:44,179 --> 00:00:46,049
Hello, we're the police.

19
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:48,750
"The police?"

20
00:00:50,189 --> 00:00:51,359
"The police?"

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,299
What brings you here?

22
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,269
We received a report
on child abuse in this home.

23
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,939
- "Child abuse?"
- "Child abuse?"

24
00:01:14,349 --> 00:01:16,579
That's impossible.
Nothing like that happened.

25
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:18,150
Something must've gone wrong.

26
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,879
Who made the report?

27
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,920
It was anonymous,
so we couldn't tell you that.

28
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,760
We heard the boy who lived here was
abused by his guardian.

29
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,129
Auntie Ha Na never abused me.

30
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,430
I don't know who this is,
but it's a misunderstanding.

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,730
Ma'am, this isn't true.

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,469
First, we need to question
the child away from you.

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,900
Let's have a little chat.

34
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,680
It's okay.
Answer his questions honestly. Okay?

35
00:01:50,379 --> 00:01:52,150
So, your name is Eun Chong?

36
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:54,650
How did you hurt your hand?

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,659
I spilled hot cocoa
and scalded myself.

38
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,689
I see.

39
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,959
Then, was your auntie with you?

40
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,829
No, she was away looking for Yali.

41
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,930
I spilled it myself and got scalded.

42
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,240
I see.

43
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,240
Did you learn what abuse means
at your kindergarten?

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,580
Did your auntie...

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,710
ever get mad at you, shout at you,

46
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,150
or hit you?

47
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,050
Auntie Ha Na never did that.

48
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,449
Then, did she punish you
when you did something wrong,

49
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,219
like giving you
a knuckle on your head?

50
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:33,860
Auntie Se Young gave me a knuckle.

51
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,090
"Auntie Se Young?"

52
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,330
How can this happen
on the day of the house visit?

53
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:43,199
Well, Yu Jin would never do that.

54
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,939
There might be something
we didn't know about.

55
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:48,639
Are you saying
Yu Jin may be abusing Eun Chong?

56
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,909
That's not what I mean.

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,050
It's not like we can install
CCTV cameras at home.

58
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:00,990
- And?
- I'm done talking to the boy.

59
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,590
Then, will Yu Jin...

60
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,060
have to go to the police station
for questioning?

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,259
No, the guardian didn't show
any signs of abuse.

62
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,199
She had a great bond
with the boy, too.

63
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,000
So, which one of you is
Ms. Yoon Se Young?

64
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,240
That's me. Why?

65
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,969
Have you hit Eun Chong recently?

66
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,069
No, never.

67
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,180
What? Why would Se Young hit him?

68
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,610
She adores him.

69
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,949
He said Auntie Se Young pushed him
off the bed and bruised him once,

70
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,280
and he was
knuckled on the head yesterday.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,960
Did you knuckle Eun Chong?

72
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,129
Well, I had a good reason.

73
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,759
The reason doesn't matter.
That behavior still counts as abuse.

74
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:47,930
How dare you lay a hand
on my grandson?

75
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,969
Mom.

76
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:53,710
Wait, if something like that
counts as child abuse,

77
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:56,009
how can anyone raise a child?

78
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,780
He was bruised by mistake
because Eun Chong surprised her...

79
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,180
when he snuck into Se Young's bed.

80
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,349
And she gave him a noogie
because she was surprised...

81
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,889
at a toy caterpillar
and gave him a light dab.

82
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,789
Hitting him on the head
still counts as child abuse.

83
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,430
It can hurt the child emotionally.

84
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,389
She didn't know that.

85
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,060
She didn't intend to abuse him.

86
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:22,000
In this situation,
I must reschedule my visit...

87
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,199
after the police investigation ends.

88
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,610
So? What will happen now?

89
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:33,079
We received a report
and found evidence of abuse.

90
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,120
Ms. Yoon Se Young,
you're now a suspect in this case.

91
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:39,180
- "Suspect?"
- "Suspect?"

92
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,790
A suspect?

93
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,720
A police investigation?

94
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:47,990
Mom, this is so unfair.

95
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,100
It's okay. They'll ask
a few questions and end it there.

96
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,459
You wouldn't get locked up
for giving him a noogie.

97
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:54,699
I'll go with you.

98
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:58,199
Why do I have to get questioned
by the police because of that kid?

99
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,709
I told you to be nice to Eun Chong!

100
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,879
Why did you hit him on the head
only to end up like this?

101
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:06,740
Jeez.

102
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:10,579
Aunt Yeo Jin was furious.

103
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:13,019
Go downstairs
and beg her for forgiveness.

104
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:15,449
I hit Eun Chong on the head,
not Yu Jin.

105
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,060
Aunt Yeo Jin is so weird.

106
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,360
You have no idea
who you messed with.

107
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,490
It'd be the best scenario
if she only got mad at you.

108
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,160
Who made the report?

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,269
Catch that punk
and lock him up for calumny!

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,509
Did Auntie Se Young
hit you on the head yesterday?

111
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,009
Yes.

112
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,240
Has she done that before?

113
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:45,319
You should've told me right away
when something like that happened.

114
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,790
You have to tell me everything
from now on.

115
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,459
Has she ever shouted at you?

116
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,699
Has she ever ruined your day
or broken your heart?

117
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:03,100
She always calls me a kid.

118
00:06:03,269 --> 00:06:04,569
And Little Grandma, too.

119
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,370
My name is Lee Eun Chong.

120
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,810
I'll tell them to address you
by your name from now on.

121
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,310
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

122
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,850
It's okay.

123
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,519
Why did this happen
on the day of the agency's visit?

124
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,790
You must be heartbroken.

125
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,519
We can do it again next time.

126
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,990
It's all right.

127
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,730
Then, let's not lose heart. Okay?

128
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:31,500
Anyway, who lied
and made that false report?

129
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,199
Gosh, I wonder.

130
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,769
Not many other than our family know
that you live here.

131
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:44,579
The adoption agency is
visiting their home today.

132
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,649
- Would he get adopted after that?
- Probably.

133
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,319
Did you make up with Ha Na, too?

134
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,889
I heard you told her to make sure
she adopted Eun Chong.

135
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:56,949
Yes, I hope she does.

136
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,389
Hey, should I call her
and ask how the visit went?

137
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,269
Hey, Ha Na. How did the visit go?

138
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,139
It got postponed? Why?

139
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,769
"Child abuse?"

140
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,110
And?

141
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,139
Gosh. Okay. Bye.

142
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,350
Ji Seok, this is huge.

143
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,779
Child abuse?
What are you talking about?

144
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:28,089
Ji Seok, do you think giving a kid
a noogie counts as child abuse?

145
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:29,990
You're probably asking
because it does.

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,089
Did someone give Eun Chong a noogie?

147
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,060
Give it back, please.

148
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,329
I don't want to.

149
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,000
Give it back.

150
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:48,170
- Move aside.
- That hurts!

151
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,410
Hey! Yoon Se Young!

152
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,279
You surprised me.

153
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,740
Are you okay?

154
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,449
Apologize to him.

155
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:58,620
I'm the one who needs the apology.

156
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,680
Apologize.

157
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,750
Otherwise,
I'll make a formal report...

158
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,089
of your child abuse,
including shoving him right now.

159
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,889
- Have you lost your mind?
- You hit his head and shoved him.

160
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,990
And you shouted at him
and mistreated him whenever you wanted!

161
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,430
Apologize for everything.

162
00:08:12,329 --> 00:08:13,459
I had a reason.

163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,970
I wouldn't do that
if he didn't bother me.

164
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,870
Hey, you tell her.

165
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:19,339
You're the problem.

166
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,569
- Just behave if you came with...
- Shut up!

167
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:24,009
Who do you think you are
to say that to Eun Chong?

168
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
You're the one
who's living off my family!

169
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,250
- What?
- I put up with you for a while...

170
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,620
because I didn't want
to cause drama at home.

171
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,419
But not anymore.

172
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,889
What did you put up with?

173
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,620
What you had to go through
couldn't compare to what I did!

174
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,919
Do you want to know
what I put up with?

175
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,490
You harassed me at work
until the moment I became Yu Jin.

176
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,559
Even after I became Yu Jin,

177
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,570
you still ignored me
and tormented me.

178
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,500
And you're now abusing Eun Chong
like you didn't harass me enough!

179
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,169
Forget me.
Why do you mess with Eun Chong?

180
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,870
Don't you know how damaging it is...

181
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,309
for a child to be abused as a kid?

182
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:00,980
You talk like you've been beaten up.

183
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:03,179
Yes, I got beaten up
through my childhood.

184
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,279
I was beaten every single day...

185
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,250
until I met Ji Seok's parents
when I was ten!

186
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,389
"Ten?"

187
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,529
What? Does she remember
when she was ten years old?

188
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,899
Do you know how frightening it is...

189
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,769
for a child to live
with an adult like you?

190
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,529
Why should Eun Chong feel
such anxiety because of you?

191
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,940
Who do you think you are
to hurt him like that?

192
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,610
Who do you think you are
to ignore and harass me?

193
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,279
I don't know about others,

194
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:33,840
but you can't do this to me.

195
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,519
What did I do?

196
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:40,379
You were with me...

197
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,620
when I disappeared.

198
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,289
I would've grown
with my mom and dad's love...

199
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,659
if I hadn't gone to the sea
with you on that day.

200
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,070
You said my disappearance
scarred you to this day.

201
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,000
You said you waited all your life
for me to return!

202
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,509
Did you really wait for my return?

203
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,679
But your actions told me...

204
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:08,110
that you probably hoped
I was dead...

205
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,850
and would never return!

206
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,980
Stop!

207
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,450
Stop putting on a show
and apologize!

208
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,159
Auntie Ha Na...

209
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,929
It's okay.

210
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,799
And stop calling him a kid
from now on.

211
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,230
He has a name, too!

212
00:10:27,529 --> 00:10:28,830
What's going on?

213
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,399
Oh, my. Se Young! What's wrong?

214
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,600
Do you feel unwell?

215
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,570
Why are you shouting at her
while she's like this?

216
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,539
Stand up.

217
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,149
Apologize, Se Young.

218
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,879
That's enough.

219
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,259
What's going on?

220
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,000
Did you two have a fight
over Eun Chong's business?

221
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:02,730
Mom...

222
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:17,750
I think Yu Jin remembers everything.

223
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,519
What would she remember?

224
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:24,090
If she did,
she would've told everything.

225
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,659
I think she's hiding it on purpose
to test me.

226
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,590
You're delusional again.

227
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:34,330
Is it that hard for you
to pretend to get along with her?

228
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:36,370
Why won't you listen to me, Mom?

229
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:38,740
I think she remembers everything.

230
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,639
- She's the actress, not me!
- Lower your voice.

231
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,980
Hello, Yeo Jin?

232
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,190
Yes.

233
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,820
Aunt Yeo Jin summoned us.

234
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,529
How could the words "child abuse"
come out from under my roof?

235
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,000
Have you hit him in the head
before this time?

236
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:13,100
No, that was
the first and the last time.

237
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,169
Be honest!

238
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,309
I've done it once before.

239
00:12:21,379 --> 00:12:24,080
How dare you touch
my precious grandson's head?

240
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:26,980
I just want
to snap her wrists in half.

241
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,250
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

242
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,190
Se Young is
looking back on her actions, too.

243
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,860
She won't do this again.

244
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,659
Yeo Jin,
please forgive her this once.

245
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,470
She should be forgiven
by Eun Chong and Yu Jin.

246
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,639
Last time, you bruised his face
and gave him a bump,

247
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,070
and now, you hit him in the head?

248
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,580
How can you hit this young kid?

249
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:57,649
We can't live in the same house
if you continue to cause problems.

250
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,090
Yeo Jin, I understand the situation,
but how can you say that?

251
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:05,919
To be frank,
he's not even your grandson.

252
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,389
He's Yu Jin's friend's son.

253
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:09,889
And he didn't have
a broken bone or anything.

254
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,159
How can you call
a noogie child abuse?

255
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,769
She wouldn't have done that
if he didn't do anything.

256
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,000
He always surprised Se Young,
so he played a part, too.

257
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,169
Things aren't working out,
so we'll have to live separately.

258
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,809
You should be
doing everything to humor her,

259
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:24,909
but you always chose to fight her.

260
00:13:24,909 --> 00:13:26,809
And now you're messing
with Eun Chong, too.

261
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:30,049
Did you think I was oblivious
because I stayed quiet?

262
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,779
I can see and hear everything.

263
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,580
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

264
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,419
Yu Jin and Eun Chong waited so much
for this adoption to happen.

265
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,289
The whole process was postponed
because of today!

266
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,659
The least you could do was
feel sorry,

267
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,789
but you refused to do that
and fought her?

268
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,000
Apologize to them
with all your heart.

269
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,700
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.
I won't do that again.

270
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm sorry, Yu Jin.

271
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,470
I truly apologize.

272
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,080
Okay.

273
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,679
Eun Chong, I'm sorry, too.

274
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,320
It's all my fault.

275
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,659
I'm the sinner
for not bringing Se Young up properly.

276
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:15,490
Make sure you get along with Yu Jin
and Eun Chong from now on.

277
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,830
If you don't think you can do that,
you can leave.

278
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,169
You said you were visiting
your uncle's business.

279
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,470
It's a cold day,
so have a safe trip.

280
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,039
- Okay.
- Okay.

281
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,309
- We're leaving.
- Okay.

282
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:34,610
Let's go.

283
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,120
You don't have to cry.

284
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,460
You'll end up crying tears of blood
for making my daughter cry.

285
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,330
I may even make...

286
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,500
your grandson join Yu Jin.

287
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,769
Auntie Ha Na, what is this?

288
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,539
This? It's called a trampoline.

289
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,179
I feel much lighter and better...

290
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:11,649
in my body and mind
after jumping on this.

291
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,649
Are you in a bad mood, Auntie Ha Na?

292
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,419
Something bad just happened, right?

293
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,720
I wanted to forget it right away.

294
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,389
Then, I want to try, too.

295
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:26,230
In that case,
let me show you an example.

296
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,429
Okay.

297
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,070
Hooray!

298
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,669
- What do you think about my jump?
- Awesome!

299
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:35,070
Like this. Jump.

300
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,840
- Is that fun, Auntie Ha Na?
- Yes, it's a lot of fun.

301
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,909
I can feel my stress melting away,

302
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,950
and it makes my body
and mind feel much lighter.

303
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,419
- Do you want to try, Eun Chong?
- Yes!

304
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,190
- All right!
- All right! This is fun!

305
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,090
- So? Isn't this fun, Eun Chong?
- It is!

306
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,159
Be careful.

307
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,070
It's so much fun!

308
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,299
I'll be at the restaurant.

309
00:16:03,769 --> 00:16:05,799
No, you don't have to come.

310
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,539
You have to move
the vegetables in, too.

311
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,539
The veggies will come daily.

312
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,379
Freshness is everything.

313
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,950
Then, let's eat dinner together.

314
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,279
Bye.

315
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,090
- Yay!
- Stop it.

316
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,519
- We have to go.
- No.

317
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,259
It's Eun Chong and Ha Na.

318
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,559
- Eun Chong.
- Yay.

319
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,860
- It's Mr. Hwang.
- Oh, my.

320
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:33,799
Hello, Mr. Hwang. Come here.

321
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,740
Why are you
suddenly in my neighborhood?

322
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,970
Oh, we stopped by
on our way to Ji Chang's place.

323
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:42,809
Did something bad happen?

324
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,379
Were you frustrated or stressed out?

325
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,580
How did you know, Mr. Hwang?

326
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,210
I have a way to tell.

327
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,450
What's going on?

328
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,659
Right, the adoption agency
was supposed to visit today.

329
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,059
Did it go well?

330
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:02,629
Well...

331
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,970
There was a problem with the process,
so it got postponed.

332
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,369
What was the problem?

333
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,009
I think we can share it with him.

334
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,680
Why don't we go
to your brother's business first?

335
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:29,789
Okay.

336
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:35,359
Wait, who made a report like that?

337
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,200
Not a lot of people know
Eun Chong lives there.

338
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,329
Right? I found that odd, too.

339
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:43,529
And it was weird
how I lost my photo.

340
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,240
Yes, I found the photo
in my mom's room.

341
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,609
In the chairwoman's room?

342
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,079
- I found it.
- You did?

343
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,410
Eun Chong found it
in her vanity table drawer...

344
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,910
during a treasure hunt.

345
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,349
But Mom didn't know anything
about it.

346
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,519
I wonder.

347
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,490
You wanted to adopt him immediately,
but it got postponed again.

348
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,819
- We'll have another chance.
- We'll have another chance.

349
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,900
Aren't you going to tell him
about Auntie Se Young?

350
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,230
What about Auntie Se Young?

351
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,369
You were with me...

352
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,380
when I disappeared.

353
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,980
But your actions told me...

354
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:29,950
that you probably hoped
I was dead...

355
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,750
and would never return!

356
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,119
She clearly remembers something.

357
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,920
But how much does she remember?

358
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:45,029
Did you think I was oblivious
because I stayed quiet?

359
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:46,599
I can see and hear everything.

360
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:51,369
Wait, is Aunt Yeo Jin
feigning ignorance...

361
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:52,769
even though she knows everything?

362
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:56,039
I need to know what's going on
to come up with a measure.

363
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:30,240
You could ask Se Young
about what happened to her.

364
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:31,910
You're making me curious.

365
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:38,049
Ta-da.
The fried chicken is on the house.

366
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:40,250
Your business is thriving.

367
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,519
It's in a great location,
and the interior is pretty, too.

368
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,890
But it tastes even more beautiful.

369
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:45,859
Agreed.

370
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,890
You can order more food
if you need anything.

371
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,259
Okay.

372
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,000
We said we'd be casual like friends
outside the office.

373
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,670
Is today day one, then?

374
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:58,500
Right. Sure.

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,069
Hey, friend.

376
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04,579
Hey.

377
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,609
Gosh, I can't do this.

378
00:20:07,609 --> 00:20:09,680
How can I speak casually to my boss?

379
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,220
It'll be weird if I go casual alone.
Then, let's take our time.

380
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:15,720
Did you two become friends?

381
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,920
- Yes.
- Yes, we did. But it's not so easy.

382
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,230
I learned the telepathy game
at the kindergarten. Do you want to play?

383
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,859
- "The telepathy game?"
- "The telepathy game?"

384
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,670
Baseball or soccer?

385
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:29,730
- Soccer!
- Baseball!

386
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,369
Flour cake or rice cake?

387
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:32,400
- Flour cake!
- Rice cake!

388
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,109
Honestly speaking, I like both.

389
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,809
Yes, me, too.

390
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,450
We can't play the game like that.

391
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,420
This time, let's try
to get on the same page, my friend.

392
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,549
Okay. Yes.

393
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,049
- Pouring sauce or dipping sauce?
- Dipping!

394
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:50,490
- Custard cream or red bean filling?
- Red bean filling!

395
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,359
Cats or dogs?

396
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:54,390
- Cats!
- Cats!

397
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:56,589
Me, too!

398
00:20:56,759 --> 00:20:57,859
You, too, Eun Chong.

399
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,859
We had something in common.

400
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,269
- That was fun.
- That was.

401
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:05,640
- Where did you learn that?
- At the kindergarten.

402
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,200
Which kindergarten?

403
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:09,170
Chamsae Kindergarten!

404
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:10,910
Great job.

405
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:15,609
The disposal went well, so you, me,
and Danny should grab a bite to eat.

406
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,250
- Think of something.
- Yes, sir.

407
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,490
You said not to find evidence
of Chairwoman Shin's daughter's death.

408
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,960
But you were adamant
about finding it.

409
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,829
Did you find it?
Or did you decide not to?

410
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,730
- I'll just watch her for a while.
- Why?

411
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,269
I wanted her...

412
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,369
to enjoy her life as Cinderella
a little longer.

413
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,509
And I wanted my siblings
to live easier lives.

414
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:48,210
It'll be fun to make use
of my enemy's money like that.

415
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,349
I think I understand how you feel.

416
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:54,220
You still care very much
about your older sister.

417
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,619
But I'm an awful brother.

418
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:59,319
I hoped to see you feel
more comfortable with your sister.

419
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:02,230
Then, you'd be able to live
with a lighter heart...

420
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,930
and more human touch in your life.

421
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,829
Will I ever see a day like that?

422
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,769
When that day comes,
the first thing I'll do is...

423
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,710
introduce my family to you.

424
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,380
That day will come, and I'll wait.

425
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,950
They can't confirm the status
of my grandson's child abuse report?

426
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,319
No, you aren't present
on his family relation certificate,

427
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:33,359
so they can't confirm
that you're his grandmother.

428
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,559
What is this nonsense?

429
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:37,390
I'm his grandmother,
yet I can't do a thing?

430
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,099
- So, only Ms. Goo can do something?
- Yes, ma'am.

431
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,769
And the social worker in charge.

432
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,200
Whoever has parental rights
and custody has the most power.

433
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,509
There's no legal problem...

434
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:52,180
even if she refuses to show her son
to his grandmother.

435
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:55,950
If Ms. Goo gets
his parental rights and custody,

436
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,150
that means
all rights over Eun Chong...

437
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,779
- only belong to her?
- Yes, ma'am.

438
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,349
Even if I want to see him,

439
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,349
I can't do that
if she refuses to show him to me.

440
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:06,690
That may be the worst-case scenario.

441
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,990
That can't happen. He's my grandson.

442
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:13,730
It might be for the better
that the house visit got postponed.

443
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:18,740
Let's drag out the adoption
as much as we can for now.

444
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,140
Yes, ma'am.

445
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:26,440
How dare she tell me
to move out of her place?

446
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:31,109
I spent years serving that woman.

447
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:35,349
Do I have to live like a servant,
trying to humor her?

448
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,089
You need to
until you get Hyesung for yourself.

449
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,289
Don't worry about your daughter.
They'll let her go after an inquiry.

450
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,329
Make it look like the officers
got the address confused...

451
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,329
with the child abuse report.

452
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,400
- Otherwise, I'll draw suspicion.
- Okay.

453
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:54,910
Thanks to your daughter,
you have some time before the adoption.

454
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:57,140
I have to kick out
that fake daughter...

455
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,980
before she moves further
in the adoption process.

456
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:02,250
Anyway, that kid would
want to go with his aunt.

457
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,180
This wouldn't be easy.

458
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,619
Then, what?
Is there a way around this?

459
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:10,519
We'll have to let him
join his mother.

460
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:19,160
I'm back, Yeo Jin.

461
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:20,730
Where are the kids?

462
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,730
They aren't back yet.

463
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:28,039
So, I bought a scarf that you like.

464
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:30,769
Why did you get my present?

465
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,640
I'm not the one
you need to help feel better.

466
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,150
I got something
for Eun Chong and Yu Jin, too.

467
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:39,119
The robot I promised him
after the treasure hunt was all sold out,

468
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,819
so I had to go around
looking for this.

469
00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:44,789
He'll be happy.

470
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,160
Don't be so mad, Yeo Jin.

471
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,059
I know Yu Jin is here now.

472
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:54,329
But you and I lived together
all our lives.

473
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,269
You must've felt awful
after saying that to me.

474
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,569
We might be sisters-in-law,

475
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:04,369
but we lived
like we were real sisters.

476
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,039
Once Se Young gets married,

477
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,279
you know you're the only one
I can depend on in this life.

478
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,250
Have a good talk with Se Young.

479
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,119
Why can't she find her peace?
Why is she so sensitive?

480
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:17,619
Is there a problem
between her and Jin Goo?

481
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:20,589
Goodness, no. I'll talk to her.

482
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,359
We're home.

483
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,730
Hey, Eun Chong.

484
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,799
Come on in.

485
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:30,670
I got you the present
from the treasure hunt. Here.

486
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,900
Gosh, it's the transforming robot.

487
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,109
- Thank you.
- Sure.

488
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,180
And this is for you, Yu Jin.

489
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,049
I got you a muffler.
It's 100 percent cashmere.

490
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,279
You didn't have to do this for me.

491
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,619
- Here.
- Thank you.

492
00:25:48,619 --> 00:25:49,950
Good for you, Eun Chong.

493
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,859
I don't know how much you know,

494
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:58,930
but I won't go down that easily.

495
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,769
Hey, you were home.

496
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,000
Yes.

497
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:12,910
- Did you have fun?
- Yes.

498
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:17,150
Right. I got some tteokbokki.
You should have some.

499
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:18,680
I see.

500
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,250
We should visit his business
one of these days.

501
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,619
Okay.

502
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,859
You can come with us, Aunt Yeo Jin.

503
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,289
Yes, you should.

504
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,059
Okay.

505
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,900
We should get changed.

506
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,000
Let's go.

507
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:44,539
You aren't present
on his family relation certificate,

508
00:26:45,009 --> 00:26:47,509
so they can't confirm
that you're his grandmother.

509
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:51,309
I'm a grandmother
who can't do anything.

510
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,559
Se Young lost her spirit
after Mom had a talk with her.

511
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,000
So, why did she mess with Eun Chong?

512
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:13,099
Stop!

513
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,240
Apologize to Eun Chong now!

514
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:20,109
Something like that happened
with the hat, too.

515
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,180
Why would she always shudder
whenever I mentioned I was lost?

516
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,450
Did something happen
at the time of my disappearance?

517
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:43,529
Be nice to Yu Jin and Eun Chong.

518
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,470
That's the only way
we won't get kicked out.

519
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,210
Do you want coffee?

520
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,069
No, I want water.

521
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,880
You know everything, don't you?

522
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:57,950
When will you drop the bomb?

523
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,849
Let me repeat what I said before.
I didn't think you heard me.

524
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:05,720
- What?
- Don't call Eun Chong a kid.

525
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:07,589
If you want to call him,
use his name.

526
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,789
Right. Okay.

527
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,160
Please tell Aunt Myung Ji, too.

528
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,259
Or should I talk to her?

529
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:15,829
No, I'll tell her.

530
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,400
Okay.

531
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,410
Do you have something to say?

532
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,779
By any chance, do you...

533
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,750
Never mind.

534
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,230
So, I included a cruise trip
to let mothers and daughters...

535
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,500
make great memories in a unique way.

536
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,630
- "A cruise trip?"
- Yes.

537
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:52,640
My recommendation is Uido.

538
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,670
I once went there on a ship
from Seongbuk Port...

539
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:58,339
- when I was a kid.
- "Seongbuk Port?"

540
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,480
That was where Yu Jin went missing.

541
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,049
It's not too far from Seoul,
and the place has a great sunset.

542
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,049
It looks exotic, so...

543
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,559
She must know everything
if she knows Seongbuk Port.

544
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,329
She's acting like she doesn't know
even though she does.

545
00:29:20,529 --> 00:29:22,569
She's trying
to stress me out to death.

546
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,240
(Jin Goo)

547
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,549
Se Young.

548
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,849
What's wrong?
Why are you trembling like this?

549
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:49,289
- Mom, you don't believe me, do you?
- What?

550
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,559
Yu Jin already knew
we went to Seongbuk Port.

551
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:54,000
"Seongbuk Port?"

552
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,130
How would she know that?

553
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,339
Because she remembered everything!

554
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,700
No, it was a coincidence.

555
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,140
Leave my room
if you won't believe me.

556
00:30:05,809 --> 00:30:07,980
She was fine for a while.
Why is she doing this again?

557
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:09,779
Good grief.

558
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,380
Leave Yu Jin to me.

559
00:30:13,549 --> 00:30:16,049
Just pay attention to Eun Chong.

560
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,960
Mom, you have to believe me.

561
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,589
She knows everything
but is pretending like she doesn't,

562
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,029
and Aunt Yeo Jin, too!

563
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,869
Why did you think
she told us to move out?

564
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:33,970
Mom, why would she tell me to leave
just for giving Eun Chong a noogie?

565
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:36,569
She wanted to kick us out
because she knew everything.

566
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,910
We have to run away first, Mom.

567
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,109
- Mom...
- Okay.

568
00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:43,049
You can't go on like this.

569
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,480
You need to see the doctor again.

570
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,380
Give me a moment.

571
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,720
Here. Take your medicine.

572
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,359
- Now, take it.
- No!

573
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,529
What's with you?

574
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:14,539
I didn't do it!

575
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,650
What was that?

576
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:26,589
Go away.

577
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:30,359
- Se Young.
- It wasn't my fault.

578
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,529
No! It wasn't me.

579
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:35,769
Se Young!

580
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:44,640
Were you dreaming?

581
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,650
What's wrong? It's me.

582
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:56,849
It'll be much better
if you just dream about it,

583
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,690
because it'll soon become
your reality.

584
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:02,460
I remembered everything you did...

585
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:04,930
twenty years ago.

586
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,039
I'm so sorry.

587
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:14,799
I apologize.

588
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:18,839
- What's wrong?
- I apologize.

589
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:22,309
Please forgive me. Please.

590
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,680
I'm sorry...

591
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,319
Se Young, get a grip on yourself.

592
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,890
I'm sorry...

593
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,809
(Cinderella Game)

594
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,450
She knows everything.
She's just testing us, Mom.

595
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,049
Get a grip on yourself!

596
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,690
No, you get a grip on yourself!

597
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,019
My daughter is
on the verge of death,

598
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,920
- but you three look so happy.
- Here.

599
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,420
Who made the child abuse report?

600
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,630
It might have been Aunt Yeo Jin.

601
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,660
She might have wanted me
to undergo a police investigation.

602
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,829
Should I help you
with Eun Chong's adoption?

603
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,400
I'm thinking of processing it
without telling Mom.

604
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,269
I'll end up dying with stress
if I stay here.

605
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,240
I'm going east.

606
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,670
