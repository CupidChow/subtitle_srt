1
00:00:01,577 --> 00:00:04,779
Back then, Mr. Hwang was just a young boy who was my age,

2
00:00:05,179 --> 00:00:07,848
but he was really clever and nice.

3
00:00:08,618 --> 00:00:09,789
He was like that.

4
00:00:10,488 --> 00:00:13,828
Jin Goo was always brave while fighting his illness.

5
00:00:14,328 --> 00:00:17,999
That ten-year-old kid went through the surgery bravely.

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:23,269
But I felt so bad whenever I thought of the chairwoman.

7
00:00:23,498 --> 00:00:24,768
What? Why?

8
00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:28,269
What do you mean? Because she lost you.

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,608
Back then?

10
00:00:31,638 --> 00:00:32,808
The water is boiling.

11
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:38,049
But she said...

12
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:41,418
she lost me when I was seven.

13
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:47,129
Auntie Ha Na, is Yali here?

14
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:49,058
No, she's not here.

15
00:00:50,858 --> 00:00:52,097
She's not in the master bedroom, either.

16
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:54,128
She must be hiding in some corner.

17
00:00:54,129 --> 00:00:56,499
I want to play with Yali.

18
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:59,238
Do you want to find her with me? Okay.

19
00:01:03,678 --> 00:01:05,838
Where are you, Yali? Come and have a treat.

20
00:01:05,948 --> 00:01:07,977
It's such a wonder.

21
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:09,948
She's not in her usual hiding places.

22
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:12,648
She didn't go outside, did she?

23
00:01:12,818 --> 00:01:14,617
No, she's still home.

24
00:01:14,618 --> 00:01:15,688
Could she be in the utility room?

25
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,689
Yali!

26
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:20,028
Goodness. Ms. Goo, can you go...

27
00:01:20,029 --> 00:01:23,097
to Jin Goo's room and look under his bed?

28
00:01:23,098 --> 00:01:25,129
- Right. Okay. - Okay.

29
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:41,309
Let's not think about that.

30
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:44,079
Yali.

31
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:45,749
Yali?

32
00:01:46,588 --> 00:01:48,219
I don't think she's here, either.

33
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,458
Hey.

34
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:57,228
- That's... - You're right. It's that camcorder.

35
00:01:57,358 --> 00:01:59,969
I took it out to show you when you got here.

36
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:05,038
Gosh, I can't believe I get to see this again.

37
00:02:07,209 --> 00:02:09,378
I was reunited with this after 20 years.

38
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,778
Let me show you the footage I took...

39
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,608
- at the hospital back then. - Okay.

40
00:02:16,749 --> 00:02:18,649
Gosh, why do I feel nervous?

41
00:02:19,018 --> 00:02:20,589
Am I about to see my darkest history?

42
00:02:21,788 --> 00:02:23,518
Everyone has a dark history.

43
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:25,758
Take a look.

44
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,659
There's young Goo Ha Na, the ten-year-old with bobbed hair.

45
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,828
All right. Look here.

46
00:02:32,328 --> 00:02:33,498
Stop it.

47
00:02:33,499 --> 00:02:35,767
Say something to Hwang Jin Goo.

48
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:37,298
Stop filming me.

49
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,709
- Come on. - Stop filming me.

50
00:02:40,268 --> 00:02:41,838
I looked so embarrassed.

51
00:02:41,839 --> 00:02:45,209
- Say something. - Well, I looked shabby back then.

52
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,779
- No, you look pretty. - Stop filming me.

53
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,719
You did that on purpose.

54
00:02:57,489 --> 00:02:58,618
Why don't we stop here?

55
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,659
No, it's all right.

56
00:03:02,489 --> 00:03:04,357
You helped me back then...

57
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,368
by using all those difficult words.

58
00:03:06,369 --> 00:03:07,499
Do you remember that?

59
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,698
Of course.

60
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:11,968
I thought you were very smart and brave,

61
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:15,038
although you seemed to be around my age.

62
00:03:16,038 --> 00:03:19,548
I was grateful, found it odd, and got a little jealous, too.

63
00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:21,279
I must've been cool since then.

64
00:03:22,149 --> 00:03:24,478
You were also pretty back then, Ms. Goo.

65
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,219
Especially when you smiled.

66
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,288
I was?

67
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:33,357
I spent more days crying than smiling.

68
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,788
But you smiled a lot at me.

69
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:42,629
Goodness.

70
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,239
What? What's going on?

71
00:03:58,619 --> 00:03:59,788
What's wrong?

72
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:04,219
My goodness! Did you touch this? My gosh.

73
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:05,887
- Eun Chong. - My goodness.

74
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,387
- What do I do? - Oh, no!

75
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,888
- Are you in a lot of pain? - Wait.

76
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:10,728
- Get something. - We need ice.

77
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,698
- Ice. - Goodness. Right here.

78
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,369
- My gosh. - Stand here.

79
00:04:14,568 --> 00:04:18,567
My gosh. It must've hurt a lot. This is bad.

80
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:20,067
Oh, no.

81
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,268
Here's ice.

82
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:28,947
Was it the hot cocoa?

83
00:04:28,948 --> 00:04:31,749
He spilled the hot cocoa while trying to find Yali.

84
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:34,017
He needs to go to the emergency room.

85
00:04:34,018 --> 00:04:35,548
Yes. Hurry up, Jin Goo.

86
00:04:35,549 --> 00:04:37,318
- Eun Chong. - Eun Chong, let's go.

87
00:04:38,018 --> 00:04:39,157
Goodness, this is bad.

88
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,488
What do we do?

89
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,328
My gosh. What do we do now?

90
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:45,729
How's the adoption process going?

91
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:48,429
They'll come for a visit this week.

92
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:52,169
I'll relay additional information to Ms. Goo.

93
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,439
All right. Make sure you prepare everything.

94
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,479
Is there something you want to say?

95
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,609
I was a little worried.

96
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,549
Once she adopts him,

97
00:05:02,708 --> 00:05:05,349
it's a good thing for Eun Chong that he has a mom now.

98
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,689
Once Eun Chong comes of age and begins the succession process,

99
00:05:10,218 --> 00:05:12,318
Ms. Goo's presence may become a hindrance...

100
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,028
between you and him.

101
00:05:17,099 --> 00:05:18,929
I thought about that, too.

102
00:05:20,328 --> 00:05:22,729
I should do something for her in return...

103
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:24,369
for raising my grandson.

104
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,539
If Ms. Goo found out she was a fake daughter,

105
00:05:29,239 --> 00:05:32,039
she might end up taking the parental right...

106
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,648
and custody over Eun Chong.

107
00:05:33,679 --> 00:05:37,119
Would she betray me if she found out...

108
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:38,918
she wasn't Yu Jin?

109
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,619
You should be ready for the worst-case scenario.

110
00:05:43,258 --> 00:05:46,528
But Eun Chong desperately wanted to be adopted.

111
00:05:48,559 --> 00:05:50,999
- Please get it ready for now. - Yes, ma'am.

112
00:05:57,999 --> 00:05:59,669
- You're here, Jin Goo. - Yes.

113
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:03,438
Ms. Jang would've gone to pick you up. You're back already?

114
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:04,578
Is he asleep?

115
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:10,818
What happened to his hand? Was he hurt?

116
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,749
He spilled hot cocoa and got scalded.

117
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,887
How bad was it?

118
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:17,817
It was a first-degree burn. Thankfully, it wasn't serious.

119
00:06:17,818 --> 00:06:20,158
How could you use the word thankful after a kid got hurt?

120
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,897
Why weren't you paying attention?

121
00:06:22,898 --> 00:06:25,999
If you went out with a kid, you should've kept your eyes on him!

122
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:29,129
Ms. Chairwoman.

123
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:33,539
Yes, right.

124
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:35,408
I was too worked up.

125
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:40,208
It wasn't Yu Jin's fault.

126
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:43,049
He spilled hot cocoa trying to find Yali.

127
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,249
What is it, Yeo Jin?

128
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,619
My gosh! What happened to his hand?

129
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:50,789
Lay him down in the room.

130
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:57,059
Here.

131
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,768
It must sting, burn, and feel painful.

132
00:07:08,268 --> 00:07:09,439
It's all my fault.

133
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:10,939
Don't be so hard on yourself.

134
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:13,349
Kids can get hurt instantly.

135
00:07:13,448 --> 00:07:16,479
Exactly. I already knew he could get hurt if I looked away.

136
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:19,789
All mothers blame themselves when their kids get hurt,

137
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:21,289
but don't do that.

138
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:24,419
He got hurt while playing at my place,

139
00:07:24,789 --> 00:07:27,327
- so I felt even sorrier. - It's all right.

140
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:30,328
You shouldn't mind what the chairwoman said.

141
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,169
She must've been that concerned about Eun Chong.

142
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,838
It must've hurt so much to burn his flesh.

143
00:07:42,638 --> 00:07:46,179
Even adults have a hard time dealing with pain from scalding.

144
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:51,249
My gosh. What if that leaves a scar, Yeo Jin?

145
00:07:53,189 --> 00:07:54,688
There were enough adults at their place.

146
00:07:54,689 --> 00:07:57,088
Why weren't they paying attention to one kid?

147
00:08:00,429 --> 00:08:03,929
How sad. Your dear grandson got hurt.

148
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:06,729
You'll want to sit next to him right now.

149
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:09,028
It must be tough to hold yourself back.

150
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,809
Was he badly scalded?

151
00:08:20,408 --> 00:08:21,479
Where are you going?

152
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:23,648
Didn't I tell you? I'm meeting my friends.

153
00:08:24,018 --> 00:08:25,479
They told me to treat them before the wedding.

154
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:27,288
Do I have to go?

155
00:08:27,648 --> 00:08:29,548
I'll save you until next time.

156
00:08:29,688 --> 00:08:30,819
All right.

157
00:08:32,418 --> 00:08:35,028
Did the meeting go well last night?

158
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:38,198
Yes, of course. I think things will work out.

159
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,028
Ms. Yoon didn't come.

160
00:08:42,028 --> 00:08:43,138
I'm glad.

161
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,407
Don't worry. He'll get better soon.

162
00:08:50,408 --> 00:08:51,479
Yes.

163
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:53,108
Right. Please relay my suggestion...

164
00:08:53,109 --> 00:08:55,778
to that marketing team leader from New York.

165
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,979
What do you mean?

166
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,148
I heard the marketing team leader from New York was in Seoul,

167
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:04,359
so I said it might be a good idea to schedule a tour.

168
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:05,589
That sounds great.

169
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:08,428
You two both work for the hotel, so it'll be a win-win situation.

170
00:09:08,489 --> 00:09:10,298
I'll ask when I get to work.

171
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,199
- I'm leaving. - I'll go with you.

172
00:09:13,629 --> 00:09:15,268
- Goodbye, then. - Bye.

173
00:09:15,469 --> 00:09:16,638
Goodbye.

174
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,609
I guess he doesn't know anything.

175
00:09:27,949 --> 00:09:30,018
Right. You should go first, Jin Goo.

176
00:09:30,719 --> 00:09:31,918
Should I tag along?

177
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,688
It's been a while since I met your friends. It'll be a surprise.

178
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:35,849
Do you want to do that?

179
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:38,458
Wait, I'm sorry.

180
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,328
We're doing something like a bridal shower.

181
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,359
- Where are you guys meeting? - That's a secret.

182
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:43,959
I'll call you after.

183
00:09:51,099 --> 00:09:53,038
What are you thinking, Jin Goo?

184
00:09:53,538 --> 00:09:55,109
She must've been with her friends.

185
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:59,008
And yesterday, something urgent must've come up before the meeting.

186
00:10:02,349 --> 00:10:03,949
(Head Director's Office)

187
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,388
What could her weakness be?

188
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,428
Well, she seems weird.

189
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:16,999
She's in such peace even after betraying Jin Goo.

190
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,569
All she ever does is play with that kid.

191
00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:21,928
He must be a lucky kid.

192
00:10:22,668 --> 00:10:24,538
He gets so much love from my aunt...

193
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,468
just because he's Yu Jin's friend's son.

194
00:10:26,469 --> 00:10:29,908
It's not just Ha Na. I now have that kid as my superior.

195
00:10:30,609 --> 00:10:33,849
At times, it feels like he has the most power at my place.

196
00:10:34,308 --> 00:10:36,048
Chairwoman Shin adores Eun Chong?

197
00:10:37,449 --> 00:10:39,249
But her fake daughter brought that kid home.

198
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,349
Eun Chong is Du Na's son.

199
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,888
And Du Na was a friend she met at the children's home.

200
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:50,329
Hwang Jin Goo went to St. Paul's Home two days in a row?

201
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:52,257
Yes, according to Zero,

202
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,499
his car navigator was set to that address.

203
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:57,368
Yesterday, Chairwoman Shin must've gone there with him.

204
00:10:57,369 --> 00:10:59,768
Yes, I'm sure she's looking for her daughter.

205
00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:03,038
Du Na was from that children's home, too.

206
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:06,609
What if she used a different name that wasn't Yoon Yu Jin?

207
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:08,109
Wait,

208
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:10,518
is Du Na...

209
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,188
actually Yoon Yu Jin?

210
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:23,928
Danny, where are you?

211
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:26,729
You said there were no articles that included photos...

212
00:11:26,869 --> 00:11:28,369
among the ones you found.

213
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,839
No, the photos were all taken down.

214
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,569
Can you look up articles in the actual newspaper...

215
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,709
or the missing child flyer?

216
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,037
Do you want to confirm her looks?

217
00:11:37,038 --> 00:11:38,178
I have a feeling...

218
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:41,548
Eun Chong is Chairwoman Shin's grandson.

219
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:44,017
The boy your sister raises, her friend's son?

220
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:46,378
Yes, his mother is someone named Lee Du Na...

221
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,819
from the children's home.

222
00:11:48,119 --> 00:11:51,158
She disappeared when she was ten, and she has lost her memories.

223
00:11:51,188 --> 00:11:52,188
That's the same age...

224
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,358
as the initial report on her disappearance.

225
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,688
She must've gone to the children's home after receiving the delivery...

226
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,129
because of Lee Du Na.

227
00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:01,267
If Eun Chong turns out to be her grandson...

228
00:12:01,268 --> 00:12:03,469
Your sister comes into the picture to protect her grandson.

229
00:12:04,538 --> 00:12:05,869
I'm seeing the plot here.

230
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,938
I need to confirm if Lee Du Na is...

231
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:12,879
really Yoon Yu Jin.

232
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:18,479
It must hurt.

233
00:12:19,579 --> 00:12:20,819
I'm sorry, Eun Chong.

234
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:24,219
No, I'm sorry. I should've been careful.

235
00:12:24,359 --> 00:12:26,959
I wish I could suffer in your place.

236
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:30,329
Don't scratch it no matter how itchy it gets.

237
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:32,128
Okay.

238
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:34,928
Ms. Bang Ul must be worried, too.

239
00:12:35,398 --> 00:12:37,168
I called her and said you were fine.

240
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,938
Grandma, when will I get adopted?

241
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:45,709
The agency will check our situation at home this week.

242
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:46,908
All right!

243
00:12:48,249 --> 00:12:50,949
- Ms. Jang told you, right? - Yes.

244
00:12:51,719 --> 00:12:53,819
Right. Mom.

245
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,888
You lost me when I was seven, right?

246
00:12:57,489 --> 00:13:00,028
Yes, why do you ask?

247
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:03,258
Did you hear something?

248
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,829
Mr. Hwang got his heart surgery when he was ten years old,

249
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,999
and I heard you had a tough time after losing me back then.

250
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:15,538
- Did Ms. Sim tell you that? - Yes.

251
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:18,879
I did have a tough time back then.

252
00:13:19,479 --> 00:13:22,148
I kept getting calls about girls who looked like you,

253
00:13:22,508 --> 00:13:24,648
but they weren't you.

254
00:13:26,888 --> 00:13:27,949
I see.

255
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:31,959
Eun Chong should take a break from kindergarten until he's better.

256
00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:33,959
Then, who will I stay home with?

257
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:36,288
Auntie Ha Na will have to go to work.

258
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:39,158
You can stay with me.

259
00:13:39,229 --> 00:13:40,428
Okay!

260
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:46,709
Did Ha Na call you?

261
00:13:46,969 --> 00:13:48,007
She said he was fine,

262
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:50,339
but he must've been in so much shock.

263
00:13:50,408 --> 00:13:52,278
It must hurt a lot, too.

264
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:55,177
That was such an unexpected situation.

265
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,548
It could've been much worse.

266
00:13:57,219 --> 00:13:58,349
That's true.

267
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,297
Wait, I'm sorry.

268
00:14:12,298 --> 00:14:14,368
We're doing something like a bridal shower.

269
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,168
- Where are you guys meeting? - That's a secret.

270
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:17,868
I'll call you after.

271
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:18,969
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,109
The canceled meeting got rescheduled. I have to go.

273
00:14:22,239 --> 00:14:23,267
At this hour?

274
00:14:23,268 --> 00:14:26,038
The marketing team leader in New York is on a big power trip.

275
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:40,629
I must have a knack for lying.

276
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:42,959
It's so easy to make up a lie before I come to meet you.

277
00:14:47,268 --> 00:14:48,369
What's on your mind?

278
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,908
- Mr. Goo Ji Seok. - Yes?

279
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:56,638
You're thinking about something else while sitting here with me?

280
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:58,908
So, Hwang Jin Goo still hasn't caught on?

281
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:01,849
Was he not suspicious when you said you'd meet friends on a weekend?

282
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,319
Things are hectic at home because that kid got hurt.

283
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:06,619
- Eun Chong got hurt? - Yes.

284
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:09,688
He went to Jin Goo's place to see the cat and burned himself.

285
00:15:09,989 --> 00:15:11,589
Chairwoman Shin must've flipped out.

286
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,459
How did you know?

287
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,928
You were jealous of Eun Chong...

288
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:19,629
and said she adored him more than her daughter.

289
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:20,928
You're right.

290
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,898
Even today, she got furious at Ha Na because that kid got hurt.

291
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,938
I almost felt bad for Ha Na.

292
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,178
Was Eun Chong her grandson just as I speculated?

293
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:33,609
When you heard Ha Na was Yoon Yu Jin,

294
00:15:34,109 --> 00:15:36,178
did you think she looked like what she did as a child?

295
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,778
- Not at all. - What about now?

296
00:15:39,849 --> 00:15:41,788
I see zero resemblance no matter how often I see her.

297
00:15:42,048 --> 00:15:45,288
- As a child, was Yoon Yu Jin... - How long will you talk about her?

298
00:15:45,859 --> 00:15:47,287
You said you cut your ties with her.

299
00:15:47,288 --> 00:15:49,788
Why do you keep asking me about Yu Jin these days?

300
00:15:49,928 --> 00:15:51,228
Do you want to reconnect?

301
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:52,428
Then, do that.

302
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:54,398
Right. Sorry.

303
00:15:55,168 --> 00:15:57,268
- Something came up. - Like what?

304
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,738
Is something going on with Yu Jin?

305
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,609
It's too early to share. I'll tell you later.

306
00:16:04,209 --> 00:16:05,608
Is this something good or bad?

307
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:06,739
I'm not sure.

308
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,709
If you aren't going to tell me,

309
00:16:09,008 --> 00:16:10,579
don't make me curious.

310
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,018
I'll tell you once I'm sure.

311
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:13,489
Eat up, now.

312
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,148
You only say that you cut ties with her.

313
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:17,658
I'm sick of your first love.

314
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:19,959
She's never gone.

315
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:23,829
I could probably find a photo of Du Na at home.

316
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,969
I have to go to my siblings' place.

317
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:31,638
Why?

318
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,538
Right. Because your brother opened for business?

319
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,038
"Opened for business?"

320
00:16:37,239 --> 00:16:39,379
- Thank you. - Thank you.

321
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:40,579
Thank you.

322
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:44,749
Here's your tteokbokki.

323
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:47,547
It'll taste delicious if you dip this into these.

324
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,619
Try it like that.

325
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,158
My aunt let him start that business.

326
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:55,359
She even gave them credit cards they could use.

327
00:17:06,868 --> 00:17:08,737
Yes, Mr. Han. Where are you?

328
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:09,809
I'm at home.

329
00:17:09,907 --> 00:17:12,878
I cleaned my place, did the laundry, and thought of you during a break.

330
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,809
- Have you eaten? - I have.

331
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,217
What about finding the evidence...

332
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:20,589
of the death of Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

333
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,819
I still haven't figured out a way.

334
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,458
Is that so?

335
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:26,759
You shouldn't devote yourself only to work.

336
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:28,988
You should be out on a date on your day off.

337
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,228
I'm going to visit my siblings' place.

338
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,028
Your siblings' place?

339
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,769
Yes, I'm nearby.

340
00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:39,539
I see. Is that so? All right.

341
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:41,009
Let's talk later.

342
00:17:53,718 --> 00:17:56,388
What? Wasn't that Ji Seok?

343
00:17:58,718 --> 00:17:59,759
Where?

344
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:01,288
Why would he be here?

345
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,228
- He doesn't know I started this. - Right?

346
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:06,129
- But the back... - Stop jinxing this.

347
00:18:06,629 --> 00:18:08,268
He wouldn't leave quietly.

348
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:09,829
He'd come in and make a scene inside.

349
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:17,839
Why is he suddenly back home?

350
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,309
Is their tenant home?

351
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:48,738
There she is. Du Na.

352
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,299
(Probability of Parentage: 99.9 percent)

353
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:14,829
There's a 99.9 percent chance he's her grandson.

354
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:20,098
It was just as I expected. The kid was the real deal.

355
00:19:20,099 --> 00:19:22,638
A seven-year-old successor is now unexpectedly in the picture.

356
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,539
Yu Jin was something, too.

357
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,049
She knew she was being tailed,

358
00:19:27,748 --> 00:19:29,477
so she didn't list him on her family registry.

359
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:31,819
I would've handled him then if I had known.

360
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:34,548
What's your plan now?

361
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,418
I'll wait for the right moment.

362
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:39,289
Goo Ha Na is nothing but a cover.

363
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:42,029
All I have to do is keep that seven-year-old under control.

364
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:45,458
Wait.

365
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:49,269
I heard Goo Ha Na planned to adopt him.

366
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:52,398
If she becomes his legal guardian,

367
00:19:52,938 --> 00:19:55,238
she'll get everything.

368
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:57,339
You have to stop that.

369
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:03,109
I have to stay focused.

370
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:09,089
Yeo Jin, how's Eun Chong?

371
00:20:09,488 --> 00:20:12,359
Oh, I don't think he'll get blisters.

372
00:20:12,718 --> 00:20:14,559
Gosh, I'm so glad.

373
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,898
My goodness. This world was filled with misery.

374
00:20:20,158 --> 00:20:21,228
Why?

375
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,299
It's the lady of Myeongun Group.

376
00:20:23,629 --> 00:20:25,838
His second son gave up parental rights and custody...

377
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:27,769
to his wife when they split up.

378
00:20:28,238 --> 00:20:30,039
But since that day,

379
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,779
her daughter-in-law won't let her meet her grandson.

380
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,748
- Why not? - She got revenge on that family...

381
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:37,918
by using her parental rights and custody.

382
00:20:38,148 --> 00:20:39,747
How can that happen?

383
00:20:39,748 --> 00:20:41,348
She should get him back right away.

384
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,447
She can't.

385
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:45,688
Whoever has parental rights and custody has the most power.

386
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:48,187
There's no legal problem even if she refuses to show her son...

387
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:52,228
- to his grandmother. - Is that so?

388
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,068
That lady cried a river, saying she might not see her grandson...

389
00:20:56,069 --> 00:20:57,468
for the rest of her life.

390
00:20:57,769 --> 00:21:00,968
If she never gets to see her dear grandson again,

391
00:21:01,238 --> 00:21:02,869
that'll be the worst punishment imaginable.

392
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:08,049
Don't let your fake daughter get everything you have...

393
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:10,248
and make a wise choice, Yeo Jin.

394
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,248
Goodness.

395
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,418
Yes. If the agent asks,

396
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,628
"What can your auntie do to make you feel the happiest?"

397
00:21:21,629 --> 00:21:23,059
What will you say?

398
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:26,599
When she hugs me tightly like my mommy.

399
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,428
Me, too.

400
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:35,039
I think they'll ask, "Why do you wish..."

401
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,769
"to adopt Eun Chong?"

402
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:43,009
Because Eun Chong is very dear to me.

403
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:46,878
And I want to be by his side to help him grow up...

404
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:49,818
into a healthier and happier boy.

405
00:21:49,819 --> 00:21:52,759
I want to stay with you, too, Auntie Ha Na!

406
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:56,259
Yes, please let us stay together.

407
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:02,198
What are you up to?

408
00:22:03,468 --> 00:22:06,299
We practiced the interview for the adoption agency's visit.

409
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:08,569
Auntie and I have no problems!

410
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:09,968
Is that so?

411
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,177
She got revenge on that family...

412
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:16,208
by using her parental rights and custody.

413
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,948
If she found out she was a fake, would she take Eun Chong from me...

414
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:25,488
by using her parental rights and custody?

415
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:30,698
Okay.

416
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:38,769
Why was Ji Seok here?

417
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,339
Did he come to get something?

418
00:22:41,938 --> 00:22:45,238
Was there something related to Yu Jin?

419
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:52,119
Mom will stay with Eun Chong tomorrow.

420
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,319
It'll be too dangerous to pay special attention to Eun Chong.

421
00:22:57,789 --> 00:22:59,158
You should keep your distance.

422
00:23:00,658 --> 00:23:04,658
I'm sorry. I forgot that I had a breakfast meeting.

423
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:07,728
Why don't you take tomorrow off?

424
00:23:08,668 --> 00:23:10,228
I'll ask at work.

425
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,839
No, it's okay. I'll stay with him tomorrow.

426
00:23:12,938 --> 00:23:14,238
I'm free.

427
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:18,039
- You will? - Yes.

428
00:23:18,379 --> 00:23:21,178
It won't be easy to babysit him all day long.

429
00:23:21,678 --> 00:23:23,208
It's just for a day.

430
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:26,448
Eun Chong, you can stay with Little Grandma tomorrow.

431
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,718
Will Ms. Bang Ul not be here?

432
00:23:28,888 --> 00:23:30,549
No, she's not coming.

433
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,228
Think of everything you want to eat and do tomorrow.

434
00:23:34,388 --> 00:23:35,829
I'll take the day off.

435
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,299
Yu Jin, do you not trust me?

436
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:42,467
Then, please do that for us.

437
00:23:42,468 --> 00:23:43,869
All right. Don't worry.

438
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:46,238
Then, please do that, Aunt Myung Ji.

439
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:47,468
Sure.

440
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:10,488
You did that on purpose.

441
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:15,498
- Why don't we stop here? - No, it's all right.

442
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,498
Did I open up her old wounds?

443
00:24:30,978 --> 00:24:33,349
You were also pretty back then, Ms. Goo.

444
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,019
Especially when you smiled.

445
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,458
I was pretty when I smiled?

446
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:56,869
Gosh, what am I thinking?

447
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:03,049
Now, as of today, we've become the Travel Service Department.

448
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,079
Let's keep up our spirits.

449
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:06,849
- We can do it! - We can do it!

450
00:25:08,789 --> 00:25:10,859
Let's start working on the projects...

451
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,658
we can also implement here at the hotel.

452
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:15,288
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

453
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:18,457
President Hwang, why don't we begin the mother-daughter therapy tour?

454
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:19,928
We can offer it to the hotel's guests.

455
00:25:20,359 --> 00:25:24,668
It can be a regular program or a promotional event.

456
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:26,438
- That sounds great. - That sounds great.

457
00:25:27,138 --> 00:25:29,468
Ms. Goo, slam on the accelerator once again.

458
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,879
Gosh, okay.

459
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:35,748
Also, I'm no longer the president. I'm the general manager.

460
00:25:37,819 --> 00:25:38,948
- Yes, sir. - But Ha Na,

461
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:40,987
let's turn the mother-daughter therapy tour...

462
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:42,119
into a big success!

463
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:44,987
Okay. Let's do this!

464
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:46,318
- We can do this! - We can do this!

465
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,158
- We can do this! - You're the best!

466
00:25:49,829 --> 00:25:51,329
It's like they're celebrating.

467
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:54,468
And Ms. Yoon, I need to see you.

468
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:56,228
Sure.

469
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,938
Why didn't you call me back yesterday?

470
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,099
Did you call?

471
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:07,379
Gosh, I didn't know you called. I'm sorry.

472
00:26:07,748 --> 00:26:10,379
- Why did you call? - I wondered if you were having fun.

473
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:13,879
It's been a while since we met, so time literally flew by.

474
00:26:13,978 --> 00:26:15,218
Show me some pictures.

475
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:18,559
I wanted to see how much fun you had.

476
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,488
My friends took the photos.

477
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:23,188
They said they'd upload it on their account, but not yet.

478
00:26:23,488 --> 00:26:25,728
- I'll show it to you when they do. - Okay.

479
00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:29,428
Why are you staring at me?

480
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,098
No reason.

481
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,198
You used to say it was because I was pretty. "No reason?"

482
00:26:33,438 --> 00:26:34,609
Where's your love?

483
00:26:37,009 --> 00:26:38,109
Of course, you're pretty.

484
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,148
Are you done?

485
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,579
When are you meeting the marketing team leader from New York?

486
00:26:43,708 --> 00:26:44,978
I wanted to say hi, too.

487
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:50,589
Both Ha Na and you were very interested in that team leader.

488
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:52,918
I'll find out the schedule.

489
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:56,859
What is this? Is he suspicious of me?

490
00:26:59,329 --> 00:27:00,428
You may leave.

491
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,529
How's Mother doing with her new business? Is it going well?

492
00:27:05,168 --> 00:27:08,668
You know ingredients are everything when it comes to food, right?

493
00:27:08,908 --> 00:27:10,038
Of course.

494
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:12,779
The vegetables would be delivered every single day.

495
00:27:12,978 --> 00:27:14,278
- Right? - Yes.

496
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,519
I'll serve my customers as if I'm cooking for my own son.

497
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:20,887
Yes, please keep that spirit and do a great job.

498
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:22,789
I look forward to this, too.

499
00:27:25,388 --> 00:27:28,559
There seemed to be all kinds of broths.

500
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:30,958
I'm not sure if I can make all those.

501
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:32,728
Don't worry about it.

502
00:27:32,829 --> 00:27:34,498
You'll get the broth package from the headquarters,

503
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:36,667
so all you have to do is mix everything in perfect ratio.

504
00:27:36,668 --> 00:27:37,967
It's not too difficult.

505
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:39,769
Gosh, I'm glad.

506
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:41,839
You'll do a great job.

507
00:27:41,968 --> 00:27:44,138
- Then, let's go to the kitchen. - Okay.

508
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:58,918
First, I need to get him on my side.

509
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:02,359
All done.

510
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:04,458
Goodness.

511
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:08,769
Hey, that must be the pizza.

512
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,968
Pizza's here.

513
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,978
Pizza's here.

514
00:28:21,379 --> 00:28:23,309
Goodness. What's this? That hurt.

515
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,548
Darn it. What is this?

516
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:26,779
I'm sorry.

517
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:30,089
It's okay.

518
00:28:30,418 --> 00:28:33,759
I should've been more careful.

519
00:28:34,888 --> 00:28:39,228
But it's dangerous to leave this where people are walking by,

520
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,799
- so play with blocks in your room. - Okay.

521
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,427
Give it to me, please.

522
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:46,498
Well, I'm taking this.

523
00:28:46,968 --> 00:28:50,539
I'll give it back when you're a good boy with me.

524
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:59,519
You have your mommy's phone?

525
00:29:01,718 --> 00:29:04,519
- Yes. - Can you show it to me?

526
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:05,759
Later.

527
00:29:06,888 --> 00:29:10,158
I said you had to listen to me...

528
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,099
to get your block back.

529
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,968
I'll show it to you after I eat this.

530
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:22,509
Okay. Eat up.

531
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:27,509
I threw out her phone in the lake at the time of the accident.

532
00:29:28,148 --> 00:29:30,349
What's this other phone?

533
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:38,359
Lee Du Na. Lee Eun Chong.

534
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,228
I heard he took his mother's last name...

535
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,029
because he had no dad.

536
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:48,198
Come in.

537
00:29:49,728 --> 00:29:51,339
Mr. Goo, I found it.

538
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:53,967
I met the reporter who reported her disappearance...

539
00:29:53,968 --> 00:29:55,269
and received the original of the article.

540
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,208
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

541
00:30:06,879 --> 00:30:09,148
(Missing Child, Name: Yoon Yu Jin, age 10, female)

542
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,658
Du Na?

543
00:30:13,388 --> 00:30:14,559
They're the same person.

544
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:18,329
How can this happen?

545
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,059
How can this be real?

546
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:25,968
So, everything was...

547
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,579
staged by Chairwoman Shin and Hwang Jin Goo.

548
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:37,978
How's Eun Chong?

549
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,379
He didn't go to the kindergarten, right?

550
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,748
No. It must sting and itch, but he's holding out.

551
00:30:43,948 --> 00:30:45,958
Aunt Myung Ji is babysitting him.

552
00:30:46,988 --> 00:30:48,359
That's an unlikely pair.

553
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:51,629
She's suddenly so nice to him.

554
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:52,829
Is she?

555
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:55,329
That's a good thing.

556
00:30:56,099 --> 00:30:57,198
Yes.

557
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,339
I guess so. Yes.

558
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:12,748
Mr. Goo.

559
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:15,348
I was on my way to say hello as this was day one...

560
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:17,089
of our new department...

561
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,488
as General Manager Hwang Jin Goo of the Travel Service Department.

562
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:40,967
(Cinderella Game)

563
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:43,167
Mr. Hwang was beaten up by Mr. Goo?

564
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:44,778
Could it be because of that rumor?

565
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:45,808
Thanks a lot, friend.

566
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,247
I warned you. Do not get me involved in these dirty rumors.

567
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:49,879
You wouldn't like both anyway.

568
00:32:50,049 --> 00:32:52,618
Will you tell your sister that she's a fake?

569
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:54,078
I found it!

570
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,088
How did this end up in your room?

571
00:32:56,089 --> 00:32:57,717
Why is this happening?

572
00:32:57,718 --> 00:32:58,718
I have a bad feeling about this.

573
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:00,217
Ji Seok has changed completely.

574
00:33:00,218 --> 00:33:01,358
Is something going on?

575
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,158
This is all too sudden.

576
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:04,898
I've been too narrow-minded.

577
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,728
I look forward to our continuous cooperation.
