(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:07,610
(Episode 24)

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,390
Now, there really is no one
who'll return to this room.

6
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:21,429
I promised...

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,460
I would do whatever it took
to find you.

8
00:00:26,899 --> 00:00:28,929
But I didn't do anything.

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,909
I couldn't find you or protect you.

10
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,950
But I will...

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,549
find your son.

12
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,590
I'll find him...

13
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,859
and protect him.

14
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,740
- Auntie Ha Na is mine!
- She's my sister.

15
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,239
- What are you doing?
- No way!

16
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:07,209
- You have Kongkong.
- You both need to let go.

17
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,170
Stop it.

18
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,340
- What's with you two?
- Give her back!

19
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,640
- What's with you?
- No, she's my sister!

20
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,510
I need to find my grandson
right now.

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:17,180
I'll do every possible thing I can
to find him.

22
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,750
What if you told her who he was...

23
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,390
and that she shouldn't disclose
he was of Hyesung Group's blood?

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:27,530
Something good enough
to console her daughter's death.

25
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:32,000
My auntie is my mommy!

26
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,129
How many times do I have to say it?
Are you stupid?

27
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:35,799
No, you're stupid!

28
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,840
How can your auntie
become your mommy?

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,269
My auntie will become my mommy!

30
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,540
I'll find my grandma, too!

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,650
Yu Jin.

32
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,219
Yu Jin.

(Messages)

34
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,349
He's...

35
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,490
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

36
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,389
Thank you.

37
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:40,330
Hello. My name is Lee Eun Chong
of Chamsae Class...

38
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,000
at Chamsae Kindergarten.

39
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,599
Why is his photo...

40
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,050
Gosh.

41
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,699
Auntie...

42
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:21,039
Did you wake up?

43
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,580
Go back to sleep. It's Saturday.

44
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,409
Your grandson
was named Lee Eun Chong.

45
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,520
Ms. Goo Ha Na raises him
as his guardian.

47
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,490
Ms. Goo, that tour guide.

48
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,099
Is he your son?

49
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:46,900
He's my nephew.

50
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Hello.

51
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,039
Was the boy I met at the department
store your sibling's son?

52
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,310
He was such a clever boy.

53
00:03:57,379 --> 00:03:59,439
He's my friend's son.

54
00:04:00,409 --> 00:04:02,479
Her friend was Yu Jin.

55
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,780
If Ms. Goo was her friend
from the children's home,

56
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,719
then was she
Lee Ha Na in that drawing?

57
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,829
Yeo Jin, you were here?

58
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,100
Did you sleep here?

59
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:29,740
I dozed off
and ended up sleeping until now.

60
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,279
How do you feel?

61
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,550
I feel much better.

62
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,850
You look much better now
than yesterday.

63
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,850
You should have breakfast.

64
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,389
Bang Ul made beef and radish soup.

65
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,790
Would you like some?

66
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,129
- Sure. Take your time.
- Okay.

67
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,339
She collapsed two days ago,

68
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,040
but she seemed perfectly fine today.

69
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,939
What's going on?

70
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,389
Little boy.

71
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,990
Are you really Yu Jin's son?

72
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,389
Are you my grandson?

73
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,600
Grandma. I mean, Ms. Chairwoman.

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,470
This is my present.

75
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:43,920
You were right in front of me,
but I still didn't recognize you.

76
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:49,189
The child's safety is
the most important.

77
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,290
He may fall into danger
if people find out...

78
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,529
that he is your grandson.

79
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,060
No.

80
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,129
I couldn't keep Yu Jin safe,
but not her son.

81
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:04,240
I must keep Eun Chong safe.

82
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,980
My pumpkin,
Granny will keep you safe.

83
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,180
Wake up, Uncle Ji Chang.

84
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,120
Wake up, Uncle Ji Chang.

85
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,620
It's eight o'clock!

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,389
It's Saturday, kiddo.

87
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:28,790
Today's Monday.

88
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,160
You're late.

89
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:33,629
I'm late? Darn it.

90
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:39,500
Hey!

91
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,910
Lee Eun Chong,
come out while I'm still nice.

92
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,139
Let's have a real fight.

93
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,990
Hey! Take this, you little rascal.

94
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,589
You need to get punished.

95
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:01,959
A work that looks beautiful
in darkness?

96
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,060
There's no such work in this world.

97
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,129
There is.
That's why it's called a riddle.

98
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,170
- Fireworks?
- Gosh.

99
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:11,670
- Am I right?
- Yes!

100
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:12,970
Yes.

101
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,970
I chose not to answer that
because it was too childish.

102
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,110
I can't hang out
with an immature kid like him.

103
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,139
Then, find someone
who's mature enough for you.

104
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,750
We speak the same language,
don't we, Eun Chong?

105
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,850
Yes, Auntie Ha Na.

106
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,449
You two are annoying.

107
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,790
What a lovely couple you two are.
Darn it.

108
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:32,120
Gosh, it's a tent.

109
00:07:32,189 --> 00:07:34,459
Hey, don't touch
someone else's trash.

110
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,759
Many people throw out things
that are perfectly good.

111
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:37,829
Let's see.

112
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,139
This isn't so bad.

113
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:46,839
It is bad. There's a hole in it.

114
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:50,980
I'll wipe it clean
and sew it up, too.

115
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,709
I'll turn this into
the most unique tent in the world.

116
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,209
All right!

117
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,480
It doesn't look so bad.

118
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,000
Right, Ms. Yoon told me
that you lived next door.

119
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,069
I do.

120
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,910
She had a bit too much to drink.

121
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,870
Please excuse me.

122
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,209
Did you forget
about our meeting two days ago?

123
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,610
Or did you stand me up on purpose?

124
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,579
That...

125
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,320
Things became hectic for me
after the chairwoman collapsed.

126
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,019
I didn't skip it on purpose.

127
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,559
I should've called you first.
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,419
I heard the chairwoman collapsed
after receiving a delivery.

129
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,690
Did she get bad news?

130
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,429
It concerned her personal life,

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,429
so I did not think
it was my place to tell you.

132
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,269
If it was personal,
how personal was it?

133
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,440
A personal matter for a chairwoman
of a group can concern business.

134
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,940
Anyway, I also heard
she was fine now,

135
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,710
but you still seemed very busy.

136
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:03,919
I've had many outside meetings
to sign contracts for the hotel.

137
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,419
You're a bad liar.

138
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,399
Yes, Ms. Chairwoman. Right now?

139
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:30,210
Where would you like to go, ma'am?

140
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,309
I told Myung Ji that
I was going to the temple.

141
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,149
Do you need to do something else?

142
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,919
Do you know
where Ms. Goo Ha Na lives?

143
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,720
Yes, she lives in my neighborhood.

144
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,490
What about her?

145
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,289
We're going to her place.

146
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,730
To Ms. Goo's place?

147
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,860
I hear my grandson is there.

148
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,129
What do you mean?

149
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:56,769
Ms. Goo's nephew, Eun Chong.

150
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,570
"Eun Chong?"

151
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,539
Do you know him?

152
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,409
Yes, I've met him a few times.

153
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:05,639
Wait, is he...

154
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,580
I heard that boy was...

155
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,350
my grandson.

156
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,519
Are you sure, ma'am?

157
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,649
Who told you this?

158
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,399
(Your grandson
was named Lee Eun Chong.)

159
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,570
Who is this from?

160
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,409
It was probably Sung Ho.

161
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,840
It must've been his reply
to my e-mail.

162
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,309
Ms. Goo was Yu Jin's friend
from the children's home.

163
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:47,519
Lee Ha Na in the drawing was
actually Ms. Goo Ha Na.

164
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:51,519
So, we need to go to their place.

165
00:10:53,659 --> 00:10:54,730
Okay.

166
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,759
All done.

167
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,929
- Ta-da! It's done!
- Yes!

168
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,269
This is what I call vintage.
Don't you think so?

169
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:10,610
It looks pretty.

170
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:15,009
It really feels like we're camping
to lie here like this.

171
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,879
- Should we go camping, too?
- Really?

172
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,620
Yes.

173
00:11:20,789 --> 00:11:23,590
We can play in the water,
eat barbecue,

174
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,820
and light up sparklers.

175
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,429
At night, we can lie down
and look at the stars, too.

176
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:29,759
- And make wishes?
- That's right.

177
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,730
It sounds exciting.

178
00:11:32,629 --> 00:11:35,870
Let's all go camping in spring,
all our family.

179
00:11:35,929 --> 00:11:38,169
- Including Uncle Ji Seok?
- What?

180
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,139
Of course.

181
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:46,009
You know tomorrow is...

182
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,149
the memorial service
for my parents, right?

183
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:51,450
Yes, that's why we're going
grocery shopping today.

184
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,019
You're right.

185
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,519
They're your grandma and grandpa.
Aren't they?

186
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,590
They are.

187
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,059
Anyway, Auntie Ha Na.

188
00:11:59,059 --> 00:12:00,990
Who did you eat
pork belly with yesterday?

189
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,190
With the president.

190
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:07,799
Yes, I should return his coat later.

191
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,399
- That was his coat?
- Yes.

192
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,970
Let's go grocery shopping
after I stop by his place.

193
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:17,980
I'll come with you.

194
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,450
Does President Hwang
have a girlfriend?

195
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:24,649
Of course. He's to marry her.

196
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,549
Gosh, really?

197
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:27,889
Yes, why?

198
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,419
I'll stay home with Uncle Ji Chang.

199
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,730
I saw him right in front of me,

200
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:39,899
and yet,
I didn't realize he was my grandson.

201
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,769
Have you met him before?

202
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,100
I ran into him by chance
at a department store.

203
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,139
He seemed very cheerful and clever.

204
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,250
My friend suddenly passed away
in an accident.

205
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,110
- He's your friend's son?
- Yes.

206
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,379
She was like family.

207
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,590
Eun Chong had no one in his life,

208
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,460
so naturally, I decided to take him.

209
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,929
Yu Jin must've been heartbroken...

210
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,100
to leave that little boy behind.

211
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:15,299
Right! I forgot to return
the condolence money...

212
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:16,970
you gave Eun Chong.

213
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:19,100
Why are you returning this?

214
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,970
The DNA test result came out,

215
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,940
and she wasn't his grandmother.

216
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:28,379
Ms. Chairwoman, Ms. Goo had also been
looking for his grandmother.

217
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,820
She had been looking for me?

218
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:35,389
Yes, she continued looking
since the day your daughter passed.

219
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,019
Recently, they came across someone
who seemed to be his grandmother...

220
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,519
and even gave her a funeral,

221
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,259
but the DNA test said...

222
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,700
she wasn't his grandmother.

223
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,100
Something like that happened?

224
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,940
If she had been looking
for his grandmother,

225
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:54,100
Yu Jin must've told her about me.

226
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,639
Could it mean her memories returned?

227
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,309
Then, why didn't she find me?

228
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:03,450
Her memories
must've returned only partially.

229
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:07,250
She was also using only his DNA
to find his grandmother.

230
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,720
I'll ask Ms. Goo
for more details regarding that.

231
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,720
Yes, okay.

232
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:18,230
What have I been doing
while trying to find Yu Jin?

233
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,129
I've only trusted
that DNA registration to this day.

234
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:24,070
You should e-mail Mr. Yoon
and ask him to return to Korea.

235
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,070
You two must
discuss Eun Chong's issue together.

236
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:31,639
That children's home staff member
I mentioned to you was...

237
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,179
a native man to that village?

238
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:35,210
Yes, ma'am.

239
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,990
She asked about me?

240
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,120
Yes, she only looked at you briefly
in the director's office yesterday,

241
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,620
but she must've felt something.

242
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,690
I realized once again...

243
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,360
that marriage must establish
such a connection.

244
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,230
So, what did they say?

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,399
They said you were a native man...

246
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,600
and a retired
elementary school principal.

247
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
- And they didn't pry further?
- No.

248
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,399
But you should still be careful.

249
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,570
I sent her Eun Chong's photo.

250
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,340
She won't come
to the children's home anymore.

251
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,950
Hwang Jin Goo went to St. Paul's Home
two days in a row?

252
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,220
Yes, according to Zero,

253
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,379
his car navigator was
set to that address.

254
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,389
Yesterday, Chairwoman Shin
must've gone there with him.

255
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:18,620
Yes, I'm sure
she's looking for her daughter.

256
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,830
- Why that children's home?
- What is it?

257
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,159
My sister was
from that children's home.

258
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,600
Your sister?

259
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,279
My goodness.

260
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,250
Run.

261
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:08,240
Auntie, can you dry my hair?

262
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,309
Sure. Come over here. Okay.

263
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,980
All right.

264
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,450
Okay. Let me see.

265
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,250
Your hair is curly,

266
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,820
just like your mommy.

267
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,059
Was Mommy's hair curly, too?

268
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:28,889
Yes, so she always had
to get straight perms in summer.

269
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:32,230
I see. "Straight perm?"

270
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,970
It makes your hair straight.

271
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:41,210
Then, my grandma must
also have curly hair.

272
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,340
Probably.

273
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:45,980
Okay. Come here.

274
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:49,879
All right.

275
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,419
Jin Goo.

276
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,599
I had to leave first for work.

277
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,970
I got you some soup,
so make sure you have that.

278
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,829
- Yes?
- Where are you?

279
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:41,599
- At my newlywed home.
- Why did you stay the night out?

280
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,069
- What is it?
- Yeo Jin went...

281
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,700
to the temple with Jin Goo.

282
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:49,410
His priority is
always my aunt, not me.

283
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:52,210
Did you find out anything
about the file she got?

284
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:54,579
I've been looking
for someone good with safes.

285
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:57,920
Did you ask
where he went with your aunt?

286
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,349
They did a round with the customers.

287
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,750
I'm stopping by at his place
before I go home.

288
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,019
He's not even there. Why?

289
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,490
It's your fault.

290
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:11,529
What?
She dropped the pot with duck soup?

291
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:16,170
She's always finding ways
to be that wretched.

292
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,799
Why did she take the bus
while carrying a pot?

293
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,970
She should've grabbed a taxi.

294
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,309
So? Did Jin Goo get mad at you?

295
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,809
Well, she's your mother-in-law,
so do what you need to do.

296
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,250
Bye.

297
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,319
This was why I wanted in-laws
who were in my league.

298
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,829
(Safe Product Information)

299
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,670
(Safe Product Information)

300
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,309
Detective Cho, we need to meet now.

301
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,710
I have to send the web address
of the tracking app to his phone?

302
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,849
Then, he'd notice
I installed it on his phone.

303
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,779
You can't send it from your phone.

304
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:07,750
Use his mother's phone.

305
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,990
He'll open the address
his mom sends.

306
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,359
- Does that sound that easy?
- Doesn't your daughter know...

307
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:17,359
the password to his phone?

308
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:20,299
All she has to do is
open it in secret and click it.

309
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,470
Don't couples
usually share such information?

310
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:27,039
Gosh. No one shares passwords
like they did in the old days.

311
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,440
It's too dangerous
to put a tail on her.

312
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:33,480
My only chance is that safe.

313
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:36,910
Send me a photo of the safe.

314
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,880
I already have
a safe technician ready to go.

315
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,119
Let's check how long it'll take
and set a date.

316
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,990
Really? One second.

317
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,630
Yes, I send it to you.

318
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,359
You chose someone decent, right?

319
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,029
We have to move?

320
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,170
Well, I'm sorry.

321
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,740
My husband recently got fired.

322
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,339
He got sick of working,
so we decided to pack up...

323
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,440
and return to our hometown.

324
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,480
But still, how can we suddenly move?

325
00:20:09,579 --> 00:20:11,079
We still have a while
in our lease contract.

326
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,720
That was why
I came to ask for a favor.

327
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,650
What happened to us was inevitable.

328
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,920
You'd be able to find a place
in a month, right?

329
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,289
What? A month?

330
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:22,230
We need at least three months.

331
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,230
That's the law.

332
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,599
Yes, a month is not long enough.

333
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,670
On top of that,
our lease contract didn't expire,

334
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,269
- so you couldn't do this...
- I already know that.

335
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,140
We're just in a hurry.

336
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,769
Okay. I'll pay the realtor's fee
and for your move, too.

337
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,039
Please talk to your sister for me.

338
00:20:42,849 --> 00:20:44,009
Ma'am!

339
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:49,990
We can't find a home just like that
just because she tells us to move.

340
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,789
She must think
only her situation is important.

341
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,789
What about us?
Is our situation unimportant?

342
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,759
Yesterday's news said
the lease prices have skyrocketed.

343
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:07,940
You look wonderful, Mother.

344
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:11,839
Is it because it's expensive?
It feels so light on me.

345
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,410
It was made
with 100 percent cashmere.

346
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:16,380
Your padded jacket
looked way too heavy.

347
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,819
Jin Goo bought that for me,
and it was a good one, too.

348
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,420
You can wear that
when you go out nearby,

349
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,250
and you can wear this
when you travel out far.

350
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,589
You look like
the lady of a wealthy family.

351
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,789
Goodness, what wealthy family?

352
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,829
Jin Goo will
make it happen very soon.

353
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:34,430
Is that so?

354
00:21:35,769 --> 00:21:38,569
I'm sorry, Mother.

355
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,269
I heard you made duck soup for us,

356
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:44,210
but you ended up dropping it
as you took it back.

357
00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:46,710
I would've had some if I had known.

358
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,710
I'm so sorry for your trouble.

359
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,250
Jin Goo shouldn't have
told you that.

360
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,650
You must've been upset.

361
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:02,329
Please take this,
eat something nice, and feel better.

362
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,430
Goodness, you bought this coat
and brought me money?

363
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,799
No, take it back.

364
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,670
Well, if I could,
I'd love to treat you...

365
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,640
to a delicious meal
and go somewhere nice, too.

366
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,970
But I'm too busy.

367
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,440
This is a token of my heart,
so please take it.

368
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,839
I already know how you feel.

369
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,309
You must be busy working
and planning the wedding,

370
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:26,380
so you don't have to mind me.
Just take it back.

371
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:27,950
My gosh.

372
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:29,990
Please just take it.

373
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,319
Good grief. My goodness.

374
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,730
Yes, who is it?

375
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,460
Hello.

376
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,200
It's you, Eun Chong's auntie.

377
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,569
What brings you here?

378
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,400
I came to return Mr. Hwang's coat.

379
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,640
Is he home?

380
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,869
Jin Goo? Yesterday, he...
I'll take that.

381
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:54,279
Anyway, why did you have his coat?

382
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,410
Ms. Goo Ha Na?

383
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,619
Ms. Yoon.

384
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,420
She works with you,
so you must know each other.

385
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,460
She came to return Jin Goo's coat.

386
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,490
His coat?

387
00:23:07,789 --> 00:23:10,059
Why were you dressed so lightly?
Where's your coat?

388
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:11,130
What?

389
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,930
It got wet, so I left it in the car.

390
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,500
Please excuse me.

391
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:23,640
Mother, I need to have a word
with Ms. Goo for a moment.

392
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,910
I didn't expect to see you here.

393
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:33,980
You must've been here often
if you know his mother, too.

394
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,420
I've been here once before...

395
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,920
because my grocery bag
got mixed up with hers.

396
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,529
And what's that coat?

397
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,029
Were you with him
after work yesterday?

398
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,930
- Yes.
- I can't believe...

399
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:47,130
you answered that so easily.

400
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:48,430
Why were you with him?

401
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,799
Did you have a contemplative talk
about the future of Hyesung Tour?

402
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,099
We had dinner.

403
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:56,970
He apologized for not telling me
about the Dubai contract...

404
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
and offered to treat me.

405
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,710
That Dubai contract.

406
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:02,480
I'm so sick of hearing that.

407
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:04,819
- Are you into him?
- What?

408
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,079
No.

409
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,190
He's engaged to someone else,
and that someone else is your boss.

410
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,859
And he's the president
of your workplace.

411
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:14,319
It's just like
having feelings for a married man.

412
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,259
- That isn't the case.
- Of course not.

413
00:24:16,259 --> 00:24:17,359
It shouldn't be.

414
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,259
But why did you show up
with his coat?

415
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,799
It suddenly began to rain,

416
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:25,539
so he gave it to me to use
instead of an umbrella.

417
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,339
I should've declined,

418
00:24:27,339 --> 00:24:29,410
but I didn't think it through.
I'm sorry.

419
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:31,509
Both of you are ridiculous.

420
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:34,410
One for offering
and the other for accepting it.

421
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,579
I understand
how uncomfortable this is for you.

422
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,319
He just let me borrow it
instead of an umbrella,

423
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,349
so I hope
there's no misunderstanding.

424
00:24:42,349 --> 00:24:44,490
A misunderstanding?
Because of someone like you?

425
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,859
I can't believe this.

426
00:24:46,019 --> 00:24:49,230
Anyone can tell you're flirting
with the president as a woman.

427
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,559
How dare someone like you
eat with the president?

428
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:53,460
And you took his coat
instead of an umbrella?

429
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,529
Someone like you?

430
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:56,700
- What about someone like me?
- Don't you know?

431
00:24:57,569 --> 00:24:59,539
I know that you're a big shot,

432
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,539
and I understand that
you feel offended by this.

433
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:03,769
But someone like me
also deserves respect as a human.

434
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,410
If you're a woman of character,
you need to show respect...

435
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,250
Did you expect my respect
after hitting on my man?

436
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,779
You should be ashamed of yourself.

437
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,980
I always found you irritating
from the get-go.

438
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,289
Why did I get involved
with a crude and vulgar girl like you...

439
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,319
That's enough.

440
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,890
I never hit on him,

441
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,460
and I never did anything
to be ashamed of.

442
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,960
And I am especially
not someone crude and vulgar.

443
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,799
What do you mean, enough?
This has just begun.

444
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:28,670
I give you my warning.

445
00:25:28,869 --> 00:25:31,740
If you get involved
with Mr. Hwang in private again,

446
00:25:31,869 --> 00:25:34,099
then your life will become
brutally torturous.

447
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,710
His mother just came out.
Please excuse me.

448
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:46,779
- Goodbye.
- All right. Goodbye.

449
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,319
What's wrong?
Did you two have a fight?

450
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,859
Why would we fight, Mother?

451
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,220
It's a cold day.
Why did you come out? Let's go.

452
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,569
I gave her my warning
and told her to stay within the line.

453
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,700
She causes
a lot of trouble at work, too.

454
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,839
She took up an illegal gig
and got fired...

455
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:09,910
from the previous travel agency.

456
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,109
Then, why did you hire her?

457
00:26:12,339 --> 00:26:13,680
We were deceived.

458
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,680
She caused a sexual scandal
with a man...

459
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,910
in the parking lot
as soon as she started...

460
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:24,089
- I don't want to say it.
- A man? At the office parking lot?

461
00:26:24,089 --> 00:26:25,319
That's not all.

462
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,160
There was theft in the office, too.

463
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,730
She even stole something?

464
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,859
That was supposed to be
a misunderstanding, but who knows?

465
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:33,559
Anyway, she has more issues
than you think.

466
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,930
Jin Goo didn't say
anything like that.

467
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,930
He doesn't like to discuss work
outside the office.

468
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,299
Please don't tell him.

469
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,039
She seemed well-behaved,

470
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:45,640
kind, and diligent.

471
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,980
I must be getting bad
at judging people's character.

472
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:53,180
You can never judge a book
by its cover. She's really sly.

473
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,549
She was just a contract worker,

474
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:57,720
but she already reached out
to the chairwoman, too.

475
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,519
That young woman
must be incredibly ambitious.

476
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,089
She's a scary girl.

477
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:04,859
You should be careful from now on.

478
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:06,359
Don't even let her inside.

479
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:09,170
All right. I won't.

480
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,410
Hit on her man?

481
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:22,509
Well, I did feel
my heart race for a moment,

482
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,380
but was that on me, too?

483
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,119
If that is on me, I'll think of this
as an early vaccination.

484
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,890
All right. That's it.

485
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,259
Hey, Ji Seok.

486
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,660
My friend at the children's home?

487
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,569
Her name was Yoon Yu Jin.

488
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,369
"Yoon Yu Jin?"

489
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,269
No, I've never heard
that name before. Why?

490
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,569
No?

491
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,910
Did the children's home call you?

492
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,380
No, I haven't been visited often
since the previous director nun...

493
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,349
emigrated to Canada.

494
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:02,289
- Anyway, is something going on?
- No, see you tomorrow.

495
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:04,349
Okay. Come over with Ji Eun.

496
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,019
Bye.

497
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:11,690
Why is he suddenly asking me
about the children's home?

498
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:15,430
"Yoon Yu Jin?"

499
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,910
- This is it?
- Yes.

500
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,440
It's the house on the inside.

501
00:28:25,809 --> 00:28:28,180
Eun Chong lives here?

502
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,710
I never knew
he was always so close by.

503
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:36,549
Eun Chong...

504
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:39,359
You poor thing.

505
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:43,930
I hope I get to see just your face.

506
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,400
She asked us
to leave within a month.

507
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,970
Tell her to observe the law.
Who cares if she's the landlady?

508
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:59,779
How are you going to find a home
in just a month?

509
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,079
The money is the problem.
We can always find a home.

510
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,549
Hold out as much as you can.

511
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,319
You still have the lease,
so what if you don't move out?

512
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:09,420
If we can't find a home,
we'll have to crash at your place.

513
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,549
Forget that.

514
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,759
Don't even dream
of living off Ji Seok. Bye.

515
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,829
Ji Seok would
never take Eun Chong in.

516
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:23,930
Should we buy that house?

517
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,000
Darn it. You're such a cold brat.

518
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,950
Uncle Ji Chang,
what are we going to do?

519
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:41,420
Leave the adults
to worry about money and housing.

520
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,759
All you have to do is
play with this thing.

521
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:53,529
It'll break Auntie Ha Na's heart
when she finds out.

522
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:56,369
I should've gone with her...

523
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,640
and said hi to Ms. Bang Ul, too.

524
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,140
Should I go inside?

525
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,809
- Can you do that?
- Yes.

526
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,809
There's Eun Chong, Ms. Chairwoman.

527
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,059
Eun Chong.

528
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:29,430
It's me, Grandma.

529
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,039
Please look up at me.

530
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,670
(Cinderella Game)

531
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,309
Try to persuade Jin Goo
to tell you everything.

532
00:32:17,309 --> 00:32:18,680
- Then, why did you lie?
- What?

533
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,579
Trust can collapse in an instant.

534
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,779
The one who raised Eun Chong
has no idea...

535
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,549
she had taken in
the blood of her sworn enemy?

536
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,619
How could this happen?

537
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,950
I'll get your revenge soon,
so please wait a little longer.

538
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,690
Mommy will find the culprit.

539
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,789
If you do this,
you will pay for it, Yeo Jin.

540
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:38,630
We can't just sit around and take it
if Aunt Yeo Jin betrays us.

541
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,400
I should bring Eun Chong home.
