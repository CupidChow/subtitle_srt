1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,480
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,279
I was greatly impressed
with your management style...

5
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:12,550
when I first began to study
business management.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,420
You help sell businesses in trouble
at a good price before they go down,

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,359
like you're their savior.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,390
- Is that so?
- I also heard...

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,859
you were the evil hand that profits off
of troubled businesses...

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,170
at giveaway prices.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,670
I realized it was possible
to manage businesses like this,

12
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,070
both as a savior and the evil hand,

13
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,939
like Jekyll and Hyde.

14
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,880
Since then, I decided
to have you as my role model.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,549
Not all hearsay is true.

16
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:47,119
At times, the truth could be
covered up by hearsay.

17
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,789
- I don't care.
- I'm like that, too.

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,130
I'm glad to know we're like-minded.

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,229
You're now one of us,

20
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,799
so feel free to tell me
whatever you need.

21
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:01,929
I do have a favor to ask.

22
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,069
I believe President Hwang Jin Goo...

23
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,799
reports to you
regarding Hyesung Tour.

24
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,709
Please allow me to take over.

25
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:12,379
I cannot condone
a mere president of a subsidiary...

26
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:13,980
ignoring hierarchy...

27
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,549
and reporting to the chairwoman
in a private setting.

28
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,280
This is irrational
in most organizations.

29
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,189
I'll talk to President Hwang.

30
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:25,989
Allow me to talk to him.

31
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:27,989
As you wish.

32
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,680
Who are you?

33
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,209
Why did she just slap me?

34
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,450
Who the heck are you?

35
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,549
A tour guide.

36
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,849
Yes, a tour guide
who causes all kinds of trouble...

37
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,519
and resorts to illegal acts.

38
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,060
Were you sent here
by Jaemin Construction? Or Taeyang?

39
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,730
I know. I heard
Daeri Construction's second son...

40
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,829
began to feather his own nest,
so was it him?

41
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:05,930
What are you talking about?

42
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,069
I said I caught you
acting as a spy...

43
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,370
trying to ruin our business.

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,439
- "Spy?"
- That was why you were...

45
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,900
going through other people's trash.

46
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,139
Going through what?

47
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,780
- The bag popped, so I had to...
- Search all you want.

48
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,080
You won't find anything.

49
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,479
I knew something was up
when you followed us here.

50
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:25,849
She's driving me crazy.

51
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,490
- That's not the case.
- If so,

52
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:30,919
then how did you know we'd be here
and followed us?

53
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,759
You messed with the wrong person.

54
00:02:34,389 --> 00:02:36,960
I'll find out everything about you
and release a follow-up article,

55
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,900
an industrial spy
disguised as a tour guide!

56
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,400
- Hey.
- And your family will suffer, too,

57
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,300
so just wait.

58
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:51,009
What's going on?

59
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,340
Why is she here again?

60
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,150
It's nothing.
Did you find the reason?

61
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,780
Not yet.

62
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,990
I haven't been slapped
since my childhood.

63
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,469
- What are you doing?
- What?

64
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,840
What was the problem?

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
I didn't use
any artificial flavoring,

66
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,639
and I thoroughly checked
the list of allergies, too.

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,370
Yes, ma'am.

68
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,180
Why did the guest from Dubai
lodge the complaint?

69
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,310
No idea.

70
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:30,449
All he had to do was
just tell us what the problem was.

71
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:32,120
He's making
everyone's life difficult.

72
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,250
What if I end up taking the blame?

73
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,590
Yes, he was a guest
for Hyesung Tour,

74
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,259
so he must be staying
at Hyesung Hotel.

75
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,430
(Haengun Meat,
Product: Beef ribs, halal, frozen)

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,139
By any chance,
did he use frozen halal meat?

77
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,340
Probably.

78
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,110
Did he not eat it
because the meat was frozen?

79
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,409
Hey, Ji Eun.

80
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,180
Can you check if there is
a guest from Dubai at your hotel?

81
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:06,349
What? His name was...

82
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,620
- Hassan.
- Hassan.

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,490
He's not in his room?

84
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,159
Is he not back yet?

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,560
Why are you prying
into a guest at our hotel?

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,029
Hey, isn't that him?

87
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:23,529
Hey, yes.

88
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,839
Hello.

89
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,740
Hello.

90
00:04:30,579 --> 00:04:32,910
It's an honor to meet you,
Mr. Hassan.

91
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,279
Hello, my name is Goo Ha Na,
a tour guide.

92
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:37,949
Are you with Hyesung Tour?

93
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,990
No, I was at Restaurant Mirim
because of work,

94
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,589
and I saw them leave
without finishing his meal.

95
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,459
I was wondering
if it was because of frozen meat.

96
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,730
These meal boxes were made
with fresh halal meat.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,129
- If they didn't have dinner...
- They did.

98
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,569
- Is that halal?
- Yes.

99
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:00,810
Really?

100
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,509
They seem to enjoy it, right?

101
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:11,120
Even Hyesung Tour didn't know this.
How did you find out?

102
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,350
I have a regular guest of seven years
who is also like them.

103
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:16,819
The guest never eats
any frozen meat.

104
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,029
By any chance,

105
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,870
could you ask if that dinner
would have a negative impact...

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,300
on his business
with Daeri Construction?

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,839
No problem.

108
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,339
- "No problem."
- My gosh.

109
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,310
Thank you.

110
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,149
Are you busy in two days?

111
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,149
No, why?

112
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,420
There was a problem
with my scheduling,

113
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:51,160
so I've been looking for a guide
to assist the lady when she shops.

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
I'll do it.

115
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,129
But she's a guest
traveling with Hyesung Tour,

116
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,360
so I need to ask
for their understanding.

117
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,629
I'll manage that.

118
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,269
Gosh, thank you.

119
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,019
It all came down to this,

120
00:06:21,019 --> 00:06:22,750
so you should apply for a job
at Hyesung Tour.

121
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,420
They were hiring
tour guides with experience.

122
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,129
Hwang Jin Goo is the president,
so I'm never going to get it.

123
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,930
On top of that...

124
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,629
- Who are you?
- Why did she just slap me?

125
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,000
Who the heck are you?

126
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,740
The more I thought about it,
the more offended I was.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,769
How am I going to retaliate?

128
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:45,310
Do you know that woman
who's always with Hwang Jin Goo?

129
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,310
Yoon Se Young?

130
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:50,110
She's the team leader
of Hyesung's Tour Planning Team...

131
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,220
and Hwang Jin Goo's fiancee.

132
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,279
Why? Did you have a go at her, too?

133
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,750
I don't go around picking fights.

134
00:06:55,649 --> 00:06:56,790
What's she like?

135
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,160
A girl hated by everyone.

136
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:00,629
Right?

137
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,759
She obviously seemed rude.

138
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,199
Does she go on power trips
with her team members?

139
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,899
That wasn't what I meant.

140
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,029
She's the chairwoman's niece
and the only legal heiress,

141
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,300
so everyone is jealous of her,

142
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,670
like Cinderella.

143
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:15,470
An heiress?

144
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,910
I want to be like her.
She's my role model.

145
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,509
All women should
live like Yoon Se Young.

146
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:22,149
Move.

147
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,620
- Gosh.
- My fight is too strong.

148
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,250
I'd never meet her again,
so I should've just slapped back.

149
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,889
Come on.

150
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,129
Ha Na, life always comes...

151
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,360
with variables and exceptions.

152
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,300
Hwang Jin Goo
may wake up late in the morning,

153
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,300
and he may get into an accident
the day before your interview.

154
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,740
I kicked a slipper
and hit Hwang Jin Goo's head.

155
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,740
You're really tough.

156
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,740
I said he'd suffer from betrayal...

157
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,079
if he stabbed me in the back
like this.

158
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,449
You're over.

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,579
Ha Na, I think this is a sign...

160
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,149
that you should focus on
becoming a housewife.

161
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,089
- Do you want water?
- No.

162
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,310
Why didn't you sew that in the day?

163
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,680
It's bad for your eyes, Mom.

164
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,009
My eyes are still going strong.

165
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,519
These blankets are for you
and Se Young. Isn't it pretty?

166
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,850
We could've just bought one.
Why did you make this hard for you?

167
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,990
It's for my precious son
and daughter-in-law,

168
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,159
so it's hardly trouble.

169
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,460
I wanted to do this myself.

170
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,529
Myung Ji said you'd be
the head director very soon.

171
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,169
Is that so?

172
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,269
The head director was recruited?

173
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:53,139
It's something I heard
from the board of directors.

174
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,909
He seemed to be recommended
by the investor.

175
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,710
Mom, did you want to see me
become the head director?

176
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,250
It'd be great if you became one.

177
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:06,049
But you prefer assisting
the chairwoman to getting promoted.

178
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,720
Myung Ji kept patronizing me.

179
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,120
I just wanted to knuckle her
on the head yesterday.

180

Aren't you going to wash up?

182
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,419
Why? Did something bad happen
during the wedding photoshoot?

183
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,990
How did you know?

184
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:48,289
Why? What's going on?

185
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:52,399
I ran into Goo Ji Seok at the hotel.

186
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,200
What?

187
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,769
Wait, why was he at our hotel?

188
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:00,200
He's staying there.

189
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:04,279
There are many other hotels.
Why is he staying there?

190
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,139
Tell him to leave immediately.

191
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:07,779
He must've made it big.

192
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,649
He looked sharp.

193
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,750
My gosh.

194
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:15,649
He's an orphan
without any connections.

195
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,590
He couldn't have made it big.

196
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,090
Hey, if he makes it big,

197
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,360
I'll eat my hat.

198
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,960
If you make enough money,
it means you made it.

199
00:10:24,259 --> 00:10:27,899
So, what did he do to make money?

200
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:30,330
No idea. I don't care.

Yes, the loan I took out

There were 17 more years
to pay it off,

but it'll be a piece of cake
for an executive to find a job.

294
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:18,750
You should take charge
and give her a job.

295
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,379
It's illegal
to request a job like this.

296
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,690
On top of that, I couldn't do that
if she was fired for an illegal gig.

- Why should I?
- "Why should I?"

00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:29,159
We're family!

300
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,460
Family should help each other
when we're in need.

301
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,700
Didn't you learn that
back in kindergarten?

302
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:36,129
- Family?
- Yes, family.

303
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:39,539
Right, that was the word
you hated most.

304
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,409
Little brother,
do you have to do this now?

305
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,580
You need to eat first.
You love raw fish.

306
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,080
Don't get delusional and think
you're doing your part...

307
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,649
as an older brother
just by buying a few pieces of fish.

308
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,190
Like it or not, Ha Na is
the breadwinner for our family.

309
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,360
What have you done
as the eldest son anyway?

310
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,889
You left for America five years ago
as if you were running away.

311
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:04,230
Did you want to be an older brother
now that you were better off?

312
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,200
No, thanks. You aren't welcome.

313
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,900
- That's enough!
- Ouch.

314
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,799
Yes, I'll do my part as an older brother
and the breadwinner.

315
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,809
So, stop complaining
and try to work with me.

316
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,440
How are you going to play your part?

317
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,579
Do you think
giving us money is the end?

318
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,450
I'm moving to an apartment soon.
You two should move in.

319
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,380
An apartment?
Is it yours? Where is it?

320
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,890
I'll tell Ha Na.
So, pretend like you didn't know.

321
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,250
She'll marry anyway.

322
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,990
Are you trying
to split her up from us?

323
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,059
Look what we're doing!
Why are we leaving Ha Na out?

324
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,329
What will happen to her without us?

325
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:40,730
She'll be happier.

326
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,569
Don't you think you two are
holding Ha Na back?

327
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,250
- Gosh.
- I'm tired.

328
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,509
My goodness. It looks so pretty.

329
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,150

330
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,089
- It looks amazing.
- It does.

331
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:04,819
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

332
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,720
Please.

333
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,130
- It's huge.
- I'm looking forward to this.

334
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,730
She doesn't share
a drop of blood with us.

335
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,160
How long will you live off her?

336
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,500
Who cares about blood?

337
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:17,400
Mom and Dad wouldn't have adopted her
if they cared about that.

338
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,869
- That's enough.
- Continue!

339
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,640
Ha Na and the two of us...

340
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,170
never had such a thought.

341
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,279
Isn't that so, Ji Eun?

342
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:29,049
I don't know what Ha Na is thinking.

343
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:30,880
How disloyal.

344
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,779
I don't want to force anything.

345
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,750
Live however you want to.

346
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:36,390
It's up to you
to choose who you live with.

347
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,190
Take your time to finish
before you come out.

348
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,299
And now I'm too depressed to eat.

349
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,130
Why did you come today?
Did you come here to fight?

350
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,640
You shouldn't live like that,
you evil brat.

351
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:00,279
"Brat?"

352
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,680
Don't be so cheeky! That punk.

353
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,410
Darn it.

354
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,490
- My gosh.
- Breakfast begins at 7 a.m.

355
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,789
- Please enjoy your meal.
- Okay.

356
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,220
Your guide will come
and meet you at 9 a.m.

357
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,730
Then, please have a great rest.

358
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,160
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

359
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,130
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

360
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,170
Uncle Ji Seok.

361
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,309
He looks like Uncle Ji Seok.

362
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,220
Did the three of them meet
without telling Auntie Ha Na?

363
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,390
Let's go, Auntie.

364
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,789
You must be hungry.

365
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,259
Let's go.

366
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,000
Wait.

367
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,200
What's wrong, Auntie?

369
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,089
Auntie, are you getting a new job?

370
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,390
I don't know.

(Hyesung Tour: Open Recruitment

372
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:29,230
Come here.

373
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,039
What?

374
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,109
Ji Eun and Ji Chang?

375

(White Butterfly Tour)

376
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,750
Ji Eun! Ji Chang!

377
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:48,089
I thought you had to meet someone
for dinner, Ji Chang.

378
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,019
Yes, I did.

379
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,519
Wait, you did, too.

380
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,990
I met someone at the hotel.

381
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,630
Was it the two of you?

382
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,759
Are you crazy? I'm already sick
of eating with him at home.

383
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,329
Jeez, those are my words.

384
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,630
They're doing this again.

385
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,630
- Hop in.
- We'll take the bus.

386
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,869
That's the car for your work.

387
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:06,670
Yes, Ha Na. You should do your job.

388
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,309
I can do that
after I drop you off. Hop in.

389
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,910
Just go.

390
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,839
There's no need to pay the bus fare.

391
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:14,109
Hop in now.

392
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,319
Come on.

393
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,450
It's not like
the bus fare costs a lot.

394
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:30,190
It's not every day
you run into your family outside.

395
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:32,660
It's so nice
to run into each other, isn't it?

396
00:21:37,869 --> 00:21:39,039
Maybe it's just me.

397
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,140
Ji Chang, did you meet someone
at the hotel, too?

398
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,140
Yes... I mean...

399
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:48,079
No, I was passing by,
then I had to use the restroom.

400
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,309
What did you eat for dinner?

401
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,319
I had spicy fish soup.

402
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:54,720
Was it good?

403
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,720
It tasted like spicy fish soup.

404
00:21:57,089 --> 00:21:58,720
- Who did you eat with?
- What?

405
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,990
- My friend.
- Your friend? Who?

406
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,730
Someone you don't know.

407
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,869
Did you have a friend
I didn't know of?

408
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:11,130
Do you now keep secrets from me?

409
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,640
Can we please go in peace?

410
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,069
You're so talkative.

411
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:17,509
Did something make you mad, girl?

412
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,250
Why are you glaring at me?
Look forward.

413
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,220
Darn it. Jeez.

00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:35,329
Like it or not, Ha Na is
the breadwinner for our family.

415
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,559
What have you done
as the eldest son anyway?

416
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,759
You left for America five years ago
as if you were running away.

417
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,170
Did you want to be an older brother
now that you were better off?

418
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,809
Make sure you feed Eun Chong first.

419
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,380
Don't worry about that,
and drive safely, Ha Na.

420
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,819
I'll be back.

421
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,589
Uncle Ji Chang, Auntie Ji Eun,
you two are bad!

422
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,789
You lied to Auntie Ha Na!

423
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,630
What's he saying?

424
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,269
Hey, we didn't lie.

425
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,410
- I saw everything.
- What?

426
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,380
You two met with Uncle Ji Seok.

427
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,809
Why didn't you tell Auntie Ha Na
that Uncle Ji Seok was here?

428
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,319
She's always waiting for him.

429
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,720
Hey, that's...

430
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:38,559
Hey, this kid has a knack
for making me feel flustered.

431
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,759
Uncle Ji Seok did come.

432
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:44,160
But it's a secret
from Auntie Ha Na for a while.

433
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,299
- Why is it a secret?
- Tell me about it.

434
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,569
Keep that going, Eun Chong.
You finally did something I liked.

435
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,839
You're too little
to know everything.

436
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,470
We're doing this for Auntie Ha Na.

437
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,740
How is this for Auntie Ha Na?

438
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,480
Hey, you're pretty sharp.

439
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,339
Why? Because things are hectic
after she lost her job...

440
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:05,950
She lost her job?

441
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,920
Yes, she got fired.

442
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,089
Your favorite Auntie Ha Na is
now unemployed. Happy now?

443
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:12,690
- What is she going to do?
- What do you mean, kid?

444
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,220
Just stay quiet.

445
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,099
Do you like it?

446
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,910
- My gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

447
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,240
Look at this.

448
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,609
- Do you want to try this?
- Yes.

449
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,480
Oh, my gosh. It's so cute.

450
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,180
How about you try these two?

451
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:38,220
Let's see which one is better.

452
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,380
Oh, my gosh. It looks so pretty.

453
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,589
- It looks so pretty.
- Really?

454
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,259
- My gosh, you look great.
- How is it?

455
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:49,990
One, two, three.

456
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,730
It's so beautiful.

457
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,069
This one.

458
00:24:57,069 --> 00:24:58,670
This one is so pretty, too.

459
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,440
- This one is so cute.
- My gosh.

460
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,609
Amira's interpreter left?

461
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,839
Then, who is she shopping with?

462
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,450
The interpreter said
she found someone on her own.

463
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,809
They're our guest.
We should've found someone.

464
00:25:12,049 --> 00:25:14,579
Did another travel agency hear this
and get to her first?

465
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:17,349
They were greatly satisfied
with the halal boxed meals,

466
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,259
and the guide was
someone who got those.

467
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:21,019
"Halal boxed meals?"

468
00:25:22,089 --> 00:25:23,289
Who was the guide?

469
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,329
Thank you, Ha Na.
I had such a great time, thanks to you.

470
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,900
I will definitely call you
when I'm in Korea next time.

471
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,470
I'm glad to hear that.

472
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,500
If you need anything,
just call me anytime. Okay?

473
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,740
Of course.

474
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,880
Oh, my brooch. It's gone.

475
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,140
I think I lost it.

476
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,180
When did you start not seeing it?

477
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,549
Do you have any idea
where you dropped it?

478
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:47,480
I must've dropped it
while we were shopping.

479
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,049
It's an important gift
from my mother.

480
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,990
It's super important to me.

481
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,460
Oh, my gosh. Where did it go?

482
00:25:55,059 --> 00:25:59,230
Okay, Amira. I'll go check
the places we visited today.

483
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,069
Just... Don't worry,
and go up to your room.

484
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:04,400
You might be late
for your prayer time. Okay?

485
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:05,640
Okay.

486
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,400
You have to find it.

487
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,940
Sure.

488
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,009
- Take these.
- Okay.

489
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,210
Please don't worry about it.

490
00:26:16,109 --> 00:26:17,509
Thank you so much.

491
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,519
Amira.

492
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,490
Hello.

493
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes, hello.

494
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,490
My guest lost her hijab brooch.

495
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:33,160
Could you look in the store
and see if she dropped it?

496
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,200
It's very important.

497
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,500
Yes, I'll be there now. Goodbye.

498
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:43,539
It's you again.

499
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,710
You knew she was
an important guest to us,

500
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,549
yet you took up this job
as an unqualified guide...

501
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,609
Hey.

502
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,680
I guess you have a habit...

503
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,720
of suspecting people, blaming them,
and talking down to everyone.

504
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,250
It was a personal request
from the interpreter.

505
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,660
I said I had to ask Hyesung Tour
for their understanding,

506
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,529
and she said she'd manage.
What more do you want?

507
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:05,029
You should've done your job
if you snatched our guest.

508
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,160
What will you do about the brooch?

509
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,829
I'll start looking.

510
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,970
If that brooch causes trouble
for my client's business,

511
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,640
I won't let you live.

512
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,650
She brought the halal box meals
and found out about the frozen meat?

513
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,150
What's with my luck
yesterday and today?

514
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,220
She was the one
who should apologize to me!

515
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,069
What?

516
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
Gosh, that's not it.

517
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,309
Excuse me.

518
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,450
Where could it be?

519
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,190
I was worried
about how you couldn't sleep.

520
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,089
Should I get you a prescription?

521
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,190
I don't want to depend on drugs.

522
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,630
Instead, I may consider
picking up drinking.

523
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:11,730
Be my drinking buddy.

524
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,130
Sure. Please think about
the type of liquor you like.

525
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,630
Something strong.

526
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,039
President Hwang Jin Goo knows
he didn't get the job,

527
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,039
so why did he stay quiet?

528
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,740
He might be more cautious
than I expected.

529
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,640
Should I leak the information
to the board?

530
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:28,950
They'll find out soon enough.

531
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,390
I didn't expect to see you here.

532
00:28:38,089 --> 00:28:39,960
There are millions of hotels
here in Seoul.

533
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,160
How dare you set foot in here?

534
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,789
Hey, get out of here.

535
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:47,829
Why do you care
which hotel I stay at, lady?

536
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,430
"Lady?"

537
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,269
You little...

538
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,099
Let go of me.

539
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,569
Mom.

540
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,309
- Let go of me.
- Let go of her.

541
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,839
Darn it.

542
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:05,079
Hey. You must've become a big shot.

543
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,380
What's with you?
You're at the hotel.

544
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,019
- Let's go.
- You.

545
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,190
Leave the place now.

546
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,029
Good grief.

547
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:27,400
Have you lost your mind?

548
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,539
What if Jin Goo
or Aunt Yeo Jin saw you?

549
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:31,069
I lost it...

550
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,740
the moment I saw him.

551
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:37,880
Why is he lurking around here?
What an eyesore.

552
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,049
He'll find you the same.

553
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,119
Why did you date
someone lowly like him?

554
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,420
That was why we broke up.

555
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,230
I'm dating Jin Goo
and marrying him as you want.

556
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,130
Do you think
Jin Goo is good enough for me?

557
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,369
I had no other choice
because of Yeo Jin.

558
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,839
Why are you here?

559
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,640
I went to see your newlywed home,

560
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,440
then came to have dinner with you.

561
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,809
I have to eat dinner
with Aunt Yeo Jin and Jin Goo.

562
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:09,410
The three of you?

563
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:12,480
Will she appoint him
as the head director?

564
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,589
I know it.

565
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,660
I'll stay out of this,

566
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,490
so call me right away
after you hear the news.

567
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:33,099
I'm sorry. I wanted to make you
the head director before marriage.

568
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:35,970
It's all right.
The business comes first.

569
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,210
Jin Goo will do
great things in the future,

570
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,109
so he won't fret
over a small matter like this.

571
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,609
We knew you made a wise judgment.

572
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,180
Thank you.

573
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,779
When did those little kids
grow up this much?

574
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,059
You know how much
your support means to me, right?

575
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,430
I'll work even harder, Aunt Yeo Jin.

576
00:30:57,289 --> 00:31:00,130
My dream had always been
to support you by your side,

577
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,759
so I should be thankful.

578
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,299
Do you want to know what he's like?

579
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,869
I heard he was someone
recommended by an investor.

580
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,140
You knew about this?

581
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:12,039
It wasn't anything official.

582
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,480
What's he like?

583
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,279
All I know about him is
his educational background.

584
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,220
I was worried because
he hadn't shown what he could do.

585
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:26,359
I'll keep an eye on him,
find a fault, and then fire him.

586
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,890
He should be a decent man...

587
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,890
both for your business and me.

588
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,329
That would hurt my pride
a little less.

589
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,000
What you just said
had a hidden meaning.

590
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,339
Honestly speaking, I'd be lying
if I said I wasn't bothered.

591
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,799
I was a little bothered.

592
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,710
Then, you can be the judge.

593
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:49,309
I thought you should meet him
before he takes office, so I called him.

594
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,819
It'd be nice to meet him
as soon as possible.

595
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,519
All right, then.

596
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,160
Ms. Chairwoman.

597
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:11,630
Come on in.

598
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,410
He's President Hwang Jin Goo
of Hyesung Tour.

599
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,880
- My name is Hwang Jin Goo.
- I'm Goo Ji Seok.

600
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,490
She's Team Leader Yoon Se Young
of Hyesung Tour...

601
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,190
and my niece.

602
00:32:32,589 --> 00:32:35,660
Hello, my name is Yoon Se Young.

603
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,430
Hello, I'm Goo Ji Seok.

604
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,150
(Cinderella Game)

605
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,079
You should've handled the money issue
as soon as you broke up.

606
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:35,819
I can't pay that back right away.

607
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:38,089
What the heck is wrong with you?
Come here!

608
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:39,559
Show me what you can do.

609
00:33:39,619 --> 00:33:40,920
That's the only way
I'll approve of you.

610
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,289
Why do I need your approval?

611
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:45,089
It was
the chairwoman's special order.

612
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:48,029
Find the contact for the guide
who found the brooch for Hassan's wife.

613
00:33:48,029 --> 00:33:51,230
Who knows what Aunt Yeo Jin
is hiding to surprise us?

614
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,339
You get just one month.

615
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:55,970
If you don't keep your promise,
I'll set your place on fire.
