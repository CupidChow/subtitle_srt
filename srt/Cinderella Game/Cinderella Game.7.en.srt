1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,379
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:05,139
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,380
Please show me your kindness.

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:12,119
So, you're with Good Day Tour?

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,589
No, please.

7
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,620
Are you an actual guide?
Do you have the license?

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:19,690
Yes, of course, I do.

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:20,929
Let me see it.

10
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:22,989
Do you have to see it?

11
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,460
- So, you don't have it.
- I do.

12
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,200
Here. It's my tourist guide license.

13
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,479
You saw it, right?

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,280
Okay, then.
I'll talk to your company.

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,390
Hey, no. Wait.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
I'll pay for the medical expenses.

17
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,159
You took up a gig
from another company, right?

18
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,329
Yes.

19
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:03,399
- Give it to me.
- Sorry?

20
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:06,299
- My license?
- Medical expenses.

21
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,170
I don't care
about the damage at the club,

22
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,909
but I need the medical expenses
for my friend.

23
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,959
This is all I have.

24
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:38,439
Try to live legitimately.
Don't do anything illegal, okay?

25
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,510
Why won't he stop and leave?

26
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,430
What happened?

27
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,129
I got the medical expenses.

28
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,500
Just sue her.

29
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,129
She took up an illegal gig and lied.
What a nasty piece of work.

30
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,400
I need to nip her in the bud...

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,840
so that a guide like that
doesn't lurk around the industry.

32
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:15,009
Where are the kids?

33
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,180
They're taking Myung Soo
to the hospital.

34
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:23,680
I was scared he'd report me
to the tourist association...

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,849
and revoke my license.

36
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,689
Gosh, what a day.

37
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,189
What?

38
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,810
I thought he was Ji Seok.

39
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:52,210
Ji Seok is in Korea?

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,009
Why do I have to keep this
a secret from Ha Na?

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
He said he'd tell her.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,520
So, keep your mouth shut.

43
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,949
What are we doing here?
Are we leaving her out?

44
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:06,460
And why is he sleeping at a hotel
when he has a home here?

45
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,590
Was he ashamed of our place?

46
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,430
Why do you get so worked up?

47
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,960
He'll come home soon,

48
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,900
so let's just stay quiet until then.

49
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:16,830
She'll only cause a commotion
if she finds out.

50
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:19,539
He's the one
who's causing the commotion.

51
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:21,669
He should report to Ha Na
the first thing after he arrives.

52
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,780
How dare he contact us secretly
hiding in a hotel room?

53
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,979
Stop overreacting.

54
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:29,879
Make time on Wednesday night.

55
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,819
Ji Seok asked us to come to dinner.

56
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,189
Jeez. The two mean siblings
can enjoy dinner alone.

57
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,620
You aren't coming?

58
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,030
Do I look like I'll trade my conscience
for a few pieces of meat?

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,659
Why are you bringing
your conscience into this?

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,740
Okay. We're eating a course meal
at the Japanese place at the hotel.

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,300
I'll make the reservation for two.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,169
"Course meal?"

63
00:03:56,009 --> 00:03:59,009
No, I'm not going.
I don't want to eat that.

64
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,409
I don't want to eat it.

65
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,050
- The course meal there costs...
- I don't want to eat it!

66
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,219
You don't want to eat what?

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,659
You surprised me!

68
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,830
Why won't you knock
or say that you're here?

69
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,960
Were you two trashing me?

70
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,430
How was Seok Ki's mother?

71
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,970
Did she welcome you with open arms?
Did she want to set the date soon?

72
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,899
- Do you want to get rid of me soon?
- It's not that.

73
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,410
Ha Na, Ji Eun and...

74
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,610
I wanted fried chicken and beer,
but he kept backing out.

75
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,750
Why did you kick me?

76
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,779
Goodness. It's too late
for fried chicken and beer.

77
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:38,149
Goodnight.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,819
Darn it.

79
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,990
- You better keep your mouth shut.
- What are you going to do?

80
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,220
How dare you do this to your sister?

81
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,290
- You punk.
- Gosh.

82
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
You have no chance against me.

83
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,430
How dare you defy me? Jeez.

84
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,199
The pottery
shattered completely right away.

85
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,110
You really don't know
where Uncle Sung Ho is?

86
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,079
He sends that without a return address.
How would I know?

87
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,410
Don't you think
he's in touch with Aunt Yeo Jin?

88
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,420
She might be hiding that from us.

89
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,980
Why do you think
Sung Ho won't come back?

90
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,620
He went out to find Yu Jin
20 years ago.

91
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:19,420
Has he ever sent
a single update on Yu Jin??

92
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,230
Well, he could've started
a new family with another woman.

93
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,009
Yeo Jin has almost given up
on finding Yu Jin.

94
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,209
She just wants to know if Yu Jin is
dead or alive before she dies.

95
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,509
- Really?
- She heard nothing for five years.

96
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,449
She hasn't even found anyone
who looks similar to her.

97
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,589
Maybe that's why...

98
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,730
my daughter is looking
more and more beautiful.

99
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:55,689
And you've been sleeping well...

100
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,399
without night terrors lately.

101
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,329
It may return any day now.

102
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,930
Hey, don't jinx it.

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,110
Just trust me.

104
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,779
In the end,
Hyesung Group will belong to you.

105
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,300
My mom told me to break up with you.

106
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,870
But I'll marry you as soon
as Eun Chong is out of your life.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,170
How much money did I lose yesterday?

108
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,269
What a waste.

109
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,670
Try to live legitimately.
Don't do anything illegal, okay?

110
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,879
Did he feel bad
for the speeding ticket?

111
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,319
He did have a bit of conscience.

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,360
I'm fired?

113
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,660
You already know why.

114
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:36,560
You took up an illegal gig
as a private guide yesterday.

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
How long
were you going to deceive me?

116
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:42,899
No, sir. It's not like that.

117
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,569
Yesterday, I...

118
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,439
You told President Hwang Jin Goo
of Hyesung Tour...

119
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:48,709
that you were a private agent.

120
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,339
"President Hwang Jin Goo?"

121
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,579
Are you an actual guide?

122
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,980
Do you have the license?

123
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,350
I felt bad for your situation
and thought highly of you...

124
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,220
because you worked diligently
and hard.

125
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,089
How can you betray me like this?

126
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,459
A year ago, you said you'd quit...

127
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,360
if you took up another illegal gig.

128
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,500
I'm sorry, sir.

129
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,399
I really have no excuses to make.

130
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,899
But this was the first time
after that day.

131
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,170
I only suffered
from a loss yesterday.

132
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,839
I also suffered from a loss!

133
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:24,910
Look at this.

134
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,480
Isn't this you?

135
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:30,579
These are obviously our logo
and your face.

136
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:31,980
What are you going to do now?

137
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:36,549
Just about everyone knows.

138
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:38,389
Do you know
how much damage you've caused?

139
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,429
All our schedules were canceled!

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I lost my money, my job,

141
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,529
and my reputation, too.

142
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:54,940
Can you talk to him once again?

143
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,570
I'm one of the founding members,

144
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,509
and you already know I'm the best
as a tour guide and with my sales.

145
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,710
Then, I might get fired, too.

146
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,679
We're walking on eggshells here.

147
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,120
You should just take a break.

148
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,049
You're going to marry anyway.

149
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,259
Tell me about Seok Ki's mother.

150
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,960
Did she tell you two to marry?

151
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,259
What am I going to do now?

152
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,500
Ask President Hwang
to at least correct the article.

153
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:23,669
As you said,
this is a small industry.

154
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,740
One article like that
can take a toll on you.

155
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,610
Don't you think it's so dirty?

156
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:30,370
How can he betray me like this?

157
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:37,919
Hello.

158
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,419
I'm here to meet
President Hwang Jin Goo.

159
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:42,620
Is he in the office?

160
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,289
Do you have a reservation?

161
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,419
I don't,

162
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,690
but tell him it's Goo Ha Na,
the tour guide, and he'll know.

163
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:54,000
Wait, he's here.

164
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,669
Hello, President Hwang!

165
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,809
- Why are you here?
- Please spare me some time.

166
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,309
I have something to tell you.

167
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,779
I'm a little busy.

168
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,919
I was fired
after what happened yesterday.

169
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,250
Could you make a statement
to correct the news article?

170
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,090
- What news article?
- About how I was an illegal agent.

171
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,860
The Internet was full of my photos
and articles about me.

172
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,929
We were done talking yesterday,
so why did you release this article?

173
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,500
I need to nip her in the bud...

174
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,000
so that a guide like that
doesn't lurk around the industry.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,309
Can't you show me an understanding
as someone in the same industry?

176
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,570
How can I overlook this?

177
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,509
You clearly said
you took up an illegal gig,

178
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:39,039
and I told them only what I heard.

179
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,419
But still,
how can you stab me in the back?

180
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,220
This elevator
isn't open to the public.

181
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,690
Just five minutes.

182
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,000
I took up a gig on the side,
but I only ended up losing money.

183
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,529
I lost my money, my job,

184
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:01,299
and my reputation, too.

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,200
Please let me save my reputation...

186
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,039
- Please leave.
- by correcting the article.

187
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,070
That's the only way
I can get a job elsewhere.

188
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,340
I thought you were a good person
when you gave the money back,

189
00:11:13,779 --> 00:11:15,809
but you stabbed me in the back
with a smile on your face.

190
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,120
Get out.

191
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:30,559
- Please let me off this once.
- Do I have to drag you out?

192
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:37,799
Now!

193
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,399
Why are the rich always so cold?

194
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,139
How can he be so heartless
if he works at such a big company?

195
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,139
Darn it.

196
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:20,679
It's Ha Na.

197
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:23,610
You didn't have
to release an article.

198
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:27,019
These small tourist companies
that recently popped up...

199
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:29,220
would lead to the consumers' loss
if we didn't deal with them.

200
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,360
Most companies in tourism are
small businesses.

201
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,519
There aren't too many corporations
who are in this.

202
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,590
The problem is that guides like her
taint the entire industry.

203
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,200
She needs to suffer now
so she won't do that again.

204
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,470
You clearly showed you could end
someone's life if they crossed you.

205
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,000
You'd better be careful, too.

206
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,840
Yes, of course.

207
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,039
You were fired?

208
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:53,710
Keep it a secret from Eun Chong.

209
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,679
You're talking about him again?

210
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,720
Why would you care about him
when you just lost your job?

211
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,549
Anyway, what does your termination
have to do with President Hwang?

212
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,789
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

213
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,789
Find out Hwang Jin Goo's schedule
for today and tomorrow.

214
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,960
What? Me?

215
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,960
Right. I should ask Ji Eun.

216
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,700
What?

217
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,470
Hey, Hyun Ju.

218
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:23,570
A pick-up at the airport? What time?

219
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,279
- He's staying at our hotel?
- Yes.

220
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,480
We'll receive the investment
only after he becomes the head director.

221
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,620
We should move this forward quickly.

222
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,720
Set up a meeting tomorrow evening.

223
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,120
Yes, ma'am.
Should I inform President Hwang...

224
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,259
I'll do it.

225
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,830
A talent recommended by Richard Han?

226
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,129
(Yeonji University,
NYU Storn School of Business)

227
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,399
He must've been chosen
because of his looks.

228
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,500
(Resume, Name: Goo Ji Seok)

229
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,710
Tomorrow evening?

230
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,070
It's been 13 years.

231
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,509
Are you nervous?

232
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,179
Let's call it anticipation.

233
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:04,620
Please continue to update more information
about Hyesung Group.

234
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,850
Yes, sir. I also have the file you wanted
on President Hwang Jin Goo.

235
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:11,759
So, he's the most likely to succeed?

236
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:14,730
Yes, sir. Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin
once had a daughter,

237
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,059
but she went missing a long time ago
and was never heard from again.

238
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,730
Her closest heir is her niece,
Team Leader Yoon Se Young.

239
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,230
But she also has much trust
for President Hwang...

240
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,970
and considers him
almost like an adopted son.

241
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,970
He's also the key contributor
in turning Hyesung Tour...

242
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,509
into the runner-up in the industry
within a short period of time.

243
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,480
On top of that,
the two are to marry,

244
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,940
and this is almost certain.

245
00:14:34,309 --> 00:14:36,149
Almost doesn't mean 100 percent.

246
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,820
(1. Basic Information)

247
00:14:40,149 --> 00:14:44,149
Breakfast will be served
from 7 a.m. in the restaurant...

248
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,419
- located in the lobby.
- Okay.

249
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,360
- Enjoy your rest. Bye.
- Thank you.

250
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,389
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

251
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,799
- Bye.
- Have a good day.

252
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,570
What?

253
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,870
Ji Seok?

254
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,039
Ji Seok!

255
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,820
It seemed like him.

256
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,220
What are you doing?

257
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,830
Hey, I just saw someone...

258
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,590
- who looked like Ji Seok.
- What?

259
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,299
His profile and the back looked
exactly like Ji Seok.

260
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,399
I saw him yesterday, too.

261
00:15:27,669 --> 00:15:29,830
Why would he be here
and not in America?

262
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,539
When will he come home?

263
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,169
Gosh, he might get caught.

264
00:15:35,169 --> 00:15:38,080
So, have you found out
Hwang Jin Goo's schedule?

265
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,580
He's doing a wedding photo shoot
at our hotel tomorrow.

266
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:41,850
"Wedding?"

267
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,409
That's not what I want to know.

268
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,980
Does he have any meetings outside?

269
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,379
What can you offer?

270
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,690
Tell me now.

271
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,990
After his wedding photo shoot,

272
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,019
he has a meeting
at Restaurant Mirim in the evening.

273
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,289
"Restaurant Mirim?"

274
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,129
I'm good friends
with the kitchen lady there.

275
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,700
- What's she saying?
- Okay.

276
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,179
President Hwang Jin Goo.

277
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:24,149
I got curious about how amazing
the man you chose is.

278
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,320
Have you been digging into
my background?

279
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,129
Words reached my ears first.

280
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,299
Se Young.

281
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,669
Jin Goo.

282
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:40,039
You look wonderful.

283
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,379
Start canceling contracts
with the hotels...

284
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,610
in affiliation
with the travel agency.

285
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,850
Then, call car rental companies
and restaurants as well.

286
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,960
Chairwoman Shin was invested in
the travel agency, so she'd protest.

287
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,690
And things are only fun
with some opposition.

288
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,730
I'll reach out with updates.
Goodbye.

289
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,339
Spread the word
about the head director's recruitment...

290
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,849
so that Hwang Jin Goo will hear it.

291
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,579
Let him know that
he didn't get the job.

292
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,490
Where are you?

293
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,619
Ten minutes?

294
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,559
All right.

295
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,240
It's been over 30 minutes.
Why isn't she here yet?

296
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,609
Did she get into an accident?

297
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,730
What are you doing here?

298
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:14,769
I went into a construction zone
and had to take a huge detour.

299
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,339
The navigator in a foreign car is
far from smart.

300
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,910
- Then, you could've called...
- Bang Ul, let's go.

301
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,589
The daughter-in-law
of Gangnam Hotel...

302
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:37,690
got this ring?

303
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:42,890
But I don't want the same design.
It makes me feel like a copycat.

304
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,500
How much is it?

305
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,599
I'll manage.

306
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,400
Show me something a grade higher,

307
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,569
the most expensive one you have.

308
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:56,269
Please give me a moment.

309
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:02,410
I hear people often have weddings
on a cruise ship.

310
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,779
Daeyang Industry's daughter
also did it on a cruise ship.

311
00:19:07,819 --> 00:19:09,519
Our hotel is great,

312
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,019
but the ballroom is too tiny.

313
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,230
My family isn't any less than them.

314
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,529
She'll be Hyesung Group's successor.

315
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,099
You should tailor your ambitions...

316
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,069
to the measure of your abilities.

317
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:28,309
Why are you bringing up
my ambition and abilities?

318
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,240
Jin Goo's the one with ambition,
and Se Young is the capable one.

319
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,480
His ambition will come true
once he marries Se Young...

320
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,349
after he becomes the head director.

321
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,950
Her situation doesn't seem
any different from us.

322
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,019
Forget the bloodline.

323
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,190
Jin Goo and Se Young are
completely different.

324
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,829
She's no longer the daughter
of the same Choi Myung Ji...

325
00:19:48,829 --> 00:19:50,690
who used to freeload off Yeo Jin.

326
00:19:51,089 --> 00:19:55,369
Yes, sure. You own a building
in the most expensive area.

327
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,230
My goodness.

328
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,809
Bang Ul, you can run along
and shop for groceries.

329
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,039
I'll decide on the rings.

330
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:09,710
This one is really pretty.

331
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,589
How much is this?

332
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:21,829
The head director was recruited?

333
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,960
It's something I heard
from the board of directors.

334
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,700
He seemed to be recommended
by the investor.

335
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,369
"The investor?" Richard Han?

336
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,470
- Do you need more time?
- Yes, just ten minutes.

337
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,009
- Is something going on?
- No.

338
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,640
The wedding photo shoot
took a toll on me.

339
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,009
Yes, more than I expected.

340
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,009
- I'll be downstairs, then.
- Okay.

341
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:50,319
- Are you sure?
- I overheard it in the restroom,

342
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,920
so I wasn't entirely sure.

343
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:54,890
Even if the investor
made this recommendation,

344
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,630
how could she
not say a word to you...

345
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,460
Watch what you say
if you aren't sure yet.

346
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,000
Even if it was accurate,

347
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,430
- pretend like you didn't know.
- Yes, sir.

348
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,200
Are you all right?

349
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,599
If it is true,
then I am a little curious...

350
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,269
about what the person is like.

351
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,680
Didn't you see me?

352
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,890
You're staying here?

353
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,329
As you can see.

354
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,700
- Why?
- Why?

355
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,529
Why did you come to Hyesung Hotel
out of millions of hotels out there?

356
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,329
Was it because of me?

357
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,369
You're still as delusional as ever.

358
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,470
My company got me a room here.
That's all.

359
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,309
You got a job? Who do you work for?

360
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,210
No, I don't want to know.

361
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,990
You look great.

362
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,289
I couldn't see
a trace of Goo Ji Seok,

363
00:21:56,289 --> 00:21:58,119
who picked up trash early in the day
in the streets of New York.

364
00:22:00,589 --> 00:22:02,859
Everything began to take off
after I ended it with you.

365
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:10,430
(Jin Goo)

366
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,470
Where is she?

367
00:22:18,009 --> 00:22:19,309
(Jin Goo)

368
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,119
It's not so bad
to see you do so well, Ji Seok.

369
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,319
I once loved you,

370
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,920
so it wouldn't be fun for me
to reunite with a loser.

371
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,190
I don't care what you think is fun.

372
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,099
You'll be married soon.

373
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:47,140
Se Young.

374
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,759
We have to go now.

375
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:27,880
Excuse me.

376
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,410
Have you seen
a young woman around here?

377
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:32,720
No.

378
00:23:34,019 --> 00:23:35,089
Wait.

379
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,859
I saw someone near the pool.

380
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,690
Thank you.

381
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,619
Hey, Jin Goo. I was near the pool.

382
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,089
I'll be there soon.

383
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,259
Okay.

384
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,420
This way, please.

385
00:24:45,589 --> 00:24:46,660
Yes.

386
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,259
Please serve
a good amount of food...

387
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,700
and avoid using dishes
made of gold or silver.

388
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,200
- Are you using halal meat?
- Of course.

389
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,730
We'll get everything ready
and begin serving right away.

390
00:25:04,609 --> 00:25:05,910
Hello, President Hwang.

391
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,609
Are you stalking me?

392
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,349
I'm really sorry.

393
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,680
So, please correct
just the news article.

394
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,190
I'm the breadwinner of my family,
so I must make money.

395
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,549
Can't you see that I'm working?

396
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,730
That article is preventing me
from getting another job...

397
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:23,390
What are you doing?

398
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,630
Let go of me! Let go!

399
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,109
Gosh, I'm sorry.

400
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,680
I didn't do it on purpose.

401
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,480
Do you wish to die?

402
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,450
If you lurk around me one more time,

403
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,519
I'll kick you out
from this industry forever.

404
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:54,059
You must be so great.

405
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,029
What now?

406
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,130
Are you deaf?

407
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,700
I said, "You must be so great."

408
00:26:04,269 --> 00:26:07,569
Yes, my mother always says that.
"You're such a great son."

409
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:09,539
And at work, I'm a great boss,
a great subordinate,

410
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:11,779
and a great colleague,
so I hear that everywhere I go.

411
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,339
You're a good judge of character.

412
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,849
Were you allowed to ruin other lives
just because you were great?

413
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,119
Yes, fine. I did break the rules.

414
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:24,190
But it wasn't like
I caused you damage...

415
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,890
or conned other people.

416
00:26:26,259 --> 00:26:29,359
What right do you have
to make me lose my job?

417
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,700
You were an embarrassment
to the entire industry.

418
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,799
And as someone in the industry,
I have the freedom to expose...

419
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,930
a guide who resorts to expediency,

420
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,470
causes damage to the agency,
and has a problem with her morals.

421
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,500
Didn't you know?

422
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,900
Leave. Stop bothering me at work.

423
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,039
Let go of me. Let go.

424
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,779
- What's with all the noise?
- Let go!

425
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,109
Let go of me!

426
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,750
Why is that woman here?

427
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,049
Then, how clean and noble...

428
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,150
is your morality?

429
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,990
Have you never resorted
to illegal acts or expediencies?

430
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:03,359
Have you lost your mind?

431
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,230
How dare you show up here?
Leave at once.

432
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,599
I'm not talking to you.

433
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,430
You also went over the speed limit
and got a ticket.

434
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,900
And it didn't seem like
it was your first time.

435
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,970
Isn't it also illegal
to break the traffic regulations?

436
00:27:14,269 --> 00:27:17,039
- What are you doing? Drag her out.
- I'll see myself out!

437
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,980
If you stab people
in the back like this,

438
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:24,849
you'll also find yourself
getting stabbed in the back.

439
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,390
- Darn it.
- You already hit me from the back.

440
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,900
Darn it.

441
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:52,640
What have you done, Goo Ha Na?

442
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,980
I should've begged him for mercy,

443
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,079
but I made a scene instead.

444
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:15,329
Please let us keep
just our father's factory.

445
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,769
This is his life's work.

446
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:20,470
Your father sold this factory off
because of debt.

447
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,440
Hyesung Finance took it over
instead of money.

448
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:26,880
Chairwoman Shin.

449
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,250
Please hear me out.

450
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,420
Chairwoman Shin!
Please let me talk to you!

451
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,079
- Stop it!
- Please, Chairwoman Shin!

452
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,500
Chairwoman Shin is here.

453
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,440
Nice to meet you.
My name is Goo Ji Seok.

454
00:29:00,109 --> 00:29:01,380
I'm Shin Yeo Jin.

455
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,180
It's a risk for the group to recruit
external personnel.

456
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,890
You're a young man
who hasn't proven himself,

457
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,960
so you will face resistance
within the group.

458
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:14,660
It's fun to have resistance...

459
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,430
and face the criticism head-on
through my competence.

460
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,859
You have great confidence.

461
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,529
I look forward to working with a man
recommended by Richard Han.

462
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,039
I'll exceed your expectations.

463
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,940
I get scared when I meet someone...

464
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,109
who seems overly confident.

465
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,079
Because I don't know
what gives them such confidence.

466
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,180
And especially for someone
who shows that in the first encounter.

467
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,619
Some show
a distorted level of confidence...

468
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:46,819
when they deceive someone...

469
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,190
or want to hide their weaknesses.

470
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,660
If you were worried about that...

471
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,660
No.

472
00:29:53,099 --> 00:29:55,700
This was just our first meeting,
and things became too rigid.

473
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,200
I'm not so good with these things.

474
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,869
I enjoy working
with a bit of tension.

475
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,180
He'll go straight to the hotel
after dinner.

476
00:30:06,309 --> 00:30:09,349
His visit to the construction site
changed to Pangyo.

477
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:12,019
Continue to check his schedule
according to the plan.

478
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,819
- Why are you leaving already?
- Hassan!

479
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,519
What's going on?

480
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,390
What did you do with his order?

481
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:22,430
Don't you know how important food is
in communication?

482
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:24,190
Everything was ruined
from the get-go.

483
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,230
He got up after a few bites.

484
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,259
I can't figure out the reason.

485
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,269
I apologize for the concern.

486
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,299
You still have more time
to win his heart.

487
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,640
I will look into the matter
right away.

488
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,150
I can't depend on
my younger siblings.

489
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:44,549
I should find a job.

490
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:46,220
Why do you keep serving them
like your superiors?

491
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,589
What did you get from looking after
your siblings to this day?

492
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:52,190
It wasn't business.
I didn't need to get anything.

493
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,589
What was the problem?

494
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,630
I didn't use
any artificial flavoring,

495
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,430
and I thoroughly checked
the list of allergies, too.

496
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,579
Why are you adding to my trouble?

497
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,049
Nothing is easy in my life.

498
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,619
I wasn't saying
what I did was right,

499
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,890
but I was just trying hard
to live a good life.

500
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:28,730
Cut me some slack here.

501
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,029
(Haengun Meat,
Product Name: Beef ribs, halal)

502
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,839
Could it have been our etiquette,
not the food?

503
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:49,809
We should find the reason first.

504
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:54,049
I'll make sure this isn't a problem
for your business. I'm so sorry.

505
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:17,440
Who are you?

506
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,039
Why did she just slap me?

507
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,339
Who the heck are you?

508
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:07,160
(Cinderella Game)

509
00:33:07,289 --> 00:33:08,930
It's all that woman's fault.

510
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,930
Things kept going wrong
ever since we met her.

511
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,029
Amira's interpreter left?

512
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,529
Then, who is she shopping with?

513
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:17,769
He looks like Uncle Ji Seok.

514
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,069
Like it or not, Ha Na is
the breadwinner for our family.

515
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,140
What did you do
as the eldest son anyway?

516
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,509
President Hwang Jin Goo knows
he didn't get the job,

517
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,509
so why did he stay quiet?

518
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,640
You've become a grown-up.

519
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,549
I'll keep an eye on him,
find a fault, and then fire him.

520
00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:33,450
How long do you think
you can do this,

521
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,180
Chairwoman Shin Yeo Jin?
