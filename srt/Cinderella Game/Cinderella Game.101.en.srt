1
00:00:00,672 --> 00:00:03,542
Ha Na, Se Young is gone.

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:05,242
What?

3
00:00:06,082 --> 00:00:07,452
Se Young is gone?

4
00:00:10,082 --> 00:00:11,582
She canceled her number, too.

5
00:00:16,122 --> 00:00:17,392
(Final Episode)

6
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:24,702
(You will be cursed for abandoning your mother.)

7
00:00:26,332 --> 00:00:27,402
Ha Na.

8
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:30,572
Choi Myung Ji sent a threatening letter to Se Young.

9
00:00:31,272 --> 00:00:32,402
What?

10
00:00:34,012 --> 00:00:35,212
How is she threatening her?

11
00:00:38,612 --> 00:00:40,212
What do you mean Se Young is gone?

12
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:42,612
She was supposed to meet Ji Seok for lunch.

13
00:00:42,612 --> 00:00:45,222
But he couldn't reach her, so he went to her place.

14
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,222
Then, he found this.

15
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:50,892
"You will be cursed..."

16
00:00:50,892 --> 00:00:52,792
"for abandoning your mother?"

17
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,592
She this to her daughter, too?

18
00:00:57,532 --> 00:01:00,572
We also got something like this.

19
00:01:08,072 --> 00:01:09,742
Do you think Eun Chong will be okay?

20
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:12,382
Ms. Jang and I have our eyes on him when we pick him up,

21
00:01:12,382 --> 00:01:13,352
so don't worry about him.

22
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:15,412
It would be much better if she reflected on herself there.

23
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:17,982
Instead of doing that, she became more despicable.

24
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:22,652
Anyway, can you find Se Young?

25
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:25,122
She could've gone into hiding after receiving that odd letter.

26
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,292
What if she was kidnapped?

27
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:31,032
She must've become more desperate after her slush fund went missing.

28
00:01:32,162 --> 00:01:33,232
It's Ji Seok.

29
00:01:35,002 --> 00:01:36,172
Hey, Ji Seok.

30
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:39,402
She was caught on CCTV?

31
00:01:45,742 --> 00:01:46,912
She wasn't kidnapped.

32
00:01:47,212 --> 00:01:49,312
She went out into the parking garage with her suitcase,

33
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,122
got into her car, then left.

34
00:01:52,352 --> 00:01:54,222
Really? I'm glad she wasn't kidnapped.

35
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,152
Okay. Bye.

36
00:01:57,462 --> 00:01:59,062
So, she wasn't kidnapped?

37
00:01:59,062 --> 00:02:01,362
No, she was caught on camera leaving in her car with a suitcase.

38
00:02:01,532 --> 00:02:03,262
Maybe she left on a trip.

39
00:02:08,772 --> 00:02:10,472
Someone sent you a letter.

40
00:02:11,572 --> 00:02:12,602
Who is it from?

41
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:13,912
It doesn't say.

42
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:25,152
Ji Seok. It's me, Se Young.

43
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:28,692
I didn't think I could tell you in person,

44
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:29,892
so I decided to write a letter.

45
00:02:30,392 --> 00:02:32,622
You must be in shock because I disappeared.

46
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:35,532
But please think that...

47
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,562
I disappeared for a while to reappear even clearer.

48
00:02:39,032 --> 00:02:41,172
I want to learn to stand on my own two feet...

49
00:02:41,372 --> 00:02:43,402
in a place where nobody knows me.

50
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:46,102
Hyesung Group.

51
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:47,342
Choi Myung Ji's daughter.

52
00:02:47,912 --> 00:02:50,042
I don't want these heavy titles.

53
00:02:50,842 --> 00:02:52,012
I just want to be Yoon Se Young.

54
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:55,912
I'll try to live only as myself in a place...

55
00:02:57,282 --> 00:02:58,752
where I can do that.

56
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,452
I'll come and find you...

57
00:03:02,122 --> 00:03:04,462
after I learn to fill my day...

58
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:06,862
all by myself.

59
00:03:13,572 --> 00:03:14,632
Se Young...

60
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:23,912
I dream of you every day.

61
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:28,082
Your absence left such a huge void in me,

62
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:30,852
but I don't regret...

63
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:32,382
turning you in.

64
00:03:35,122 --> 00:03:36,222
You brat.

65
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:45,262
I was the only one who could stop you.

66
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,332
(October 7, 2018, 550,000 dollars, Yu Jin's accident)

67
00:03:46,332 --> 00:03:47,432
I also wanted...

68
00:03:48,202 --> 00:03:50,242
to escape from you.

69
00:03:52,102 --> 00:03:54,512
- I feel scared and insufficient. - Bye.

70
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:55,772
No, Se Young!

71
00:03:55,772 --> 00:03:58,042
- But I won't be stuck at age ten. - No, Se Young!

72
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,382
I'll be my 32-year-old self.

73
00:04:01,052 --> 00:04:02,382
Come back to me.

74
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,222
I hope you reflect on yourself and atone for everything you did.

75
00:04:06,382 --> 00:04:07,692
Make sure you eat well.

76
00:04:12,422 --> 00:04:15,292
My daughter, just wait.

77
00:04:16,532 --> 00:04:18,602
I'm a woman chosen by fate.

78
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:21,902
I'll turn everything back.

79
00:04:22,902 --> 00:04:24,202
I'll get you back...

80
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,342
and take Eun Chong away, too.

81
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:29,982
Their wedding is my D-day.

82
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,182
Just wait.

83
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:35,252
(Ilsin District Court)

84
00:04:49,902 --> 00:04:51,902
- Finally, one down. - One down.

85
00:04:51,902 --> 00:04:53,272
This is the real beginning.

86
00:04:53,702 --> 00:04:54,932
Let's keep it going until the end.

87
00:04:54,932 --> 00:04:56,232
- Let's go! - Let's go!

88
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:04,212
There was an audio recording as evidence ...

89
00:05:04,612 --> 00:05:06,512
that the culprits tampered with the brakes on their own...

90
00:05:06,982 --> 00:05:09,352
and caused our parents' accident...

91
00:05:09,482 --> 00:05:11,252
without your order.

92
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,422
I now believe...

93
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:17,192
what you said.

94
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:21,732
But that doesn't mean I'm innocent.

95
00:05:22,732 --> 00:05:25,732
I'll keep paying you back as long as I live.

96
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:33,212
Please accept this.

97
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:36,612
What is this?

98
00:05:37,042 --> 00:05:39,442
I had set up a trust fund...

99
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:42,282
with some of my assets for you and your siblings.

100
00:05:44,782 --> 00:05:45,982
Your assets?

101
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:47,852
This has nothing to do with recent events.

102
00:05:48,092 --> 00:05:50,122
I had done it before I collapsed.

103
00:05:51,622 --> 00:05:54,362
I finally got a chance to explain your parents' car accident,

104
00:05:54,532 --> 00:05:56,532
so I thought it was a good time to give it to you.

105
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:58,332
I hope you accept it.

106
00:06:10,382 --> 00:06:14,352
- It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. - It's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

107
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:16,182
- Six figures... - Six figures... It's six figures.

108
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:18,252
- Right. Ten million? - Seven, eight...

109
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:19,622
Ten million?

110
00:06:19,622 --> 00:06:20,792
We can't accept this.

111
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:24,122
Yes, we don't need this much money.

112
00:06:25,892 --> 00:06:29,562
I did so much wrong against all of you.

113
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,602
I can't undo those sins with this money,

114
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:34,872
but it's a token of my apology.

115
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:36,902
Please accept it.

116
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,672
In that case,

117
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:46,042
- thank you, Ms. Chairwoman. - Thank you.

118
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,212
- Hey. - Hey.

119
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,982
Why not? We can use it to do good.

120
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:53,392
Yes, we can't ignore our elder's sincere gestures.

121
00:06:55,192 --> 00:06:57,592
You can use it however you like.

122
00:06:57,862 --> 00:06:59,062
- Okay. - Okay.

123
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:08,802
My gosh.

124
00:07:09,332 --> 00:07:11,942
No matter how much I think about it, it's just too much money.

125
00:07:14,412 --> 00:07:17,012
It's nowhere near enough to repay my heart's debt,

126
00:07:17,012 --> 00:07:18,612
and don't get me started on your kindness.

127
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:21,282
Then, thank you very much.

128
00:07:21,712 --> 00:07:23,722
But I'll do an even better job at raising Eun Chong.

129
00:07:24,682 --> 00:07:27,622
There was something I wanted to say to you,

130
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:31,522
but I kept hesitating.

131
00:07:32,022 --> 00:07:33,632
It's all right. You can tell me.

132
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,462
I know it's brazen of me to ask at this point in time,

133
00:07:39,732 --> 00:07:42,302
but will you be my daughter?

134
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,472
It would've been much better...

135
00:07:47,472 --> 00:07:48,942
if I just asked you to be my daughter...

136
00:07:49,472 --> 00:07:51,812
instead of deceiving you.

137
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,422
We took a very long detour.

138
00:07:58,622 --> 00:08:00,652
But if it's okay with you,

139
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:03,252
I want to be...

140
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:06,262
your mother.

141
00:08:13,032 --> 00:08:15,172
There's no pressure.

142
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,672
You can give me an answer after you think about it slowly.

143
00:08:20,812 --> 00:08:23,172
There was something I wanted to tell you, too.

144
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,042
Sure.

145
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,382
Will you...

146
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,382
and Mr. Yoon...

147
00:08:32,782 --> 00:08:34,852
sit as my parents at the wedding?

148
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,222
Your parents?

149
00:08:39,822 --> 00:08:40,992
You're saying...

150
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,432
Please be my mom.

151
00:08:47,872 --> 00:08:49,002
Really?

152
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,202
Thank you.

153
00:08:57,182 --> 00:08:58,312
My daughter,

154
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:01,312
may I hold you in my arms?

155
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,652
Let me give you a hug.

156
00:09:11,562 --> 00:09:13,292
Thank you...

157
00:09:15,232 --> 00:09:16,462
for becoming my mom.

158
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:21,672
Thank you, my girl.

(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

160
00:09:41,352 --> 00:09:42,922
I thought I'd feel lighter,

161
00:09:44,092 --> 00:09:45,222
but I feel kind of odd.

162
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,932
I feel completely empty.

163
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,072
I have no idea where to go...

164
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,002
or how I should live.

165
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:01,872
I'm at a loss.

166
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:07,252
Is Se Young doing well?

167
00:10:08,682 --> 00:10:11,052
Where is she, and how's she doing? Why hasn't she reached out?

168
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:15,552

(Chairman Goo Ji Seok)

170
00:10:23,662 --> 00:10:24,802
Hello?

171
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:26,662
Ji Seok.

172
00:10:27,372 --> 00:10:28,502
Yes, Mr. Yoon.

173
00:10:29,402 --> 00:10:30,602
Is something going on?

174
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:34,112
I think I saw Se Young.

175
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:37,412
Where was she?

176
00:10:40,912 --> 00:10:42,212
I heard she was here.

177
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:44,252
Yes, she's over there.

178
00:10:45,952 --> 00:10:49,452
(St. Paul's Home)

179
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:12,672
I like how this place...

180
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,342
never leaves me with random thoughts.

181
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:17,742
I don't have time to think before I move...

182
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:20,752
to look after the children,

183
00:12:20,812 --> 00:12:23,782
clean, do the laundry, and cook.

184
00:12:25,422 --> 00:12:27,252
Then, I'd get a chance to sit...

185
00:12:27,252 --> 00:12:29,052
and listen to the sound of the wind and birds.

186
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:31,562
You're cleaning, doing laundry, and cooking?

187
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:35,732
It's hard to imagine.

188
00:12:36,832 --> 00:12:38,062
I'm not so good at it.

189
00:12:38,702 --> 00:12:40,802
I've barely managed not to become a nuisance.

190
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,972
You didn't seem so bad when I saw you hanging the laundry.

191
00:12:48,572 --> 00:12:49,812
But why was it here?

192
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:52,482
Although I have a feeling I know.

193
00:12:52,912 --> 00:12:55,782
It's where Yu Jin and Ha Na grew up.

194
00:12:57,552 --> 00:13:00,122
I wanted to be here where the two were together...

195
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:03,122
even for a short while.

196
00:13:12,602 --> 00:13:14,802
Is everyone doing well?

197
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,572
Yes.

198
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:19,472
Ha Na and Jin Goo's wedding is right around the corner.

199
00:13:20,202 --> 00:13:21,912
Yes, you're right.

200
00:13:23,942 --> 00:13:25,342
When will you return?

201
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:28,982
Do you need more practice in living alone?

202
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:32,922
Can't you go through trial and error in Seoul...

203
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:37,962
by my side?

204
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,302
How's Se Young doing?

205
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:49,572
She seemed much more stable.

206
00:13:50,132 --> 00:13:52,742
She looked more relaxed than before.

207
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:54,372
I'm glad.

208
00:13:55,512 --> 00:13:58,512
You also seem like you've found your peace.

209
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:02,612
It's all thanks to you.

210
00:14:02,952 --> 00:14:04,182
If it hadn't been for you,

211
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:07,852
it would've been impossible for me to reunite with my wife.

212
00:14:08,822 --> 00:14:09,852
Thank you.

213
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:12,062
And again, I'm sorry.

214
00:14:13,492 --> 00:14:15,532
I thought of you very often.

215
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:17,732
But...

216
00:14:19,032 --> 00:14:21,172
I didn't have the courage to reach out to you.

217
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:24,602
I probably wanted to look away from you,

218
00:14:25,242 --> 00:14:26,702
even though I knew how you really felt.

219
00:14:28,012 --> 00:14:30,242
I was too absorbed in the hurt and shock I experienced...

220
00:14:32,142 --> 00:14:33,312
and became petty.

221
00:14:34,152 --> 00:14:35,282
Don't say that.

222
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:38,322
It also would've been hard for me to accept this even if I were you.

223
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,892
It's only natural that you were hurt.

224
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:44,462
It was something that required time,

225
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,462
so I waited.

226
00:14:48,892 --> 00:14:52,202
At times, I had this thought.

227
00:14:53,632 --> 00:14:55,972
That fate must've led us...

228
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:58,272
to each other in America.

229
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,912
Perhaps my parents...

230
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:03,882
brought you to me.

231
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:05,842
Something like that.

232
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:09,652
If I hadn't met you back then,

233
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:11,322
I would've died...

234
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,622
or failed in getting my revenge.

235
00:15:14,752 --> 00:15:16,292
Even if I had gotten my revenge,

236
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:19,262
the anger I had within me would've killed me.

237
00:15:20,292 --> 00:15:22,192
So, it felt like my parents...

238
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:26,532
sent you to me to prevent that.

239
00:15:32,972 --> 00:15:34,042
May I...

240
00:15:35,842 --> 00:15:38,082
continue to think of you as my father?

241
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:42,582
Then, may I also think of you as my son?

242
00:15:45,382 --> 00:15:46,652
Yes, thank you.

243
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:49,652
And thank you.

244
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:00,402
Have some tteokbokki!

245
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:02,172
Hello.

246
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:05,102
- We just opened. It's delicious! - Thank you.

247
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:08,312
Hello. Have some tteokbokki with stringy cheese!

248
00:16:08,312 --> 00:16:09,572
Enjoy.

249
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:11,382
Your tteokbokki is ready.

250
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,512
Please enjoy.

251
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,012
- Excuse me. - Yes?

252
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:19,222
- May I have some more of this? - Yes, coming right up.

253
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:22,192
Hello.

254
00:16:22,192 --> 00:16:23,992
We just opened the second store...

255
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:25,392
of this tteokbokki brand...

256
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:27,832
which has become the hottest K-food trend around the world.

257
00:16:28,462 --> 00:16:30,432
Hey, this is my favorite tteokbokki brand.

258
00:16:30,432 --> 00:16:31,862
It finally opened in our neighborhood.

259
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:32,932
It's really famous.

260
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:34,772
It's that tteokbokki brand everyone talks about.

261
00:16:34,932 --> 00:16:36,332
We'll have your bestsellers.

262
00:16:36,332 --> 00:16:38,502
Yes, that's a wonderful choice. Please come in.

263
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:42,042
An order of tteokbokki and fried chicken, please!

264
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,472
- Sure! - Okay.

265
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,582
Come on in.

266
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:49,382
Your tteokbokki set and fried chicken are ready.

267
00:16:49,382 --> 00:16:51,282
Try and dip the chicken in this tteokbokki sauce.

268
00:16:51,382 --> 00:16:52,522
I highly recommend it.

269
00:17:00,262 --> 00:17:02,232
It's so crunchy. It's definitely a great place.

270
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:04,432
It was just as he said. The sauce is the real deal.

271
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:06,132
I love how spicy yet sweet it is.

272
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:08,202
The customers all love it.

273
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:11,542
Let's keep this going and open up the third store, too.

274
00:17:31,862 --> 00:17:33,062
What about these?

275
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:35,632
Try it on.

276
00:17:55,352 --> 00:17:56,452
Thank you for coming.

277
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:58,522
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

278
00:17:58,522 --> 00:18:00,452
- Hello. - Congratulations.

279
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,552
It's great to see you.

280
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:03,992
- You're here. - Hello.

281
00:18:04,062 --> 00:18:05,322
Yes, thank you.

282
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:06,822
- Thank you for coming. - Congratulations.

283
00:18:07,532 --> 00:18:08,792
Hello.

284
00:18:10,562 --> 00:18:11,702
Goodness.

285
00:18:11,932 --> 00:18:14,672
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

286
00:18:14,672 --> 00:18:15,972
- I'll see you later. - Okay.

287
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:21,842
One, two three.

288
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:24,982
- Thank you. - Thank you.

289
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:27,282
- Hey. - Have you been well?

290
00:18:27,282 --> 00:18:30,722
- I missed you so much. - You look so beautiful today.

291
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:32,152
- Gosh. - Thank you for coming.

292
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,522
- Thanks. - Congratulations.

293
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:35,752
- Ha Na. - Ha Na, congratulations.

294
00:18:35,752 --> 00:18:37,222
- Hello. - Come and have a seat.

295
00:18:37,222 --> 00:18:38,362
Sure.

296
00:18:39,222 --> 00:18:40,632
- You look so pretty. - Thank you.

297
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:44,932
One, two, three.

298
00:18:46,002 --> 00:18:47,932
- Congratulations. - Thank you for coming.

299
00:18:47,932 --> 00:18:49,132
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

300
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:51,242
- Right? - Congratulations.

301
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:52,942
- You'll be happy. - Yes.

302
00:19:15,692 --> 00:19:16,792
Se Young.

303
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:19,162
Se Young.

304
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:20,502
Congratulations.

305
00:19:21,632 --> 00:19:22,772
You look beautiful.

306
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,202
Thank you for coming.

307
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:27,072
Congratulations, Jin Goo.

308
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:28,442
Congratulations, both of you.

309
00:19:47,832 --> 00:19:48,962
This isn't the place.

310
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:51,402
I'll die if I stay here.

311
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:52,862
This isn't the place.

312
00:19:52,862 --> 00:19:54,172
Will you remove her handcuffs...

313
00:19:54,172 --> 00:19:55,872
to help with the diagnosis?

314
00:19:55,872 --> 00:19:56,972
Sure.

315
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:03,972
Just wait, Yeo Jin.

316
00:20:04,342 --> 00:20:06,782
Today is the last day you'll see your grandson.

317
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:13,022
Get lost. Get out of my head.

318
00:20:14,522 --> 00:20:17,622
You're here to kill me, too.

319
00:20:17,992 --> 00:20:20,492
- No! - Calm down, Inmate 1818.

320
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:26,862
I need to go to the restroom.

321
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:40,642
Goodness.

322
00:20:40,642 --> 00:20:42,652
Inmate 1818! Stop right there!

323
00:20:43,012 --> 00:20:44,982
Inmate 1818! Stop!

324
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:46,922
Stop right there!

325
00:20:49,892 --> 00:20:50,992
You're so cute!

326
00:21:08,972 --> 00:21:10,112
He's so cute.

327
00:22:38,862 --> 00:22:39,962
Ha Na...

328
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:44,172
Hello. I'm Hwang Jin Goo, the groom.

329
00:22:45,342 --> 00:22:48,972
Hello. I'm Goo Ha Na, the bride.

330
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:52,612
You look great!

331
00:22:56,912 --> 00:22:58,182
We're here today...

332
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:01,422
to promise before everyone...

333
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,892
to be each other's chosen partner...

334
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:05,322
for the rest of our lives.

335
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:10,862
And we prepared a little something...

336
00:23:11,602 --> 00:23:14,202
to make our promise even more special.

337
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:15,832
- Is someone singing? - No idea.

338
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,842
Just now, we received the confirmation...

339
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:26,642
of Eun Chong's adoption from the court!

340
00:23:29,382 --> 00:23:30,812
- All right! - Congratulations!

341
00:23:30,812 --> 00:23:31,952
Congratulations!

342
00:23:32,422 --> 00:23:33,522
All right!

343
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:39,192
From now on, Eun Chong is officially...

344
00:23:39,522 --> 00:23:41,232
- our son! - Our son!

345
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:42,362
- Eun Chong! - Eun Chong!

346
00:23:42,362 --> 00:23:44,362
- All right! This is awesome! - Yes!

347
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:56,142
The two of us are marrying today,

348
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:57,572
but it's a new start for three.

349
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,082
Thank you for coming here...

350
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:01,582
and joining us today.

351
00:24:02,552 --> 00:24:03,812
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

352
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:05,322
Congratulations!

353
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:11,062
Congratulations.

354
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:14,462
Darn it. You're so mean.

355
00:24:38,552 --> 00:24:39,622
What's wrong?

356
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:42,692
It's nothing.

357
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,102
- Ha Na! - Congratulations.

358
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,402
- Congratulations! - Congratulations!

359
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:00,372
They look great.

360
00:25:01,002 --> 00:25:02,012
- Thank you. - Sure.

361
00:25:02,272 --> 00:25:04,012
Where did Eun Chong go?

362
00:25:04,582 --> 00:25:05,682
He was here just now.

363
00:25:06,082 --> 00:25:07,142
Eun Chong!

364
00:25:07,542 --> 00:25:08,982
Where's Eun Chong?

365
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,952
He was playing here just now.

366
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:12,982
Eun Chong?

367
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:15,552
Maybe he went to the cafe.

368
00:25:17,022 --> 00:25:18,292
What's wrong?

369
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:19,792
What is it? Is Eun Chong gone?

370
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,132
Did he go out into the street?

371
00:25:21,132 --> 00:25:22,232
No...

372
00:25:22,232 --> 00:25:23,392
I'll look for him.

373
00:25:27,532 --> 00:25:28,602
Choi Myung Ji.

374
00:25:30,772 --> 00:25:32,202
Myung Ji was here.

375
00:25:33,972 --> 00:25:35,142
Myung Ji?

376
00:25:38,682 --> 00:25:39,812
Eun Chong!

377
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:42,812
Eun Chong!

378
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:44,452
Eun Chong!

379
00:25:44,852 --> 00:25:45,982
Lee Eun Chong!

380
00:25:46,152 --> 00:25:47,952
Lee Eun Chong! Eun Chong!

381
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:49,252
Lee Eun Chong!

382
00:25:49,252 --> 00:25:51,292
Eun Chong!

383
00:25:54,062 --> 00:25:56,232
Eun Chong!

384
00:25:56,462 --> 00:25:57,532
Eun Chong!

385
00:26:01,172 --> 00:26:02,302
Eun Chong.

386
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:10,642
Eun Chong!

387
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:15,152
Auntie Ha Na. I mean, Mommy!

388
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:19,982
Goodness.

389
00:26:20,922 --> 00:26:23,292
What were you doing here?

390
00:26:23,522 --> 00:26:25,162
There's a butterfly.

391
00:26:27,322 --> 00:26:28,392
A butterfly?

392
00:26:36,302 --> 00:26:38,542
Se Na must be anxious to fly.

393
00:26:38,742 --> 00:26:41,612
It can fly around freely starting today.

394
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:45,582
You're leaving,

395
00:26:46,412 --> 00:26:47,882
and Se Na's leaving, too.

396
00:26:48,582 --> 00:26:50,352
We'll continue to meet, though.

397
00:26:50,952 --> 00:26:53,982
I hope Se Na will go somewhere nice and meet great friends.

398
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:55,992
- Just like us. - Yes.

399
00:27:08,102 --> 00:27:09,502
Are Du Na and Se Na...

400
00:27:10,102 --> 00:27:11,302
watching us?

401
00:27:20,882 --> 00:27:21,952
Eun Chong.

402
00:27:23,052 --> 00:27:24,922
Eun Chong... Eun Chong!

403
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:29,052
You were here?

404
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,422
I saw a butterfly.

405
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,392
You did?

406
00:27:38,132 --> 00:27:39,202
Ha Na.

407
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:42,472
I saw a butterfly.

408
00:28:05,562 --> 00:28:08,262
Choi Myung Ji is a woman chosen by fate.

409
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,832
She pretended to be schizophrenic...

410
00:28:11,832 --> 00:28:13,562
and tried to run away and then got caught.

411
00:28:14,202 --> 00:28:17,102
She already committed enough crimes, but she added jailbreak, too.

412
00:28:17,232 --> 00:28:19,502
Good grief. She's out of her mind.

413
00:28:19,702 --> 00:28:22,742
Choi Myung Ji is a woman chosen by fate.

414
00:28:23,672 --> 00:28:26,282
I can't stay locked up in here.

415
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:27,882
I have to go home.

416
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,152
I have to go home.

417
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:34,122
Se Young.

418
00:28:34,892 --> 00:28:36,352
Open the door, Se Young.

419
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:38,692
Open the door for your mom.

420
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:49,472
No, Se Young.

421
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:51,702
Se Young!

422
00:28:55,642 --> 00:28:57,512
The defendant, Choi Myung Ji,

423
00:28:58,182 --> 00:29:00,112
is sentenced to life.

424
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:02,312
Se Young!

425
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:08,352
(1 year later)

426
00:29:08,352 --> 00:29:10,522
(To Mommy, Eun Chong's birthday party invitation)

427
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:13,692
Who are you going to invite?

428
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,632
All my family.

429
00:29:16,892 --> 00:29:19,362
I see. Everyone will get together for the first time in a while.

430
00:29:20,202 --> 00:29:22,132
What do you want as a birthday present?

431
00:29:24,402 --> 00:29:27,242
I'm sorry, Mother. I overslept.

432
00:29:28,072 --> 00:29:29,942
Why did you wake her? She should get more sleep.

433
00:29:29,942 --> 00:29:32,112
She's due soon, so it has to be hard for her.

434
00:29:32,712 --> 00:29:33,942
I didn't wake her.

435
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:35,982
She looked so pretty in her sleep,

436
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:37,352
so I just looked at her.

437
00:29:37,352 --> 00:29:39,152
You're so silly.

438
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,392
Yes, what's wrong with your son, Mother?

439
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:42,852
It's because you're too pretty.

440
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:49,492
Eun Chong, are you writing your birthday party invitations?

441
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:50,562
Yes, Mommy.

442
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:53,562
I want a younger sibling as my birthday present.

443
00:29:55,672 --> 00:29:58,802
You should ask your mommy to give birth on your birthday.

444
00:29:58,802 --> 00:30:00,402
Mommy, can you do that?

445
00:30:03,412 --> 00:30:05,882
You'll have to ask Blessing.

446
00:30:07,712 --> 00:30:08,782
Hey, Blessing.

447
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,252
Can you come out on my birthday?

448
00:30:13,322 --> 00:30:14,752
Can you?

449
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:19,122
Blessing is kicking...

450
00:30:19,522 --> 00:30:20,592
and moving, right?

451
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,432
How's your mother?

452
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:25,902
She's still the same.

453
00:30:27,032 --> 00:30:28,732
She only looks at my childhood photos...

454
00:30:28,932 --> 00:30:30,532
and keeps calling my name.

455
00:30:31,702 --> 00:30:33,802
But she doesn't recognize me, although I'm sitting next to her.

456
00:30:36,072 --> 00:30:37,972
She'll remember you someday.

457
00:30:43,112 --> 00:30:46,422
I'm attending a Blue Hands event tomorrow...

458
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:49,192
as a member of a supporters' group for missing children.

459
00:30:49,452 --> 00:30:51,722
You've become quite busy as the director there...

460
00:30:51,922 --> 00:30:53,092
after you donated all ten million dollars.

461
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:55,132
I can't be as busy as you, Chairman Goo.

462
00:31:00,702 --> 00:31:03,132
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

463
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:06,972
No, it's not that.

464
00:31:07,772 --> 00:31:09,812
Wait, are you...

465
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,182
I think I'm pregnant.

466
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,152
What do I do?

467
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:21,592
Of course, we'll have the baby. What do you mean?

468
00:31:23,892 --> 00:31:24,962
When did you find out?

469
00:31:25,322 --> 00:31:26,522
It's been a few days.

470
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:31,502
Do you think I can be a good mom?

471
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:35,532
You will be.

472
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:46,742
- Ready, begin. - Ready, begin.

473
00:31:46,742 --> 00:31:50,012
- Happy birthday to you - To you

474
00:31:50,012 --> 00:31:53,152
- Happy birthday to you - Oh, yeah

475
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:56,792
- Happy birthday, dear Eun Chong - My baby

476
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:59,362
Happy birthday to you

477
00:31:59,622 --> 00:32:00,892
Blow out the candles.

478
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,732
Look how cute he is.

479
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:10,132
My gosh.

480
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:12,372
- Don't serve too much. - Is this okay?

481
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:14,702
- Where's mine? I brought a lot. - Ta-da!

482
00:32:14,702 --> 00:32:17,342
Congratulations. You made Hyesung Tour the best in the industry.

483
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:19,082
Economic magazines are...

484
00:32:19,342 --> 00:32:20,842
all saying have the Midas touch.

485
00:32:21,042 --> 00:32:22,152
You better watch out, Ji Seok.

486
00:32:22,582 --> 00:32:25,622
I'll be the next chairman of Hyesung Group.

487
00:32:26,582 --> 00:32:28,192
Feel free to try me anytime.

488
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:31,122
I always have fun whenever I compete against you.

489
00:32:31,222 --> 00:32:32,662
I told you long ago that it wasn't fun for me.

490
00:32:34,692 --> 00:32:35,862
- Whoa. - My gosh.

491
00:32:36,492 --> 00:32:39,262
(Happy birthday, Eun Chong.)

492
00:32:39,262 --> 00:32:41,062
- Look at that. - It looks great.

493
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:42,172
Good for you.

494
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:44,432
My gosh.

495
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:46,372
Nice.

496
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:49,142
I recently had a baby dream. Who wants to take it?

497
00:32:50,372 --> 00:32:51,712
No, thank you.

498
00:32:51,882 --> 00:32:53,582
I need to get some rest after I give birth.

499
00:32:58,922 --> 00:33:00,022
Are you okay?

500
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:03,222
- Are you pregnant? - Hey.

501
00:33:03,422 --> 00:33:04,522
Is that true?

502
00:33:04,962 --> 00:33:06,062
Yes.

503
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:10,592
My baby dream was for you, not for Ha Na.

504
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,502
It doesn't matter whose dream that was.

505
00:33:14,602 --> 00:33:16,602
I'm so happy for you.

506
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:18,102
Thank you.

507
00:33:18,102 --> 00:33:20,342
Congratulations. You two should marry soon.

508
00:33:21,142 --> 00:33:22,272
- Right. - Yes.

509
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,342
What's wrong?

510
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:27,982
I think I'm going into labor.

511
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:29,182
- My gosh. - Really?

512
00:33:29,182 --> 00:33:32,022
Then, you should lean on me.

513
00:33:32,322 --> 00:33:33,822
What do we do?

514
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:36,392
What now?

515
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,562
Then, am I going to have a sibling now?

516
00:33:39,562 --> 00:33:40,892
All right!

517
00:33:41,462 --> 00:33:43,692
Ha Na, do the Lamaze breathing.

518
00:33:43,692 --> 00:33:44,792
Repeat after me.

519
00:33:45,132 --> 00:33:47,062
Inhale, exhale.

520
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:49,202
Inhale, exhale.

521
00:33:49,432 --> 00:33:50,832
Exhale. Honey.

522
00:33:52,202 --> 00:33:53,302
Honey.

523
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:55,142
Hey...

524
00:33:55,512 --> 00:33:56,612
- Wait. - My gosh.

525
00:33:56,612 --> 00:33:58,242
- Honey. - Oh, no.

526
00:33:58,682 --> 00:34:00,012
- My goodness. - Hey.

527
00:34:00,512 --> 00:34:01,682
Honey. Stay with me.

528
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:04,152
Honey.

529
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:06,682
My gosh. What do we do?

530
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:08,182
Ouch!

531
00:34:08,322 --> 00:34:09,492
Honey.

532
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:45,622
(Thank you for supporting and watching Cinderella Game.)

533
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:52,492
I'm just grateful that I married...

534
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:53,692
a man like him.

535
00:35:53,692 --> 00:35:55,062
(A woman who firmly believed her life was perfect)

536
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:57,562
They're kissing each other with a cloth over them.

537
00:35:57,762 --> 00:35:58,962
There may be a secret,

538
00:35:59,432 --> 00:36:01,602
or they may be in fake love.

539
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,002
(The secret and betrayal behind love)

540
00:36:03,002 --> 00:36:05,072
The first mistake you made was...

541
00:36:05,072 --> 00:36:06,442
marrying me.

542
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:09,042
Watch and see...

543
00:36:09,572 --> 00:36:11,742
how your dear daughter crashes and falls.

544
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:13,782
(Kang Jae In)

545
00:36:13,782 --> 00:36:16,612
I'm not Kang Se Ri. My name is Kang Jae In.

546
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:18,082
Just wait.

547
00:36:18,182 --> 00:36:20,152
I'll live as Kang Jae In.

548
00:36:20,322 --> 00:36:21,722
I'm the one and only Kang Jae In, and that's enough.

549
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:24,952
Queen's House, premiering on April 28.
