1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,609
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,209
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:10,220
(Episode 55)

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,550
Se Young, what's with you?

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,349
You're as cold as ice.

7
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,489
- Come out.
- No!

8
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:19,260
No, this is the most
eastern place in this house.

9
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,160
I have to go east.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,899
- I have to stay here.
- Get a grip on yourself!

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,760
No, you get a grip on yourself!

12
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:37,140
Look at me.

13
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:42,179
Listen up to what I'm about to say.

14
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:44,820
Yu Jin is...

15
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:47,820
dead.

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,289
Stop lying.

17
00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:51,259
- That's just a lie!
- She's not Yu Jin!

18
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:54,159
Goo Ha Na is a fake.

19
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:58,929
"Fake?"

20
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,299
Yu Jin died...

21
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,040
six years ago.

22
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,609
Goo Ha Na was a fake
that your aunt made up.

23
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:14,980
A knockoff.

24
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:20,390
"Fake?"

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,159
Is Goo Ha Na really a fake?

26
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:35,900
- She's not Yu Jin?
- No.

27
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,000
She's nothing,

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,870
so you don't have to feel nervous
about her from now on.

29
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:43,939
How can she be a fake?

30
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,780
She even did
a DNA test with Aunt Yeo Jin.

31
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,719
You're lying to me
to make me calm down, aren't you?

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:56,489
Do you want me to get you
her death certificate?

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,719
Are you serious?

34
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,430
How can this be?

35
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,030
Did she set this up
with Aunt Yeo Jin?

36
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,459
It'd make more sense if she had.

37
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,430
Even Goo Ha Na was fooled.

38
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,500
She thinks she's really Yu Jin.

39
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,240
Not only did Yeo Jin deceive us,

40
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,409
but she deceived her, too.

41
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,139
How...

42
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,349
How can she deceive Goo Ha Na, too?

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,050
It'd make more sense if she knew
and let Aunt Yeo Jin deceive her.

44
00:02:25,449 --> 00:02:27,050
You can nitpick over the details later.

45
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,360
What's important is
that Yu Jin is dead.

46
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,789
You have no reason to feel anxious.

47
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,599
It doesn't matter
what Goo Ha Na does, says,

48
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:39,800
or remembers.

49
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,199
Everything is nonsense.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,099
Then, why did she mention
Seongbuk Port?

51
00:02:46,969 --> 00:02:49,240
What is this
about going missing at age ten?

52
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,180
She must've gone missing at ten
and lived near Seongbuk Port.

53
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:55,050
She was Yu Jin's friend
at the children's home.

54
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,180
A friend at the children's home?

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,379
Wait, then...

56
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,689
why did Aunt Yeo Jin make
a fake daughter if Yu Jin died?

57
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,759
Did she not want
to leave me her inheritance?

58
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,729
At first,
I also thought that was the reason.

59
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,199
But the real deal was someone else.

60
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,300
"The real deal?"

61
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,139
Yu Jin died.
How can there be a real deal?

62
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:22,509
- He's at home.
- Our home? Who?

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,939
That kid.

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,110
That kid is the real deal?

65
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,210
What makes him the real deal?

66
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:29,979
He's Yu Jin's son.

67
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,050
"Yu Jin's son?"

68
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,919
Try not to use your hand,
and be careful.

69
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,930
Okay. I feel so excited
to go to the kindergarten.

70
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,090
Really?

71
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,099
You must be happy to meet
your friends and teachers.

72
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:53,000
Eun Chong, have fun
at the kindergarten.

73
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,810
Okay. Have a great day
at work, Auntie Ha Na.

74
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,210
Okay.

75
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,849
Goodbye.

76
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,719
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

77
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,000
Is something going on with Se Young?

78
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,399
Where did the two women go
this early?

79
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,529
I'm not so sure, either.

80
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,250
Yu Jin is dead,

81
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,149
Goo Ha Na is a fake,

82
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,060
and Yu Jin's son is
now living in our home?

83
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,699
- Right?
- Yes.

84
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,769
She's a fake daughter?

85
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,730
What will Ha Na do now?

86
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,339
All right.
Laugh as much as you want.

87
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,310
Forget all about the stress
that brat and Aunt Yeo Jin...

88
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,610
gave you to this day.

89
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,449
Who else knows about this?

90
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,779
It's only us.

91
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,819
No way.

92
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,819
A fake daughter?

93
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,529
Mom, this is hilarious.

94
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,560
Gosh.

95
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,899
My gosh.

96
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,170
Wait, how did you find out
Ha Na was a fake daughter?

97
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,339
Well, your aunt seemed...

98
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,810
suspiciously attached to Eun Chong,

99
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,040
so I ran a parentage test
between them...

100
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,449
and found out they were related.

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,720
Then, how did you know
Yu Jin was already dead?

102
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:53,019
She was named Lee Du Na
at the children's home.

103
00:05:53,589 --> 00:05:55,089
I heard she died in a car accident.

104
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:59,500
I went to the children's home
and confirmed her childhood photo.

105
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,629
She was Yu Jin.

106
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:02,699
No way.

107
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,339
Did you say
it happened six years ago?

108
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,810
Gosh, it would've been much better
if I had found out back then.

109
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,910
We should be glad
that we found out now.

110
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,509
Be good to Eun Chong from now on.

111
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't make it obvious.

112
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,449
- What's your plan?
- What do you think?

113
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:24,959
We'll kick out
that fake daughter first.

114
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:27,589
No, don't kick her out right away.

115
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,529
- Why not?
- I can't miss out on the fun...

116
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:32,560
of watching Ha Na acting cheeky,
not knowing that she's a fake.

117
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,899
I'll make her pay many times over
for all the humiliation I endured.

118
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,399
Then, I'll kick her out in the most
miserable and gruesome way.

119
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,310
- Gosh, really.
- Yes.

120
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,310
You'll easily catch a cold...

121
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,839
- in this weather.
- It's so cold.

122
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,079
(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

123
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:56,019
Is she at her newlywed home?
Or is she at his place?

124
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,560
That means Aunt Myung Ji also knows
Se Young has another man.

125
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,029
Thank you for coming.

126
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:07,470
Thank you. There are lots of...

127
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,430
- Your extra order of meat.
- Thanks.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,800
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

129
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,379
Stop laughing. You'd get caught.

130
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,480
I can't hold it back.

131
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,319
Jeez.

132
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,819
Mom, how am I going to face Ha Na?

133
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,360
- Why?
- I'll burst out laughing each time.

134
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,230
My goodness.

135
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,060
Do you need anything else?

136
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,930
No, Mother. This is delicious.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm glad.

138
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,569
Se Young, you look radiant.

139
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:45,740
Did something good happen?

140
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,839
I have to smile often
to draw good things into my life.

141
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,910
That's true.
You're even more beautiful when you smile.

142
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:53,209
Bang Ul, you've become a success
thanks to your son.

143
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,850
You're now the owner
of a wonderful business like this.

144
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,910
Yes.

145
00:07:57,079 --> 00:08:00,420
I've suddenly become a success,
from a housekeeper to a business owner.

146
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,490
Oh, my.

147
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,519
Ms. Sim, congratulations
on your new business.

148
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,660
- You're here.
- Congratulations.

149
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,560
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. I'm glad you're here.

150
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,060
Congratulations, Ms. Sim.

151
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,569
- Thank you, Ms. Goo.
- Sure.

152
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,240
The place looks great.

153
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,569
Mom, Ha Na's here.

154
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,339
Be careful.
You're making it too obvious.

155
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:24,240
Please enjoy.

156
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,610
- Okay.
- Thank you.

157
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,410
- Thank you.
- Hello, Ms. Yoon.

158
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,779
- Hello.
- Hello, Ms. Choi.

159
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,250
Hey, you all came.

160
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,720
Please enjoy your lunch.

161
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

162
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:40,690
Good grief.

163
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,830
- You're here.
- Yes.

164
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:48,600
Was the police investigation okay?

165
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,470
Yes, it ended quickly.

166
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,539
- You seem to be in a good mood.
- I am.

167
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:56,269
You should go ahead and eat.
We're done.

168
00:08:56,909 --> 00:08:58,809
Right. You should go first, Mom.

169
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,710
I'll go back to work with the team.

170
00:09:01,049 --> 00:09:02,980
- Do you want to do that?
- Goodbye, then.

171
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,450
Bye.

172
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,019
I need to go to the office
and have a talk with that punk.

173
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:18,360
Okay.

174
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,919
- Se Young.
- Ms. Yoon.

175
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:58,440
I wanted to pour this hot soup
over your face...

176
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,210
as I recalled all those days
I was deceived by you.

177
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,250
Why are you staring at me?

178
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:13,350
No reason.
Don't mind me, and eat your food.

179
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,519
You were deceived, too?

180
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,990
- Man.
- This is so good.

181
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,000
Should I say that was unfortunate?
Or should I call you stupid?

182
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,759
Maybe both.

183
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:30,100
Did something funny happen?

184
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:31,740
Let us laugh with you.

185
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,269
Jin Goo probably took the lead
in turning her into a fake daughter.

186
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,179
I can't believe this.

187
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,250
Life is so interesting.

188
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,519
She looked dead serious yesterday,

189
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,519
but today,
she looks like she's on cloud nine.

190
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,519
It didn't seem like
Aunt Myung Ji got mad at her.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,470
Where did you go last night?
You even got packed up.

192
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,909
Is something going on?

193
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,539
I didn't pack up.

194
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:14,049
I went to leave my stuff
at my newlywed home.

195
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,779
I see.

196
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,620
Have you ever been scammed?

197
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,919
- No.
- Or betrayed?

198
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,590
- Was someone scammed?
- Yes.

199
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:31,059
I've never heard anything like it.
It goes beyond your imagination.

200
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,330
This world is
full of scary people like that.

201
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,440
Who got scammed?

202
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,299
Someone I know.

203
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,070
She'd feel so betrayed
if she found out she got conned.

204
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,980
If I were her,
I wouldn't want to live.

205
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,779
Is this fun for you?

206
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,879
If you hear about it,
you'll find it fun, too.

207
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,419
Who got scammed, and how?

208
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,519
This girl I know is
actually a fake...

209
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,360
Never mind. Maybe later.

210
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,539
My gosh.

211
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,940
Why did she stop in the middle?

212
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,769
She's making me curious.

213
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,509
I just had it, but I began to want
some more. It was so good.

214
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,179
- It was really good.
- It was so good.

(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

216
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,820
Ms. Goo, get some coffee.

217
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,059
Okay.

218
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,500
Get your own coffee.

219
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,909
Didn't you hear me? Coffee.

220
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay.

221
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:01,850
You can all order some.
It's my treat.

222
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,620
Really?

223
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
- I want hot Americano.
- Me, too.

224
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,019
- And me.
- Three hot Americanos.

225

(Team Leader Yoon Se Young)

226
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,360
Right. We didn't get to eat
the fish buns last time.

227
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,200
Get some fish buns, too.

228
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,429
I want custard cream filling.

229
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:19,100
So what if you glare at me?

230
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,669
You're a knockoff.

231
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,509
What are you doing? Run along.

232
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:27,009
Okay.

233
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,490
Life as pathetic Goo Ha Na
suits you best.

234
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,110
Good, I ran into you.

235
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,450
I was on my way to your office.

236
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,879
We'll talk inside.

237
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:05,649
I have nothing to discuss with you.

238
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,690
Where are your manners?

239
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,690
I didn't come to fight.

240
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,799
I came to have a friendly chat.

241
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,059
You can do it here.

242
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,200
Stop seeing Se Young.

243
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,899
Refuse to meet her
even if she comes to see you.

244
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,669
What are you going to do
by seeing an engaged woman?

245
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:29,269
You should tell that to her.

246
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,909
She's the one who's marrying,
not me.

247
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:35,850
So, you'll keep seeing her
if she comes to see you?

248
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,250
I won't stop her from coming
or force her to stay.

249
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,320
That was one thing
I learned in America.

250
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,350
She dumped you there before.
Do you want to be dumped here, too?

251
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,519
I don't care what you do
to get her feelings.

252
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,789
She'll marry Jin Goo anyway.

253
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:48,960
Be my guest.

254
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,889
She's not someone I want to marry.

255
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,860
What?

256
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,940
How far will he take this?

257
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,169
Mother.

258
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,779
Hey, Jin Goo.

259
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:10,549
Is something going on
between you and Mr. Goo?

260
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,720
No.

261
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,919
You began to work for him,

262
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,519
so I asked him
to take good care of you,

263
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
but he didn't seem to care.

264
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,529
You don't have to say that to him.

265
00:15:23,529 --> 00:15:26,830
How can I just walk away?
You're my son-in-law.

266
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,269
Okay, then. You should go.

267
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,500
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

268
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,940
She wouldn't put in a good word
for my sake to Mr. Goo.

269
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:44,009
The air seemed personal
between those two.

270
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,049
Mr. Han hasn't said anything
about the move I could use...

271
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:49,350
to put pressure
on Chairwoman Shin, right?

272
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,750
No, not yet.

273
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:55,289
She can reapply for adoption
with you as the guarantor.

274
00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:56,990
Then, please proceed in secret.

275
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,159
Don't let Chairwoman Shin
or Choi Myung Ji find out.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,269
- They'll get in the way if they do.
- Okay.

277
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,399
It must be Hwang Jin Goo.

278
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:13,740
(Head Director's Office)

279
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,879
Have a seat.

280
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:25,559
We want to do the mother-daughter
therapy tour with the hotel guests.

281
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,370
Please proceed.

282
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:40,539
When would I find out
the reason I was beaten?

283
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,009
Soon.

284
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:46,940
I just saw you and Ms. Yoon's mother
having a serious conversation.

285
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:48,710
What was that about?

286
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,220
She asked me to take good care
of Ms. Yoon and you,

287
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,220
so I told her
to mind her own business.

288
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,220
You two will do well anyway.

289
00:16:55,649 --> 00:16:58,889
That's right.
She was worried over nothing.

290
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,559
She must feel anxious
about her future son-in-law.

291
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,889
You should make sure
your future mother-in-law...

292
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,160
doesn't get anxious.

293
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,569
You don't have to worry about me.

294
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,740
What? What's this?

295
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,779
- It's a cufflink.
- Is this yours?

296
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:19,880
It's not mine.

297
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,380
Well, I saw it on the floor
at the office,

298
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,680
so I picked it up thinking it was
one of my staff's, then forgot.

299
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,069
Even if she is seeing someone else,

300
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,140
it can't be Mr. Goo.

301
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,240
Come in.

302
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,119
I saw Mother leaving
after meeting Ms. Goo.

303
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,450
Why would she meet him?

304
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:02,519
You didn't know?

305
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:05,289
She just met with Mr. Goo
without telling you?

306
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:10,259
She asked him to take care of me
because I was now with the hotel.

307
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:14,359
Why did she say that
and hurt your pride?

308
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:17,730
I wonder.
I must've been that untrustworthy.

309
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:20,170
It's Mr. Goo she doesn't trust,
not you.

310
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,670
He keeps messing with you.

311
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,680
Or did she have something personal
to discuss with him?

312
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,450
What personal thing
would she discuss with him?

313
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,480
I wouldn't know.

314
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,319
Is he feeling me out?

315
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,089
Right. Did your friends upload
the photos on social media accounts?

316
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,589
Her phone broke,
so she lost all the photos.

317
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,630
Gosh, what a shame.

318
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,259
If I had known,
I would've taken the photos.

319
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,829
Yes, what a shame.

320
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:50,869
He's still suspicious of me?

321
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,380
It took you forever to get coffee.

322
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,250
It took me a while
to find fish buns.

323
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,579
There was no custard cream filling,
but only red bean filling.

324
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,190
- So you got red bean filling?
- Yes.

325
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,359
Did I tell you to get that
if they didn't have custard cream?

326
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,690
I went out in this cold weather
to get these,

327
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,930
so just eat it.

328
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,529
Follow me with those.

329
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,210
Good luck.

330
00:19:32,579 --> 00:19:35,150
Good luck.

331
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,720
You must feel rather offended.

332
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:50,930
I refused to run errands
unrelated to work. What are you doing?

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,059
Are you trying to make
our relationship known by provoking me?

334
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,329
What's our relationship?

335
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:57,799
- Don't you know?
- I do.

336
00:19:58,339 --> 00:19:59,670
But you don't.

337
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,240
What don't I know?

338
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,869
What happened overnight?

339
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:06,339
You acted like you'd get along
with me last night.

340
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,839
Why are you suddenly doing this?

341
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,849
That was when I thought
you were Yu Jin.

342
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,450
You're a fake.

343
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,349
- Why are you smiling?
- It's funny.

344
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,390
What's funny?

345
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:27,130
How dare you talk down
to your boss at work?

346
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,900
Do you want the staff
to find out who you are?

347
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,369
That'll be fun, too.

348
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:37,240
The higher you go,
the more fun your fall will be.

349
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,210
Speak coherently.

350
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,450
I don't want to.

351
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:47,549
You can have the coffee
and the fish buns.

352
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,990
The higher I go,
the more fun my fall will be?

353
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:58,960
What's she talking about?

354
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,730
Ha Na.

355
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,839
Is there something personal
between you and Ms. Yoon?

356
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,240
- No.
- So, why were you talking casually?

357
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,609
I didn't.

358
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,009
I clearly heard you.

359
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,390
A way to kick out the fake daughter?

360
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,660
I want her out within the month.

361
00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:30,490
Is there a smooth way
to make her realize...

362
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:31,930
that she's a fake?

363
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,769
It'll be best
if Yeo Jin makes a mistake.

364
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:40,539
But that sly woman never does that.

365
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,569
You can
keep throwing things at her...

366
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:44,569
and make her
become suspicious on her own.

367
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,109
What if she finds out
that I know she's a fake?

368
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,289
Right.
I'll begin to play both sides.

369
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,289
(Head Director's Office)

370
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,299
I heard you met my mom.

371
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,029
You didn't look as bad as I thought.

372
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,230
You didn't pick up your phone,
so I was worried.

373
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,269
I felt like
I could die any minute yesterday.

374
00:22:12,339 --> 00:22:14,740
- But you feel alive today?
- Yes.

375
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:19,440
Jin Goo saw you meeting my mom.

376
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,710
He seemed a bit suspicious.

377
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:23,250
We'll be fine
as long as there's no evidence.

378
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:28,190
Something like this.
You left it at my place.

379
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,990
Right.
I guess I lost it at your place.

380
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,799
You said you were
looking into Yoon Yu Jin, right?

381
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,000
You said you'd tell me
when you were sure.

382
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:45,740
Are you sure of that now?

383
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,670
Not yet.

384
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,809
Can't you tell me
if it's something good or bad?

385
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,539
I'll tell you when I'm sure of it.

386
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,509
He can't stay this calm
if he knows...

387
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,109
Goo Ha Na is a fake.

388
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,319
He would've run over to Aunt Yeo Jin
and shot her to death.

389
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,250
- Why are you laughing?
- No reason.

390
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:13,359
Yes, right.

391
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:27,039
Hey, this is the lucky bracelet.

392
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,609
Mr. Hwang, I brought it
to show it to you.

393
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,950
Gosh, it's been 20 years.

394
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,819
And you kept it all along.
This is touching.

395
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,390
It was meaningful to me.

396
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:43,660
I made a great memory
when I met you back then.

397
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,599
And I felt kind of strong
whenever I looked at this,

398
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,170
just like, "No rain, no flowers."

399
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:51,700
It's not that big of a deal,
but it still feels worthwhile.

400
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,839
I'm looking forward
to our continuous cooperation.

401
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,440
I should give it to Eun Chong.

402
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,410
I got to meet my mom
thanks to this bracelet,

403
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,309
so Eun Chong might
meet his grandmother.

404
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,450
It's a great idea
to pass down a lucky item.

405
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:10,819
What's that?

406
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:15,130
Is there a way to stop her
if the adoption process resumes?

407
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,230
Even if the home visit continues
according to the process,

408
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,799
we can stop everything...

409
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,970
by tampering with the papers
before the court examination.

410
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,500
But those are
all temporary measures.

411
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,339
Find a long-term measure
for me to protect him.

412
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:29,640
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,049
So, the adoption got postponed?

414
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:36,109
Yes.

415
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:39,619
The one who made the false report
must be someone close to her.

416
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,950
The adoption was obstructed
on purpose.

417
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,589
Did Yeo Jin make the report herself?

418
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,259
Gosh, it'd be nice
if Ji Seok could help.

419
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,559
He's now with us
on the idea of adoption.

420
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,099
Ji Seok agreed to let her adopt him?

421
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,470
Do you have
to put pressure on her again?

422
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,309
I may need it in the future.

423
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,250
Did he need to put pressure on her
because of the adoption?

424
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:16,250
Does Ji Seok know
that Eun Chong is our grandson?

425
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,859
Yes, hello.

426
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,829
The home visit? This weekend?

427
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,799
That was faster than I expected.
I wasn't too hopeful.

428
00:25:28,769 --> 00:25:31,329
Yes, thank you. Goodbye.

429
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,069
Gosh, Eun Chong would be thrilled.

430
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,440
- Did something good happen?
- Yes.

431
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,140
Ji Seok, when the home visit
got canceled,

432
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,240
I thought it'd take a while
to reschedule.

433
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,049
But I got a call that
they'd come on the weekend.

434
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,220
That's great news.
Will you tell your family?

435
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,720
Yes.

436
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,450
But there was a false report
on child abuse, too.

437
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,990
Shouldn't you be cautious?

438
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:53,960
I heard the visit could be done
spontaneously.

439
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,630
Ask them
to make it seem spontaneous.

440
00:25:58,029 --> 00:25:59,099
Should I do that?

441
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,960
So, I shouldn't
tell Eun Chong, either?

442
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,799
That'd be better to keep this quiet.

443
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,170
Right. Yes. Thank you.

444
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,039
It's so nice to discuss
something like this with you.

445
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:11,210
Let me know if you need help.

446
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,410
- Bye.
- Okay.

447
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,480
Bye, Ji Seok.

448
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,890
Have some. It's like my warm heat.

449
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,089
Thank you.

450
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,599
Why are you here
instead of going home right away?

451
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,700
I wanted to see you
before I went home.

452
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,670
I don't think you're here to see me.

453
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,740
You two should talk.

454
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:46,240
- Wait, no. Don't go.
- Excuse me?

455
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,750
Have a seat.

456
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,480
Gosh, how cute.

457
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,490
- Oh, no. Goodness.
- No, I'm fine...

458
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,660
Enough is enough, Ji Eun.

459
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,960
It must be hard to work
with a cold-hearted guy like Ji Seok.

460
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,470
Keep up the good work.
You can do it.

461
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,599
Mr. Goo is warm on the inside.

462
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,210
My family already knows.

463
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,339
He may come off as cold,
but he's burning hot on the inside.

464
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:18,680
Right, Ji Seok?

465
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,210
Should I leave?

466
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:25,849
Not today. But next time, yes.

467
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:32,960
I didn't see anything new
in the information you sent...

468
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,359
regarding Goo Ji Seok.

469
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,900
He had a girlfriend
when he studied abroad?

470
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:44,869
You said there were
no traces of women in his life.

471
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,509
Look into the details
and call me back. Bye.

472
00:27:56,779 --> 00:27:58,349
So, he did date someone.

473
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,259
What are you doing?

474
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,799
Why did you throw it out?

475
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,369
I found it annoying.

476
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,140
So, you 2 were friends
from 20 years ago?

477
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,910
This bracelet seemed like a token
that kept your friendship going,

478
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,940
so I got jealous.

479
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,210
Even so, you can't throw out
someone else's possession.

480
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:30,109
What's going on?

481
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,180
You should take it.

482
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:37,190
- Why is this here?
- I loathed that and threw it out,

483
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:39,619
but Mr. Hwang
picked it out of the trash can.

484
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,490
Why did you throw this out?

485
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,329
Come to my office, Ms. Yoon.

486
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,140
Why did she touch my stuff
without asking?

487
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,369
And why does she seem so confident?

488
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,880
Did you have fun humiliating me
in front of Ha Na?

489
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,210
You're always brazenly honest
after doing something like this.

490
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,980
Is it a crime to be honest?

491
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,450
You should be grateful
that I saw you.

492
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,380
If Ms. Goo saw you,

493
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,819
you'd be someone who stole
and threw out her possession.

494
00:29:10,819 --> 00:29:12,519
You'd have no excuses to make
even if she reported you.

495
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:14,190
I already told you.

496
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:17,130
I got jealous and didn't want to see that.

497
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,599
What were you that jealous over?

498
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,400
Why do you ask? You.

499
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,430
My fiance kept getting involved
with another woman, so why wouldn't I be?

500
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:26,799
You didn't want me to get involved
with Ha Na only because I was yours.

501
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,410
Not because it's me,
but only because I'm yours.

502
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,539
Are you saying I don't love you?

503
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,950
I'm starting to have that idea.

504
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,579
To me, that sounds like
you don't love me.

505
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,789
Why won't you answer me?
Are you agreeing with this?

506
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,529
I'm not so sure, either.

507
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,400
Then, you can have
a serious thought on that matter.

508
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,339
Yes, I'll begin to have...

509
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,339
a serious thought on it
starting now.

510
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,589
Why do both Ji Seok and Jin Goo
care so much about Goo Ha Na?

511
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,930
Take the subway home.

512
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:30,029
- I have to go somewhere.
- Sure.

513
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,000
"Sure?"

514
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,539
I'm not your friend.

515
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,609
- Yes, Ms. Yoon.
- How dare you sigh?

516
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,680
You must've lost your mind
because I've been patient with you.

517
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:46,619
You have to apologize first.

518
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,019
What makes you so confident
after messing with my stuff?

519
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,750
That's theft.

520
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:55,490
Yes, I did touch your stuff.

521
00:30:56,529 --> 00:30:57,690
So what?

522
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,500
It's me, Yoon Yu Jin.

523
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,470
- What now?
- I'm Yoon Yu Jin.

524
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:09,309
Yes, you are Yoon Yu Jin.

525
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,640
Gosh, I forgot for a moment.

526
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,480
No, I shouldn't forget that.

527
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm sorry for not realizing that.

528
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,619
Why are you suddenly doing this?

529
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,619
Can you handle the consequences?

530
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:26,289
What do I have to handle?

531
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,759
Are you saying that Aunt Yeo Jin
may kick my mom and me out?

532
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:34,029
It may be something else.

533
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:36,130
Let's see who'll end up leaving.

534
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:38,740
What?

535
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:44,940
Did you catch
the laughing disease or something?

536
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,539
"The laughing disease?"

537
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,980
"The laughing disease?"

538
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:53,250
Yes, I guess so.

539
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,890
I keep bursting out in laughter
whenever I see you.

540
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,619
You're like my laughter button.

541
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,960
Let me give you a warning, too.

542
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,329
Be careful with your lies.

543
00:32:07,329 --> 00:32:09,799
- What lies?
- Your lies to Mr. Hwang.

544
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,670
You talked this nonsense
about how I was lying last time.

545
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,269
This again?

546
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,039
- So, no?
- What's that lie?

547
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:20,440
Tell me.

548
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,150
You can't even say it.

549
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,019
You're seeing another man.

550
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,519
Did you think I wouldn't know?

551
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,559
And he works at our company,
doesn't he?

552
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,819
(Cinderella Game)

553
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,619
If you keep doing this,
you'll get caught.

554
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:38,759
Stop seeing that punk.

555
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:40,420
They're in front of the house?

556
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,390
Ha Na found out
I was seeing someone else.

557
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:45,460
If Ha Na found out, Hwang Jin Goo
would also find out very soon.

558
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,660
How did she notice?

559
00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:47,930
Is that love?

560
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,529
If I can take advantage of her
to get revenge, I will.

561
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,640
- Hey!
- Stop picking a fight and get out.

562
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
- You're doing this on purpose.
- What are you doing?

563
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,710
I'll find a way.

564
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:59,910
Ms. Goo, how would you feel
if someone used you as a fake daughter?

565
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:01,039
Mr. Hwang...

566
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,880
