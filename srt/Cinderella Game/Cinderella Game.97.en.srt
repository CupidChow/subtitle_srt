00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:03,528
(Episode 97)

2
00:00:04,298 --> 00:00:05,928
(Kongkong, Daddy has been getting morning sickness instead of me.)

3
00:00:06,028 --> 00:00:08,368
(Your little fetal heart is beating. Your heart rate was 195bpm today.)

4
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,238
Come in.

5
00:00:15,868 --> 00:00:17,278
Are you clearing out your stuff?

6
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:19,838
I thought I should start.

7
00:00:20,048 --> 00:00:22,208
I'll move out as soon as I find a place.

8
00:00:26,588 --> 00:00:29,648
I threw all those out before. I'm glad you kept it.

9
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:32,918
I'm sorry I didn't tell you I was Eun Chong's grandfather.

10
00:00:33,188 --> 00:00:34,328
It's all right.

11
00:00:36,488 --> 00:00:38,998
Let me return this to you. It was yours.

12
00:00:39,598 --> 00:00:41,498
I should give it to Eun Chong now.

13
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:49,768
(I am waiting for you.)

14
00:00:50,678 --> 00:00:52,778
That was the hat found when Yu Jin went missing.

15
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:58,618
Why did she suddenly get on that boat alone?

16
00:00:59,718 --> 00:01:00,788
"Alone?"

17
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:03,988
Wasn't she with Se Young?

18
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:07,558
She was there with Se Young?

19
00:01:09,688 --> 00:01:11,928
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

20
00:01:12,228 --> 00:01:14,368
but I lived at Seongbuk Port when I was young.

21
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:18,738
I remember running into Du Na and Se Young back then.

22
00:01:25,138 --> 00:01:26,138
Come in.

23
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:29,208
Excuse me. We're from Yongju Police Station.

24
00:01:29,278 --> 00:01:30,918
Which one of you is Ms. Choi Myung Ji?

25
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:32,178
That's me.

26
00:01:36,988 --> 00:01:39,858
You're here because of the embezzlement, right?

27
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:42,187
Let's talk outside.

28
00:01:42,188 --> 00:01:44,758
You're under arrest without a warrant for murder instigation.

29
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,368
What? What did you say?

30
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,198
What...

31
00:01:51,638 --> 00:01:53,667
What are you doing?

32
00:01:53,668 --> 00:01:55,307
You're arrested without a warrant...

33
00:01:55,308 --> 00:01:56,837
due to the possibility of evidence destruction and flight.

34
00:01:56,838 --> 00:01:58,108
It wasn't me.

35
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:00,408
I didn't do it. What are you doing?

36
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:02,348
I didn't do it.

37
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:05,217
It wasn't me. Let go of me.

38
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:06,418
Let go.

39
00:02:07,148 --> 00:02:09,288
Se Young, it wasn't me.

40
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:11,858
- I didn't do it. I really didn't. - Come with us.

41
00:02:12,688 --> 00:02:14,658
It wasn't me! Se Young!

42
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:15,858
Se Young!

43
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,827
Mom... Mom?

44
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:20,328
Don't try to run away, okay?

45
00:02:20,768 --> 00:02:22,197
I thought your power trip, fake pregnancy,

46
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:23,437
and embezzlement were the end of the story.

47
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:26,037
What now? Murder instigation?

48
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:27,537
No, something's wrong.

49
00:02:27,538 --> 00:02:30,407
Hey, the police wouldn't arrest her without evidence.

50
00:02:30,408 --> 00:02:32,138
And if they did it without a warrant, it had to be true.

51
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:34,747
You two weren't just gold diggers or mother-daughter scammers.

52
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:36,608
What now? Murder instigation?

53
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:40,117
I could've died if I married her.

54
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,518
It's not true!

55
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,118
How dare you shout at my son?

56
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:48,028
We caught you trying to con us.

57
00:02:48,088 --> 00:02:49,188
Got it?

58
00:02:51,198 --> 00:02:52,628
Maybe you're your mom's accomplice.

59
00:02:52,758 --> 00:02:54,068
You've killed someone, too. Right?

60
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:01,168
You tried to kill me, too, right?

61
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,677
Wasn't that why you said you didn't care...

62
00:03:03,678 --> 00:03:06,078
if I cheated on you or gambled? No?

63
00:03:06,338 --> 00:03:08,508
Don't associate with her. She's just bad luck.

64
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:10,008
Let's go.

65
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:12,278
Good grief.

66
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,168
I didn't do it.

67
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:30,198
I was falsely accused.

68
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,098
Come with us.

69
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:37,878
What would we have done if she was married into our family?

70
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:39,978
Just thinking about it gives me the creeps.

71
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,408
Jeez. I can't believe it.

72
00:03:56,858 --> 00:03:57,998
Are you okay?

73
00:03:59,428 --> 00:04:00,528
Were you beaten?

74
00:04:33,098 --> 00:04:36,228
Did you really see Yu Jin and Se Young at Seongbuk Port that day?

75
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:39,368
That day, two girls got out of the car,

76
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,108
and I saw them get on the boat together.

77
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:44,108
- Together? - Yes.

78
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,708
Only one girl left the boat,

79
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:50,618
and she must've been Se Young.

80
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:54,987
Then, it would mean she knew...

81
00:04:54,988 --> 00:04:57,388
Yu Jin was still on the boat.

82
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,257
So, how did you know she was Se Young?

83
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:04,398
- Did you ask for her name? - No.

84
00:05:10,028 --> 00:05:12,068
Be careful. It's slippery here.

85
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:18,108
I just remember she had a scar on her knee.

86
00:05:18,878 --> 00:05:20,648
A scar on her knee?

87
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,018
Yes.

88
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,548
She had a butterfly-shaped scar on her knee.

89
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:30,718
She removed it around the time she went to middle school.

90
00:05:31,718 --> 00:05:35,058
Why didn't she say anything if she knew Yu Jin was on the boat?

91
00:05:36,188 --> 00:05:37,298
Se Young.

92
00:05:39,058 --> 00:05:41,228
Where's Yu Jin? Is Yu Jin with you?

93
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:43,997
She's...

94
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:45,397
Where is Yu Jin?

95
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:47,668
- You were with her, right? - No.

96
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:49,938
Then, where is she?

97
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,208
- In the car... - She's not there.

98
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,208
Did she not tell you where she was going?

99
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,118
I went to the restroom.

100
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:00,818
She said Yu Jin was in the car,

101
00:06:01,488 --> 00:06:03,758
and she had gone to the restroom.

102
00:06:04,318 --> 00:06:07,928
Did Se Young really lie?

103
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,797
Are you sure about that memory?

104
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:12,128
It's been 20 years.

105
00:06:12,628 --> 00:06:14,928
I was beaten up by my foster parents...

106
00:06:15,128 --> 00:06:17,938
and had to sleep outside, then got sent to an emergency room.

107
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,068
I arrived at the children's home a few days after,

108
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:23,708
and Du Na came on the same day.

109
00:06:24,178 --> 00:06:26,508
She lost all her memories, so she didn't even know her name.

110
00:06:26,838 --> 00:06:28,078
Goodness, Yu Jin.

111
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:30,618
My poor girl.

112
00:06:31,678 --> 00:06:35,118
I should've asked Se Young more questions back then.

113
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:40,928
Myung Ji must've known about Se Young's lie.

114
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:43,258
I finally understand why...

115
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,598
she instigated the hit-and-run accident.

116
00:06:48,628 --> 00:06:50,128
That was why she kept...

117
00:06:50,638 --> 00:06:52,338
Yu Jin's whereabouts a secret.

118
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,368
Because Se Young's lie...

119
00:06:54,838 --> 00:06:56,708
would've been exposed if Yu Jin returned.

120
00:06:56,868 --> 00:06:59,138
And she must've wanted to get her hands on Hyesung.

121
00:06:59,838 --> 00:07:02,978
Yes, I should share this with the police.

122
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,098
Let go of me. Let go.

123
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:19,898
Se Young, it wasn't me.

124
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:21,368
I didn't do it.

125
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:23,698
No.

126
00:07:24,098 --> 00:07:27,238
No, it can't be Mom.

127
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,308
It can't be.

128
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:32,307
Hey, the police wouldn't arrest her without evidence.

129
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,278
And if they did it without a warrant, it had to be true.

130
00:07:34,408 --> 00:07:35,508
Evidence?

131
00:07:37,818 --> 00:07:39,648
Did they find that notebook?

132
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:44,988
(Goo Ji Seok)

133
00:07:50,698 --> 00:07:52,858
How dare you arrest me without evidence?

134
00:07:53,358 --> 00:07:55,568
And you did it while I was with my future in-laws!

135
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:01,968
My daughter must be psychologically distraught.

136
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:07,448
This is an infringement of human rights and defamation.

137
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,048
I will hold all of you responsible...

138
00:08:10,748 --> 00:08:12,577
if this marriage doesn't come through.

139
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:14,888
Yes, sure. You can do that later.

140
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,517
And show some respect.

141
00:08:16,518 --> 00:08:18,488
Why should I show respect in this situation?

142
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:23,058
We got Detective Cho Byung Jin to make a testimony...

143
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:25,327
regarding the unresolved case...

144
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:27,698
of Yoon Yu Jin's hit-and-run death from seven years ago.

145
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:31,097
He said you, Ms. Choi, gave the order...

146
00:08:31,098 --> 00:08:32,568
to get rid of Ms. Yoon Yu Jin.

147
00:08:34,008 --> 00:08:37,478
Did you arrest me...

148
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:39,508
solely on that man's words?

149
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:42,578
- There's another... - Who? The hit-and-run driver?

150
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:45,718
Or someone who's with Yeo Jin?

151
00:08:47,418 --> 00:08:51,518
They're all out to get me!

152
00:08:51,888 --> 00:08:54,187
I never gave out such an order!

153
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:57,758
I hear there's a notebook that shows the amount of money...

154
00:08:58,198 --> 00:08:59,957
you exchanged with Detective Cho...

155
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,698
and records that you tailed and kept an eye on Ms. Yoon all along.

156
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:05,798
Let me see that darned notebook!

157
00:09:07,268 --> 00:09:09,138
We'll find it soon.

158
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,008
Aren't you supposed to arrest me...

159
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:15,608
after finding that notebook?

160
00:09:16,648 --> 00:09:19,478
I finished testifying. I'm waiting for the chairwoman now.

161
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,918
I gave the same testimony as the one I did seven years ago.

162
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:27,128
I also told them about the possibility...

163
00:09:27,288 --> 00:09:30,228
that the landlady Du Na met might be Choi Myung Ji.

164
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:37,638
I'll call you later, Jin Goo.

165
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,938
Are you here to see your mom?

166
00:09:49,448 --> 00:09:50,878
You should hear me out first...

167
00:09:52,948 --> 00:09:54,388
before you meet her.

168
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:02,628
What are you talking about?

169
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,458
What do you mean Yu Jin gave me that hat?

170
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:09,528
I heard the old hat in the chairwoman's closet...

171
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:11,198
was the one...

172
00:10:12,098 --> 00:10:14,108
Du Na was wearing when she went missing.

173
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:17,738
- So? - Du Na said...

174
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:20,308
she gave that hat to some girl.

175
00:10:22,308 --> 00:10:23,478
It was you, wasn't it?

176
00:10:23,678 --> 00:10:26,047
What are you talking about? It wasn't me.

177
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:27,518
You had a scar on your knee, right?

178
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:29,888
You were the girl...

179
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:31,658
who got off that boat.

180
00:10:32,158 --> 00:10:33,258
No.

181
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:35,628
Stop lying.

182
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,158
You got the wrong person.

183
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:40,667
And why are you telling me this now?

184
00:10:40,668 --> 00:10:42,828
You need to stop lying.

185
00:10:43,628 --> 00:10:46,638
The tragedy of that day began with one small lie.

186
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:51,778
- It's time to tell the truth. - About what?

187
00:10:51,878 --> 00:10:53,847
Why you got off the boat alone on that day...

188
00:10:53,848 --> 00:10:56,148
and why you didn't tell anyone she was on the boat.

189
00:10:57,978 --> 00:11:00,748
The small lie you told that day...

190
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:04,018
could've led to her hit-and-run accident.

191
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:08,487
Are you blaming Yu Jin's car accident on me, too?

192
00:11:08,488 --> 00:11:09,927
I'm not blaming you.

193
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,098
Anyone can lie. But...

194
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,468
you should've set the record straight right away.

195
00:11:14,898 --> 00:11:16,428
If you did that back then,

196
00:11:16,568 --> 00:11:20,498
Du Na's disappearance could've been just a mishap.

197
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,608
I have no idea what you're talking about.

198
00:11:23,638 --> 00:11:26,037
Is this a roundabout way to say my mom instigated her accident?

199
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:27,508
Do you have evidence that she did it?

200
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:28,708
Seven years ago,

201
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:31,978
Du Na said she found her mom's home.

202
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:36,048
The landlady there said the original owners had moved...

203
00:11:36,618 --> 00:11:39,158
and offered to give her the address, so they were supposed to meet.

204
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,688
But on that day, she got into that accident.

205
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:46,027
So?

206
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:47,898
That's all I know.

207
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:51,098
Make a wise decision.

208
00:11:59,178 --> 00:12:01,248
Is she saying my mom was...

209
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,348
that landlady?

210
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:08,718
You look awful.

211
00:12:09,588 --> 00:12:10,918
You're going to get married soon.

212
00:12:12,658 --> 00:12:14,458
How am I going to marry, Mom?

213
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:17,898
You were arrested for murder instigation in front of his family.

214
00:12:19,028 --> 00:12:21,728
I got framed and arrested, so why would it get called off?

215
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:25,397
Once I get out,

216
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,638
- I'll talk to Ms. Jung again and... - That's enough.

217
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,137
Do you not believe me, either?

218
00:12:30,138 --> 00:12:31,478
Are you sure you didn't do it, Mom?

219
00:12:32,538 --> 00:12:34,977
No, I didn't.

220
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:37,178
I also hope that's true.

221
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:39,778
I don't want to be a murderer's daughter.

222
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:42,788
That'll never happen.

223
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:46,258
I don't know about everyone else,

224
00:12:46,888 --> 00:12:48,558
but you need to believe me.

225
00:12:49,758 --> 00:12:51,798
Then, why did the police arrest you?

226
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:55,327
They say all circumstantial evidence is pointing to me,

227
00:12:55,328 --> 00:12:56,498
but it's all nonsense.

228
00:12:56,628 --> 00:12:58,368
Everyone is suspicious of you.

229
00:12:59,098 --> 00:13:01,308
Why would they do that without any evidence?

230
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,937
They must hate me.

231
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:04,837
No matter how much they hate you, why would they all work together...

232
00:13:04,838 --> 00:13:06,007
and try to turn you into a murderer?

233
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,978
How can I tell what they're thinking?

234
00:13:09,048 --> 00:13:12,348
I'm about to go crazy from frustration.

235
00:13:14,948 --> 00:13:17,288
I'll be out there soon. Once I'm out,

236
00:13:18,018 --> 00:13:19,958
I'll sue everyone who ruined your marriage...

237
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,788
by arresting me...

238
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:23,428
without hard evidence.

239
00:13:24,658 --> 00:13:26,728
The small lie you told that day...

240
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,998
could've led to her hit-and-run accident.

241
00:13:33,268 --> 00:13:34,338
Many things...

242
00:13:35,808 --> 00:13:38,238
would've changed if I were honest with Uncle Sung Ho...

243
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:40,848
on that day, right?

244
00:13:42,678 --> 00:13:44,677
Why are you bringing that up?

245
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:46,518
You wouldn't have had to tail Yu Jin...

246
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,548
or keep an eye on her.

247
00:13:49,188 --> 00:13:50,288
Stop talking.

248
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,558
- Everything is recorded. - Did Yu Jin...

249
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:54,928
visit us at home seven years ago?

250
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:57,697
I don't know what you're talking about.

251
00:13:57,698 --> 00:13:59,298
Be honest with me.

252
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,698
I didn't do this only for myself.

253
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,338
I did everything for you.

254
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:10,808
Go, now.

255
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,048
The detectives are investigating,

256
00:14:17,378 --> 00:14:18,878
so they'll find the notebook soon.

257
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:21,517
Things would be much easier if Myung Ji confessed.

258
00:14:21,518 --> 00:14:22,848
We have to detain her first.

259
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:25,518
She'll destroy the notebook first as soon as she gets released.

260
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,528
And she may even flee.

261
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:30,258
Yes, I think she'll destroy the evidence first.

262
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:33,628
Let's put our faith in the police for now.

263
00:14:33,758 --> 00:14:34,928
Okay.

264
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:39,138
Let's go to my uncle's tteokbokki place again later.

265
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:41,268
All right. See you later, Eun Chong.

266
00:14:42,368 --> 00:14:43,837
Goodbye.

267
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:46,108
Bye. Good work today.

268
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:47,478
Goodbye.

269
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:50,778
We'll get going, too.

270
00:14:51,148 --> 00:14:52,177
You should get some rest.

271
00:14:52,178 --> 00:14:54,717
Eun Chong, you should stay with Grandma for a while.

272
00:14:54,718 --> 00:14:56,988
- She'll be here alone. - Okay.

273
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:58,787
I'll go, too.

274
00:14:58,788 --> 00:15:00,858
You can stay a little longer.

275
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,528
What? Okay. I will.

276
00:15:18,038 --> 00:15:21,448
I think Eun Chong adjusted to his life as the chairwoman's grandson.

277
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:25,148
And it's even more stable now that his grandpa is here, too.

278
00:15:26,478 --> 00:15:28,618
He'll do even better if he had his own parents,

279
00:15:29,248 --> 00:15:31,288
and we're here, ready to be just that.

280
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,998
He has lots of uncles and aunties, too.

281
00:15:39,328 --> 00:15:40,528
I'm kind of jealous.

282
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:43,598
My mom and I lived alone,

283
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:46,438
so I liked how lively your family was.

284
00:15:47,298 --> 00:15:50,138
You and your mother have a great relationship, too.

285
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,538
I'm jealous of you, too.

286
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:54,848
My dad was such a loving husband,

287
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,148
and I took after him.

288
00:15:57,978 --> 00:16:00,117
What? That means you'll also be a loving husband...

289
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:01,848
if we marry.

290
00:16:04,218 --> 00:16:05,588
I don't even need to say yes.

291
00:16:07,018 --> 00:16:08,158
Good for you.

292
00:16:10,588 --> 00:16:11,658
Jeez.

293
00:16:15,298 --> 00:16:18,638
My goodness. What on earth is going on?

294
00:16:19,868 --> 00:16:21,768
- I'm home. - You're back.

295
00:16:22,138 --> 00:16:23,408
Did you see this?

296
00:16:24,838 --> 00:16:25,938
What are you watching?

297
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,717
What are you doing?

298
00:16:32,718 --> 00:16:34,387
You're arrested without a warrant...

299
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:35,848
due to the possibility of evidence destruction and flight.

300
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:40,618
Was Se Young's mom arrested while meeting her future in-laws?

301
00:16:41,258 --> 00:16:43,128
- I didn't do it. - Her future in-laws?

302
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:45,928
Was she meeting her future in-laws?

303
00:16:46,758 --> 00:16:48,927
- I mean, - If they did it without...

304
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:51,098
the wedding got called off recently, and she was already meeting them?

305
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:52,397
You two weren't just gold diggers or mother-daughter scammers.

306
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:53,998
What now? Murder instigation?

307
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,907
- I could've died if I married her. - Anyway,

308
00:16:57,908 --> 00:16:59,978
what does murder instigation mean?

309
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:03,177
Doesn't that mean she told someone to kill another?

310
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:05,948
We caught you trying to con us.

311
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:13,218
The person you have reached is...

312
00:17:14,018 --> 00:17:16,088
Se Young must've been deeply shocked.

313
00:17:17,358 --> 00:17:19,728
- While she was with future in-laws? - Yes.

314
00:17:20,428 --> 00:17:23,798
It seemed like she was abused by the man's family, too.

315
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:26,897
Her mom got arrested, and the marriage got called off.

316
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:28,738
She must be in great shock.

317
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:31,838
I saw her at the police station.

318
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,308
Really?

319
00:17:33,808 --> 00:17:34,978
How did she look?

320
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,007
She looked haggard and dazed,

321
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:38,918
so I just figured it was because of her mom's arrest.

322
00:17:39,618 --> 00:17:41,648
I didn't know something like that happened.

323
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:44,287
You should meet her.

324
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:45,558
She won't pick up her phone.

325
00:17:45,888 --> 00:17:48,358
You should visit her at home. She must be at the newlywed home.

326
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:51,658
I'll ask Jin Goo for the passcode just in case.

327
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:54,428
Okay.

328
00:17:55,328 --> 00:17:57,368
Hey, you two were here.

329
00:17:58,438 --> 00:17:59,497
Did you see it?

330
00:17:59,498 --> 00:18:00,738
Yoon Se Young's mom got arrested.

331
00:18:00,898 --> 00:18:03,107
This must be her unlucky year.

332
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:04,208
How did you know?

333
00:18:05,278 --> 00:18:07,078
There's a video of her with her future in-laws.

334
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:10,348
- It blew up like crazy. - We caught you trying to con us.

335
00:18:10,508 --> 00:18:11,618
Got it?

336
00:18:15,348 --> 00:18:16,748
Choi Myung Ji must be behind Du Na's case...

337
00:18:17,148 --> 00:18:20,458
if she was arrested for murder instigation, right?

338
00:18:21,628 --> 00:18:23,728
Wait, is that how it goes?

339
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:28,768
Anyway, I suddenly feel kind of bad for Se Young.

340
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:30,767
The whole nation now thinks...

341
00:18:30,768 --> 00:18:33,138
she's a murderer's daughter because of her mom.

342
00:18:33,298 --> 00:18:34,408
I have to go.

343
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,238
- I'll text you the passcode. - Okay.

344
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,278
What passcode? What?

345
00:18:40,438 --> 00:18:42,078
Where are you going, Ji Seok? Where is he going?

346
00:18:42,378 --> 00:18:43,448
Why aren't you going home?

347
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,418
Mind your own.

348
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:47,018
Go with Ji Seok.

349
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:57,228
Yes.

350
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:00,228
All these tragedies began because of my lie.

351
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:02,068
It's all my fault.

352
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:06,198
Gosh, what are we going to do?

353
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:07,808
Let's tell Daddy.

354
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:09,438
No.

355
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:12,737
It was your present for me.

356
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:15,648
Yu Jin got on the boat because of me.

357
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:17,407
Okay.

358
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,917
- And she rolled down the stairs... - Five. Six.

359
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:21,318
because I wanted to play hide-and-seek.

360
00:19:21,888 --> 00:19:25,918
Eight. Nine. Ten.

361
00:19:26,518 --> 00:19:29,488
Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen.

362
00:19:30,928 --> 00:19:31,998
Yu Jin.

363
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:34,298
Yu Jin.

364
00:19:40,898 --> 00:19:42,038
Yu Jin.

365
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:43,408
Se Young?

366
00:19:44,908 --> 00:19:47,208
Where's Yu Jin?

367
00:19:48,508 --> 00:19:51,918
And she was lost because I lied to Uncle Sung Ho.

368
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:54,648
In the end, it's my fault.

369
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:56,917
Yu Jin died,

370
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,958
and my mom instigated the hit-and-run case...

371
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:01,088
all because of me.

372
00:20:01,858 --> 00:20:03,988
(Goo Ji Seok)

373
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,468
Se Young. Yoon Se Young.

374
00:20:25,918 --> 00:20:27,148
You're bleeding.

375
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:30,648
Ji Seok.

376
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:40,628
I heard you went to the police station.

377
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:43,728
Did you meet your mom?

378
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:45,838
It's all my fault.

379
00:20:46,668 --> 00:20:47,738
What is?

380
00:20:47,938 --> 00:20:51,408
If I didn't lie, my mom...

381
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:54,478
wouldn't have become a murderer.

382
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:58,548
And I...

383
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,488
wouldn't have become a murderer's daughter.

384
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,618
What's on your mind?

385
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:09,488
You haven't eaten anything, right?

386
00:21:10,058 --> 00:21:11,228
Let me get something to eat.

387
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:33,078
You have to eat.

388
00:21:37,918 --> 00:21:39,918
When I was with my future in-laws,

389
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,858
the guy asked if I were also her accomplice.

390
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:46,628
I guess I am.

391
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:50,468
If my mom had to do that because of me,

392
00:21:51,538 --> 00:21:52,798
it'd make me her accomplice.

393
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,238
Why was that your fault?

394
00:21:55,838 --> 00:21:57,938
Stop minding what others say.

395
00:21:58,308 --> 00:22:00,178
No one will care after some time.

396
00:22:00,338 --> 00:22:02,608
When did things start going wrong?

397
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:06,378
Would my life have changed...

398
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,648
if I made a different decision back then?

399
00:22:10,488 --> 00:22:11,588
Back then?

400
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,758
Back when?

401
00:22:14,588 --> 00:22:16,958
It's been too long, so I can't change anything.

402
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:20,458
But I can't go on like this.

403
00:22:22,128 --> 00:22:23,828
I'm so scared and frightened.

404
00:22:26,738 --> 00:22:27,868
Se Young.

405
00:22:28,508 --> 00:22:31,208
It feels like my life stopped when I was ten.

406
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:35,148
It feels like time has stopped...

407
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,608
at that sea...

408
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,348
where Yu Jin went missing.

409
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:44,218
Did something happen back then?

410
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:02,738
- And a marshmallow. You love this. - Yay!

411
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:05,438
Oh, my.

412
00:23:07,138 --> 00:23:09,248
- Make sure you chew well. - Okay.

413
00:23:18,918 --> 00:23:20,588
- What are you up to? - Hey.

414
00:23:21,328 --> 00:23:22,688
I was thinking of Yu Jin.

415
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:25,398
Why did you get rid of the fireplace?

416
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,028
I also didn't see the wooden swing in the yard.

417
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,738
I got rid of everything when I made Ha Na my daughter.

418
00:23:34,668 --> 00:23:37,407
She said Yu Jin remembered a fireplace, a wooden swing,

419
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:40,308
hot chocolate, and marshmallow.

420
00:23:42,148 --> 00:23:44,308
I thought she'd get suspicious...

421
00:23:44,448 --> 00:23:47,718
when she moved in as Yu Jin, so I got rid of them all.

422
00:23:51,148 --> 00:23:52,758
I was stupid and foolish.

423
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:55,388
No.

424
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:58,498
- What about Eun Chong? - He's asleep.

425
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:00,657
I'll go, then.

426
00:24:00,658 --> 00:24:01,828
You should get some rest.

427
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:07,268
Yes, Attorney Ko.

428
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:10,868
What?

429
00:24:14,678 --> 00:24:16,278
All right. Bye.

430
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:19,318
- Was that the attorney? - Yes.

431
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:22,388
Myung Ji is putting the blame all on Detective Cho.

432
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:24,088
It won't be easy...

433
00:24:25,218 --> 00:24:27,188
to put her behind bars without that notebook.

434
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:31,358
We have to do whatever it takes to find it.

435
00:24:33,158 --> 00:24:35,728
I want to call Se Young over and nitpick over this immediately.

436
00:24:47,008 --> 00:24:49,208
This hat is new. You should wear it.

437
00:24:50,278 --> 00:24:51,378
It's a gift.

438
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,178
Yu Jin!

439
00:24:57,518 --> 00:24:58,588
Yu Jin!

440
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:01,658
Yu Jin!

441
00:25:03,258 --> 00:25:05,798
I went to the restroom.

442
00:25:06,458 --> 00:25:09,298
I'll find her and come back, so don't go anywhere...

443
00:25:09,528 --> 00:25:10,668
and stay in the car.

444
00:25:11,638 --> 00:25:12,738
Yu Jin.

445
00:25:34,988 --> 00:25:36,428
(Restricted Number)

446
00:25:38,728 --> 00:25:40,357
You're arrested without a warrant...

447
00:25:40,358 --> 00:25:41,897
due to the possibility of evidence destruction and flight.

448
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:44,468
You tried to kill me, too, right?

449
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:47,667
Wasn't that why you said you didn't care...

450
00:25:47,668 --> 00:25:50,268
if I cheated on you or gambled? No?

451
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,408
Don't associate with her. She's just bad luck.

452
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:54,138
No!

453
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:57,248
No, please...

454
00:26:09,658 --> 00:26:10,728
(Yoon Se Young)

455
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,368
Yes, hello?

456
00:26:16,998 --> 00:26:18,137
It's me.

457
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:19,298
What time is it?

458
00:26:21,708 --> 00:26:24,738
I thought of what you said yesterday.

459
00:26:25,738 --> 00:26:27,708
I realized I've never made any decisions in my life...

460
00:26:28,708 --> 00:26:31,718
from the moment I was born until now.

461
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,018
I did everything as my mom wanted.

462
00:26:35,988 --> 00:26:37,788
You can live as you like from now on.

463
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,928
I want to make a decision for the first...

464
00:26:43,058 --> 00:26:44,428
and the last time.

465
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:46,098
On what?

466
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,868
Will you be honest and tell the chairwoman the truth?

467
00:26:55,968 --> 00:26:57,368
I'm glad you made that decision.

468
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,077
It wasn't your fault.

469
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,478
You were too young back then.

470
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:03,778
It was an accident.

471
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:05,718
I envy you, Ha Na.

472
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:08,818
- For what? - You're different from me.

473
00:27:13,458 --> 00:27:16,928
I'm sorry for harassing you...

474
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:19,258
all this time.

475
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:21,928
What has gotten into you?

476
00:27:22,068 --> 00:27:23,168
Take care.

477
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:26,098
Hello? Hey...

478
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:31,168
What was that?

479
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:34,438
She didn't seem like her usual self.

480
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:39,948
I want to make a decision for the first...

481
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:42,418
and the last time.

482
00:27:43,988 --> 00:27:47,218
Did she mean she'll tell the truth to the chairwoman?

483
00:27:49,728 --> 00:27:52,328
(Yoon Se Young)

484
00:28:10,678 --> 00:28:12,977
Hey, Ji Seok. Did I wake you?

485
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:15,387
Yes, what's up?

486
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:17,548
Can you check and see if Se Young is home?

487
00:28:18,888 --> 00:28:20,988
I just got a call from her,

488
00:28:21,488 --> 00:28:23,088
and something didn't feel right.

489
00:28:24,658 --> 00:28:26,898
- What do you mean? - Find her for now.

490
00:28:27,598 --> 00:28:28,698
Se Young!

491
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,068
Se Young!

492
00:28:40,138 --> 00:28:42,047
Hey, Ha Na. She's not home,

493
00:28:42,048 --> 00:28:43,948
- and she won't pick up her phone. - She won't?

494
00:28:44,748 --> 00:28:46,718
Did she see the video of her meeting the in-laws?

495
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:48,018
The video of her with the in-laws?

496
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:50,148
I took everything down.

497
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:51,818
I have a feeling...

498
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,687
she got a dreadful idea.

499
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:55,858
What dreadful idea?

500
00:28:57,888 --> 00:29:00,158
- You don't mean... - It doesn't feel right.

501
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:02,828
I need to look for Se Young.

502
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:08,738
It feels like my life stopped when I was ten.

503
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,208
It feels like time has stopped at that sea...

504
00:29:12,278 --> 00:29:13,638
where Yu Jin went missing.

505
00:29:15,878 --> 00:29:16,948
Hey, Ha Na.

506
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,717
Where was the sea that Du Na went missing?

507
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:20,778
Why?

508
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,348
- Do you think she's there? - Yes.

509
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:32,458
I must destroy the notebook first.

510
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:35,428
(Se Young)

511
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:39,398
The person you have reached...

512
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:42,108
Her mother just got released. Why won't she pick up?

513
00:29:44,938 --> 00:29:47,408
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please...

514
00:29:48,808 --> 00:29:49,978
You should go that way.

515
00:29:50,108 --> 00:29:51,848
- I'll go this way. - Okay.

516
00:29:56,018 --> 00:29:57,118
Se Young!

517
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:23,848
(Goo Ji Seok)

518
00:30:35,858 --> 00:30:38,228
- Se Young. - Ji Seok.

519
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,198
Where are you?

520
00:30:42,068 --> 00:30:43,428
Se Young, can you hear me?

521
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:45,438
Yes.

522
00:30:46,168 --> 00:30:47,268
Where are you right now?

523
00:30:48,738 --> 00:30:50,338
Please just tell me where you are!

524
00:30:51,638 --> 00:30:53,078
When I looked back on everything,

525
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:57,448
I realized you were the one I loved.

526
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,018
I don't know about you,

527
00:31:04,418 --> 00:31:05,818
but it was love for me.

528
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:10,488
I sincerely cherished every minute we spent in America.

529
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:18,438
I'm glad I got to leave you with this.

530
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:21,768
Take care.

531
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:29,848
Hello? Se Young! Yoon Se Young!

532
00:32:51,258 --> 00:32:53,228
(Cinderella Game)

533
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:56,467
I'll find the notebook and throw you back inside.

534
00:32:56,468 --> 00:32:57,667
Go ahead and try.

535
00:32:57,668 --> 00:32:59,337
I'll put together every crime you committed and report you,

536
00:32:59,338 --> 00:33:01,797
including forgery of private documents and fraud.

537
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:03,767
Ms. Choi Myung Ji, may I talk to you for a second?

538
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:06,507
You have to live alone if I get arrested.

539
00:33:06,508 --> 00:33:08,408
Can you live alone without me?

540
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:10,847
I did everything for you.

541
00:33:10,848 --> 00:33:13,748
I feel bad for both Du Na and Se Young.

542
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:16,748
I want to spend every second I have left...

543
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:18,688
with you.

544
00:33:23,858 --> 00:33:26,997
I'm just grateful that I married a man like him.

545
00:33:26,998 --> 00:33:28,457
(A woman who firmly believed her life was perfect)

546
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:31,098
They're kissing each other with a cloth over them.

547
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,468
There may be a secret,

548
00:33:32,938 --> 00:33:35,207
or they may be in fake love.

549
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:36,607
(The secret and betrayal behind love)

550
00:33:36,608 --> 00:33:38,637
The first mistake you made was...

551
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:39,908
marrying me.

552
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,548
Watch and see...

553
00:33:43,078 --> 00:33:45,348
how your dear daughter crashes and falls.

554
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:47,247
(Kang Jae In)

555
00:33:47,248 --> 00:33:50,148
I'm not Kang Se Ri. My name is Kang Jae In.

556
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:53,458
Just wait. I'll live as Kang Jae In.

557
00:33:53,818 --> 00:33:55,258
I'm the one and only Kang Jae In, and that's enough.

558
00:33:55,728 --> 00:33:58,458
Queen's House, premiering on April 28.
