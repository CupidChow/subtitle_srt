1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:01,940
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,380
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,650
Se Young! Se Young, wake up.

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,290
Se Young...

6
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,030
Where did she go?

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,270
She won't pick up her phone, either.

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,750
Did she leave with her medicine?

9
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,920
Hey, Jin Goo.

10
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,990
Se Young did what?

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,000
Are you okay?

12
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,010
- Jin Goo...
- Do you remember taking pills?

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,110
Why did you do this?

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,410
I don't want to live.

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,220
Your mother will be here.

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,420
You still came running.

17
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,420
I told myself I'd die
if you didn't come.

18
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,630
Don't go.

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,740
Are you trying
to work things out with Ha Na?

20
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,810
Tell me.

21
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,510
I have nothing on my mind right now.

22
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,420
What about later?

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,850
I can't stand to see that.

24
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:54,490
Promise me that
you'll never date Ha Na.

25
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,990
Then, I'll let you go.

26
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,290
Why do you care about who I date?

27
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,360
Forget me and live your life.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,360
Then, why did you save me?

29
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,800
Why didn't you just leave me to die?

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,170
- Lower your voice.
- Take responsibility for saving me.

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,640
If you can't do that,

32
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,410
don't date Ha Na, either.

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,240
What are you doing?

34
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,940
Please keep quiet.

35
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,080
You weren't done with this.

36
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,450
How's her condition?

37
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,790
She's fine.
She overdosed on sleeping pills,

38
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:30,260
but it wasn't so bad
that she had to pump them out.

39
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,720
She collapsed because of stress
caused on her body...

40
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,490
by anemia and nutritional imbalance.

41
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,190
She can leave.

42
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,240
Se Young.

43
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,280
- Se Young.
- Mom...

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,580
Please excuse me.

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,820
How did she...

46
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,590
end up taking pills?

47
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,890
Were you there?

48
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,430
You can ask her.

49
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,260
Jin Goo...

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,400
That jerk left
without even looking back.

51
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,370
Oh, no. Are you okay?

52
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,150
Why did you take those pills?

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,050
You told me to pretend to die
to hold Jin Goo back.

54
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,890
I told you to pretend.
I didn't tell you to kill yourself.

55
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,560
It's fine. I'm not dead.

56
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,630
You're just...

57
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,400
Just forget Jin Goo.

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,200
We're after Hyesung Group.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,340
But if Yeo Jin continues
to keep Eun Chong by her side,

60
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,710
we'll end up becoming
only sidekicks.

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,110
It's all Ha Na's curse.

62
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,150
Se Young.

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,650
Why don't we
send Eun Chong abroad to study?

64
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,890
- Send him abroad?
- Go with him and act as his mom.

65
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,690
You can go with him,
then return about a decade later.

66
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:18,360
By then, we'll be able
to control him however we want.

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,770
But will Aunt Yeo Jin let him go?

68
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,940
I'll make her say yes.

69
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,840
Ha Na got her revenge on me?

70
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,110
Think about it.

71
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,740
Jin Goo and Se Young
can't adopt Eun Chong...

72
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,280
if they aren't married.

73
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:35,810
That was what she wanted.

74
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,920
She messed with Se Young
on top of that...

75
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,820
by dropping the news
on the day of her wedding.

76
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,260
She's pure evil.

77
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,160
It seems like
Jin Goo is also under her grasp.

78
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,160
He did change recently.

79
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,170
Yeo Jin, at times like these,

80
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,740
you and I must work together.

81
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,110
You can't let Ha Na
take Eun Chong from you.

82
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,510
Why would that happen?
He's my grandson and my blood.

83
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,780
Even that doesn't work for her.

84
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,480
First, we have to put
a physical distance between them.

85
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,950
While we're on the subject,

86
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:19,720
why don't you
send Eun Chong abroad to study?

87
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,060
He's too young.

88
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,160
He'd never leave Ha Na's side
if he stayed in Seoul.

89
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,530
If she makes a fuss
with a custody suit,

90
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:33,540
that can end up
exposing Eun Chong to the public.

91
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,210
Se Young can leave with him
and return about a decade later.

92
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,510
That'd be perfect timing
to introduce him as your successor.

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,480
And if I'm needed,
I can go with them too.

94
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,220
And you can take a sabbatical
and come along.

95
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,790
She overdosed on pills?

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,100
That sounds like her.

97
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,530
- Call her if you're worried.
- I'm fine.

98
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,270
Se Young woke up.

99
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:12,180
She didn't take much,
so she didn't need to pump her stomach.

100
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,580
I thought you'd be curious,
so I decided to text you.

101
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,050
Se Young is fine.

102
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,650
I'm glad.

103
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,720
- Was that Hwang Jin Goo?
- Yes.

104
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,060
You know Jin Goo likes you, right?

105
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,860
Really?

106
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,600
How do you feel...

107
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,930
- about him?
- He turned me into a fake daughter.

108
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,700
- Why would I like him?
- What if you left that out?

109
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,240
Do you like him?

110
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,040
That's not on my mind.

111
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,210
What about you?
What did you see in Se Young?

112
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,880
Getting revenge
isn't everything, right?

113
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,950
I'm not sure.

114
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,060
I'll also know for sure
after we're done with our revenge.

115
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,860
For me, it's Eun Chong.
For you, Se Young.

116
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,160
I don't think things will be over
even after we get our revenge.

117
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,500
What are you up to, Eun Chong?

118
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,500
I'm studying the alphabet.

119
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,140
Alone?

120
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,140
Yes, I can now do this alone.

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,580
You're so brave.

122
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,980
You're fine without me there, right?

123
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,350
Yes, because you and I are
always connected.

124
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,780
That's right.

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,820
What did you eat for lunch?

126
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,320
I had a sandwich. What about you?

127
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,420
I had some meat.

128
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,660
I have to go, Auntie Ha Na.

129
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,060
I'll call you later.

130
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,970
Okay. Bye.

131
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,310
Eun Chong, you're now okay
with acting like a big boy...

132
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,880
even without Auntie Ha Na.

133
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:58,450
Yes, we may be apart,
but we're always connected.

134
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,290
What's your auntie up to these days?

135
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,890
Work.

136
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,390
What work?

137
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,890
Something really important.

138
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,800
She'll come and see me
when she's done.

139
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,200
I see.

140
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,600
How can I send
this little boy abroad?

141
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,840
You're here, Bang Ul.

142
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,610
Don't call me by my name.

143
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,620
We may not be in-laws,
but our friendship is forever...

144
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,920
Friendship, my foot.

145
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,020
Stop talking nonsense
and take a seat.

146
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,530
Things are over, but we still need
to balance the account.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,870
"Balance the account?"

148
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,440
The wedding was called off,
so we should settle the cost.

149
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,010
Wait, Se Young almost
killed herself because of Jin Goo,

150
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,180
and you were worried about that?

151
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,610
You're here,
so it must mean she's fine.

152
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,250
Also, get your story straight.

153
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,680
That's not because of Jin Goo.

154
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,850
She ruined her own life.

155
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,260
How dare she con him
by faking her pregnancy?

156
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,170
This house was a gift
from the chairwoman,

157
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:24,570
so we can return it to her
or split it in half.

158
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,570
But you need to pay for the wedding,
including wedding presents,

159
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,470
the venue, and everything else.

160
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,540
What did you say?

161
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,540
Se Young is responsible
for breaking off this wedding.

162
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,680
Jin Goo is a victim
of this fraudulent wedding.

163
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,220
"Fraudulent wedding?"

164
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,320
- Se Young loved him, so...
- How is this love?

165
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,730
How is it love to cheat on him?

166
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,000
How is it love
to fake her pregnancy?

167
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:54,370
He was lucky that the news broke out
on the day of his wedding.

168
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,070
If he found out after,

169
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,670
your daughter
would've become a criminal,

170
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,410
and my son
would've become a divorce.

171
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,610
All right. Come on.

172
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,110
We don't have to settle anything.
I'll pay for everything. Okay?

173
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,950
So, let's stop fighting.

174
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,420
Now, for their future...

175
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,690
Now, that's all
for the wedding cost.

176
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,760
I need you to compensate
for Jin Goo's psychological damage.

177
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:26,100
Okay, fine. I'll do that too.

178
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,830
Instead,

179
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,340
please cut some slack
on Se Young just this once.

180
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,210
I don't want a daughter-in-law...

181
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,440
who cheats and lies.

182
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,540
Who knows what kind of lies
she'll tell in the future?

183
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,910
Wait, then,

184
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,820
did you want to see me
just to get...

185
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,980
some money from me?

186
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,420
Otherwise, why would I meet you?

187
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,160
This woman has become crazy
for money after starting a business.

188
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,360
You want to cash in
on your son's broken engagement?

189
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,830
"Cash in?" How much will you offer
to call it cashing in?

190
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,700
I feel offended
just to sit with you and talk.

191
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,600
Let's settle the account
and end our ties here.

192
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,470
Yes, sure. Let's do that. Sure.

193
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,880
Now that we're on the topic,

194
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,380
I never approved of Jin Goo
from the start.

195
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,880
He was
nowhere near Se Young's league,

196
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,350
but Yeo Jin
forcibly made Se Young...

197
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,790
- date that punk!
- What now?

198
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,890
He's nowhere near whose league?

199
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,860
Did I hear
what I thought you just said?

200
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,690
Yes, was I wrong?

201
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,200
He's just called
the chairwoman's stepson.

202
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,700
It's just nonsense!

203
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Is that all you have to say?

204
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,340
Let go. I said, let go of me.

205
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,810
I was already angry
that she toyed with my son.

206
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,410
How dare you go on
and blurt out that nonsense?

207
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:50,450
If you don't let go of me,
I'll pull out your hair too.

208
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:53,920
Do people in your daughter's league
cheat on their fiance...

209
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,520
just before the wedding...

210
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,590
and con the partner
by faking her pregnancy?

211
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,060
- Does that happen in her league?
- What's with you?

212
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,760
- Bang Ul, you're just...
- You.

213
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,530
- Let go of me.
- Let go.

214
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,530
- Let go of me!
- No, you let go of me first!

215
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,970
- You need to let go of me first!
- Let go!

216
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,470
- Let go!
- No, you let this go!

217
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:13,600
What's wrong with you?

218
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,850
I have a lot to say too.

219
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,550
He cheated on her with Ha Na!

220
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,650
He was happy to run off
because her pregnancy was fake!

221
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,390
What are you making up?

222
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,330
If he wanted to call it off,
he should've come to the venue...

223
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,790
and done it in person.

224
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,330
How can he just call
and announce it to us?

225
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,070
Where are his manners?

226
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,670
Se Young is also a victim!

227
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,570
Like mother, like daughter.

228
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,140
Like mother, like son.

229
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,780
- Goodness.
- You haven't been beaten enough.

230
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,680
Ms. Sim, I never knew you had
a knack for beating people up.

231
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,380
Your slowness always frustrated me
when you were my maid.

232
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,520
Why are you so fast
when you beat me up?

233
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,220
I'm going to kill you today.

234
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:05,790
I won't just sit around
if you beat me.

235
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,660
It's all or nothing for me too.

236
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,360
Bring it on. Okay?

237
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,600
- I'll get you too.
- What now? You brat.

238
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,530
- You brat. Bring it on.
- My gosh! Bang Ul!

239
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,370
- Bang Ul!
- Let's do this!

240
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,370
I said I'd kill myself,
yet he turned around coldly.

241
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,850
It's all Ha Na's fault.

242
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,620
If you want me, take Hyesung first.

243
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,890
Jin Goo will be the winner
in this life...

244
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,820
after we adopt Eun Chong.

245
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,090
Do you really think so?

246
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,830
You never know
what will happen in life.

247
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,600
Who knows how things will change?

248
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,670
Ji Seok already knew
about my fake pregnancy.

249
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,280
Who is it?

250
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,780
It's me.

251
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,300
Are you okay?

252
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,330
I heard
you went to the emergency room.

253
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,740
Did Ha Na tell you?

254
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,970
It was you and your sister.

255
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:31,940
You knew everything,

256
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,780
yet you kept talking about my baby
whenever we met,

257
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,910
while sneering at me on the inside!

258
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,750
No! Let go of me!

259
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,060
Did you tell Ha Na to drop this news
on the day of my wedding?

260
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,420
Yes.

261
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,630
Is this your revenge?

262
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,170
Have you had enough
now that you've seen me ruined?

263
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,040
I haven't had enough.

264
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
You never loved Jin Goo.

265
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,510
You were going to marry him...

266
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,610
because of Hyesung and Eun Chong.

267
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,750
Because those were
more important to me than love.

268
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,120
- I'll take Hyesung.
- How?

269
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,050
By talking to Ha Na...

270
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,590
- and adopting Eun Chong?
- Why not?

271
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,160
Then, Hyesung will belong
to Ha Na, not you.

272
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,260
Who knows?

273
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,630
There are other ways to take Hyesung
other than Eun Chong.

274
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,660
- How?
- You gave me...

275
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,830
the authorization key
for the security server.

276
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,200
What can you do with that?

277
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,740
You'll see.

278
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:37,710
Once you take Hyesung,
will you give it to me?

279
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,150
Only if you agree to join me.

280
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,520
Do you think I believe you?

281
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,320
So what if you don't?
Is there anything else you can do?

282
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,500
Then, stop Ha Na and Jin Goo...

283
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,830
from seeing each other.

284
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,350
Dad.

285
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,890
I can see
how diligently you have lived...

286
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,320
now that I'm going through
these documents you made.

287
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,130
But Chairwoman Shin...

288
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,260
took this business
you worked so hard for,

289
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,170
as well as your life and Mom's life.

290
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,070
I'll turn everything back.

291
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,570
Please keep watching over me...

292
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,040
and Ji Seok.

293
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,790
- Ha Na.
- Hey.

294
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,160
You're still up.

295
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,860
You're always looking at documents.
What on earth are you up to?

296
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,660
It'll only hurt you to know.
Go to sleep.

297
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,900
You should be out on a date
in this beautiful spring.

298
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,270
You can talk to me
after you start dating.

299
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,340
I can always get a date
if I want to.

300
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,110
Goodnight.

301
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,680
- Goodnight.
- Bye.

302
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,820
You know Jin Goo likes you, right?

303
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,590
How do you feel about him?

304
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,390
He turned me into a fake daughter.

305
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,990
Why would I like him?

306
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,330
If you can use me
to get your revenge, do it.

307
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,270
I'll gladly take part.

308
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,730
Just wait.

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll make use of you.

310
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:07,360
Will your revenge end
after you take Eun Chong back?

311
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,860
No.

312
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:11,430
Did she mean she had more to do?

313
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,010
Find a place in the UK
to send Eun Chong abroad.

314
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,170
He's still too young.

315
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:26,740
He'll stay in touch with Ha Na
as long as he's in Seoul.

316
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,010
If she keeps seeing him,
she'll want to take him back,

317
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,980
and things will get complicated
if she files a custody suit.

318
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,490
That's a wise decision.

319
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,820
Bang Ul and I
pulled each other's hair out,

320
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,490
so I don't think
Jin Goo and Se Young will happen.

321
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,930
The adoption is off too,
so it's better to send him abroad.

322
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,860
You pulled out Ms. Sim's hair?

323
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,330
You should've been apologizing.

324
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,100
I didn't just apologize.

325
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,500
I offered to pay for everything,

326
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,540
yet she went for my hair.

327
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,140
She kept harassing me,
then I snapped, and...

328
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
You probably made her
want to do that.

329
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,440
No, I'm serious.

330
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,650
I thought of our kids, so...

331
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,190
The audit is coming up,
but there won't be a problem...

332
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,920
as long as the corporate raid
stays hidden, right?

333
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,130
You don't have to mind this.

334
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,830
Okay.

335
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,370
What happened
at your wedding was unfortunate.

336
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,300
I believe
you took part in this plan.

337
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,440
It's appalling to hear you say that.

338
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,140
I won't deny that.

339
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,350
Did your lingering feelings
for Ms. Yoon also play a part?

340
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:39,480
Why did this revenge
suddenly jump to romance?

341
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,620
It smelled like it.

342
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,690
- Like unfinished romance.
- Not at all.

343
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:48,430
The wedding is off, so make sure
you're ready for the audit.

344
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,490
I'll look forward to it.

345
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,630
Why would you look forward to it?

346
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,070
You kept quiet
as if you didn't know anything,

347
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,200
but it must be Richard Han.

348
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,540
I'm looking forward to seeing
who the chief auditor is.

349
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,240
I hope the auditor
lives up to your expectations.

350
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,050
So, he just admitted...

351
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,290
Richard Han was behind this.

352
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,590
Chairwoman Shin holds
a rather large piece...

353
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,830
in Hyesung Tour's
financial hierarchy.

354
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,660
The flow of funds changed a little
after it was sold.

355
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,230
We can go after this.

356
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,130
Yes, I'll get the materials ready.

00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,840
(Youngshin Fashion Supporting File,
Youngshin Fashion Supply Request)

358
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:03,430
Chairwoman Shin, do you admit
to conducting illegal activities...

359
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,440
in the process
of Youngshin Fashion's disposal?

360
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,370
It's true.

361
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,780
You sold off its assets
at dirt cheap price...

362
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,010
Ha Na, don't get worked up.

363
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,680
If you get caught up in her pace,
it's over.

364
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,880
Okay.

365
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,340
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

366
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,510
That's Ms. Yoon, right?

367
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,610
I knew she went on power trips,
but she just slapped that person.

368
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,890
Wait, the missing money envelope...

369
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,590
was also a self-fabricated incident?

370
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,420
The fake pregnancy
wasn't really a surprise, then.

371
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,330
- What is this?
- She's frightening.

372
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,500
What's that?

373
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,270
This must be a bolt out of the blue
for Ms. Yoon while she's away.

374
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,140
Reporter Kim, what now?

375
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,580
A scandal broke out
about my power abuse?

376
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,780
I need to hang up.

("In-House Power Abuse by the Niece

00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,560
What is this? This...

379
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,430
must've been Ha Na.

380
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:40,160
She said I was the culprit
for the money envelope incident...

381
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,430
and had hidden the evidence
to this day?

382
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,800
Have you seen the article?

383
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,170
It was Goo Ha Na.

384
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,170
It was that brat again?

385
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,380
People are showing a huge response
to the power abuse scandal.

386
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,580
That's a sensitive issue these days.

387
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,810
It's crucial to find...

388
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,520
decisive evidence
for my father's business...

389
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,150
until the company's founding anniversary.

390
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,050
I'll find something until that day.

391
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,260
Other than that, we're all done
getting ready for the audit.

392

Everything is up to you now, Ha Na.

393
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,660
I'm just tagging along
with all your preparations.

394
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,400
Great work, everyone.

395
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,930
- Great work.
- Great work.

Hello?

398
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
Yes, I understand.

399
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,110
I have to be somewhere,
so please excuse me.

400
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,020
- Goodbye.
- Yes, sir. Goodbye.

401
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,080
Goodbye.

402
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,500
Hello, I am Lee Du Na's father.

403
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,740
Hello.

404
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:03,080
So, do I just have to keep quiet
that you're Du Na's father?

405
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,780
Yes, please keep it a secret
for just a short while.

406
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,290
I'll do that.

407
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:12,690
I always wondered
why she suddenly passed away...

408
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,390
in that kind of car accident.

409
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,930
Around when she left for the US
with her foster parents,

410
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,430
someone had come for her
at the children's home.

411
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,500
Was it a woman?

412
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,270
Yes.

413
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,570
By any chance, was it her?

414
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,180
I'm not exactly sure.
It happened 20 years ago.

415
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,020
You may not remember right away,

416
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,790
so please call me
if and when you do.

417
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,020
Sure.

418
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:53,260
Was this person
related to Du Na's accident?

419
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,770
That's what I want to find out.

420
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,440

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,480
Are you trying to ruin me for good?

424
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,440
Wasn't ruining my marriage enough?

425
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,850
Do you want the world
to shun me too?

426
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,920
You've gone insane to get revenge.

427
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,380
I put my life into this.

428
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,550
- What?
- You should've taught her better.

429
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,560
I think those that abuse their power
are the most pathetic.

430
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,730
How inferior and anxious
does one have to be...

431
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,730
to abuse their power
to confirm their presence?

432
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,200

433
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,930

Add property damage
on top of everything.

You talk like
you're an attorney or something.

Is this the police?

439
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,880
There's a mom and her daughter
trespassing, damaging my property,

440

- and blackmailing me.
- You.

- Let go of me.

I told you
not to mess with my sister.

00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,560
- Let go of me.
- Get away from her.

446

Why are
these two rude women here again?

448
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,500
Let go of her, woman!

449
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,730
You're a bunch of ignorant punks.

Hey, don't do anything
you'll regret.

451
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,740
That's what you're doing.

452
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,170
As soon as Ha Na adopts Eun Chong,

453
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,040
you two will be the first
to leave Hyesung Group.

454
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,380
Hey, not even in your dreams.

455
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,780
I can't let any of you have...

456
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,920
Hyesung or Eun Chong... No, I won't!

457
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,690
That's not going to happen,

458
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,160
not even over my dead body.

459
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,260
Get out of my house now.

460
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,660
What is this?

461
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,340
Get out of here,
unless you want to leave as a dead body!

462
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,840
- Get out!
- Get out!

463
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,170
- Get out of here!
- Hey!

464
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,340
- Hurry.
- Get out!

- What's with you?
- Go!

466
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,410
Darn it.

467
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:51,180
How dare they come here
and make a scene?

468
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,880
Why were those two rude women here?

469
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,190
I'm sorry, Aunt Yeo Jin.

470
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:00,020
I'm sorry, Yeo Jin.

471
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,390
Things are already hectic at work
because of that external audit,

472
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,000
so why did those videos
get exposed now?

473
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,430
It's suspicious that those were
leaked out just before the audit.

474
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,830
If the external audit team
exposed this,

475
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:12,600
Ms. Yoon's power abuse
might be a part of the audit.

476
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,570
This may call
for an apology to the public.

477
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,010
"An apology to the public?"

478
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,240
Yeo Jin, that's a bit...

479
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,880
The public sentiment
isn't looking great.

480
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:25,020
I'll prepare a video to upload
to Ms. Yoon's social media account,

481
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,650
as well as a letter of apology
on our website.

482
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,820
- Do as she says.
- Okay.

483
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:34,760
We'll go upstairs, then.

484
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,230
Do you still not have information
on the chief auditor?

485
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,000
No, we don't know the name,
the sex, or the age.

486
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,770
Even the audit team
doesn't have the information.

487
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,370
It must be someone
who works for Richard Han.

488
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,610
I made sure they wouldn't find anything
even if they looked,

489
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:54,580
but I wasn't sure
what they were after.

490
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,180
Did Richard Hand find...

491
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:00,150
any weaknesses on you
at the time of Hyesung Tour's disposal?

492
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,090
No.

493
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,220
Then, let's just
keep an eye on them.

494
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,290
I took care of everything
that could be a problem,

495
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,760
and Hyesung Tour has had
a clean book all along.

496
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,500
Hey, Ji Seok.

497
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,070
- Tomorrow's the D-day.
- Yes.

498
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,070
I never expected
to go back to Hyesung Group.

499
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,410
Are you nervous?

500
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,240
A little.

501
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,740
Just stick to what we prepared.

502
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:29,510
Don't forget
that you have me behind you.

503
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,180
I won't.

504
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,980
I'm sure Mom and Dad
will give me their support.

505
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:38,960
Yes, they're probably watching us.

506
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,590
Let's put an end to this,
then go visit them.

507
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,560
Okay.

508
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,530
- And let's visit them with a smile.
- Okay.

509
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:50,130
See you tomorrow.

510
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,210
Gosh, look at that intense red suit.

511
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,510
Who's that?
I think I've seen her before.

512
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,350
Right? She seems familiar.

513
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,020
Why are you here?

514
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
To work.

515
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,520
What business do you have here?

516
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,930
Your suit would
stand out too much at work.

517
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,000
You aren't at a nightclub.

518
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,130
You can still sneer at me
even after your wedding got called off...

519
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,070
for faking your pregnancy?

520
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,910
- Just pull my videos.
- Just press the button.

521
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,420
- You're meeting the chairwoman?
- Yes.

522
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,750
Why would you meet her?

523
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,920

Name: Youngshin Fashion)

525
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:59,330
Youngshin Fashion was
a business I took over?

526
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,170
Yes, you took it over 13 years ago.

527
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,570
The CEO's name was Goo Young Min.

528
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,840
So, Goo Young Min was
the father to the Goo siblings?

529
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,140
Yes, ma'am. Do you remember?

530
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,150
Youngshin Fashion. Goo Young Min.

531
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,420
Please let us keep
just our father's factory.

532
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,390
This is his life's work.

533
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:32,160
Chairwoman Shin. Please hear me out.

534
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,960
Chairwoman Shin!
Please let me talk to you!

535
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,230
- Please.
- Stop it!

536
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,230
Chairwoman Shin!

537
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,840
That boy...

538
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,910
The two siblings
intentionally joined my business...

539
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,780
to get their revenge on me.

540
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,350
What should I do?

541
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,920
Come in.

542
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,830
Why are you here?

543
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,370
Hello.

544
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,710
My name is Goo Ha Na,
and I am here to conduct...

545
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,440
Hyesung Group's audit
as a chief auditor starting today.

546
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,640
"Chief auditor?"

547
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,910
You're the chief auditor?

548
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,820
Yes, nice to meet you.

549
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,610
(Cinderella Game)

550
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,980
This isn't an audit. It's a revenge.

551
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,350
What are you after?

552
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:33,480
A grudge.

553
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,150
What will you do after finding out?

554
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,650
Are you trying to take the business?

555
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,550
You'll soon suffer from revenge too.

556
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,190
Shouldn't you send Eun Chong abroad
as soon as possible?

557
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,160
People began a boycott
for Hyesung Group.

558
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,330
I thought we were on the same side.

559
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,830
Richard Han is
behind the Goo siblings.

560
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,230
She put her life into this revenge,
so she'd do anything.

561
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,270
I'll persuade her or threaten her...

562
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:52,600
to make her stop this revenge.

563
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,500
For now, I'll meet Chairwoman Shin.

564
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,610
Make an appointment.
