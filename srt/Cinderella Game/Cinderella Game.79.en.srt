1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,640
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,240
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,150
(Episode 79)

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,850
It's me, Yeo Jin.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,420
Why are you here?

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,590
Why are you...

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,300
I am Richard Han.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,530
You're Richard Han?

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,140
Yes.

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,440
I can't believe this.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,370
I'm sorry
for not telling you before.

13
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,240
No.

14
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,150
No, you can't be him.

15
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,750
I can explain.

16
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,150
You were the one...

17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,590
who stabbed me in the back
from the shadows?

18
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,560
You were the one
who helped the Goo siblings...

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,590
and attacked me?

20
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,500
- Is this true?
- Yes.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,540
Honey.

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,510
Let go of me.

23
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,180
You...

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:17,380
aren't Yu Jin's dad.
You aren't my husband.

25
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,120
He was such a sweet
and warm-hearted man.

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,420
But you stabbed me in the back...

27
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,990
while I was holding out all alone...

28
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,290
without Yu Jin.

29
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,690
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,970
Let me explain
why I had to become Richard Han.

31
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,030
No.

32
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,370
- I don't want to hear it.
- Please hear me out, Yeo Jin.

33
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,450
Keep it short.

34
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,120
I don't want to sit with you
for too long.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,860
I ended up in America...

36
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:03,130
after I left home
trying to find Yu Jin.

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,530
Then, five years ago,
I met Ji Seok there.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,700
Do you remember
when I came to see you 13 years ago?

39
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,670
A couple who took out a loan
from your financial institute...

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,540
died in a car accident.

41
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:20,380
Ji Seok was their son,

42
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,850
the young student
who clung onto your car...

43
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,350
and desperately begged
in front of their factory.

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,850
He tried to take his life.

45
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,690
He went abroad to America...

46
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,390
out of spite against you to be a success,
but it must've been hard.

47
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,560
He met me...

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,100
just as he was about to give up
and kill himself.

49
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,530
I couldn't turn away...

50
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,470
when I found out about him.
I wanted to save him.

51
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,810
That was why I helped him
and ended up coming here.

52
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,480
What a wonderful love story
written in the stars,

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,810
so much so
that you betrayed your wife.

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,110
I didn't betray you.

55
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,380
I thought I was doing this for you.

56
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,680
I'm your husband,

57
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,660
so I wanted to apologize
and ask them for forgiveness.

58
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:06,090
Apologize? Ask for forgiveness?

59
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,790
You owe those to me.

60
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,530
What did I do so wrong?

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,870
Why are you working
under an alias...

62
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,000
trying to help the victims
of corporate raiding?

63
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,370
And you did this
to write off my sins?

64
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,870
Are you patronizing me?

65
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,640
I thought it was my sin.

66
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,910
Everything happened
because I couldn't stop you.

67
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,010
I wanted to see you change.

68
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,750
So, did you feel lighter
while feigning kindness...

69
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,850
and helping the Goo siblings?

70
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,750
You felt bad for them,

71
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,190
but not me, who lost her daughter
and was abandoned by her husband?

72
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,460
What was on your mind
as you helped them with this revenge?

73
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,830
What were you thinking
while hoping I'd go down?

74
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,460
How is attacking me
something you're doing for me?

75
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,230
You couldn't do this
if you thought of Yu Jin.

76
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,500
No, even if
you thought of Eun Chong.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,040
No, I knew
you wouldn't understand me.

78
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,370
But...

79
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,280
I always felt bad for you.

80
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,850
You're a hypocrite.

81
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,410
Why did you think
I began the corporate raids?

82
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,020
That was the only thing
that kept me going...

83
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,020
after both you and Yu Jin
disappeared from my life.

84
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:11,860
I took those companies with a good reason
and solid procedures.

85
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,960
- People have died!
- I didn't kill them!

86
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:17,730
Why are you blaming me
for their weakness and death?

87
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,800
There were those
who took their own lives,

88
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,530
- but Ji Seok's parents...
- That again?

89
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,600
I didn't do it.
If you have evidence, show me.

90
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
You're the evidence.
It's in your conscience.

91
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,210
Just admit it.

92
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,510
That's the only way
you can start over.

93
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,210
You must think...

94
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,580
I'm the evil one,
and you're the good one.

95
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,250
But you're much more evil
and cruel than me.

96
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,250
You've gone crazy.
You're out of your mind.

97
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,620
Good luck with the Goo siblings.

98
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,260
I'll continue on my own.

99
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,690
You're the only one
who can stop them.

100
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,460
Apologize and step down
from your office as a chairwoman.

101
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,430
Then, I'll make them
stop the revenge.

102
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,970
No, you need to stop helping them
this instant.

103
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,600
You should be stopping them
from this revenge or whatever...

104
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,540
if you were my husband
and Yu Jin's dad.

105
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,040
I can't stop them
if you refuse to change.

106
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,610
Do they know you're my husband?

107
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,710
No.

108
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:11,520
So, you deceived me and them?

109
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,650
You need to consider Eun Chong.

110
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,020
Try to think who'll be in his life
after we're both gone.

111
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,320
You don't deserve
to speak about him.

112
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,130
I was the one
who told you about him.

113
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,160
So what?

114
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,760
Ms. Goo is looking for me.

115
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:30,740
She said she'd need his grandfather
to enter a custody suit.

116
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,140
And? You'll take her side?

117
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:37,740
I don't want to see that happen.

118
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,410
Ms. Goo is like a mother to him.

119
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,050
Why would you fight her?

120
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,720
This wouldn't have happened
if you listened to me and apologized...

121
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,820
- to the siblings 13 years ago.
- Stop bringing that up!

122
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,190
Do you know
why she wants to take Eun Chong?

123
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,790
It's because he's my blood.

124
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,290
She wants to use him
to get her revenge!

125
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,590
No.

126
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,500
You don't believe my words,

127
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,370
but you believe their words?

128
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,470
Yeo Jin, let us
atone for our sins...

129
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,910
and start over.

130
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,510
I want to go back to our old days.

131
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,610
Now?

132
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,480
I want to live...

133
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,950
the rest of our lives
as Eun Chong's grandparents.

134
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,090
I also want to see consolation
between you and Ms. Goo.

135
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,220
That won't happen.

136
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,460
She was Du Na's friend...

137
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,430
and Eun Chong's guardian.

138
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,070
Try to think in their shoes.

139
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,070
She took in her enemy's blood,
the one who killed her parents.

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,470
I didn't kill them!

141
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:43,070
I can just laugh it off
when others talk about me like this.

142
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,950
But I just can't forgive you
for calling me a murderer.

143
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,210
You...

144
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,220
just killed me twice,
even three times.

145
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,650
Did you say you wanted to go back
to the old days?

146
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,020
No.

147
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,390
We can never go back.

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,730
Yeo Jin.

149
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,850
It's nice to get off work with you.

150
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,250
I should walk you to and fro from work
once I become unemployed.

151
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,520
But the unemployed are
always the busiest.

152
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,230
Isn't that the chairwoman?

153
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,600
- Ms. Chairwoman.
- Yeo Jin!

154
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,850
Wait. My gosh.

155
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,220
- Is he...
- He's the chairwoman's husband.

156
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,190
He's her husband?

157
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,030
I'm going in first.

158
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,140
Ha Na, where's Eun Chong?

159
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,440
Mr. Han, please stay home
and call me if he comes.

160
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
Okay.

161
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:33,120
The man who lives in Ha Na's place
is the chairwoman's husband?

162
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,360
The wedding and power abuse videos
have been taken down.

163
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,430
Did Ji Seok pull them?

164
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,860
Probably.

165
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,400
Should I just leave up
the petition for my dismissal?

166
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,970
I'll quit anyway
before I go abroad to study.

167
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,000
But a dismissal
won't make you look good.

168
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,610
Give it time.

169
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,980
Anyway, Ji Seok may end up
taking Hyesung,

170
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,510
so do I have to go abroad?

171
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,450
Will you keep seeing him?

172
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,850
I need to hold onto him
to get Hyesung.

173
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,050
All right.
You're done with Jin Goo anyway.

174
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:14,630
We'll take anyone's hand
if that's what it takes to get Hyesung.

175
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:18,100
- Let's keep an eye on it and wait.
- Okay.

176
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,130
You're back, Yeo Jin.

177
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,470
You're back, Aunt Yeo Jin.

178
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,070
How did your meeting
with Richard Han go?

179
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,070
What's he like?

180
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,220
Did something happen?

181
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,020
She doesn't look so well.

182
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,490
I don't think the meeting went well.

183
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,920
Will he continue to help
the Goo siblings get revenge?

184
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,230
As you expected,
she wouldn't admit it.

185
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,430
We have to make her pay
for what she did.

186
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:57,470
I wanted to think of Eun Chong
and avoid the worst.

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,210
I wanted to stop this
from becoming more tragic.

188
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,410
She doesn't deserve
to be his grandmother, either.

189
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,480
I'll try to put
more pressure on her...

190
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,280
at the audit tomorrow.

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,760
Why did they meet outside
instead of going home?

192
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,460
- They didn't look so happy.
- No, right?

193
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,700
There are instances where couples
drift apart after losing a child.

194
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,300
But still, he spent 20 years away.

195
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,570
The chairwoman
must've been hurt more deeply...

196
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:38,810
because of her husband,
not just her daughter.

197
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,040
Probably.

198
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,310
They had
the best kind of relationship,

199
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,150
so Myung Ji was always jealous.

200
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:48,190
She said they made her
feel sour as a widow.

201
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:52,620
Why does he live at Ha Na's place
without telling the chairwoman?

202
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,560
Is it because of Eun Chong?

203
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,130
I didn't betray you. I thought...

204
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,440
I was doing this for you.

205
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,770
I'm your husband,

206
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,970
so I wanted to apologize
and ask them for forgiveness.

207
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,010
I thought it was my sin.

208
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,250
Everything happened
because I couldn't stop you.

209
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,420
I wanted to see you change.

210
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,920
You should've
looked after me first...

211
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,990
if you were really my husband.

212
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,270
Chairwoman Shin is
refusing to show up to the audit?

213
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,870
What's the reason?

214
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,770
I understand.

215
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,410
Chairwoman Shin refused to be
at the audit.

216
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,280
But she didn't say anything
until yesterday.

217
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,190
Did she change her mind
after meeting Mr. Han?

218
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,420
Avoiding the audit
won't end everything.

219
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,860
It's Chairwoman Shin.

220
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,300
- Hello?
- It's me, Shin Yeo Jin.

221
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,700
I wanted to meet you
and Ms. Goo today.

222
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,470
All right. Sure.

223
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
She wants to meet us.

224
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,450
Does she want to talk
instead of the interview?

225
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,860
What do you think you're doing?

226
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,560
Three. Fight until the end.

227
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,870
I'll never give
Eun Chong to you, either.

228
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,800
I'll take him from you.

229
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,640
Ms. Goo is looking for me.

230
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,710
She said she'd need his grandfather
to enter a custody suit.

231
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,450
I won't let you take Eun Chong.

232
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,090
Yeo Jin, Ms. Jang said
the stock prices went back up,

233
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,590
and we began to patch up
the problem with the hotel, too.

234
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,760
Yes.

235
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,530
So, about Se Young...

236
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,690
How long will the preparation take
to go abroad? Do it quickly.

237
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,870
Right. They'll need
at least two months starting today.

238
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,700
An English tutor will come
starting today,

239
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,200
and he applied for a passport.

240
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,240
Se Young can work
until the founding anniversary...

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,310
and start preparing after that.

242
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,540
Okay.

243
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,810
I heard things didn't go well
with Richard Han.

244
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:31,950
What was his relationship
with the Goo siblings?

245
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,920
- Why is he helping them?
- I don't know.

246
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,190
How did he make that much money?

247
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,790
I don't know.

248
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,860
What did they talk about?
She doesn't know anything.

249
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,570
This is the breakdown...

250
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,370
of your corporate card
for the last three months.

251
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,340
You also used the company car
quite often.

252
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,040
There's a problem with the items
directly irrelevant to your job.

253
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,480
Do you agree?

254
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:03,380
Yes, I do.

255
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,780
Were those used
by the fake daughter project?

256
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,450
Yes.

257
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,820
You've appropriated
the company fund.

258
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,360
Was it done
under the chairwoman's order?

259
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,030
If you refuse to answer,

260
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,200
I must decide based on other evidence
and circumstances.

261
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,100
It was me.

262
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,100
You don't have to take the blame
for everything.

263
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,340
Did you do...

264
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,180
the fake daughter scheme reluctantly
because the chairwoman made you?

265
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,110
At first, I was against it,

266
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,880
but I volunteered to do it.

267
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,120
So, you made a voluntary decision...

268
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,620
to do this?

269
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,190
Yes.

270
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,690
Why did you do that?

271
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,330
Because of your loyalty
to the chairwoman?

272
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,470
Did you wish to stay loyal to her
and trust her that much...

273
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,640
to deceive and toy
with someone else's life?

274
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,740
I wanted her...

275
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,410
to have a mother.

276
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,610
A mother
who would love her, adore her,

277
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,380
and take her side.

278
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,390
She lost her parents as a child,

279
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,660
then became an orphan,
a foster child,

280
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,630
a breadwinner,
and even Eun Chong's foster mother.

281
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,930
She lived her life as a guardian
to her siblings and Eun Chong,

282
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,770
so I wanted her to know
what it was like...

283
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:37,410
to be protected
and to live that life.

284
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,340
I believed...

285
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,880
the chairwoman would be like that.

286
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,580
However,

287
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,250
everything was
my arrogance and misjudgment.

288
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,800
Did you pity her?

289
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,400
No.

290
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,940
I wanted her to be happy.

291
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:20,480
I want you to be really happy,

292
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,950
more than anyone in this world.

293
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,530
Have you considered...

294
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,570
how much she would be hurt
when the truth...

295
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,200
eventually came forward?

296
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,410
Have you?

297
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,610
That was...

298
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,680
what I feared the most.

299
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,380
I was afraid she'd be hurt...

300
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,850
and become miserable.

301
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,360
If you could go back in time...

302
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:05,400
and choose what you'd do
about the fake daughter project,

303
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,870
what would you do?

304
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,870
There's only one thing
I want to change...

305
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,610
if I could go back in time.

306
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,040
I want to notice my feelings
much faster.

307
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,480
And I'd be honest with her...

308
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,880
about the lies I told...

309
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:29,390
and my feelings.

310
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
That's all for today.

311
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,110
I want to apologize to her
for the rest of my life,

312
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,680
right by her side.

313
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,930
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

314
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,370
The interview is over.
You may leave.

315
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,980
How far will you take your revenge?

316
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,250
What do you want from this?

317
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,920
Do you want to tell me
to stop this revenge?

318
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,390
Have you had a talk
with the chairwoman?

319
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,790
Why don't you try
talking to her some more?

320
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,260
You've associated
with her for 20 years,

321
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,730
yet you know nothing about her.

322
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:49,130
You're right. I recently realized...

323
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,300
I didn't know much about her.

324
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,870
You seem to know nothing.

325
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,010
Do you want to know...

326
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,180
what she's really like?

327
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,380
Do you want me to show you...

328
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,750
her true nature?

329
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,650
I'll text you later. Be there.

330
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,730
I was surprised...

331
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,600
you wanted to see us outside
after refusing to come to the audit.

332
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,130
I'm sure you have a reason
for calling out both of us.

333
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,970
I remember Youngshin Fashion.

334
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,110
Mr. Goo, you were
still in high school, right?

335
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,680
That boy who stood in pouring rain
in front of the factory,

336
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,780
begging me to save the business.

337
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,180
Yes, but you didn't even
look my way...

338
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,690
and left coldly.

339
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:45,720
That young boy grew up
and came to stab me in the back.

340
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,760
Should I say it's nice to meet you?

341
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,790
You wish to attack me
with a big player...

342
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,660
- like Richard Han behind you?
- Yes.

343
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:57,630
Would things have changed
if I showed you mercy back then?

344
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:01,100
I could've shown a favor
to my future attacker.

345
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,540
So, I do not regret
what happened in the past.

346
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:08,810
Everything about your father's business
ended 13 years ago.

347
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,380
You wouldn't find anything
even if you looked.

348
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,150
Legal and financial problems
still stand,

349
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,850
the ones from the process of defaulting
the business.

350
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,120
We have enough evidence
and witness testimonies, too.

351
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,460
I can show you
if you need to see it.

352
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,290
Those aren't decisive evidence.

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,630
Everything you're doing is illegal.

354
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,400
How can someone like you
be the chief auditor?

355
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,940
Why do you question Hyesung Group
for what Hyesung Finance did?

356
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,810
Hyesung Finance and Hyesung Group...

357
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,840
share the same chairwoman and board.

358
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,410
And it's also important
to figure out...

359
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,780
how big of an impact
my father's business made...

360
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,250
on Hyesung Group's finances
when it defaulted...

361
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,750
You still seemed to use
the same method you used back then.

362
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:53,720
Bring decisive evidence
if you want to take me down.

363
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,790
If we show that to you,

364
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,330
will you admit to everything
right away?

365
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,830
I'd be greatly disappointed
if you refused to do it even then.

366
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,100
Promise to admit it right away.

367
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,470
You won't find anything,

368
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,870
so why should I make that promise?

369
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,910
How was your meeting
with Richard Han yesterday?

370
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,880
It seemed like he also wanted
to convince you to admit to your sins.

371
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,790
He seemed quite disappointed
with your refusal.

372
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,120
You two are so gullible.

373
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,360
You were deceived by me,

374
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,330
and you were deceived
by Richard Han.

375
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,860
"Deceived?"

376
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,970
How was I deceived?

377
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,130
You'll find out later.

378
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,540
The chairwoman met with Richard Han?

379
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,340
That man yesterday,
her husband, was Richard Han?

380
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,010
Mr. Han seemed
to want to show you mercy,

381
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,880
- but he said he couldn't talk...
- "Mercy?"

382
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,420
You should've done your research
before you began this revenge.

383
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,860
It was already unfair
to get called a corporate raider,

384
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,090
but you also made me a murderer.

385
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,530
"Murderer?"

386
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,200
You intentionally caused...

387
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,330
my parents' car accident.

388
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,640
Did you see it?

389
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,070
The police investigated
and ended it as a car accident.

390
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,840
How dare you accuse me
without any evidence?

391
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,710
He even said
he'd meet with her the day after,

392
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,680
but the accident broke out
on that day.

393
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,220
There was a dash cam in his car,

394
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,690
but it was gone
when the investigation began.

395
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,290
But I found a partial backup while
cleaning up the company's server.

396
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,390
The video was damaged,
but you can hear his voice.

397
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,660
Take a listen.

398
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,530
What's wrong with the brakes?

399
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,030
Why are the brakes...

400
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,000
After the accident, the contract
he was to sign...

401
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,470
with the international company
disappeared, too.

402
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:53,240
When that contract got called off,
you took Dad's business over...

403
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,350
at a giveaway price.

404
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,520
How is this evidence?

405
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,120
How can I believe his words?

406
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,320
We can nitpick over that in court.

407
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,360
I even have testimony...

408
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,360
that you colluded with the police
to end the investigation.

409
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,000
Sure. I'll see you in court.

410
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,100
We aren't done yet. Sit down.

411
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,500
What's not done?

412
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,040
If you interfere with the audit
or refuse to cooperate,

413
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,770
you may be subject
to disciplinary action.

414
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,710
- This isn't the audit.
- I recorded everything you said.

415
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,850
Who are you to call this an audit?

416
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,980
So, why did you avoid it?

417
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,190
"Avoid it?" I refused to go
because it was unnecessary.

418
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,620
If you continue to do this,

419
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,360
you'll pay dearly.

420
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,360
Soon, we'll find out...

421
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,660
who'll really pay dearly.

422
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,260
You've become blinded with revenge
and can't even make sound judgment.

423
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,630
Listen up.

424
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,470
Your father is the reason
why his business failed.

425
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,140
You'll regret those words...

426
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,840
for a very long time.

427
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,480
Just wait.

428
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,220
I'll make you pay...

429
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,680
for every tear of blood
my family shed.

430
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,590
Shut it
if you do not have crucial evidence.

431
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:27,240
Did the chairwoman
really do that to Ha Na's parents?

432
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,780
You two are so gullible.

433
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,990
You were deceived by me,

434
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:45,260
and you were deceived
by Richard Han.

435
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,260
I get that she deceived Ha Na,

436
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,560
but why did she say
Mr. Han was deceiving me?

437
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,310
Did you pull my videos of power abuse
and the wedding hall?

438
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,080
Yes, I even paid people
to write comments. Do you like it?

439
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,910
You paid people to do that?

440
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,920
People seemed happy,
so I thought my sincerity came through.

441
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,850
Great job, anyway.

442
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,460
You'll be disciplined
with a pay cut for three months.

443
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,920
That sounds reasonable.

444
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,460
When are we going to meet?

445
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:28,270
I wanted to ask you to dinner,
but I guess you haven't heard.

446
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,870
- What?
- Chairwoman Shin refuses...

447
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:34,170
to attend the audit,
so the board is about to dump her.

448
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,170
What?

449
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,770
Yeo Jin did that?

450
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,880
There's a word going around
about how she embezzled...

451
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,850
the company fund
to make Ha Na her fake daughter.

452
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,250
Did Jin Goo testify and say
Yeo Jin made him do everything?

453
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,420
No idea.

454
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,250
But if the fake daughter project
came into the light,

455
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,060
wouldn't it also expose Eun Chong?

456
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,060
Yes, but she can't let people
find out about him yet.

457
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,500
Things just became very urgent
for Yeo Jin.

458
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,300
Eun Chong,
can you introduce yourself?

459
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,000
Hello, my name is Eun Chong.

460
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,480
I, eight years old.

461
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,210
What's your hobby?

462
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,880
My hobby is
playing with Auntie Ha Na.

463
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,780
Great job.

464
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,820
Take a look at this.

465
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,650
This one.

466
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,260
I just need to send Eun Chong abroad
to study...

467
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,430
and quietly end the investigation
on the fake daughter project...

468
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,590
to make sure he isn't exposed.

469
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,500
How can I shut down the investigation?

470
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:43,110
Eun Chong loves studying English.

471
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,710
Keep their move abroad confidential.

472
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,150
Make Se Young go to work
until the day before she leaves.

473
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,450
Okay.

474
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,750
Do you have a plan
for refusing to attend the audit?

475
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,090
Shouldn't you
throw Jin Goo under the bus?

476
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,660
(Travel Service Department
General Manager Hwang Jin Goo)

477
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,660
The chairwoman is the one...

478
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,400
who can break this vicious cycle
between the two families.

479
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,830
She must admit to her crimes
and apologize before it's too late.

480
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Did her husband
become Richard Han...

481
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,940
and began to help Ha Na's family...

482
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,780
to atone for the chairwoman's sin?

483
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,690
Hello, my name is Hwang Jin Goo.

484
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,420
You must be Richard Han...

485
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,430
and Eun Chong's grandfather.

486
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,440
How did you know about me?

487
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,340
I saw you meeting the chairwoman yesterday
by chance.

488
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,610
Then, I also heard she met
with Richard Han.

489
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,250
Ha Na's family doesn't know
I am Eun Chong's grandfather.

490
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:01,120
Can you keep it a secret?

491
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,850
Before I answer that, may I ask...

492
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,990
why you've become Richard Han
to help her family?

493
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,570
So, that was the story and the connection
behind everything.

494
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,070
I heard Yeo Jin
relies greatly on you, Mr. Hwang.

495
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,310
Please stay by her side.

496
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,580
She's a lonely woman.

497
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,560
So, she must've been
addicted to work...

498
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,360
without realizing
what she was doing.

499
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,030
No one
will be able to control her...

500
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,430
if you leave her side.

501
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:51,030
Then, her condition
will only become worse.

502
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,600
I don't think I can control her.

503
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,470
You're probably a better candidate.

504
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,840
I'm not going to see her.

505
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,410
I'm a sinner to her.

506
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,450
But still, don't give up
and continue to stay close.

507
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,120
I heard you love her very much.

508
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,150
She'd scoff if she heard that.

509
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,620
It seemed like
Ha Na would take this to the end.

510
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:13,990
What's your plan?

511
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,960
I will stop if she steps down
and apologizes to her victims.

512
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,760
But she's unable to do that.

513
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,570
The situation seemed serious
with the board.

514
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,740
You need a scapegoat, ma'am.

515
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,080
Only Jin Goo can do that.

516
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,050
Yes, ma'am.

517
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,180
He has become distant lately,

518
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,820
so I'm not sure if he'll listen.

519
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,060
Reach out to Ms. Sim.

520
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,770
The chairwoman
doesn't listen to anybody.

521
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,410
Will she really change her mind
if I try to persuade her?

522
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,810
Hey, Mom.

523
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,320
The chairwoman asked me
to stop by her house briefly.

524
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,750
Is something going on?

525
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,190
No. Did she say anything?

526
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,620
No, she just asked me to come.

527
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,360
All right.
I'll find out once I'm there.

528
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,760
I'll go pick you up.

529
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,760
Bye.

530
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:31,530
Why does she want to see my mom?

531
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,070
What do you mean?

532
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,640
Jin Goo is trying to leave me,

533
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,180
so can you make him stay?

534
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,120
You already know
he's like my own son, right?

535
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,950
And he also thinks of me
as his second mother...

536
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,790
who gave him his heart.

537
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:56,330
Of course, no words can describe
how grateful we are for you.

538
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:00,000
I gave him my full support
to this day,

539
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,930
just like I would to my son.

540
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,740
So, I felt betrayed
when he said he'd leave me...

541
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,170
when I was the most troubled.

542
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,440
Betrayal? Not at all.
That's far from the truth.

543
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,740
Of course not.

544
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,610
He wouldn't do that.

545
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,210
No.

546
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,520
Then, can you talk to him...

547
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,850
and tell him to stay by my side?

548
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,750
Both you and Jin Goo said...

549
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,520
you'd pay back my kindness
for the rest of your lives.

550
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,130
I hope those weren't
just empty words.

551
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,360
Of course not.

552
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,730
Jin Goo wouldn't be here today
if it hadn't been for you.

553
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,900
You gave him birth,

554
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,870
but I kept him alive until now.

555
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,510
Can you promise me...

556
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,540
that you'll make him stay
by my side?

557
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:52,950
You owe me that much.

558
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,080
You must repay me
for my kindness, Ms. Sim.

559
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,490
What did you just say to my mother?

560
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,030
- Jin Goo.
- Mom, you need to leave.

561
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:13,100
- You may leave.
- Okay.

562
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,150
If you have anything to say,
you can talk to me.

563
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,150
Stop blackmailing my mom.

564
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,250
- "Blackmailing?"
- What do you want?

565
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,950
Your protection.

566
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,390
You need to save me,
just as how I saved you.

567
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,930
Eun Chong will be exposed
if the public finds out...

568
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,590
about the fake daughter project.

569
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,760
I need you...

570
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,130
to take responsibility
for appropriating company funds.

571
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,940
That's how you can save
me and Eun Chong.

572
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,630
(Cinderella Game)

573
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:50,700
Will you cut ties with Mr. Hwang?

574
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,770
I'm glad I got a good use out of him
in the most adequate timing.

575
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:56,140
The chairwoman and I
have become estranged from now on.

576
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,940
After all,
did this only hurt Hwang Jin Goo?

577
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,680
- Right?
- I know everything now.

578
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,410
I can't turn
a blind eye to it forever.

579
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,980
- Have you seen this woman?
- Yes.

580
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,250
- Are you sure?
- She visited the children's home...

581
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:08,020
around when Du Na was adopted
and emigrated to America.

582
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:10,190
I'll help with your revenge.

583
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,990
Thank you for making
such a tough decision.
