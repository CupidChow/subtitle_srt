1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,009
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,179
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,919
(Episode 37)

5
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:16,960
You like the president, don't you?

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:18,890
Answer me.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,960
I don't covet after what isn't mine.

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,699
How dare you try to play smart
and dodge the question?

9
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,129
I asked...

10
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,829
if you liked the president.

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:34,170
You like him, but he isn't yours,
so you won't covet after him?

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:36,469
Do you want me to like him?

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,179
- What?
- If not, why do you keep saying it?

14
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,179
So what if I do like him?

15
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:45,179
Will you use that
as an excuse to fire me?

16
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,789
Or will you break off
your engagement...

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:48,950
How dare you grab me?

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,789
What are you doing, Ms. Yoon?

19
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,069
Are you all right?

20
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:07,969
No.

21
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,409
You should get yourself together.

22
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:11,640
Ms. Yoon, come to my office.

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,469
Ha Na, what happened in there?

24
00:01:39,769 --> 00:01:42,340
It's not even your birthday.
What's going on?

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,079
Did you get a boyfriend?

26
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,510
You got a flower basket and sweets.

27
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,920
My beloved daughter,
have a wonderful day.

28
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,719
From Mom.

29
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,189
Who's it from?

30
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,670
Right. You should have some.

31
00:02:07,769 --> 00:02:10,099
- Thanks, Ha Na.
- Thank you.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:13,400
Hey, that's a Shine bracelet.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,610
- Is that the real one?
- No.

34
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,439
It's not easy to get sweets
from this place these days.

35
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,479
Someone who likes you a lot
must've sent these.

36
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,120
It's not your business, Jin Goo.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,620
An employee hit another employee
in my office,

38
00:02:27,789 --> 00:02:28,990
yet it's not my business?

39
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,719
I'm with the hotel now.

40
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,419
Then, should I report this
to Director Goo?

41
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,430
Must I tell him you also hit Ms. Goo,
just like your mom?

42
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:38,060
You did this again
after that recent event.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,099
She has the rudest way of talking!

44
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,969
You already know how sensitive I am
because of Yu Jin.

45
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:45,800
What and how did she
talk rudely to you?

46
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,870
She said we should
break off our engagement...

47
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,409
The more I think about it,
the angrier I am.

48
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:52,139
- "Break off our engagement?"
- Yes.

49
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,879
She said we should break off
our engagement, so I lost it.

50
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,120
Pretend like you didn't hear this.

51
00:02:57,419 --> 00:02:58,680
This is between her and me.

52
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,189
Why would she say
we should break off our engagement?

53
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:05,520
- Tell me about it.
- But you still can't hit her.

54
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,560
This was the second time.
It's becoming a habit.

55
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,430
Yes, let's say
I was wrong for slapping her.

56
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,860
But I thought
I made myself clear to you.

57
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:15,469
You're to take my side
even when I'm wrong and she's right.

58
00:03:15,469 --> 00:03:17,500
How can I side with the perpetrator
in this situation?

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,870
I don't care what the reason is,
but you have to take my side!

60
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,879
Se Young, please try
to get along with Ha Na.

61
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,610
Why are you telling me
to get along with that nobody?

62
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,110
She's Yu Jin, Se Young.

63
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,379
Anyway, apologize to her,

64
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,389
and don't get into a habit
of hitting someone.

65
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,789
I won't forgive you
if you do something like this again.

66
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,889
- "Forgive?"
- I won't condone violence...

67
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:42,860
from a woman
I'll spend my life with.

68
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,830
I also won't condone
the man I'll spend my life with...

69
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:50,639
always taking another woman's side
instead of mine.

70
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:54,340
Do not dare
take her side again instead of mine.

71
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,409
When that happens,
I really won't forgive you.

72
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,919
All right. We'll both work this out.

73
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,590
- Apologize to Ms. Goo.
- That's my business.

74
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,689
So, you won't apologize?

75
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,189
That depends on what Goo Ha Na does.

76
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,529
Tell her to come in.

77
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,709
Where's Goo Ha Na?

78
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,750
She must've gone to the restroom.

79
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,850
- What the heck is this?
- It came for Ms. Goo.

80
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,050
Who would send something like this?

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,649
She must be dating someone.

82
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,389
I saw her
with a new Shine bracelet, too.

83
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,490
But she said it wasn't the real one.

84
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,730
That's what I expect
from a nobody like her.

85
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:51,959
I left your favorite sweets
on your desk.

86
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,769
You should have a sweet snack.

87
00:04:55,899 --> 00:04:57,339
I love this.

88
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,139
Where did you get it?

89
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,970
It was from Ms. Goo.

90
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,339
What?

91
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,750
Why are you telling me this now?
Something weird may be in here!

92
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,980
Darn it!

93
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:17,459
She threw out that delicious snack?

94
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,290
It's not easy to come across.

95
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,290
I shouldn't have left it there.

96
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,490
The flowers are so beautiful.

97
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,629
Thank you for the sweets...

98
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,000
I don't have to say that, do I?

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,069
Of course not.
You'd get tired of saying that...

100
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,310
if you wanted to say it every time.

101
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,439
- Are you going to stay home?
- No, I'm going out.

102
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,379
I'll leave
after your furniture arrives.

103
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,819
I hope you like it.

104
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:45,250
Thank...

105
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,660
No, I look forward to it, Mom.

106
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,560
"Mom?" Is that her birth mother?

107
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,029
Eun Chong must be
at the kindergarten.

108
00:05:59,029 --> 00:06:02,129
Yes, he put on his new clothes
and went there in joy.

109
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:04,639
He told everyone that
his bestie granny bought it for him.

110
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,000
I see.

111
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,240
"Eun Chong?"

112
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,240
Her nephew?

113
00:06:12,579 --> 00:06:15,779
Well, Mom. I have to go now.

114
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:18,120
All right. Have a great day.

115
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,250
You, too, Mom.

116
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:21,490
Okay. Goodbye.

117
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:28,329
You looked really stressed out
when your birth mother first appeared.

118
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,290
You two must get along well now.

119
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,129
Did your birth mother
buy that for you?

120
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,370
How awful of her
to buy you a knockoff bracelet...

121
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,800
to celebrate your reunion
after a few decades.

122
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,170
It's an authentic one.

123
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,040
You don't have the real one,
so you won't be able to tell.

124
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,279
It obviously looks fake.

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,449
This Shine bracelet...
Ha Na, may I try this on?

126
00:06:54,819 --> 00:06:57,459
I want to see how different it is
from the knockoff I have.

127
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,430
You mentioned breaking off
my engagement on purpose...

128
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,259
to make me slap you, right?

129
00:07:05,899 --> 00:07:07,370
Apologize for providing the reason.

130
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,899
Then, I may even consider
apologizing for slapping you.

131
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,500
Please don't. I won't accept it.

132
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,569
You won't?

133
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,980
Who do you think you are to say
you won't accept my apology?

134
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,680
So what if you glare at me?

135
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,050
Does this feel unfair?

136
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,079
Then, go ahead and slap me, too.

137
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:27,819
But you don't have the guts
to do that.

138
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,889
No, I don't have
the guts to do that,

139
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:33,360
and I don't want that kind of guts.

140
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,329
You're such an expert
at pathetically staying patient.

141
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,930
How long will you stay patient?

142
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,569
I'll stay patient only until today.

143
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,569
That's great to hear.

144
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,939
I look forward to finding out
what will happen.

145
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,269
I also look forward to finding out
what will happen...

146
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,610
when I run out of patience.

147
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I'll pay you back
with the interest...

148
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,519
for putting up with you all along
instead of slapping you once now.

149
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,319
What kind of a face will you make
when you find out I'm Yoon Yu Jin?

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,189
Please excuse me
if you're done talking.

151
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,230
What on earth
makes her so confident?

152
00:08:14,269 --> 00:08:16,269
Did her self-worth skyrocket...

153
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:18,139
because she found her mother?

154
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,769
I have no excuses to make
as the president.

155
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,709
I promised
I'd protect my staff members,

156
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,480
but I always
found myself apologizing.

157
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:29,949
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,350
Did Ms. Yoon apologize?

159
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,490
No.

160
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,190
So, what's going on?

161
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,519
She said it was because you said
we should break off our engagement.

162
00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:43,129
Why did you say that?

163
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,860
I shouldn't have said that.

164
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:48,330
Ms. Yoon thinks...

165
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,139
I have feelings for you.

166
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:57,039
She took things the wrong way
and crossed the line.

167
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,279
I said no, but she kept going at it,
so I blurted that out.

168
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:05,820
I didn't mean anything by that.
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:07,179 --> 00:09:09,090
You should be angry
at unfair incidents,

170
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,120
such as what her mom did to you.

171
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,789
Yes, I won't stay patient
from now on.

172
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:19,259
Frankly, I hope to see you
and Ms. Yoon get along well.

173
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:24,039
We'll probably do that
once I move into the chairwoman's place.

174
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:27,870
Are you all ready to go?

175
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,139
She told me not to bring anything,
so I had nothing to prepare.

176
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,710
She's really good to me.

177
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,179
We talk on the phone every day.

178
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:36,649
Yesterday, I went
to the department store,

179
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,590
and today, she sent a flower basket
and sweets to the office.

180
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,850
She did?

181
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,320
I felt much better thanks to my mom.

182
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:47,929
It's nice to have a mom.

183
00:09:48,429 --> 00:09:51,659
It feels like someone is
protecting me by my side.

184
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm glad to hear that, too.

185
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,299
Right.
Have you talked to Director Goo?

186
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,899
Yes.

187
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,509
For now, I decided to do
as he suggested.

188
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,740
Going on our way.

189
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,009
Things will change over time.

190
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,750
It wouldn't be easy to break off
people who were once family.

191
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:23,360
Hopscotch was a fresh idea
for the list of activities.

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,960
Anyway, apologize to her,

193
00:10:27,429 --> 00:10:29,029
and don't get into a habit
of hitting someone.

194
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:32,840
I won't forgive you
if you do something like this again.

195
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,769
How dare a servant like you say
you won't forgive me?

196
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,710
And there are activities...

197
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,610
such as Red Light, Green Light,
something tourists will love.

198
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,519
Ms. Yoon, do you have a habit
of getting distracted in meetings?

199
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,620
I'm sorry.

200
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,120
You must feel at ease around me.

201
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,519
You don't seem nervous at all.

202
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:55,590
I get that
you can't focus at work...

203
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,289
because Chairwoman Shin
found her daughter, but...

204
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,559
Do you know anything
about Yoon Yu Jin?

205
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,899
Tell me what you know.

206
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,230
So, you have no idea.

207
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,169
- Do you know anything?
- I can't tell you for free.

208
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:07,870
What do you want?

209
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,870
You still don't know?

210
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,240
I made myself clear many times.

211
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,179
Was that why you called me
a poor woman?

212
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:17,950
Because Yoon Yu Jin is
now in the picture?

213
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:19,879
What do you want to know?

214
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,649
- What does she do?
- She's an office worker.

215
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:24,519
- Where at?
- If I tell you where,

216
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,190
are you going to do
a background check?

217
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:28,789
Are you going to stop her
from turning up?

218
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,059
You should rather
reconsider my offer.

219
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:36,669
Hwang Jin Goo will be useless soon,
and you'll regret holding onto him.

220
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,740
Are you sure
you can take Hyesung Group over?

221
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,179
See for yourself, starting now.

222
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,610
Hojin Rent-A-Car
also canceled the contract.

223
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,620
And Yoon Restaurant.

224
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,120
And Sinjeong Bus Company.

225
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,350
Are they all in collusion?
Why are they all doing this?

226
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,419
Hello, sir. It's Goo Ha Na
of Hyesung Tour calling.

227
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,059
Why are you canceling the contract?
Is something going on?

228
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,730
Hello, I am Lee Soo Jung
of Hyesung Tour...

229
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,330
Hello?

230
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,299
- Why did they hang up?
- They won't pick up.

231
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:08,600
Sir, Yoon Restaurant,
Sinjeong Bus Company,

232
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,240
and Hojin Rent-A-Car
all canceled their contract with us.

233
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,840
Call them immediately.

234
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,210
- No one will pick up.
- Let's go to their office.

235
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:18,009
Mr. Yoon, go to the hotel.
Ms. Lee and Ms. Kim, the restaurant.

236
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,809
- Ms. Goo...
- One moment, Mr. Hwang.

237
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,210
President Kim, I'll be there now.

238
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,580
Let's talk in person.

239
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,620
Please don't go anywhere. Okay.

240
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,690
I got a meeting with the president
of Hojin Rent-A-Car.

241
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:30,889
I'll go with you.

242
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,590
Something doesn't seem right.

243
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,460
We only got a piece of fax
when Hyesung Hotel canceled with us.

244
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:37,700
It was a notice.

245
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,429
Ji Seok,
is this your way of showing me?

246
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,639
I heard you couldn't accept Ha Na
was Chairwoman Shin's daughter.

247
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,269
I decided to accept it.

248
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,039
Then, what about your sister?

249
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,610
We've cut our ties.

250
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,809
Ji Seok.

251
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,279
Why don't you
tell your sister the truth,

252
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,549
accept an apology
from Chairwoman Shin,

253
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:05,490
and stop your revenge here?

254
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,460
No, that's impossible.

255
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:10,830
It's all right to stop here.

256
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,299
Your parents won't return
even if you get their revenge.

257
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,100
If Chairwoman Shin apologizes,

258
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,840
she'll be doing it to thank us
for raising her daughter.

259
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:21,470
She wouldn't apologize
for her actual sin,

260
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,940
trampling all over our family.

261
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,580
I'll remind her of her sin
in my own way.

262
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:31,980
Chairwoman Shin may
get suspicious of you...

263
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,750
if you cut ties with your sister
because of who her mother is.

264
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,690
She'll try to find out
if I hold a grudge against her.

265
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,960
If you continue this,
you'll be Ha Na's enemy, too.

266
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,759
If she is
Chairwoman Shin's daughter,

267
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,000
she'll have to pay the price, too.

268
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,360
The revenge may end up hurting you.

269
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,870
Will you be okay to see your sister
and your younger siblings get hurt?

270
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,409
Mr. Han,
I already died once in America.

271
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,580
When I gave up on everything
and fell into despair,

272
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:00,779
you gave me the will to go on,

273
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,679
and you gave me hope
to restart my revenge.

274
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,850
I risked my life to be here today.

275
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:12,120
I can't give up twice. No.

276
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,690
I won't.

277
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,899
- Ji Seok.
- Mr. Han, a bit of support is...

278
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,269
all I need from you, just like now.

279
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,940
(Out of office)

280
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,940
- The phone is turned off.
- We had a meeting.

281
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,240
How could we get stood up?

282
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,340
Please leave a message...

283
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,509
The phone was turned off.

284
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:36,750
- Let me try.
- It's off. No one can pick up.

285
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:41,519
We got turned down by the restaurant
and the bus company, too.

286
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:43,549
Should we wait here?

287
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:51,259
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message after the tone.

288
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:53,559
You will be charged after the tone.

289
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,830
Let's go.
No one will come here today.

290
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:58,669
I'll come by tomorrow.

291
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,940
Okay.

292
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,039
Are you okay?

293
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,009
Gosh, yes.

294
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,549
I'll do it.

295
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,720
(Hyesung Group, Danny Jung)

296
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,629
Why is the business card
for Mr. Goo's assistant here?

297
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:31,340
I'm sorry. You had to pick up trash
because of me.

298
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,870
It's cold, and I'm hungry, too.

299
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,620
I guess I'm out of luck now.

300
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:52,759
Did I use all my luck
in finding my birth mother?

301
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,830
- You can take my luck.
- No.

302
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,629
You're the one who needs
the most luck right now.

303
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,200
I'll seize my own luck.

304
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:07,870
See?

305
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:10,870
This reminds me
of the Hyesung Hotel incident.

306
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:14,240
You and I put up
a tough fight on that day.

307
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:16,649
Things went well back then, though.

308
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,120
Not today.

309
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,350
By any chance,
was it Head Director Goo?

310
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,820
I don't know.

311
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,690
I'll try to reach Hassan, too.

312
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:33,129
What if Mr. Goo turns out
to be the mastermind?

313
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,029
I'll think about it
if that moment comes.

314
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,470
Finding the truth is
our priority right now.

315
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:44,269
What am I going to do if Ji Seok...

316
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:47,009
and the chairwoman
become serious enemies?

317
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:51,580
I'll give you the information
once that brat comes in,

318
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,889
so run a background check
and get her bank account history.

319
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,549
She must be some fraud...

320
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,919
who smelled money on Yeo Jin
and tried to deceive her.

321
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,529
She got the wrong person.

322
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,599
She got caught by you
as soon as she became Cinderella.

323
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,569
Her life is pretty much over now.

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,930
How dare she come after what's mine?

325
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,740
Her funeral march...

326
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,740
will begin playing
the moment she moves in.

327
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,079
Yes, and I need to plant
a bugging device in Yeo Jin's room.

328
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,109
She probably has
an antibugging device.

329
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,720
Most chairpersons keep one around.

330
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,150
I already know that.

331
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:32,319
You have a way of finding out
if she has one or not.

332
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:34,460
You'll have to find an expert.

333
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,160
It's not easy
to let anyone into my house.

334
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,099
Find a way for me to do it.

335
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:43,670
To the second floor, please.

336
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,440
Ms. Choi may find it odd...

337
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,940
if Eun Chong's things
come in with everything.

338
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:59,579
I can't get anything I want
for my actual blood.

339
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:02,720
Ms. Chairwoman, congratulations.

340
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:05,390
My heart raced so quickly,
and I couldn't sleep...

341
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,019
after I heard the news.

342
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,329
This must be very exciting for you.

343
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,200
Thank you.

344
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,029
You went through many hardships...

345
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:14,230
both mentally
and physically for 20 years,

346
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:16,970
so I knew you'd hear good news.

347
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,970
But still, this is miraculous.

348
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,740
Yes, but please keep it a secret
from anyone outside.

349
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:26,279
Of course.
Jin Goo made sure I zipped my mouth.

350
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:27,539
Please don't worry.

351
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,849
I had the insurance company
deal with Ms. Yoon's car.

352
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,079
Thank you.

353
00:18:34,589 --> 00:18:37,250
(Head Director's Office)

354
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,420
Should I add one more name
to the ban list?

355
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:42,930
You may leave.

356
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,500
You were the only reason...

357
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,099
why our subcontractors
would cancel the contracts.

358
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,740
We'll open the claim for damage...

359
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,509
against the Dubaian business.

360
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,279
(Head Director Goo Ji Seok)

361
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,549
Did you find something?

362
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,349
The official document they sent
was fabricated.

363
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,119
Hassan lied to us intentionally,

364
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,420
so this was a clear incident
of a breach of contract.

365
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:13,259
You already knew about this,
didn't you?

366
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:15,690
Stop giving me speculations
and bring me the evidence.

367
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,960
I'm sick of hearing
only words from you.

368
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:25,369
Go ahead
and file the claim for damages.

369
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,869
Will Richard Han pay for the damage?

370
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:32,779
What does he get from this?

371
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,650
Hyesung Group?

372
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,880
Did you also ask your sister
to cut ties with you...

373
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:39,950
because of Hyesung Group?

374
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,349
That's an interesting theory.

375
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,460
You like Guide Goo Ha Na, don't you?

376
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,930
Why do you like her?

377
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,029
- Since when?
- I never said I liked her.

378
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,869
Ms. Yoon is such a poor woman
in many different ways.

379
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:59,539
Stop crossing the line
and keep calling her a poor woman!

380
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:01,670
You crossed the line first.

381
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:03,769
Stay within the line from now on.

382
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,109
Will you protect Ha Na or Ms. Yoon?

383
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,880
Don't get dumped by your fiancee
trying to juggle both sides.

384
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:14,450
If you get dumped by your fiancee,

385
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,859
will you just go
to Chairwoman Shin's daughter?

386
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:23,529
- Why do you keep picking a fight?
- You're crossing the line again.

387
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,059
I know it's not because of work.

388
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:27,130
- What's the other reason?
- You get on my nerves.

389
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,269
A man who was to marry soon
kept getting involved with my sister.

390
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,569
So, you won't pick a fight
with me anymore...

391
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,940
now that you cut ties with her.

392
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,410
I'm the competitive type,
so she's out of the picture now.

393
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,779
I have to win everything,
so I can't guarantee anything.

394
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,950
But still, don't give up
on Hyesung Tour...

395
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,119
and try your best until the end.

396
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,430
Of course.
It's not over until it is.

397
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,029
For your information,
I've never lost.

398
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,700
Then, this will be your first time.

399
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:02,430
It'll be refreshing.

400
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,970
You'll see it on the news soon...

401
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
that Hyesung Tour will
disappear soon.

402
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,940
I'll report it to the chairwoman.

403
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,450
(Mother-Daughter Therapy Tour)

404
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:19,180
(The first trip together
after the daughter becomes of age)

405
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:24,990
I want to be the first guest...

406
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,690
when the mother-daughter
therapy tour begins.

407
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,329
Mom, I'll invite you
as the first guest...

408
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,660
of the mother-daughter therapy tour.

409
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:36,029
Let's go on a walk, make fruit tea,

410
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,400
and go to a hot spring, too.

411
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:46,579
We're putting off
all incoming tourists for a while.

412
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,779
"Putting off?"

413
00:21:50,779 --> 00:21:54,849
We can't have incoming tourists
without any subcontractors,

414
00:21:55,849 --> 00:21:56,920
as well as
the mother-daughter therapy tour.

415
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:58,920
I'm sorry, Ha Na.

416
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,390
What if our business
really shuts down?

417
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:05,630
Once Hyesung Tour goes down,
Goo Ha Na will leave automatically.

418
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,559
Should I just let that happen?

419
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:11,940
You wish to sell Hyesung Tour?

420
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:14,869
It's number two in the industry,
and it's too sudden.

421
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,180
As you can see,
it's barely escaping deficit.

422
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,420
It might be number two
in the industry,

423
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:31,690
but it had always been the last
among Hyesung's subsidiaries.

424
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,960
The stock price
and the sales kept going up...

425
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,490
until you came into the office.

426
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,130
What happened?

427
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,660
It must be due
to Mr. Hwang's incompetence.

428
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,970
I already told you
I'd focus on international hotels.

429
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,240
He wasn't prepared for the change.

430
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:48,210
There wouldn't have been
a problem...

431
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,410
if the Dubai contract
went as planned.

432
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,980
Let's hold it off
until the damage claims are over.

433
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,250
You've also become
quite dull, Ms. Chairwoman.

434
00:22:56,509 --> 00:22:57,680
Is it because of your age?

435
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,750
Or are you just siding with him
because it's Mr. Hwang?

436
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:07,420
If those aren't the reasons,
do consider selling Hyesung Tour.

437
00:23:07,589 --> 00:23:10,630
I heard you asked Yu Jin
to cut ties with you.

438
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,359
That was a sudden change
of the subject.

439
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:17,869
Why did you have
such an extreme idea?

440
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,569
It's very hard on Ha Na.

441
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:24,309
I'd like to discuss only work
when I'm in the office.

442
00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:26,380
Ha Na is my daughter
and your older sister.

443
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,910
We've cut our ties.

444
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:30,109
Until this day, she went through...

445
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,079
so many unnecessary hardships
because of us.

446
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,819
I don't want
to live off her life anymore.

447
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:39,420
So, just focus on your daughter.

448
00:23:40,089 --> 00:23:42,930
And I also refuse your
financial support...

449
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,029
for my siblings.

450
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,299
That's a shame.

451
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:49,829
I wanted to show great support...

452
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:51,839
for you and your siblings,
but you didn't want that.

453
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,869
"Great support?"
More like a great burden.

454
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,809
I understand what you mean.

455
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,509
I'll consider selling the business.
We'll talk again later.

456
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:05,079
I hope you finish considering
before Richard Han returns.

457
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,589
I'll discuss this with him in person
when he arrives.

458
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,920
Sure, then.

459
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,000
The least he could do was...

460
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,170
be happy for his adopted sister,

461
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,369
who went through a lot
trying to support her siblings.

462
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,509
It seems like
there's more to his story.

463
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,779
He also subtly showed his animosity
against me from the start.

464
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,450
Ms. Chairwoman.

465
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,390
I have the list of shell companies
and current progress...

466
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,190
regarding corporate raids.

467
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,299
Are you laundering the funds...

468
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:54,559
- under total confidentiality?
- Yes, ma'am.

469
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,430
Report to me right away
if you think something...

470
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,670
may cause trouble.

471
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,640
Yes, ma'am.

472
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,769
(Be happy.)

473
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,410
Please let our family be happy.

474
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:13,779
I hope your aunties and uncles
all become happy...

475
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,289
thanks to you, Eun Chong.

476
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,289
You're my family, too.

477
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:21,059
And now, I have a grandma, too.

478
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,000
What's your wish, Grandpa?

479
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,000
I'll write your wish on the back.

480
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,299
My wish is
the same as yours, Eun Chong.

481
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:37,039
- Really?
- Of course.

482
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,410
Shall we fly that kite sometime
so that our wish...

483
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,410
will fly high up into the sky?

484
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,480
Yes!

485
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,150
I'll do my best
to make your wish come true.

486
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:52,390
It may take time,

487
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,960
but I'll find a way
for Auntie Ha Na, Uncle Ji Seok,

488
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,430
and your grandma...

489
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:01,599
to all be happy together.

490
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,309
That's delicious.

491
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,180
- Jin Goo is coming.
- What?

492
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,019
He's coming over to eat dinner.
You need to go!

493
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:25,089
I have to grill some fish
and bring out kimchi.

494
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,920
What were you doing?

495
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
I was cleaning Yu Jin's room!

496
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:33,529
What? Why are you getting mad at me?

497
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,930
My gosh.
I should find an assistant helper.

498
00:26:37,069 --> 00:26:39,170
We always end up in a mess
whenever Jin Goo comes.

499
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:41,000
Jeez.

500
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,180
- I want to study abroad.
- I want to start my business.

501
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,180
Should I go to Italy or Paris?

502
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,950
Or I can start small in America.

503
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:53,480
Hey, how is life in America
small in any way?

504
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,819
Uncle Ji Chang, have you decided...

505
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:59,089
on chicken, pork, or beef?

506
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,490
I'm at a significant crossroads,
wondering if I'll go...

507
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,059
with meat dishes or flour food.

508
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,569
Forget that. Ji Seok wants you
at our place on the weekend.

509
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:09,930
Including Ha Na?

510
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,470
No, just you.

511
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:15,839
- Auntie Ha Na.
- Hey.

512
00:27:16,269 --> 00:27:17,470
Eun Chong.

513
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,240
A flower basket? Was it from a guy?

514
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,349
My mom sent it to my office.

515
00:27:22,579 --> 00:27:25,849
My gosh. The chairwoman is so sweet.

516
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,490
And the flowers are just like her,
very luxurious and beautiful.

517
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:31,890
I can't believe Ha Na's life
will always be good from now on.

518
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,789
- This isn't a dream, right?
- If it is, I'll kill you.

519
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:35,930
- Darn it.
- You.

520
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,130
- What?
- What?

521
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,029
You.

522
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:45,940
Whoa, hey. That isn't a job
for the heiress of Hyesung Group.

523
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,200
- My gosh.
- Don't get your hands wet.

524
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,039
Hey, let go of me.

525
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,839
We can order delivery food.

526
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,579
Let me do it.

527
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,910
I couldn't even
tell the difference...

528
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,410
when an authentic bracelet got
switched out with a knockoff.

529
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,180
How did you know?
You can never tell something like that.

530
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,579
You could've just borrowed it.
Why did you switch it out?

531
00:28:03,089 --> 00:28:04,819
Then, may I keep this?

532
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:08,019
I want to keep staring
at this brilliance.

533
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,829
It's a gift from my mom,

534
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,829
so give it back
when I move into her place.

535
00:28:11,829 --> 00:28:15,029
- I'll give it to you later.
- Okay. Ha Na, I love you!

536
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,769
My gosh. Jeez.

537
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:21,670
What did Ji Seok say?

538
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:26,039
He isn't the fussy type like us.

539
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,109
Do you know what he said
when I told him...

540
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,609
I wanted to study abroad
with the chairwoman's support?

541
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,049
- What did he say?
- He said he'd pay for it.

542
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,819
He told me
not to take a penny from her.

543
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,890
He's acting proud
as the breadwinner of our family.

544
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,420
Isn't Ji Seok adorable?

545
00:28:42,089 --> 00:28:43,630
Adorable, my foot.

546
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,430
He's a sociopath. That's what.
He can't connect.

547
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:49,230
Anyway, why did he invite just us
to her celebration?

548
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,170
- Are you two seeing Ji Seok?
- Yes.

549
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,339
I guess he'll throw you
a surprise party.

550
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:57,140
Hey, you can't tell her.
It was supposed to be a surprise.

551
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,180
Right. Sorry.

552
00:29:00,009 --> 00:29:01,910
Will he tell them
to sever ties with me?

553
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,450
Ha Na, I'll help you pack.

554
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,920
It'll be humiliating for our family
if you take something embarrassing.

555
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,349
Do not get discouraged.

556
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,890
Yoon Se Young was nothing
compared to you.

557
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,289
This is going to be so much fun.

558
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,329
She knows
you're her daughter, right?

559
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,200
She'll find out once I move in.

560
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,670
No way. She still doesn't know?

561
00:29:24,869 --> 00:29:26,640
She's going to pass out.

562
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,640
Yu Jin's room was all decorated,

563
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,410
so she'd just need to move in.

564
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:38,480
So, shouldn't we go over
and bring her home?

565
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Jin Goo and Ms. Jang will
escort her.

566
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,789
I made a reservation with the chef
of Jun Hotel on that day.

567
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:48,859
Don't make a big deal out of this.

568
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,599
Mr. Goo wants to get ready...

569
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,630
- to sell Hyesung Tour.
- I heard.

570
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,970
Wait, why does he want to sell
the travel agency?

571
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,539
Is this his way of saying...

572
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:05,410
- he'll drive him out or what?
- Mom.

573
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:07,940
I postponed everything
until the damage claim...

574
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,980
for the Dubai contract was over.

575
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,549
Be ready to take a measure.

576
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:12,579
I've been collecting evidence.

577
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:14,950
It's not like
this business is his enemy.

578
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,750
Why would he take down
his sister's workplace?

579
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,190
My gosh.

580
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,720
He must be in this wild rage
because Richard Han is with him.

581
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:24,529
You need to get the investment first
when Richard Han comes to Korea.

582
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:28,059
Does he hold a grudge
against Hyesung?

583
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:29,930
That was delicious.

584
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,309
This looks like my mom's.

585
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,750
What? No, it's mine.

586
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:48,019
Why would her glove be here?

587
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,119
I bought it for my mom.

588
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,690
- Does Mother have the same design?
- Yes.

589
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,799
I heard Mr. Goo's parents
passed away a long time ago.

590
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:02,099
Yes, they passed away
in a car accident...

591
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
when he was in high school.

592
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,240
I don't know
if Hyesung Group is his goal,

593
00:31:07,539 --> 00:31:11,269
but there has to be something more
if he coldly cut ties with Ha Na...

594
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,539
- just because she's my daughter.
- Yes, ma'am.

595
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,910
I don't understand, either.

596
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:20,150
He claimed he cut ties with her
because he didn't want to be...

597
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,720
a burden to her anymore.

598
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,960
But he holds animosity against me.
I have a bad feeling about this.

599
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:42,740
If that's what you want,
let's live as strangers.

600
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:46,779
But not Ji Eun and Ji Chang.

601
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,650
If you continue this,
you'll be Ha Na's enemy, too.

602
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,089
Mom, Dad.

603
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:08,029
Am I doing the right thing?

604
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,769
The path I chose...

605
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,269
must be correct, right?

606
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,410
Find out more about his parents.

607
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,420
I want more details...

608
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:30,049
on their car accident
and what they did before death.

609
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:31,420
Yes, ma'am.

610
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,849
(Cinderella Game)

611
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,880
Why don't we let Jin Goo...

612
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,180
shut down the travel agency
and come to the hotel?

613
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,650
We have to find evidence on Ji Seok
and kick him out first.

614
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:39,089
Yes, so you need to go
in and out of his office...

615
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,589
and do some digging.

616
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:41,920
Who are you?

617
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,430
Who are you, lady?

618
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,759
You seem familiar.

619
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,960
Director Goo's parents were...

620
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,500
in a simple car accident
due to the negligence of the driver.

621
00:33:49,769 --> 00:33:51,630
How far are you going to take this?

622
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,700
Will you finally stop
once I expose the truth?

623
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,299
- Who is it?
- Is there a reason...

624
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:56,740
why she can't be
the chairwoman's daughter?

625
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,069
It's not like we're enemies!

626
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,180
You'd regret what you just said.

627
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,579
What?
