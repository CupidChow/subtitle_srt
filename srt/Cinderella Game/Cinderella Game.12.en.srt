1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,040
(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,540
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,110
(Also, children and animals were
filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:08,980
To our youth!

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,679
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,720
Cheers.

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,989
I'm feeling these drinks today.

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,489
It's been a while,
so let's drink our fill.

9
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,890
Flip them just once.

10
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:24,059
It won't taste good
if you keep flipping it around.

11
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:25,730
Sure.

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:27,929
How was your first day?

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,370
Let me know
if anyone is harassing you.

14
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:31,940
No one is harassing me.

15
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,409
These days, doing that
can cause serious trouble.

16
00:00:38,109 --> 00:00:40,210
Ms. Goo, I'm sorry
for what happened today.

17
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:42,810
I'll treat you to a meal later.
From Hwang Jin Goo.

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,850
What's with that smile?

19
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:51,020
Right! It wasn't just my first day.

20
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,359
Ji Seok was appointed
as Hyesung Group's head director.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,899
- No way. Really?
- No way. Really?

22
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,869
So, his recruitment offer was
from Hyesung Group?

23
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,429
No way.

24
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,969
That was why he didn't tell us.

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,670
Gosh, it was my day off,
so I didn't see his appointment.

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,340
Did Uncle Ji Seok
also get a job, Auntie?

27
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,209
Yes, and it's a very high position.

28
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:16,010
Gosh.

29
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:20,120
That makes all of us
the Hyesung Group family.

30
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,250
What are the chances?

31
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,689
Not me, Auntie Ji Eun.

32
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,959
Why not? Eun Chong, you can grow up
and become a part of Hyesung Group.

33
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,730
- I really will!
- Of course.

34
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,870
Hey, in your dreams.

35
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:36,530
Just eat this and grow taller.

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,870
- Hey, speak for yourself.
- Ouch.

37
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,040
I told you not to flip it so often!

38
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,379
Corporate Raider Shin Yeo Jin,
step down from your office!

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,109
He wielded the knife in the air...

40
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:52,180
with the blade facing down.

41
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,420
Why was he surprised
if he tried to stab her?

42
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,260
Did he really intend
to stab someone?

43
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:04,060
Good grief.

44
00:02:04,629 --> 00:02:07,530
It's a huge relief
that you don't need stitches.

45
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,000
There's your
specialty medicine, honey.

46
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,479
- It must hurt.
- It doesn't.

47
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:23,680
Of course, it does.

48
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,080
Be careful.

49
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:27,889
Don't make my heart drop.

50
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,689
I won't.

51
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:37,729
Hello.

52
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,530
I was on my way to your office
to report on the Dubai contract.

53
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,039
We met here,
so let's go to your office.

54
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,139
Do you want to do that? Let's go.

55
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,479
Hey, Mr. Yoon.

56
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:57,680
Mr. Hwang, Hanguk Hotel
canceled their contract with us.

57
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:00,449
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,120
Canceling the contract?

59
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,319
What?

60
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,189
Find out where Director Jang is.

61
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,569
Director Jang of Hanguk Hotel?

62
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes, I need to meet him
and find out what's going on.

63
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,340
I'm sorry. I must leave in a hurry.

64
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,610
- Ms. Yoon can report the Dubai...
- I want to hear it from you.

65
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,539
But I will stop by
for a tour of your office.

66
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,210
Then, please show him around,
Ms. Yoon.

67
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,280
Okay.

68
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,699
How could someone who worked
an illegal gig get a job here?

69
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,330
Our agency must be out of its mind.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,129
She must have an amazing connection.

71
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,840
Oops. Will you empty mine, too?

72
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,080
Okay.

73
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,860
Please come and say hello.

74
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,189
He's the newly appointed
head director.

75
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,529
Hello, my name is Goo Ji Seok.

76
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:20,329
- Hello.
- Hello.

77
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,300
Please come to Mr. Hwang's office.

78
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,740
Ms. Goo, bring us some tea.

79
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,680
Yes.

80
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:35,149
He's so good-looking.

81
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,910
He's just my type.

82
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,879
He looks really young,
but he's already a head director.

83
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,149
He must be from a good family.

84
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:43,790
Be quiet. Ms. Yoon is mad at him
for taking Mr. Hwang's position.

85
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,860
No way.

86
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,899
I heard it was a big deal
to bring Hyesung Tour...

87
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,259
up to the second place
in the industry...

88
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:55,699
in just two years.

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,040
It's all thanks to
the talented President Hwang Jin Goo.

90
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:06,509
I heard Hyesung Tour takes up
over 30 percent of the rooms...

91
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,879
at Hyesung Hotel in a year.

92
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:11,620
That much in a year is enough
for them to consider us the VIPs.

93
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,050
Thirty percent.

94
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,689
It doesn't benefit the hotel much
except that the agency...

95
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:19,360
gives them regular business.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,560
The unit cost is too low.

97
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,199
I guess you don't know
due to the lack of experience.

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,170
- Our travel agency is enough...
- It's only the second in line.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,970
The travel agency
always has the upper hand...

100
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,170
between a hotel and a travel agency.

101
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,670
That's what you think.

102
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,459
I want tea. I can't take caffeine
on an empty stomach.

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,759
All right.

104
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:56,060
Well, black tea still has caffeine,
so should I make decaf coffee?

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,800
Ms. Goo, what are
your responsibilities here?

106
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,029
I don't think you're here
as Ms. Yoon's personal assistant.

107
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:01,699
I doubt you got a job here...

108
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:04,540
to make tea, empty the trash can,
and run errands like cleaning shoes.

109
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,569
Isn't that a power trip?

110
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:13,509
Ms. Goo volunteered to do it.

111
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:17,250
It was to apologize for the trouble
she caused before she started.

112
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:19,980
Isn't that so, Ms. Goo?

113
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,550
Answer me honestly.

114
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:26,160
Stick to the facts.

115
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,100
I'm doing this because I want to.

116
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,769
You may leave.

117
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,500
Yes.

118
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:49,180
You're still
the same loving younger brother.

119
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,449
Is it because she's your first love?

120
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:53,480
Let's focus on work
when we're at work, Ms. Yoon.

121
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,790
Sure, let's go back to business.

122
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,720
I took a tour of your office,

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,230
got a take on your thoughts,
and had a sip of tea,

124
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,300
so I should go.

125
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,529
I'll talk business...

126
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,870
with President Hwang.

127
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:22,550
Director Jang.

128
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,019
It's not very ethical
to do this without a discussion.

129
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,720
We've been partners
for a very long time.

130
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,889
Please reconsider.

131
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,230
Please, sir.

132
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,029
Well,

133
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,930
it was an order from above,
so I couldn't help you.

134
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:43,569
We'll pay the compensation.

135
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,600
Was it the president?

136
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,810
What's the reason?

137
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:52,509
I have no idea, either.
I must be somewhere, so excuse me.

138
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:54,009
Wait, Director Jang.

139
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,750
- Director Jang.
- Director Jang.

140
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:57,720
Sir...

141
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,490
Why did the president do this
despite paying the compensation?

142
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,889
Something must be going on.

143
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:11,029
Hanguk Hotel was
in financial trouble, right?

144
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:13,560
- Do some digging there.
- Yes, sir.

145
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,300
(Head Director's Office)

146
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:22,839
President Hwang met
with Director Jang of Hanguk Hotel.

147
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,180
He gave out an order
to look into their finances.

148
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,250
He'll be suspicious of the investor.

149
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:31,449
Let's see how he patches this up
before we take the next step.

150
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:34,090
Yes, sir. And I found an attorney
for Mr. Jung Man Soo.

151
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,360
He needed someone to testify
that he did not intend...

152
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,759
to harm anyone.

153
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:40,960
It'll have to be
Hwang Jin Goo or Chairwoman Shin.

154
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,190
Chairwoman Shin said
she wouldn't show mercy or settle.

155
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,700
She even refused inquiry.

156
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,070
She never looks back on herself.

157
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,769
That was pretty terrible
for a mother who lost her daughter.

158
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:55,940
He got an attorney?

159
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,480
But he had been homeless
until recently.

160
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,909
The police were also investigating
for the mastermind behind him,

161
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,649
but he kept insisting
that he did this alone.

162
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,389
Why? Did you think it was natural
for me to have an accomplice...

163
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,450
because Chairwoman Shin ruined
thousands of lives?

164
00:09:12,789 --> 00:09:13,929
What did he say to you?

165
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,529
He said the same thing to me.

166
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,830
It's the message from the wish tree.

167
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,799
It fell off the tree,
so Se Young picked it up.

168
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:29,710
I should put it back up.

169
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,179
(Yu Jin, we will meet again!)

170
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:34,679
Do you still have the same dream?

171
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,419
Secretary Jang.

172
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,049
I need to resume
the search for Yu Jin.

173
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,559
Find a different agency.

174
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,990
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,830
- Give me the IOU.
- Sure.

176
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:57,740
So, when did you start
working at Hyesung Tour?

177
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,070
Check the amount.

178
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:03,509
I put in the principal
and the interest for the bank.

179
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,409
Did you pull out your lease?

180
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:07,909
Or did you take out a private loan?

181
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,279
You just need the money, right?

182
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,250
Go tell your mother...

183
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,789
not to mess with my family again
now that everything is over.

184
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,659
I won't let her do that twice.

185
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,259
Anyway, thanks for everything,
and may we never meet again.

186
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:27,230
Let me apologize on my mom's behalf.

187
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,600
And thank you
for handling this quickly.

188
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,179
You said I'd never be able to marry
if I lived with Eun Chong, right?

189
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,710
Let me give you
a piece of advice, too.

190
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,909
If you keep
letting your mom boss you around,

191
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,419
- you'll never be able to marry.
- No, I have a girlfriend...

192
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,120
You have a girlfriend?

193
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,059
- You two-timed me?
- No.

194
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,730
Someone set me up after we broke up.

195
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,100
My mom won't leave me alone.

196
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,700
That's what I mean.
If you keep living as a mama's boy,

197
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,500
you'll never be happy
even if you marry.

198
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,940
- What?
- Jeez.

199
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,909
I feel light as a feather
after paying you back.

200
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,779
It has felt like
a heavy burden to this day.

201
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,809
I felt like I was extorting you,
just as your mom said.

202
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,850
- Goodbye.
- Why are you so haughty?

203
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,019
What do you expect me to do?

204
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,919
I've been
letting your siblings off...

205
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,460
for trashing my car.

206
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,259
Look.

207
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,090
(Lee Seok Ki, you scumbag.
What a funny name.)

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,500
Did you have evidence
that it was my siblings?

209
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,639
Would I do this if I didn't?

210
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,370
Look. I have this video as evidence.

211
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:47,139
They did a great job
at dropping the truth bomb.

212
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,309
I'm so proud of them.

213
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,649
Hey, stop showing
that haughty attitude.

214
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:54,690
I'm only letting them off
for old times' sake.

215
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,149
I'm not acting haughty.

216
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,690
You said you'd let them off,
so let them off until the end.

217
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,860
You'll delete the video, right?

218
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,399
That depends on you.

219
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,570
Come with me.

220
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,710
Get in.

221
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:21,950
Get in already.

222
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,299
Please delete the videos
on the dash cam and your phone.

223
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,370
Be honest.

224
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,879
You really didn't love me?

225
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,009
You just said that
because you were mad, right?

226
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
Do you know what love is?

227
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,690
Of course. Don't you?

228
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:05,690
I don't. I've never been in love.

229
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,059
Everything we did was love.

230
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,200
Something like this.

231
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,269
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

232
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:18,600
Yes, that's it. Acting crazy.

233
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:20,799
That's love.

234
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:24,539
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

235
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,879
I love you, Ha Na.

236
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,049
- Let go of me. Let go!
- I won't give you the dash cam.

237
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,720
I'll sue your siblings.

238
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,850
Get back in.
I'll give you the dash cam.

239
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,820
Get in, Ha Na.

240
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,659
- Let go of me!
- Come back.

241
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,460
I'll give you the dash cam.

242
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:43,490
- Let go of me!
- Ha Na.

243
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,600
Hey.

244
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,399
Hey! Darn it.

245
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:01,480
- Mr. Hwang.
- Are you okay?

246
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,379
Hey, Goo Ha Na!

247
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:11,159
Who are you?

248
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:13,820
Why are you touching my woman?

249
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,659
You're crazy.

250
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,860
What is this strange situation?

251
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,299
Who the heck are you?

252
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,269
Did you two-time me, too?

253
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,370
Not everyone is like you.

254
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:30,070
How do you know Ha Na?
What's the relationship here?

255
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,139
Us?

256
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:35,480
We're on the same side.

257
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:40,620
You aren't her husband,
her boyfriend,

258
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,519
- but someone on the same side?
- Don't get it? We're family.

259
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,470
("Between Calm and Passion")

260
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:04,210
("Between Calm and Passion")

261
00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:08,409
("Between Calm and Passion")

262
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,519
("Between Calm and Passion")

263
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,320
Do you still like this book?

264
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,090
It fell, so I just picked it up.

265
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,490
Put it back on the shelf.

266
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,659
You're still at the archives
very often,

267
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,029
both in America and Seoul.

268
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,200
Or did you know
this was where I would be?

269
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,100
You're still full of yourself.

270
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,440
"Family?"

271
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,279
Are you two siblings?
Are you married?

272
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,039
How are you two family?

273
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,279
Jeez, you're talkative.

274
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:45,379
Yes, but you probably have
no excuses to make...

275
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,220
- when you hit on my woman...
- Cut the crap...

276
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:50,750
and delete the video immediately.

277
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,820
If you don't, I'll sue you
for confinement,

278
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,720
blackmailing, and sexual harassment!

279
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,230
- What's going on?
- What is it?

280
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,169
Is that Ms. Goo Ha Na?

281
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,870
President Hwang, what's going on?

282
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,169
"President?"

283
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,509
There's a man sexually harassing
one of our employees...

284
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:13,980
in our parking lot
under the broad daylight.

285
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:16,009
- Please call the police.
- Wait.

286
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:20,120
I'll delete the video. Okay?

287
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,059
Happy now?

288
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,559
And the dash cam.

289
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,129
Or I'll report you.

290
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,759
Fine. I'll do it.

291
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,740
I'm deleting it.

292
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,110
(Formatting the memory card will
delete all your data. Are you sure?)

293
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,879
(Now formatting your SD card.)

294
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,580
You saw it, right?

295
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,720
Don't ever show up
before Ms. Goo or me.

296
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,320
If you do,
I'll sue you for confinement,

297
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,759
blackmailing, and sexual harassment
right away. Okay?

298
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,230
- Darn it.
- Time to go.

299
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,640
You should've reported
a punk like that.

300
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,769
He'd be a waste of time
for our public authority.

301
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,740
Thank you for your hard work.

302
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,940
Let's go.

303
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,549
Okay.

304
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,559
Anyway, how could he consider
molesting his ex-girlfriend...

305
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,529
in his car in the middle of the day?

306
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,740
And it was at the parking lot
of her workplace.

307
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:46,440
He must be out of his mind.

308
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,140
She was a new recruit
who started at Hyesung Tour yesterday.

309
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,380
President Hwang was so cool.

310
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,609
He showed up like a knight
in shining armor and saved her.

311
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,279
I want to work for a boss like him.

312
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,390
- Right?
- Me, too.

313
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:07,289
Have a hot drink.
You must be startled.

314
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,559
Thank you.

315
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,799
Why don't you go home?

316
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:16,829
You should
take the rest of the day off.

317
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm fine.

318
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,210
Dating abuse and stalking are
big problems these days.

319
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,740
You should be careful.

320
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,039
I never thought
it would happen to me.

321
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:31,849
It felt like I got to know him more
after we broke up...

322
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,849
than while we were dating.

323
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:37,490
I didn't think he was this low.

324
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,089
I'm not sure
if this will sound helpful,

325
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,500
but the good never happens
without the bad.

326
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:47,730
So, I hope you forget it soon.

327
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:53,640
No rain, no flowers.

328
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:55,869
"No rain, no flowers?"

329
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:02,109
If it doesn't rain,
flowers don't bloom, either.

330
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,079
I feel a little better
when I think of that saying...

331
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,589
whenever I face trouble.

332
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,119
No rain, no flowers.

333
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:18,630
My gosh, it's past lunchtime.

334
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:24,470
I heard there was a problem
with Hanguk Hotel.

335
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,400
Yes, we'll do our best to handle it.

336
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,440
I'll go in first.
You can stay a little longer...

337
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,779
until you calm down.

338
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:34,509
Thank you.

339
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,480
Mr. Hwang.

340
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,420
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

341
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,450
Did I get the job
because of someone's order?

342
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,819
I heard I pulled some strings
to get a job here,

343
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,890
but I didn't know
whose strings I pulled.

344
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,829
- Was it Goo Ji Seok...
- It was me.

345
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,200
I hired you.

346
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,569
What? Why?

347
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:03,269
I told you. I was curious
to find out how talented you were.

348
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,210
And your presentation wasn't bad
at the interview.

349
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,079
Right, you should
start working on your presentation,

350
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,180
the mother-daughter therapy tour.

351
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,049
Really?

352
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:15,049
Thank you. I'll do my best.

353
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,920
- May I ask you something, too?
- Yes.

354
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,519
You got my text message yesterday,
right? Why did you leave me on read?

355
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,930
Right, I was going to reply
after dinner,

356
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,599
but I forgot. I'm sorry.

357
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:31,099
Let me know anytime
if you want to eat with me.

358
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,890
She'll find out about our contract
with Dubai anyway.

359
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,089
Should I tell her?

360
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,230
What happened to you and Goo Ha Na
in the parking lot?

361
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,029
Everyone in the office is talking.

362
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,299
I must've seemed very cool.

363
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,839
Someone was harassing my staff,
so I helped her.

364
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,910
Her ex-boyfriend was stalking her.

365
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,069
Where is she?

366
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:12,640
She seemed startled, so I told her
to calm down before she came in.

367
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,579
You're very understanding of her.

368
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,910
At most, she'll be out
for 10 to 20 minutes.

369
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:18,349
That's not the problem right now.

370
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:20,380
Hanguk Hotel's investor...

371
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,049
- must have given them pressure.
- "Investor?"

372
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,390
They had a financial problem
after expanding the hotel,

373
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:28,059
and the investor must've included
annulling our contract as a term.

374
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:29,259
Who's the investor?

375
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:31,059
It's confidential,
so it's hard to find.

376
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,200
Even if I find out,
it's too late to turn it around.

377
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,630
Can you find our contract
with Hanguk Hotel?

378
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:47,109
Ms. Goo, you don't get to choose
how long you're out for lunch.

379
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,809
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,450
You're already showing misconduct
only days after you started.

381
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,390
Confinement and blackmailing?
And what's this about molestation?

382
00:21:57,289 --> 00:21:58,460
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,059
You've turned the president
into everyone's gossip, too.

384
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:04,160
On your first day,
you took out your spite on my shoe,

385
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,799
and today, you took advantage
of Mr. Hwang to fight the stalker?

386
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,569
You're causing harm in so many ways.

387
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,400
What will you do tomorrow?

388
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,069
- It's not like that...
- I don't need your excuses.

389
00:22:14,069 --> 00:22:16,769
If you do this the third time,
you'll be struck out. I warned you.

390
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,180
Get our contract with Hanguk Hotel
from Soo Jung and make ten copies.

391
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,710
Yes.

392
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,980
"Struck out?"

393
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,289
Is she saying she'll fire me?

394
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,829
What's wrong with you?

395
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,230
Ms. Goo, did you make the copies?

396
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,069
I made seven copies,
then the machine began to malfunction.

397
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:45,640
The service center couldn't come,
so I was trying to fix it.

398
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,099
I didn't tell you
to fix the copy machine.

399
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,009
Run to another office
and make the copies first.

400
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,240
Yes.

401
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,579
(Hotel Business
Partnership Agreement)

402
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,849
Ms. Goo.

403
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,019
Who staples paper like this?

404
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,089
Staple them at a 45-degree angle.

405
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,490
(Hotel Business
Partnership Agreement)

406
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,700
Ms. Goo.

407
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,730
You should use a clip
instead of a stapler.

408
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,529
Do it over.

409
00:23:17,769 --> 00:23:19,400
(Hotel Business
Partnership Agreement)

410
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:21,299
- Ms. Goo.
- Yes?

411
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,309
I spilled coffee on it.

412
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:26,809
I need another copy.

413
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,519
(1. I will walk your dog
for 50 cents an hour.)

414
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,519
(2. I will clean
your hamster's home for 50 cents.)

415
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,519
(3. I will
clean your shoes for 50 cents.)

416
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,920
Why won't anyone call me?

417
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,259
What are you up to, Eun Chong?

418
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:48,769
Hey, did you make this poster, too?

419
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:51,230
Yes, but no one is calling me.

420
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,869
Then, let's ask our teacher.

421
00:23:54,069 --> 00:23:56,710
Our teacher? No, hush.

422
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:57,869
Hush.

423
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,309
You need to find a fault
to kick Mr. Goo out?

424
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:05,720
The news reports on politicians
who get into all kinds of scandals.

425
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,680
You just need to cook up
something like that.

426
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,259
Find something that can
put him down for good with one go.

427
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:15,589
Goodness, he just started yesterday.
You're a bit too impatient.

428
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,859
No, we need
to start preparing now...

429
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,599
to drop the scandal
in the perfect timing.

430
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,869
Did you lose your touch
after your sabbatical year?

431
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:28,940
Or you can use this chance
to rest forever.

432
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,740
Don't say it like that.

433
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,279
Director Choi,
you're a legendary man...

434
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,750
who started as a secretary
and got promoted to a director.

435
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,750
When the chairwoman passes,

436
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,789
Se Young and President Hwang need...

437
00:24:41,789 --> 00:24:44,690
an elder like you
to work with them for a long time...

438
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,319
and lead them in their endeavors,
don't you think?

439
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:49,930
Of course.

440
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,700
Yes, so,

441
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,630
let's nip him in the bud...

442
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:58,769
before he blooms into a flower.

443
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:02,470
What's his relationship
to Richard Han?

444
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,980
There's a rumor that
Director Goo is his stepson.

445
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:06,640
"Stepson?"

446
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:10,180
So, Richard Han has no family?

447
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,250
All I know is
he's a self-made investor...

448
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,920
who emigrated to America
ten years ago.

449
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,359
There's no information
about his marriage or family.

450
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:22,960
Is he sticking
to the old-fashioned mystery tactic?

451
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:28,230
He'll return here soon,
so dig up everything you can.

452
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:31,099
- He didn't intend to harm her?
- No.

453
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:33,099
He just wanted to warn her.

454
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,069
When he wielded the knife,
it must've felt threatening, but...

455
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:38,680
Actually, I found that odd.

456
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,049
He wielded his knife
only in the air...

457
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,579
and faced the blade down on purpose.

458
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:49,349
And he looked shocked
when the knife brushed against my hand.

459
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,589
Is that so?

460
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,119
Then, did you think
he did not intend to harm?

461
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,359
It coincides
with the perpetrator's testimony.

462
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,700
Yes, but I'm sure
someone is behind him.

463
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,900
He slandered the chairwoman and said
she was a corporate raider.

464
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:05,970
Starting next month? Really?

465
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,509
Yes, then, please give me a call
as soon as you have the schedule. Bye.

466
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,210
We got it.

467
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:16,910
Ms. Yoon, we'll receive guests
from Dubai starting next month.

468
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,519
- That was quick.
- Yes.

469
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,819
But Hanguk Hotel is the problem.

470
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,220
We need to secure boarding.

471
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,650
Should I schedule the guides first?

472
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:27,819
I'll talk to Mr. Hwang.

473
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,329
- Yes.
- Yes.

474
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,339
Are you free tonight?

475
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,799
Of course, I am.

476
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,470
(Ji Seok)

477
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,609
Ji Seok is awful.

478
00:26:50,109 --> 00:26:52,119
We don't even eat that much.

479
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,920
How can he invite
just Ha Na to dinner?

480
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,490
That's so cheap. Don't you think so?

481
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,259
Are you waiting for someone to call?

482
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,000
Hello? You've reached
Lee Eun Chong's home.

483
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,569
It's not the fried chicken
and beer place.

484
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,410
No, it's not!

485
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,609
Hey, this isn't
Lee Eun Chong's home.

486
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:22,680
You didn't buy the place.

487
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,910
You don't even pay rent.

488
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,089
Is something worrying you?

489
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,349
What about you?

490
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:36,460
Life itself is full of worries.

491
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,660
Mine, too.

492
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,109
Ms. Jang, do you also think
I'm obsessive?

493
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:53,640
No, ma'am.

494
00:27:54,579 --> 00:27:58,150
Ten, twenty years would flash by
for a parent who lost her child.

495
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,480
You'll always hope for her return.

496
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,349
On top of that,
you continue to have the same dream.

497
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,519
I've never had the same dream
over and over again.

498
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,400
I keep seeing Yu Jin in tears.

499
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,460
You'll hear good news,
Ms. Chairwoman.

500
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,369
Call him and find out where he is.

501
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,869
Hello? Did you arrive?

502
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,509
Yes, I'll go in right now.

503
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:43,960
Congratulations,
Head Director of Hyesung Group.

504
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,799
Ji Eun and Ji Chang are thrilled...

505
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,700
to hear you're the head director.
And Eun Chong.

506
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,369
What happened in the parking lot
in the afternoon?

507
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:54,599
You heard?

508
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,309
He was my ex-boyfriend.
It's all good now, so don't mind it.

509
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:03,410
Why do you have
such a bad taste in men?

510
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,480
Find someone more decent.

511
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:08,150
Tell me about it.

512
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,589
I didn't put you in trouble, right?

513
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,890
What about you?
Do you face any trouble because of me?

514
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:17,130
Do Mr. Hwang and Ms. Yoon
give you a tough time?

515
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,160
Not at all.

516
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,900
Everyone in my office said
you looked so handsome.

517
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:24,769
Well, I think so, too.

518
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:27,769
Are you dating anyone?

519
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,910
- Did you date anyone in America...
- I have something to say.

520
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,180
Ji Seok.

521
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:38,519
- Can you drop that...
- Quit your job at Hyesung Tour.

522
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,720
What are you talking about?

523
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,519
Quit my job at Hyesung Tour?

524
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,700
You won't find a way
in that contract.

525
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,700
We have to give up on Hanguk Hotel
if it was their investor.

526
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,769
The guests from Dubai require
at least a five-star hotel.

527
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,970
They're coming in next month,
so we must maintain this contract.

528
00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:07,140
And you'll have Goo Ha Na
as the guide?

529
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,079
Is there any way around it?

530
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:13,579
I just have to make her quit
on her own.

531
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:17,349
Do I have to keep the Dubai contract
a secret from her?

532
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,890
It doesn't feel right.

533
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:20,259
If she finds out,

534
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,130
she'll try to get a raise
and a permanent position here.

535
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,029
I'll manage, so just keep it quiet.

536
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,130
That contract was ours anyway,
even without that woman.

537
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,339
But first, let's handle this issue
with Hanguk Hotel.

538
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,009
"Duty to notify when there is
a change of subcontractors."

539
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,640
Did the subcontractors also change?

540
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,779
I'll check.

541
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,549
Find a job at a different travel agency.
I'll find something.

542
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,420
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

543
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:50,450
Something like today
won't ever happen again.

544
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:52,890
I can't quit.

545
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:54,819
It wasn't easy to get this job.

546
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,029
I thought someone gave you the job.

547
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,329
Yes, the president hired me.

548
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,599
He said my experience
and talent wasn't so bad,

549
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,930
so he came to my house
and told me to come to work...

550
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,099
because he wanted to see how I'd do.

551
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,240
- Why are you laughing?
- You were deceived.

552
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:12,809
There's no hope for Hyesung Tour.

553
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,779
They're the second biggest
in the industry.

554
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:19,250
Also, it was a subsidiary
of Hyesung Group,

555
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,079
so you shouldn't say that.

556
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,289
I'm telling you this
because I don't want you to regret it.

557
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,349
"Regret?"

558
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,759
Did someone say
Hyesung Tour will go down overnight?

559
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,559
Yes.

560
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,670
Why would it go down?

561
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,839
It will happen soon.

562
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,000
So, you need to quit.

563
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:44,970
Is there a ground?

564
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:48,440
- What's the reason?
- Because I'll do it.

565
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,180
- You?
- Yes.

566
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,049
I plan to destroy Hyesung Tour.

567
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,539
(Cinderella Game)

568
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:50,339
I need to find out who is
and why they are oppressing Hyesung Tour.

569
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:51,769
Bring me the evidence first.

570
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Hyesung Tour will never go down.

571
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,509
I won't let it.

572
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,250
Confidentiality is our priority.

573
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,519
If you find Yu Jin alive,

574
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,349
you will be rewarded
beyond your imagination.

575
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,589
What did you say?

576
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,390
There's no reservation?

577
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,559
What are we going to do
with all those guests?

578
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,960
I'll set everything back in order.

579
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,460
Was this what you meant?

580
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,900
Destroying Hyesung Tour?
