00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,758
You still can't learn it after so long?

10
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,559
What do you mean?

11
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:02,239
Still can't learn?

12
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:03,279
Did you teach me?

13
00:01:03,998 --> 00:01:05,199
You just gave some words.

14
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:06,358
Didn't even demonstrate!

15
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:09,118
Are you doubting my teaching skills?

16
00:01:10,879 --> 00:01:11,558
Yes.

17
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,558
This is how the greatest sect

18
00:01:13,918 --> 00:01:15,118
teaches its disciples?

19
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:19,999
Kneel.

20
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:24,838
What do you want me to do?

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:29,159
I don't want anything.

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,758
Can I just leave?

23
00:01:31,278 --> 00:01:31,808
Kneel.

24
00:01:34,278 --> 00:01:35,478
Don't blame me.

25
00:01:36,318 --> 00:01:37,959
Blame my Master, Tian Lantern.

26
00:01:38,639 --> 00:01:39,318
The point is

27
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,478
we don't have
the power of celestial beings

28
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,918
to get rid of Master's control.

29
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,159
Work harder.

30
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:48,278
My freedom depends on you.

31
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,398
I'm going to eat.

32
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,359
Good luck!

33
00:01:54,918 --> 00:01:56,118
You!

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,478
I must get out of here!

35
00:02:08,478 --> 00:02:10,838
Cross this stream,

36
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,558
head west, and then...

37
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:14,959
Where are you going?

38
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,998
To the restroom.

39
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:23,079
Why are you carrying a bag?

40
00:02:29,558 --> 00:02:31,118
Senior, I'll be honest.

41
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,319
I want to leave.

42
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,438
You'd better stay alive first.

43
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:38,519
Guyue Sect

44
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,919
is downright banditry!

45
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:42,919
Not convinced?

46
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:45,759
Convinced.

47
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,878
I'm convinced.

48
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:50,278
Senior,

49
00:02:50,678 --> 00:02:53,039
if you let me go tonight,

50
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:55,278
I will do anything to repay you!

51
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,118
Why can't you accept it?

52
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:02,239
My brother is waiting for me
down the mountain.

53
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,878
Without me, he can't survive.

54
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,278
Without me, Zhaoyang

55
00:03:06,438 --> 00:03:07,479
still lives well.

56
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:09,438
That's different.

57
00:03:09,558 --> 00:03:10,799
I have to find him.

58
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:11,838
Ye Tian,

59
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:13,999
do you know why

60
00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:15,239
I'm the one stopping you?

61
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:16,998
I know.

62
00:03:17,278 --> 00:03:19,158
Because you are the most reliable,

63
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:20,079
responsible,

64
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,359
and admirable one.

65
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:23,759
Thank you.

66
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,799
But the truth is,

67
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,398
Zhaoyang has other plans.

68
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:29,678
She is here.

69
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:38,560
Kneel.

70
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,318
My dear disciple,

71
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:44,479
where are you going?

72
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,319
Hua Zhaoyang.

73
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:49,199
You haunting pest!

74
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:51,158
Even if I kneel till my bones break,

75
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,838
I'll go find my brother anyway!

76
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:54,558
I know.

77
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,718
Don't worry.

78
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:58,639
We are reasonable.

79
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,759
What do you want?

80
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:25,918
I...

81
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:27,519
Ye Xun?

82
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,278
Tian.

83
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,358
Why are you here?

84
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:31,718
Touched?

85
00:04:31,798 --> 00:04:32,358
I...

86
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:34,398
I brought your brother here

87
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:35,639
the same way I first met you.

88
00:04:37,238 --> 00:04:38,679
You've gone too far!

89
00:04:38,798 --> 00:04:40,679
We just came here to gather materials!

90
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,879
Why won't you let us go?

91
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:44,319
Innocence gets blame
when holding treasure.

92
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,519
Blame the Celestial Flower inside you.

93
00:04:46,679 --> 00:04:48,039
Celestial Flower?

94
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:48,838
I don't even know

95
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:49,838
what it is.

96
00:04:50,798 --> 00:04:51,959
I don't get it.

97
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:54,919
Guyue Sect provides food and shelter.

98
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,918
Why do you keep trying to flee?

99
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,519
You know nothing.

100
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:00,679
A true man has great ambitions.

101
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:02,519
I need to finish my book.

102
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:03,838
My readers are waiting!

103
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,598
You write books?

104
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,119
The popular Collection of Fish and Birds

105
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:09,319
is my work.

106
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,199
Just the final part left.

107
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:12,358
My readers are waiting.

108
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:15,478
That trash was written by you?

109
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,679
Trash?

110
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:19,158
You're so impolite!

111
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,759
I've read it too.

112
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:23,559
The Celestial Flower

113
00:05:23,679 --> 00:05:25,999
is just like the Flying Herb
in your stories.

114
00:05:27,158 --> 00:05:28,079
Flying Herb?

115
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,798
The Celestial Flower
is like the Flying Herb.

116
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:31,679
Then...

117
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,999
Wait, that's not the point.

118
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:39,598
Why does a copied book have readers?

119
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:42,679
Copied? Nonsense!

120
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,598
Which part?

121
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,519
Prove it!

122
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:47,798
I can't remember clearly.

123
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,519
Anyway,

124
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,759
in your stories,

125
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:52,439
every plot felt familiar.

126
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,038
You must've copied.

127
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,439
Baseless accusations.

128
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:56,879
Well, I'm tired today.

129
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:58,119
I won't argue with you.

130
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,038
Rongyue, how about making Xun

131
00:06:03,119 --> 00:06:03,679
your disciple?

132
00:06:06,718 --> 00:06:09,718
Don't make me suffer alone!

133
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:28,559
Focus!

134
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:31,119
Eyes forward!

135
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:34,238
Steady stance!

136
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:41,798
Watch your back.

137
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,838
Disaster.

138
00:06:46,238 --> 00:06:47,079
Enough.

139
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:48,238
Dismissed!

140
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:53,358
Not bad, Ye Xun.

141
00:06:54,798 --> 00:06:55,798
You've grasped the key.

142
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,079
Thanks to you.

143
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:00,798
Let's practice mental cultivation.

144
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,478
Seniors, please.

145
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,639
Ye Xun, you're doing great.

146
00:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,319
See?

147
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,679
How different are you!

148
00:07:15,718 --> 00:07:16,358
What's up?

149
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,718
Xun is just smart.

150
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:18,439
Jealous?

151
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:21,238
No.

152
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:23,838
Rongyue teaches better than you.

153
00:07:26,718 --> 00:07:28,238
Upset?

154
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:30,439
Kneel!

155
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:35,679
At this rate,

156
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:37,598
when will I ever get to leave?

157
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,879
I'll talk to Master.

158
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,079
Keep practicing here.

159
00:07:54,038 --> 00:07:54,798
Why stay here?

160
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:57,879
Senior asked you to practice,
didn't you hear?

161
00:07:59,838 --> 00:08:02,158
I heard. I just don't want to.

162
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,639
You dare disrespect Senior

163
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,598
over some dubious Celestial Flower?

164
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:10,559
I'll teach you a lesson!

165
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:21,439
Is this all you got?

166
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,038
Teach me?

167
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:24,559
You...

168
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,199
Shut up!

169
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,959
If you breathe a word

170
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,439
about my swordsmanship,

171
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:30,439
you'll

172
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,918
regret it.

173
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,439
Pretending, huh?

174
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,799
Master, what's up?

175
00:08:50,758 --> 00:08:52,679
This is Guyue Sect.

176
00:08:52,998 --> 00:08:53,959
We value most

177
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,638
propriety!

178
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:56,319
Ugh!

179
00:08:58,679 --> 00:08:59,799
Master, please don't...

180
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,448
Kneel!

181
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:05,399
Master,

182
00:09:05,758 --> 00:09:07,319
it really hurts.

183
00:09:07,518 --> 00:09:08,399
If this continues,

184
00:09:08,638 --> 00:09:10,159
I'll need metal knee pads.

185
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,718
Keep pretending.

186
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,118
What are you saying, Master?

187
00:09:15,238 --> 00:09:15,998
I don't understand.

188
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,638
You're skilled at martial arts,

189
00:09:19,838 --> 00:09:21,998
yet pretend to be weak

190
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,919
and clueless

191
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,518
before me, huh?

192
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:29,679
I don't understand
what you're saying, Master.

193
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,159
Master has told me.

194
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,358
With a little training,

195
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,199
you could become a Celestial candidate.

196
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:37,238
But you

197
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,878
just play dumb.

198
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,399
Don't you think you're despicable?

199
00:09:42,518 --> 00:09:43,559
Despicable?

200
00:09:44,199 --> 00:09:45,399
Me?

201
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:47,358
A Celestial candidate

202
00:09:47,478 --> 00:09:48,638
sounds tempting.

203
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,118
Then why refuse?

204
00:09:52,478 --> 00:09:53,959
You just fear staying here, right?

205
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,118
Ye Tian,

206
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:01,358
you want to escape the sect
more than I do, right?

207
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,799
Master, I really don't understand.

208
00:10:12,998 --> 00:10:13,518
Well,

209
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,718
let's make a deal.

210
00:10:19,638 --> 00:10:20,319
Go ahead.

211
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:22,439
Listen.

212
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,279
You just

213
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:26,319
show off your skills publicly

214
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,279
and become the Celestial candidate.

215
00:10:28,439 --> 00:10:28,959
And then,

216
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,878
take my place as the Celestial.

217
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,998
Then, I'll be in big trouble.

218
00:10:35,238 --> 00:10:36,319
Let me finish.

219
00:10:37,238 --> 00:10:37,919
And then,

220
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:39,758
I'll go travel the world,

221
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,718
studying mystic arts
and gathering treasures

222
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:44,358
to rescue you.

223
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,118
How about it?

224
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:48,199
Master,

225
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,799
becoming a Celestial

226
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,359
or traveling around

227
00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:54,039
freely,

228
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,199
which one sounds more feasible?

229
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:01,919
How about you?

230
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:04,079
I think...

231
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:05,079
Definitely,

232
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:06,959
me sneaking away is the easiest.

233
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:21,358
You're really good at pretending!

234
00:11:22,838 --> 00:11:24,439
It's a pity

235
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:25,998
only we know it.
