What matters is

11
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:58,711
you are my destiny.

12
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,991
You'll come back,

13
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:05,671
right?

14
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:11,592
No.

15
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,751
I will never return.

16
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,191
Why?

17
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,551
I will erase your memories.

18
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:27,111
Let everything

19
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:29,551
return to normal.

20
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:34,872
Don't.

21
00:01:36,391 --> 00:01:36,952
Zhaoyang.

22
00:01:38,911 --> 00:01:40,031
Can't you stay?

23
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:52,256
(Three days later)

24
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:01,072
Imperial Preceptor.

25
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:03,151
Yes.

26
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,831
Last night, I asked Ye Xun

27
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:10,792
a question many times.

28
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:16,871
Do celestial beings truly exist
in this world?

29
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,271
To be honest,

30
00:04:21,231 --> 00:04:24,351
that is also what I want to know.

31
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:25,992
I don't know why

32
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:29,711
I have a strong desire

33
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,391
to see a celestial being.

34
00:04:34,432 --> 00:04:35,911
Your Majesty, you should

35
00:04:36,672 --> 00:04:37,911
see your subjects now.

36
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:39,632
The time has come.

37
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:42,552
Your Majesty, please.

38
00:04:43,872 --> 00:04:45,351
They've been waiting for a long time.

39
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:56,512
Hua Zhaoyang.

40
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:59,791
You've purged Asura's primal darkness.

41
00:05:00,312 --> 00:05:02,271
If no lingering attachments remain,

42
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,432
ascend the Celestial Path,

43
00:05:04,632 --> 00:05:06,831
and you will become
a true celestial being.

44
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,752
(The people are descending into madness)

45
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,192
(and death follows.)

46
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,112
(Only I can save them.)

47
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:15,432
(Only me.)

48
00:05:17,312 --> 00:05:18,351
(Destroy me.)

49
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,711
(Let the world suffer no more.)

50
00:05:32,552 --> 00:05:33,351
Where is this?

51
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:36,351
You're awake.

52
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,296
(Ye Tian, General of Tiandu City)

53
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:46,496
(Hua Zhaoyang,
Disciple of the Guyue Sect)

54
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,336
(A thousand years ago,
Ye Tian's twelfth life)

55
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:53,031
Ye Tian?

56
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:55,872
You still remember me?

57
00:05:58,552 --> 00:05:59,271
Hua Zhaoyang.

58
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:00,992
Long time no see.

59
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:04,112
How do you remember me?

60
00:06:08,632 --> 00:06:09,432
Calm down.

61
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,016
(Ye Xun, Physician of Tiandu City)

62
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,992
Thank you a lot for saving my life.

63
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:46,176
The General has issued
the lockdown order.

64
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:48,632
Any infected by the Asura plague

65
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:50,231
must be reported immediately.

66
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,072
Understood.

67
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,471
My jade.

68
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,231
Give it back!

69
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:04,911
Not staying at Guyue Sect,

70
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,872
why come here?

71
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:09,831
You remember Guyue Sect?

72
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:13,591
General, Physician Ye has returned.

73
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:24,992
(Anyway.)

74
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,151
(Escape first.)

75
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:43,351
(My spiritual power?)

76
00:07:54,512 --> 00:07:57,231
(Erasing one lifetime
of Ye Tian's darkness isn't enough)

77
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:59,151
(to prevent the birth of Asura.)

78
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:00,752
(Must continue in this life.)

79
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:02,192
(The priority now is)

80
00:08:02,552 --> 00:08:05,088
(retrieving the Yin-Yang Jade
to restore spiritual power.)

81
00:08:05,471 --> 00:08:06,992
(Or, I couldn't even snap a twig.)

82
00:08:13,752 --> 00:08:14,271
Ye Xun.

83
00:08:15,744 --> 00:08:16,271
Brother.

84
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:19,632
Only one plague case today, right?

85
00:08:20,872 --> 00:08:21,391
Yes.

86
00:08:22,672 --> 00:08:23,592
I'll handle the rest.

87
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:24,351
Wait outside.

88
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,112
Alright.

89
00:09:14,392 --> 00:09:14,912
Brother.

90
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:17,911
I heard that today

91
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:19,432
a spy from Guyue Sect was caught.

92
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:21,111
Don't spread rumors.

93
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,272
There's no spy.

94
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,711
Just some reckless girl.

95
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:27,952
It's her, isn't it?

96
00:09:34,552 --> 00:09:35,111
Brother.

97
00:09:35,952 --> 00:09:37,351
Guyue Sect can't be trusted.

98
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:39,151
Hua Zhaoyang is now

99
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:40,031
their Top Disciple.

100
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:41,440
- What if she...
- Top Disciple?

101
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:46,912
More like a decorative mascot.

102
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:48,511
She poses no threat.

103
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,671
In fact, we have one thing

104
00:09:51,751 --> 00:09:52,991
to be accomplished through her.

105
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:56,831
Are you planning...

106
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,072
These people

107
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:00,952
dream of celestial ascension,

108
00:10:01,471 --> 00:10:02,952
but they must also remember

109
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:04,631
their duty

110
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,111
to save mortals.

111
00:10:22,231 --> 00:10:24,711
Tiandu City has been sealed
because of Asura plague

112
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,511
for over three months.

113
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:28,552
At this time,

114
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,111
why did Guyue Sect

115
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:31,672
send you here?

116
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:33,631
Asura plague?

117
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,792
So Asura is about to be born?

118
00:10:37,312 --> 00:10:38,511
What are you muttering?

119
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:44,631
(Asura plague's appeared.)

120
00:10:44,952 --> 00:10:46,552
(Ye Tian's about to become Asura.)

121
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:49,312
(Last life, I failed to stop it.)

122
00:10:49,711 --> 00:10:51,111
(This time, I must figure out)

123
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,392
(his resentment faster.)

124
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,471
Why stare at me like that?

125
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:00,351
If I say

126
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:03,912
I came here for you,
would you believe it?

127
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:10,351
For me?

128
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:14,672
You think I'd believe you that easily?

129
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:18,151
As the Guard General of Tiandu City,

130
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:19,152
I'm interrogating you.

131
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:21,552
As the Top Disciple of Guyue Sect,

132
00:11:21,831 --> 00:11:23,312
you must tell the truth.

133
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:25,991
General?

134
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:28,631
He's a General in this life?

135
00:11:34,552 --> 00:11:35,072
Anyway,

136
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:36,711
you want to end Asura plague, right?

137
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:37,471
I can help you.

138
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,231
Untie me.

139
00:11:40,511 --> 00:11:41,991
Let's have a frank discussion,

140
00:11:42,152 --> 00:11:42,672
