00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:51,456
You want to end Asura plague, right?
I can help you.

10
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:53,896
Untie me first.

11
00:00:54,295 --> 00:00:55,695
Let's have a frank discussion,

12
00:00:55,975 --> 00:00:56,544
okay?

13
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:07,295
Is this how you treat your guest?

14
00:01:07,576 --> 00:01:08,375
General?

15
00:01:09,655 --> 00:01:11,655
Yes, it is.

16
00:01:14,776 --> 00:01:16,616
Fine. Let's cut to the chase.

17
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:18,776
I'm a Celestial, Hua Zhaoyang.

18
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:20,056
I came here

19
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,095
to help you end the Asura plague.

20
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:23,696
But my celestial power

21
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,056
is now sealed in this jade.

22
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:28,056
Now, return it,

23
00:01:28,375 --> 00:01:30,535
and then I can help you. Understood?

24
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:33,255
You mean this jade?

25
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:38,416
Is it important to you?

26
00:01:43,343 --> 00:01:46,976
(Twelve hours ago)

27
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,535
(Hua Zhaoyang?)

28
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,295
(Wasn't she at the Guyue Sect?)

29
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:06,976
The city gates are closed.

30
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:08,776
Where did you find her?

31
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,176
We don't know how she got in.

32
00:02:11,616 --> 00:02:12,776
Before we interrogated her,

33
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:13,616
suddenly

34
00:02:14,016 --> 00:02:15,815
she collapsed in the street.

35
00:02:37,655 --> 00:02:39,135
Fortunately, she wasn't infected.

36
00:02:39,896 --> 00:02:40,415
General.

37
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,456
Judging by her attire,

38
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:43,456
she should be from the Guyue Sect.

39
00:02:43,695 --> 00:02:44,255
I see.

40
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,216
Bind her now.

41
00:02:48,616 --> 00:02:49,855
I'll deal with her later.

42
00:02:50,272 --> 00:02:50,815
Yes.

43
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:12,896
Since this jade is so important to you,

44
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:16,095
I can't return it that easily.

45
00:03:17,736 --> 00:03:19,375
I've told you I'm a Celestial!

46
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:20,655
I'm here to help you.

47
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:22,016
Celestial?

48
00:03:24,695 --> 00:03:25,896
Guyue Sect

49
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:28,655
is the greatest cultivation sect.

50
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,335
When Asura plague

51
00:03:30,415 --> 00:03:32,936
ravaged Tiandu City,

52
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:33,936
where were you?

53
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:38,775
Guyue Sect didn't

54
00:03:38,855 --> 00:03:39,936
help you end Asura plague?

55
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:44,535
Enough of this Celestial charade.

56
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:46,896
I am truly a celestial being!

57
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:48,176
If so,

58
00:03:48,815 --> 00:03:51,056
why can't you even untie the ropes?

59
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:53,496
That's why I need my jade!

60
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:55,535
Since you desire it so much,

61
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,695
let's make a deal.

62
00:04:00,176 --> 00:04:01,216
Return to Guyue Sect

63
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,375
and bring all your fellow disciples here

64
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,575
to eradicate the plague together.

65
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:08,855
After that, I'll give it back to you.

66
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:19,815
(Stubborn guy.)

67
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:21,575
(I must find other ways.)

68
00:04:51,616 --> 00:04:52,255
Hua Zhaoyang.

69
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,176
It seems improper

70
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:01,135
for you

71
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,695
to barge into my room like this.

72
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:04,335
Had you not been so stubborn,

73
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:06,895
I wouldn't resort to this.

74
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:09,015
But I won't blame you.

75
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:11,255
Once I regain my celestial power,

76
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:14,056
the Asura plague in Tiandu City

77
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:15,135
and in your body

78
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:16,335
can all be ended.

79
00:05:17,496 --> 00:05:18,416
In my body?

80
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,215
What do you mean?

81
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:23,416
Nothing.

82
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:26,255
Forget it.

83
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:29,096
I need to regain my power first.

84
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:51,176
Why are you laughing?

85
00:05:51,656 --> 00:05:52,536
Your pretentious act

86
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:54,056
is really amusing.

87
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:55,536
Ye Xun,

88
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:57,455
I've endured this in my past life.

89
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:00,455
You are still not smart.

90
00:06:14,736 --> 00:06:15,695
This is fake!

91
00:06:17,775 --> 00:06:19,895
Ye Tian, this is too much!

92
00:06:20,015 --> 00:06:20,575
Give it to me!

93
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,015
Give it to me!

94
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:23,455
Well.

95
00:06:24,015 --> 00:06:24,935
Seeing you struggle

96
00:06:25,015 --> 00:06:26,455
is quite interesting.

97
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:29,255
Take this

98
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:30,536
as a warning.

99
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:32,015
No more schemes in the future.

100
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:33,815
By the way.

101
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:35,255
Tomorrow, Ye Xun and I

102
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:36,775
will escort you out in person.

103
00:06:37,536 --> 00:06:39,215
One last advice for you.

104
00:06:40,096 --> 00:06:41,375
Do not touch me.

105
00:07:06,056 --> 00:07:06,856
Well,

106
00:07:07,015 --> 00:07:09,536
must you escort me out of the city?

107
00:07:10,056 --> 00:07:10,815
Absolutely.

108
00:07:13,096 --> 00:07:13,775
I'm telling you,

109
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:15,335
about that jade pendant...

110
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:17,015
Didn't he warn you

111
00:07:17,296 --> 00:07:18,176
not to touch him?

112
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,215
Tian, I have a few words

113
00:07:23,296 --> 00:07:24,895
to talk to her alone.

114
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,416
Don't worry. I'll be cautious.

115
00:07:38,815 --> 00:07:39,455
Just speak.

116
00:07:48,215 --> 00:07:49,455
Listen well, Hua Zhaoyang.

117
00:07:50,255 --> 00:07:52,296
This is your last chance to make amends.

118
00:07:52,856 --> 00:07:53,856
Don't disappoint Tian.

119
00:07:57,856 --> 00:07:58,616
Otherwise...

120
00:08:20,736 --> 00:08:21,375
Let go!

121
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:53,815
Are you okay?

122
00:08:58,016 --> 00:08:59,095
I'm fine, Tian.

123
00:10:39,016 --> 00:10:39,735
Don't be sad.

124
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:43,176
I'll find you a better jade pendant.

125
00:10:44,615 --> 00:10:45,455
This one

126
00:10:46,016 --> 00:10:47,575
is fake too, right?

127
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:52,495
No. It's real.

128
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,136
How could you entrust

129
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,815
such an important thing to him?

130
00:10:59,776 --> 00:11:00,695
I didn't except

131
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:02,056
this would happen.

132
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,656
Are you fine?

133
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:11,016
No.

134
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,176
This time, I can never go back.

135
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:15,695
If you can't go back,

136
00:11:16,536 --> 00:11:17,656
just stay.

137
00:11:20,656 --> 00:11:21,216
I don't need

138
00:11:21,296 --> 00:11:23,536
Guyue Sect's aid now.

139
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:31,016
Why do you look happy about it?

140
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:33,975
I... I'm not.

141
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:38,256
Well,

142
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:39,896
I'll try to find

143
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:41,256
skilled artisans in the city

144
00:11:41,376 --> 00:11:42,536
to fix this jade pendant.

145
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:44,536
This is a celestial artifact!

146
00:11:44,695 --> 00:11:46,376
No common people can fix it.

147
00:11:47,776 --> 00:11:48,335
Alright.

148
00:11:48,896 --> 00:11:50,136
You're still talking nonsense,

149
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:51,615
so I am relieved.

150
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:53,855
I'm not!

151
00:11:59,975 --> 00:12:00,615
By the way,

152
00:12:00,936 --> 00:12:02,215
I have a question for you.

153
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:03,815
In this life,

154
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:06,256
is there any obstacle
you couldn't overcome?

155
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:07,328
Or someone

156
00:12:07,495 --> 00:12:08,975
