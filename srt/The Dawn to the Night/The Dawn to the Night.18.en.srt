00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:50,831
How about you?

10
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,871
I think...

11
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:52,791
Definitely,

12
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,591
me sneaking away is the easiest.

13
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:08,431
You're really good at pretending!

14
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:11,431
It's a pity

15
00:01:11,591 --> 00:01:13,110
only we know it.

16
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,310
Alright, Hua Zhaoyang.

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,591
I don't have time for your mind games.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,511
I'm leaving now.

19
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,120
Kneel.

20
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,071
How dare you call me by that?

21
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,110
Master.

22
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,110
Master.

23
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,591
Ye Tian, don't worry.

24
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,991
One day,

25
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,871
I will expose

26
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,991
your true skills

27
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,591
in front of everyone.

28
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:45,270
You'd better watch your back.

29
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:40,710
See?

30
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,390
He's skilled at martial arts!

31
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,231
I...

32
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,150
It hurts.

33
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,110
Stop pretending.

34
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,311
It hurts!

35
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,150
Zhaoyang,

36
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,791
enough?

37
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,031
Master,

38
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,031
h-he's pretending!

39
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:15,670
Don't trust him.

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,471
Master,

41
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,870
what are you doing?

42
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,430
Admiring the scenery.

43
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,390
(Map of Guyue Sect)
After dark,

44
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,991
escape from here to there.

45
00:04:19,431 --> 00:04:20,590
Where are you going?

46
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,631
Nowhere.

47
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,111
You misheard!

48
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:24,671
Tell me.

49
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:25,270
I...

50
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:26,791
Say it now.

51
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:27,431
Nothing!

52
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,910
Tell me! Come over!

53
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,030
I said nothing!

54
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,030
Kneel! Kneel!

55
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,311
Kneel!

56
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:50,991
Master,

57
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,191
let's stop this.

58
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,191
Have a rest.

59
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,511
You're lecturing me?

60
00:04:59,871 --> 00:05:01,871
Instead of tormenting me,

61
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,070
why not...

62
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,150
Instead of lingering with me,

63
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,671
why not surrender early?

64
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,431
Surrender?

65
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:10,511
I didn't...

66
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,751
(If I really learn seriously,)

67
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:30,270
(by the time I surpass her,)

68
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,230
(would I still be stuck with this jade?)

69
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:40,910
Why the look?

70
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,951
Master, I want to tell you

71
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,270
I've accepted my fate.

72
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:50,871
Think about it.

73
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,551
Keep practicing

74
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,071
physical skills

75
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,470
is completely meaningless.

76
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,631
I'm far from becoming accomplished.

77
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,111
Right?

78
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,150
So,

79
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,150
why not teach me Taoist methods?

80
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,551
Then, I can keep up
with your pace faster.

81
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:07,991
Anyway,

82
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,951
I've accepted it.

83
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:10,270
But,

84
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,311
I have a small request.

85
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,350
Let Ye Xun go.

86
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,390
After all, it's me who dragged him here.

87
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,790
I must be responsible.

88
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:30,431
(What's he scheming now?)

89
00:06:31,551 --> 00:06:34,511
(But that might work.)

90
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,830
(You can hide sword skills,)

91
00:06:37,191 --> 00:06:40,111
(but cultivation level?
Master will see through you.)

92
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,111
(You're digging your own grave.)

93
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,390
Shifty eyes...

94
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:48,710
Bright eyes and pearly teeth!

95
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:52,111
Master,

96
00:06:52,631 --> 00:06:54,551
why were you smiling?

97
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,311
You've matured.

98
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,071
You've improved!

99
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,431
No, no.

100
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,150
I'll find you some manuals
on spirit-root awakening.

101
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,191
Manuals...

102
00:07:07,431 --> 00:07:07,951
I...

103
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:18,590
Read these.

104
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:20,991
So many?

105
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,751
(I'll use this time)

106
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:27,631
(to write some scandalous trash)

107
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,150
(and slander you.)

108
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,951
(When the sect erupts in scandal)

109
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,111
(and you get angry,)

110
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,790
(the perfect chance
to escape will come.)

111
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:52,150
Well.

112
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,511
How can I finish this alone?

113
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,671
Sweeping the long stairs alone.

114
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,191
Tiring, right?

115
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:02,270
No.

116
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,751
Just a bit cold.

117
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,511
This sect lacks warmth.

118
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,350
Is that so?

119
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:14,511
Actually, not that cold.

120
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:15,991
What's wrong?

121
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,191
Don't come closer.

122
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:21,071
My next move depends on your honesty.

123
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:22,910
Honesty about what?

124
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,071
Is Ye Tian really your brother?

125
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,470
O-Of course.

126
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,710
Why he had the Celestial Flower?

127
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:29,671
Explain.

128
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,991
I really don't know.

129
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:33,471
Then, I will suspect

130
00:08:33,551 --> 00:08:34,990
your true motives.

131
00:08:36,031 --> 00:08:38,551
We are just two wanderers
traveling everywhere.

132
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:41,470
He writes stories, you know.

133
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,710
Where have you traveled?

134
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:47,671
Changfeng Province. Yun Province.

135
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:48,870
Zhifang City.

136
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,191
Where have you been before coming here?

137
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,151
We stayed in an inn in Tiandu City

138
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,590
down the mountain

139
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,110
for two weeks, but no ideas.

140
00:08:57,311 --> 00:08:58,510
So we came to Guyue Sect.

141
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:01,230
Tiandu City? What's it called?

142
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,590
Lianghe Inn.

143
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,671
You can check it.

144
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,191
I will take a day to confirm.

145
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,271
If you lied,

146
00:09:14,031 --> 00:09:15,350
I'll report it to Master.

147
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:26,191
I treat you like this.

148
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,391
Aren't you angry?

149
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:33,510
Why?

150
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:36,870
You're just protecting
Hua Zhaoyang, right?

151
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:39,791
How did you know?

152
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,951
When you interrogated me,

153
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,470
it was like how Tian protected me.

154
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:46,791
I can understand.

155
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,110
If I find out

156
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,590
that I misunderstood you,

157
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:02,990
I'll apologize.

158
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,470
I don't need your apology.

159
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:09,590
Instead, I hope

160
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,071
you can teach me carefully.

161
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:13,671
After all, Guyue Sect

162
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,271
isn't for just anyone.

163
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:18,630
I was worried about Tian before.

164
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,590
Now that he's trapped,

165
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,630
I'll take this chance to learn.

166
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,230
What do you mean?

167
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,710
You're interested in cultivating?

168
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,830
Not at all.

169
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:34,230
I just

170
00:10:36,191 --> 00:10:37,710
want to protect Tian.

171
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:39,311
I don't want to be a burden.

172
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:54,350
Half-exposed robe.
Skin like creamy jade.

173
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,031
Mellow and flawless.

174
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,590
This plot is perfect.

175
00:11:00,391 --> 00:11:01,951
If others find

176
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,150
that the top disciple of Guyue Sect

177
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,710
teaches her disciples this,

178
00:11:06,311 --> 00:11:07,430
I would like to see

179
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,110
how you can

180
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,191

fall in?

186
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,391
Where did it go?

187
00:11:46,592 --> 00:11:47,191
