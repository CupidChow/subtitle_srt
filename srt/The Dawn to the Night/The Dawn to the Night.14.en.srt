00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,374
You said

10
00:00:50,454 --> 00:00:51,694
once you found my Death Flower

11
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:53,094
in my consciousness,

12
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:54,774
all of this would end, right?

13
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:56,215
Have you tried?

14
00:00:57,094 --> 00:00:59,334
How exactly should the people be saved?

15
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:01,134
They're now going mad one after another

16
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:02,374
and will all die eventually.

17
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:15,574
However,

18
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:18,574
I can't just watch him

19
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:21,694
disappear once more in front of me.

20
00:01:28,535 --> 00:01:29,414
(I thought)

21
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:32,015
(the Celestial Flower would save you.)

22
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:34,054
(Unexpectedly,)

23
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,655
(it became the Death Flower
of your resentment.)

24
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:40,574
(If I hurt you)

25
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:42,494
(in the end,)

26
00:01:44,134 --> 00:01:45,134
(will you hate me?)

27
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,294
Sometimes,

28
00:01:58,294 --> 00:02:00,455
I really can't understand
what you are saying.

29
00:02:02,735 --> 00:02:04,494
But this time, please.

30
00:02:09,854 --> 00:02:11,134
It's hard to explain.

31
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,535
This is my own matter.

32
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:15,614
I have no way myself.

33
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:17,614
Hua Zhaoyang,

34
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,454
you're a celestial being.

35
00:02:21,014 --> 00:02:21,975
You are the only...

36
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:24,375
But I don't want
to be a celestial being anymore.

37
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,215
Hua Rongyue, what are you going to do?

38
00:02:39,294 --> 00:02:40,694
You still have the darkness in you.

39
00:02:40,935 --> 00:02:41,854
I need to clean it.

40
00:02:42,614 --> 00:02:43,136
Stop it!

41
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:52,694
Killing him is useless.

42
00:02:53,335 --> 00:02:54,294
It's just eradication.

43
00:02:55,215 --> 00:02:55,815
Zhaoyang,

44
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,335
you're inefficient,
but I'm covering for you.

45
00:02:59,055 --> 00:03:00,094
Master sent you here

46
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:01,655
for the Asura plague.

47
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:02,935
What did you do?

48
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:05,055
You settled here.

49
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,255
The situation here

50
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,414
is far more complex than you imagine.

51
00:03:16,215 --> 00:03:18,454
What exactly are you here for?

52
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:20,815
Do the massacre.

53
00:03:23,854 --> 00:03:25,375
And locate the Asura.

54
00:03:26,174 --> 00:03:27,255
This is the only way.

55
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,375
If you have any questions,

56
00:03:32,215 --> 00:03:33,454
go and ask Master.

57
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,174
I do not understand your sect's actions.

58
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:44,535
Now the Asura plague is rampant.

59
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:46,095
You cultivators

60
00:03:46,215 --> 00:03:47,014
have great skills,

61
00:03:47,174 --> 00:03:48,375
but you never help.

62
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,614
We cultivators

63
00:03:50,694 --> 00:03:52,134
indeed possess great abilities.

64
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,775
But think about it.

65
00:03:54,454 --> 00:03:55,214
If I'm also eroded

66
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:57,014
by the darkness and become a victim

67
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,815
of the Asura plague,

68
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,335
who in this world can stop me?

69
00:04:12,935 --> 00:04:15,935
What if I get infected
by the Asura plague too?

70
00:04:17,535 --> 00:04:19,254
If the cultivators of the Guyue Sect

71
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:20,455
get infected,

72
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,854
it won't just be this city.

73
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:24,054
What's more,

74
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:25,775
in the entire world,

75
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:29,494
there will be no place left to live.

76
00:04:32,854 --> 00:04:34,895
This is why we never meddle.

77
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:37,335
Right now, we can't

78
00:04:37,814 --> 00:04:39,374
resolve the power of the Asura.

79
00:04:39,655 --> 00:04:40,414
We can only wait.

80
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:49,655
I'm the person you've been waiting for.

81
00:05:01,775 --> 00:05:03,614
You're not the Hua Zhaoyang
I'm familiar with.

82
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:04,854
Sure.

83
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:07,614
I'm the Celestial you're looking for.

84
00:05:14,975 --> 00:05:15,854
I didn't expect

85
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:19,015
that I would finally see you.

86
00:05:19,655 --> 00:05:20,695
When I first saw you,

87
00:05:21,015 --> 00:05:22,455
I felt you were seriously talented.

88
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,655
So, I brought you
and Rongyue to the Guyue Sect,

89
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,254
waiting for you
to become a celestial being.

90
00:05:31,015 --> 00:05:32,854
Surprisingly, it truly happened.

91
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:38,294
You

92
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:41,734
must have been reincarnated
in the afterlife.

93
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:45,494
What does that mean?

94
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:50,695
Back then,

95
00:05:51,294 --> 00:05:54,414
it took quite some effort

96
00:05:55,174 --> 00:05:56,655
to make her forget Ye Tian.

97
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:58,975
Now, it seems

98
00:06:00,135 --> 00:06:01,015
it was all worth it.

99
00:06:04,254 --> 00:06:05,095
So,

100
00:06:05,614 --> 00:06:06,814
Hua Zhaoyang in this life

101
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,054
didn't willingly join the Guyue Sect?

102
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,414
You came from a reincarnation
in the afterlife.

103
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:17,294
Must you ask
about the karma of this life?

104
00:06:18,414 --> 00:06:19,015
Of course,

105
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:20,654
why must I

106
00:06:20,734 --> 00:06:22,374
sever my feelings for him?

107
00:06:23,294 --> 00:06:23,895
Master,

108
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:25,095
can you tell me

109
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:26,535
what exactly happened

110
00:06:27,414 --> 00:06:30,054
between me and Ye Tian in this life?

111
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,614
You...

112
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:38,854
(Seven years ago)
Ye Tian.

113
00:06:39,895 --> 00:06:40,494
Ye Tian.

114
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:46,655
You're being silly.

115
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,455
I only care about Ye Tian's life.

116
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:51,975
His illness is congenital.

117
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,614
His life extension is against heaven.

118
00:06:54,695 --> 00:06:56,174
But I don't want to forget him.

119
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,294
Master has saved him once

120
00:07:01,535 --> 00:07:02,575
and given you choices.

121
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:04,054
He knows

122
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:05,334
only you

123
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,895
can become a celestial being.

124
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:08,934
Yet you are trapped by love,

125
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:11,854
constantly traveling between the sect
and Tiandu City.

126
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:15,374
You've gone against Master's wishes.

127
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:25,455
Zhaoyang,

128
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,294
focus on your cultivation

129
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,135
to save more people.

130
00:07:38,414 --> 00:07:39,294
Love-Killing Pill.

131
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:40,575

Master.

144
00:08:20,455 --> 00:08:21,174
Master.

145
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,135
Master, you said

146
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:26,334
that a friend of yours

147
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:28,575
had the exact same name
and appearance as Ye Tian.

148
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,975
Perhaps this is destiny.

149
00:08:31,335 --> 00:08:32,775
So, considering this,

150
00:08:32,895 --> 00:08:34,215
could you save Ye Tian once more?

151
00:08:34,374 --> 00:08:36,014
Master, I'm begging you.

152
00:08:36,654 --> 00:08:37,575
Master.

153
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,854
I can save him once more.

154
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:44,894
Hua Zhaoyang,

155
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:47,055
you are well aware

156
00:08:47,654 --> 00:08:49,614
of who I truly care about.

157
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:14,575
Master.

158
00:09:18,534 --> 00:09:20,014
Will my feelings for Ye Tian

159
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:24,295
truly hinder my cultivation?

160
00:09:27,095 --> 00:09:28,254
You know it better

161
00:09:29,374 --> 00:09:30,654
than I do.

162
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:34,455
Just like
he is the reincarnation of a prince.

163
00:09:36,215 --> 00:09:38,614
If you fail to become a celestial being
in this life,

164
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,734
I will find you again.

165
00:09:43,614 --> 00:09:46,295
You are the only hope
to oppose the power of the Asura.

166
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,975
Zhaoyang,

167
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:53,654
you can blame me.

168
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:56,055
Rongyue

169
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,854
just acted on my orders.

170
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:05,854
Master,

171
00:10:07,614 --> 00:10:08,695
I will not blame you.

172
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,695
I have already

173
00:10:19,134 --> 00:10:20,192

Sorry,

186
00:11:08,975 --> 00:11:10,614
I was wrong about you.

187
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:12,254
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:14,134 --> 00:11:15,014
You had no choice.

189
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:19,854
I truly feel powerless.

190
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:21,774
But now,

191
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:23,575
I feel somewhat relieved.

192
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,695
For me,

193
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,854
she chose to forget me.

194
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,854
I won't blame her.

195
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:35,415
Just knowing

196
00:11:36,415 --> 00:11:37,654
you feel that way

197
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:39,254
makes this life worth it.

198
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:44,335
Celestial being,

199
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:47,534
completely stopping the Asura plague

200
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,415
is the most pressing task at hand.

201
00:11:50,975 --> 00:11:51,774
Actually,

202
00:11:52,975 --> 00:11:54,295
Master also has no choice.

203
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,455
Massacre is the last option.

204
00:11:59,415 --> 00:12:01,175
Since you already know the whole thing,

205
00:12:01,534 --> 00:12:02,975
tell us what we should do.

206
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:08,455
Since I am the host,

207
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,055
end me.

208
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:13,014
That should be the best choice.

209
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,295
No!

210
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:20,095
Celestial,

211
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:22,455
just do it.
