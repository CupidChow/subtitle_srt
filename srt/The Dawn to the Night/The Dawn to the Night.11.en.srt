Just a little bit more.

11
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,328
My power is restored.

Only this much?

13
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:18,159
No.

14
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,359
I must figure out

15
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:21,678
what happened exactly

16
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:23,639
between Ye Tian and me in this life.

17
00:01:27,678 --> 00:01:29,959
I can use this opportunity
to approach him

18
00:01:30,398 --> 00:01:31,879
and find a solution.

19
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,838
Just let me see him!

20
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,239
Taoist Master Hua. General has ordered,

21
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,464
tonight, except Physician Ye Xun
for emergencies, no visitors.

22
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:48,719
That's fine.

23
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,558
Please, help me.

24
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:55,599
Taoist Master Hua, don't think

25
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,079
about forcing your way in.

26
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,599
Last two times, I pretended
not to see you

27
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,439
under General's command.

28
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,879
But this time,

29
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:04,519
he strictly forbade it.

30
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:06,238
Even a fly getting through

31
00:02:06,318 --> 00:02:07,758
would get me punished.

32
00:02:09,198 --> 00:02:11,479
What did you do to anger him?

33
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,118
Didn't you get along well days ago?

34
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:15,919
I haven't seen him

35
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,079
this furious for long.

36
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:18,998
First,

37
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,079
we never got along well.

38
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:22,278
Second,

39
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,519
why is he so furious?

40
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,799
Please return, Taoist Master Hua.

41
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:29,039
How would I know that?

42
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:37,558
He finally decided
to stop tolerating you.

43
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:40,838
Congratulations.

44
00:02:45,718 --> 00:02:46,400
Ye Xun.

45
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,158
Did you two grow up together?

46
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,239
Are you silly?

47
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,278
Of course we did.

48
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,438
I've got an idea.

49
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:57,598
Wait a moment.

50
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:06,799
So, all three of us grew up together?

51
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:10,358
You've been clinging to my brother

52
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:11,199
since childhood.

53
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,959
So, we're childhood friends.

54
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:21,319
How did we meet?

55
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:26,519
We were all orphans in Tiandu City.

56
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:29,678
Then, how did we get separated?

57
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,039
You don't remember that?

58
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:41,479
Indeed.

59
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:43,799
I did forget that.

60
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,158
How can you be this shameless?

61
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:49,678
Even Asura plague
can't make you less shameless!

62
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,359
If you don't remember,

63
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,519
why did you come here?

64
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,118
Stay in Guyue Sect
with your immortal lifestyle!

65
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,439
Tian has barely

66
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,558
recovered from the hurt you caused him.

67
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,118
Why can't you just spare him?

68
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,118
Wait, wait.

69
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,239
If you tell me

70
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,278
what happened between Ye Tian and me,

71
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,479
I promise
I'll apologize to him immediately,

72
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,718
and disappear forever!

73
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,688
Figure it out yourself.

74
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:20,838
If you can't, don't approach him again.

75
00:04:27,358 --> 00:04:28,319
How to figure it out?

76
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:48,959
General.

77
00:04:50,038 --> 00:04:50,559
What's up?

78
00:04:50,838 --> 00:04:52,319
Taoist Master Hua is infected.

79
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:53,920
What?

80
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,199
Hua Zhaoyang!

81
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:57,158
Did Ye Xun help...

82
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:04,559
I was right.

83
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:06,759
Now, only the Asura plague
can make you see me.

84
00:05:10,718 --> 00:05:11,398
Hua Zhaoyang.

85
00:05:12,158 --> 00:05:13,398
How can you joke about this?

86
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,038
If you leave now,

87
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:17,879
I'll go out to get infected!

88
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:22,679
Can you stop messing around?

89
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:24,918
I'm not.

90
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:26,478
I just think

91
00:05:27,238 --> 00:05:28,439
I should apologize to you.

92
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:31,759
Apologize?

93
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,918
Do you remember
why you need to apologize?

94
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,639
No.

95
00:05:46,398 --> 00:05:48,439
But I feel I should.

96
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:51,879
Ridiculous.

97
00:05:53,679 --> 00:05:55,199
Maybe you find me ridiculous.

98
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:57,158
But all I feel is wronged.

99
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:01,679
I don't remember

100
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:03,718
anything before coming here.

101
00:06:04,398 --> 00:06:06,639
I don't remember the road
from Guyue Sect to Tiandu City,

102
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,918
the time when Asura plague started,

103
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:09,639
and the fact

104
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,038
I joined Guyue Sect.

105
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:12,238
I remember nothing.

106
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,999
So forgetting you

107
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,079
is not surprising.

108
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:30,358
Ye Tian.

109
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,879
I only know

110
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,999
since waking up in this word,

111
00:06:34,278 --> 00:06:36,158
you're all I know.

112
00:06:37,158 --> 00:06:38,679
I came here for you.

113
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:40,158
I'm not lying about this.

114
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:45,759
And I know how to regain memories.

115
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,798
You know how to regain memories?

116
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,158
So,

117
00:06:53,718 --> 00:06:55,238
all your attempts to kiss me

118
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,999
were just to become a Celestial

119
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,158
to regain memories?

120
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:00,798
Help me.

121
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:08,158
No. You can't touch me.

122
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:11,158
You know, the Death Flower...

123
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,439
How many Death Flowers
have you absorbed?

124
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:16,319
I told you.

125
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,838
Only seventy or eighty.

126
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:18,478
Impossible.

127
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,439
I saw tens of thousands

128
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,598
of them!

129
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:29,358
You saw that?

130
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:30,199
General.

131
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:31,718
General.

132
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,238
During patrol, Physician Ye Xun

133
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:34,398
was injured by patients.

134
00:08:34,478 --> 00:08:35,718
He's developing symptoms!

135
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:37,838
I can save him.

136
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,159
Answer my question first.

137
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:40,118
Hua Zhaoyang.

138
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,399
I can't waste time with you.

139
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,079
Ye Xun!

140
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,399
Ye Xun!

141
00:08:57,758 --> 00:08:59,118
Don't be afraid. I'll save you.

142
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,439
No, no.

143
00:09:03,598 --> 00:09:05,159
You can't absorb Death Flower more.

144
00:09:05,319 --> 00:09:06,656
Do you know the consequences?

145
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:09,919
I must save him.

146
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:10,638
No way.

147
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,199
Your body is reaching its limit!

148
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,279
You can't do this.

149
00:09:14,439 --> 00:09:15,518
Nonsense!

150
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,758
If you turn into Asura because of this,

151
00:09:17,838 --> 00:09:19,319
what will the people here do?

152
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,319
Move!

153
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,159
No!

154
00:09:39,878 --> 00:09:40,518
Ye Xun.

155
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:41,679
Ye Xun!

156
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,192
Ye Xun.

157
00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:55,358
What did you do to him?

158
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:13,792
Ye Xun.

159
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,919
You...

160
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:21,079
Who are you?

161
00:11:23,358 --> 00:11:24,439
Celestial Hua Zhaoyang.

162
00:11:24,838 --> 00:11:25,878
I'm here to help you.

163
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,758
The fact you failed to
smoothly absorb the Death Flower

164
00:11:37,598 --> 00:11:38,878
is because the celestial power

165
00:11:39,319 --> 00:11:40,959
is causing resistance in your body.

166
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,118
Another reason is,

167
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,718
your body is reaching its limit.

168
00:11:48,832 --> 00:11:49,399
Tian.

169
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:54,878
Ye Xun, are you okay?

170
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:56,919
I'm fine.

171
00:11:59,199 --> 00:11:59,758
Ye Xun.

172
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,398
Ye Tian never has the ability

173
00:12:03,478 --> 00:12:04,838
to end the Asura plague.

174
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:06,598
