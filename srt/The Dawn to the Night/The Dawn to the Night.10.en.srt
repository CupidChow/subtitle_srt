In this life,

10

is there any obstacle
you couldn't overcome?

11
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,310
Or someone

12
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:55,831
you deeply hate?

13
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,230
Or something

14
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,791
you especially desire?

15
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:02,390
(The most hated one.)

16
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:04,310
(The most desired one.)

17
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,070
(The most hated one.)

18
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:14,191
Why stare at me?
You don't hate me, right?

19
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:16,150
(The most desired one.)

20
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:18,510
How could I hate you?

21
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:26,671
If I must choose one,

22
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,471
it would be the Asura plague.

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,831
I cannot bear

24
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:33,710
watching people in Tiandu City suffer.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,471
No. Not this one.

26
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,551
There must be something else.
Think about it.

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,870
Forget it.

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,471
Seems I'll have to resolve your grudges

29
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:49,391
without celestial power.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,191
Grudges?

31
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,831
I really don't have any.

32
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:53,630
General!

33
00:01:55,751 --> 00:01:56,270
General.

34
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:58,111
Ye Xun requires you in the pharmacy.

35
00:01:58,831 --> 00:01:59,360
Okay.

36
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:02,430
I'll go with you.

37
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:14,976
Tian.

38
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:22,630
Death Flower has been extracted.

39
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,488
Okay.

40
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,630
About that thing...

41
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:30,751
Thank you.

42
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:35,031
I always aid the needy.

43
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:40,670
That jade...

44
00:02:42,031 --> 00:02:43,670
Don't mention that.

45
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:46,230
Alright.

46
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,591
Isn't this mere herbal brew?

47
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:54,272
Can it contain Asura plague?

48
00:02:54,871 --> 00:02:55,911
Just transferring.

49
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,230
A temporary measure.

50
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,431
The one who can eliminate Death Flower

51
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,271
is my brother.

52
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:07,751
Ye Xun.

53
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,950
Escort this patient back
with Hua Zhaoyang.

54
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:10,991
And tell our people

55
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,510
to intensify patrols from today.

56
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,191
Got it.

57
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,630
Let's go.

58
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:01,790
(What's going on?)

59
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,550
Regard Yin-Yang Jade as this teapot,

60
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:49,110
and the tea inside will be
the celestial power.

61
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,951
Regard Ye Tian as this teacup,

62
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:57,031
and when he touched the shattered jade,

63
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,230
the celestial power was taken by him!

64
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,430
He's become my jade!

65
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,631
Then,

66
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:14,071
I can just take it back.

67
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,750
I must regain the power.

68
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,350
Please forgive me.

69
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,911
It's so late. What are you doing?

70
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,310
You promised to fix the jade for me!

71
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,190
Fix the jade?

72
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:43,591
You're not fixing the jade.

73
00:05:44,031 --> 00:05:45,071
This is harassment.

74
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,790
It's hard to explain.

75
00:05:49,031 --> 00:05:49,790
Let me kiss you.

76
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:51,870
Don't touch me.

77
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:54,271
Must you be so prudish?

78
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,471
Even I'm not this reserved!

79
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,151
I'm not prudish.

80
00:06:01,391 --> 00:06:02,670
You're so weird.

81
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,230
Exactly.

82
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:07,310
That's why I need to retrieve my power.

83
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:08,190
Well, just a kiss.

84
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,831
I don't understand what you're saying.

85
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:15,430
In short, don't touch me.

86
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,471
Let me kiss you!

87
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:21,350
No way.

88
00:06:22,471 --> 00:06:23,190
Ye Tian!

89
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:51,230
- Stop!
- Why?

90
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,271
- Let go!
- Don't move!

91
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,031
Take her away.

92
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:54,831
Yes.

93
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:57,551
Go!

94
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,190
- Just a kiss!
- Hurry up!

95
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,550
Let me kiss you!

96
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:25,471
Alright, stop hiding.

97
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:26,831
Come out now.

98
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,190
Don't avoid me now?

99
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:33,831
Is avoiding useful?

100
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,350
Your persistence

101
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,471
is truly no less than before.

102
00:07:43,511 --> 00:07:45,511
Just let me kiss you.

103
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:46,550
You won't lose anything.

104
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:49,550
Didn't I tell you

105
00:07:49,711 --> 00:07:50,550
not to touch me?

106
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,350
You know

107
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:53,911
how I contain the Asura plague.

108
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,911
Aren't you afraid?

109
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,310
I'm not.

110
00:07:58,368 --> 00:07:58,951
Wait.

111
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:00,631
How did you know I knew it?

112
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:03,750
You just hid behind

113
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,230
while watching at that time.

114
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,790
You think I didn't notice?

115
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:24,911
One year ago,

116
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,831
four cases of Asura plague
appeared in Tiandu City.

117
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,430
The plague was just a legend before,

118
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:35,310
but it suddenly became real.

119
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:38,351
Watching the people suffer

120
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,151
really hurt me a lot.

121
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,070
By chance,

122
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,271
I discovered
that I could absorb Death Flower.

123
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,590
At first,

124
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:51,751
I was afraid there'd be side effects.

125
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,070
But now, a year has passed.

126
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,391
I felt nothing wrong.

127
00:08:57,830 --> 00:09:00,751
You think Death Flower is some tonic?

128
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:04,271
Sometimes I thought

129
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:07,350
if I was specially sent by Heaven

130
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,790
to end the Asura plague?

131
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,031
How many Death Flowers
have you absorbed?

132
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,631
I can't remember clearly.

133
00:09:17,631 --> 00:09:20,190
Probably seventy or eighty.

134
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,310
So,

135
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,070
your no-touching rule

136
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,990
is because you're afraid

137
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,391
that they will get infected?

138
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,590
Are you crazy?

139
00:09:47,351 --> 00:09:49,151
See? I'm not infected, right?

140
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:51,111
But what if...

141
00:09:51,231 --> 00:09:52,190
There is no such case.

142
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,830
Even if I get infected,

143
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:56,271
can't you just absorb it back?

144
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:59,470
But I don't want you
to go through that pain.

145
00:10:09,231 --> 00:10:09,792
Fool.

146
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,430
Coward.

147
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,871
What's up now?

148
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,871
If you don't want to mention it,
I'll ask.

149
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,511
When the Guyue Sect
came to choose disciples,

150
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,911
you promised

151
00:10:47,351 --> 00:10:48,271
that you wouldn't go.

152
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,470
But you had disappeared
for several years.

153
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,670
Why?

154
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:55,351
I need your explanation.

155
00:10:59,871 --> 00:11:00,430
I...

156
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:03,271
I really don't know
what happened between us...

157
00:11:03,351 --> 00:11:04,070
Don't know?

158
00:11:06,271 --> 00:11:07,710
I've waited for so many years,

159
00:11:08,031 --> 00:11:09,991
and you just tell me

160
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,511
you don't know?

161
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,631
I don't know how to explain.

162
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:27,776
It's all because of the Yin-YangJade.

163
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,432
Jade pendant! Always the jade pendant!

164
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,430
Right.

165
00:11:37,271 --> 00:11:39,631
I'm just the one
who can be easily forgotten.

166
00:11:40,031 --> 00:11:42,351
How could I be more important
than your jade pendant?

167
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:45,311
I don't mean that.

168
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:46,271
It's okay.

169
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,271
Hua Zhaoyang.

170
00:11:49,911 --> 00:11:50,511
In the future,

171
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,151
let's keep distance.

172
00:11:58,816 --> 00:11:59,470
Wait!

173
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,631
