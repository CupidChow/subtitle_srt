He has fallen to this point, after all.

Leader.

26
00:01:33,888 --> 00:01:34,440
Leader.

27
00:01:35,001 --> 00:01:37,160
Ye Tian, the Asura, has taken action.

28
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,240
Leader.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,921
Our sect is in grave danger.

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,001
Please, save our sect.

31
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,201
Save the world.

32
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:50,800
(Tian Lantern, Guyue Sect Leader)
A new Asura has arisen.

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,001
I am not his match.

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,080
What...

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
What should we do?

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Time really flies.
Another three years have passed.

37
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,440
Asura, you have come back, after all.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,961
Don't you dare to step forward.

39
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,361
Don't call me Asura.

40
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,801
I don't like this name.

41
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,121
My name is Ye Tian.

42
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:28,401
- What...
- Heed my order.

43
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,720
Activate the Guyue Array

44
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,160
against the Asura.

45
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,281
Don't you think

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,841
the Guyue Sect is missing

47
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,560
some fragrance tonight?

48
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,400
You only brought

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,760
a bloody stench.

50
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,681
Your hands

51
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,121
are stained with innocent blood.

52
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:52,001
How can blood

53
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,320
give off a stench?

54
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:13,600
This is the smell

55
00:03:14,521 --> 00:03:15,720
I'm looking for.

56
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,760
Right now,

57
00:03:19,121 --> 00:03:21,121
we can only hope
she comes out of the seclusion

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,480
as a Celestial.

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,241
(Hua Zhaoyang.)

60
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:29,200
(It's been five years.)

61
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,401
(Wake up from your seclusion.)

62
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:43,230
(Hua Zhaoyang,
top disciple of the Guyue Sect)

63
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:52,001
What's going on?

64
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,600
Why is our sect

65
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,841
overtaken by darkness?

66
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,480
Heed my order.

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,200
Strike.

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,041
Celestial.

69
00:05:02,721 --> 00:05:04,080
I knew you'd wake up.

70
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,721
I don't like being called "Celestial".

71
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,760
You can call me Hua Zhaoyang.

72
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,681
Hua Zhaoyang.

73
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:13,921
I've been waiting for you.

74
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:16,561
Let's bring this to an end.

75
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,481
Remember.

76
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,601
No one shall intervene.

77
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,880
This is not a battle
you can take part in.

78
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,601
- Yes.
- Yes.

79
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:57,241
Why were you holding back?

80
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,041
We tried.

81
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:14,200
Unfortunately,

82
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
you lost your memory.

83
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,481
We?

84
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,561
Zhaoyang.

85
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,200
Master.

86
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,481
Everything is as it was written
in the ancient scroll.

87
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:54,561
Though Asuras are born from darkness,

88
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,880
they are no match for Celestials.

89
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,361
I've waited 2,000 years

90
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,320
for this very moment.

91
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,601
I have

92
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:03,960
finally fulfilled my wish.

93
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,200
Zhaoyang.

94
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,561
As you killed the Asura,

95
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,080
your merits are immeasurable.

96
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,601
Walk the Celestial Path

97
00:08:10,681 --> 00:08:12,640
and you will become a true Celestial.

98
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,280
Piece together the Yin-Yang Jade.

99
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,400
This is the key mentioned in the scroll.

100
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,361
Did you give me this?

101
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,840
How come I don't remember?

102
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,561
You have forgotten many things

103
00:08:27,481 --> 00:08:28,681
in the past five years.

104
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
But it doesn't matter.

105
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,640
Walk the Celestial Path.

106
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:34,280
What will happen once I become

107
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
a Celestial?

108
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,721
Heaven and earth will be well-balanced.

109
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:40,800
The universe will regain peace.

110
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,280
That will be the blessing
brought by the Celestial.

111
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,361
As for what will happen to you,

112
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,281
it's not something

113
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,440
I can answer

114
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,841
as a mortal.

115
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:51,321
I will wait for you to come back

116
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:53,400
and enlighten me.

117
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,321
Master...

118
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,001
(Hua Zhaoyang.)

119
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:46,121
(The Asura is not yet eradicated.)

120
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:49,361
(How dare you step onto
the Celestial Path?)

121
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,121
What?

122
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:58,680
(Take a good look
at your Asura nemesis.)

123
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:00,480
(Darkness remains.)

124
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,400
(The vile flower has not withered.)

125
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,840
But I have...

126
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,241
(He has merely fallen into a slumber.)

127
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,600
(You broke the celestial laws)

128
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,881
(and came here.)

129
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:13,400
(You shall be punished.)

130
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:16,560
(Now, I send you
to the origin of everything)

131
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,361
(to eradicate the Asura for good.)

132
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:31,510
(Ye Tian's first life, 2,000 years ago)

133
00:10:33,139 --> 00:10:35,813
(Ye Dynasty Palace)

134
00:10:37,984 --> 00:10:39,520
(Ye Tian, the sixth prince)
Ye Tian.

135
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,081
You've been a bit carried away lately.

136
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,760
Confess.

137
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,160
What did that old man say to you?

138
00:10:47,841 --> 00:10:50,961
Father said nothing.

139
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:53,641
You illegitimate one!

140
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,920
Do you have to go against me?

141
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,441
Fine.

142
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:02,001
(Ye Rong, Crown Prince)
I have plenty of time.

143
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,160
Let's call it a day.

144
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,361
You'd better stay alive.

145
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,001
Get lost.

146
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,481
Don't be an eyesore.

147
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,601
And don't fall into my hands.

148
00:11:14,361 --> 00:11:15,601
Hide in your residence.

149
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,880
Don't come out in public.

150
00:11:18,201 --> 00:11:19,520
You know what to do,

151
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,081
don't you?

152
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:22,441
Yes, I do.

153
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,441
I won't let Father

154
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,400
find out about what happened today.

155
00:11:30,241 --> 00:11:32,321
I'll go to a pharmacy
outside the palace,

156
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,680
not the imperial physicians.

157
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,241
At least you have

158
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,280
some sense, loser.

159
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,160
Remember.

160
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:44,200
You may have been lucky enough

161
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,361
to be made a prince,

162
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:48,160
but your little brother is a nobody.

163
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,121
Whether he lives or dies

164
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,560
completely depends on you.

165
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,560
Pinellia.

166
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:03,001
Holly.

167
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:04,560
Pepperweed.

168
00:12:05,248 --> 00:12:06,816
(Hua Rongyue, Swordswoman)
How much are they worth?

169
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:08,601
Almost there.

170
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,201
You still owe me 72 taels.

171
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,081
You...

172
00:12:12,081 --> 00:12:13,696
Don't underestimate these!

173
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,920
You won't find these herbs
anywhere this season.

174
00:12:16,121 --> 00:12:17,520
I risked my life in the mountains.

175
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,121
These are of top-grade quality.

176
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,400
Miss Rongyue, please calm down.

177
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:23,400
It's only natural to pay off debts.

178
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,281
Your sister owes Guyue Zhai money.

179
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:27,040
I'm not forcing you to gather herbs.

180
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,721
These herbs are valuable,

181
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,920
but take a look at your sister.

182
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:32,361
Over there.

183
00:12:53,332 --> 00:12:56,384
(Hua Zhaoyang, Herbalist)

184
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,481
I've kept the accounts clear and fair.

185
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:03,760
Your sister

186
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,640
stole my herbs to treat people.

187
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,560
She must pay up.

188
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:07,760
And she's been

189
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
eating and living here these days.

190
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,441
That's extra.

191
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:13,760
I calculated the costs altogether.

192
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,321
With your sister's appetite,

193
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,760
the account can't be settled.

194
00:13:18,121 --> 00:13:19,280
Hua Zhaoyang.

195
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,121
You're still eating?

196
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:26,272
Rongyue.

197
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,321
Rongyue, I'm still eating.

198
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,481
You two, stop arguing.

199
00:13:32,721 --> 00:13:33,760
Doesn't your sister have

200
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,241
the legendary Celestial Flower?

201
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:36,680
Why don't you give it to me?

202
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,800
That will settle the account.

203
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:40,201
I'll even pay you so much

204
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,640
that you don't have to work

205
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,800
for another single day.

206
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,560
Don't even think about
my Celestial Flower.

207
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:47,601
It took me

208
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:49,241
so much effort to find it.

209
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
As a cultivator,

210
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,961
I dream of being a Celestial.

211
00:13:52,721 --> 00:13:53,441
Besides,

212
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:55,441
since the Celestial Flower exists,

213
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:57,201
there must be Celestials.

214
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:03,721
Zhaoyang.

215
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,441
No one has ever

216
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,481
seen celestial beings.

217
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,800
I bet they're just legendary figures.

218
00:14:15,081 --> 00:14:16,361
Why don't we...

219
00:14:25,081 --> 00:14:25,961
What happened, sir?

220
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,040
(Look for him
in the cycle of reincarnation.)

221
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,361
(Your celestial power
will be sealed in the spiritual jade)

222
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,201
(and follow you into reincarnation.)

223
00:15:06,081 --> 00:15:07,121
(Your memory)

224
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:09,880
(will be sealed deep within your soul,)

225
00:15:10,361 --> 00:15:12,361
(waiting to be awakened.)
