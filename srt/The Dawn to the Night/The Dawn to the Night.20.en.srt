00:00:50,703 --> 00:00:53,584
What are they plotting?

10
00:00:55,464 --> 00:00:58,584
You still have the mind
to think about that?

11
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:01,504
What?

12
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:03,343
Why are you acting so weird?

13
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:04,544
And you?

14
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:06,663
Your heart

15
00:01:07,023 --> 00:01:09,224
is filled with heavy emotions,

16
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,784
so you feel weird?

17
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:14,424
Ye Tian,

18
00:01:14,864 --> 00:01:16,624
if you keep speaking to me in that tone,

19
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:17,903
I'll have to punish you.

20
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,344
Zhaoyang,

21
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,064
follow your heart.

22
00:01:24,864 --> 00:01:25,383
Kneel.

23
00:01:31,064 --> 00:01:33,023
If this posture

24
00:01:33,103 --> 00:01:34,463
makes you feel comfortable,

25
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:36,023
I'll be happy.

26
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:38,984
I'm warning you,

27
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,864
don't use your trashy storytelling tone

28
00:01:41,944 --> 00:01:42,984
on me.

29
00:01:43,224 --> 00:01:44,103
I'm not acting.

30
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:45,584
Zhaoyang,

31
00:01:45,944 --> 00:01:46,984
you drop the act.

32
00:01:48,903 --> 00:01:50,103
Your thoughts about me

33
00:01:50,704 --> 00:01:52,504
were expressed
through your sleep talking

34
00:01:52,704 --> 00:01:54,023
last night.

35
00:01:56,023 --> 00:01:56,543
I...

36
00:01:56,823 --> 00:01:57,984
What did I say in my sleep?

37
00:02:00,103 --> 00:02:00,864
In your dream,

38
00:02:01,064 --> 00:02:02,584
you kept calling my name.

39
00:02:03,183 --> 00:02:04,743
Hua Zhaoyang, be honest.

40
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,183
You like me.

41
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:12,983
So,

42
00:02:13,744 --> 00:02:15,024
everything makes sense.

43
00:02:15,784 --> 00:02:16,423
Think about it.

44
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:19,024
You're not that good at teaching,

45
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:20,744
but you insisted on teaching me.

46
00:02:21,744 --> 00:02:22,503
So, you...

47
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,224
Shut up.

48
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:25,344
So,

49
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:27,624
you wanted me to stay with you.

50
00:02:29,663 --> 00:02:30,423
Actually,

51
00:02:31,344 --> 00:02:32,103
I'm happy to do it.

52
00:02:32,624 --> 00:02:33,583
If you say so again,

53
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,663
I'll teach you a lesson.

54
00:02:37,143 --> 00:02:38,624
What will you do?

55
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:40,423
Make me kneel every day?

56
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,024
Give it a try.

57
00:02:44,983 --> 00:02:47,744
Is it the spark of love?

58
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,383
I still don't understand.

59
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:09,784
I'm cultivating myself here.

60
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:12,344
Why do I have to try jewelry or makeup?

61
00:03:19,344 --> 00:03:21,383
The way of cultivation exists
among all things.

62
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:22,663
To cultivate yourself,

63
00:03:22,863 --> 00:03:25,504
you can't only inwardly
focus on the Dantian.

64
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:28,184
Everyone has a love of beauty.

65
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:31,263
Heaven and Earth also appreciate beauty.

66
00:03:34,263 --> 00:03:35,263
Are you reciting?

67
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:36,983
No.

68
00:03:39,383 --> 00:03:40,464
You are acting strange.

69
00:03:42,103 --> 00:03:43,423
Did Master ask you to do it?

70
00:03:44,423 --> 00:03:45,263
Absolutely not.

71
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,263
Be honest.

72
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:48,143
I...

73
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:50,064
If you lie, I'll drop you.

74
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,143
Rongyue.

75
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:54,344
M-Master.

76
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:56,184
So strange.

77
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:58,024
Why did you

78
00:03:58,263 --> 00:04:00,583
suddenly have a better understanding

79
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,703
of the aura of heaven and earth?

80
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,143
Don't you feel it?

81
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:13,504
Ye Xun,

82
00:04:14,983 --> 00:04:16,024
what's wrong with her?

83
00:04:18,064 --> 00:04:18,823
Great Master,

84
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:21,223
can't you see it?

85
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,624
I'm too old.

86
00:04:26,504 --> 00:04:27,944
My old eyes missed it.

87
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:30,383
I can't see clearly.

88
00:04:31,463 --> 00:04:32,304
(Well done.)

89
00:04:32,664 --> 00:04:33,703
(Go for it.)

90
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:42,864
It really works.

91
00:04:45,023 --> 00:04:46,223
I don't quite understand.

92
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,104
But he just said it was useful,

93
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:50,023
so it must be.

94
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:53,624
Then,

95
00:04:54,823 --> 00:04:55,744
am I pretty?

96
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:07,544
Sure.

97
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,143
Alright.

98
00:05:11,864 --> 00:05:14,184
If you have any good ideas,

99
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:15,783
just let me know.

100
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:18,143
Okay.

101
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:36,744
Master, are you looking for me?

102
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:40,583
I called you over

103
00:05:40,744 --> 00:05:42,783
to ask how your cultivation is going.

104
00:05:44,104 --> 00:05:44,984
Great Master,

105
00:05:45,463 --> 00:05:48,104
my Master works diligently
and puts her efforts into it every day.

106
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:49,664
She never slacks off.

107
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:52,343
So strange.

108
00:05:52,744 --> 00:05:53,944
Sounds like

109
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,864
you don't want to run away.

110
00:05:57,703 --> 00:05:59,104
Running away is one thing,

111
00:05:59,304 --> 00:06:01,944
but praising my Master is another.

112
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:03,223
Not related.

113
00:06:04,424 --> 00:06:05,783
You're quite honest.

114
00:06:09,944 --> 00:06:10,504
Master,

115
00:06:10,744 --> 00:06:12,744
when will you teach me the Flames Magic?

116
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:17,664
Zhaoyang,

117
00:06:18,304 --> 00:06:20,023
what is the most important thing

118
00:06:20,304 --> 00:06:21,664
about teaching?

119
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:24,583
What is it?

120
00:06:25,463 --> 00:06:26,263
Patience.

121
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:28,343
Master,

122
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,664
I really can't tolerate this at all.

123
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:33,984
It's even harder to endure
than the boredom of cultivation?

124
00:06:34,944 --> 00:06:35,903
Much harder.

125
00:06:36,424 --> 00:06:37,544
He's going

126
00:06:37,744 --> 00:06:39,544
to drive me crazy.

127
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,223
Then you need to teach personally

128
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:45,823
to escape from this soon.

129
00:06:46,744 --> 00:06:47,703
Great Master is right.

130
00:06:48,104 --> 00:06:49,664
You must teach me personally.

131
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:50,783
It's more efficient.

132
00:06:51,023 --> 00:06:51,583
Am I right?

133
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:54,823
Alright,

134
00:06:55,383 --> 00:06:57,463
today I'll teach you

135
00:06:58,903 --> 00:07:01,064
the Magic of Ice.

136
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:14,503
Master.

137
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:15,463
Stay away from me.

138
00:07:16,664 --> 00:07:17,280
Master.

139
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:19,583
Master.

140
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:21,664
Master.

141
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:23,143
Can you stop bothering me?

142
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:26,984
Also,

143
00:07:27,064 --> 00:07:28,463
don't be delusional.

144
00:07:30,424 --> 00:07:32,184
How can you say that?

145
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:33,303
You kept

146
00:07:33,383 --> 00:07:34,783
calling my name in your dream.

147
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:36,583
I heard it clearly.

148
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,984
Even if that is true,

149
00:07:41,143 --> 00:07:42,744
how do you know I'm not dreaming

150
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:44,184
of cursing or beating you?

151
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:47,343
Woman.

152
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,263
(Do I really have feelings for him?)

153
00:07:55,664 --> 00:07:56,304
(Impossible.)

154
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,703
(Impossible.)

155
00:08:03,343 --> 00:08:03,872
Kneel.

156
00:08:08,583 --> 00:08:09,664

I don't know either.

there are

I see.

179
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:33,184
You kept calling my name in your dream.

180
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:36,823
And I have always

181
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:40,583
had inexplicable feelings for you.

182
00:10:42,904 --> 00:10:43,703
On the surface,

183
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:46,064
I came here to collect materials.

184
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,064
But now, it seems

185
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,343
it is fate that makes us

186
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:52,703
meet again.

187

188
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,544
you always want to leave here, right?

189
00:11:04,944 --> 00:11:06,223
Let's leave together tonight.

190
00:11:19,823 --> 00:11:20,463
