heard from Senior for five years.

95
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:53,831
Master,

96
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:55,550
what do you mean?

97
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,351
It means

98
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:00,270
that she's been
in seclusion for five years

99
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:02,630
and should wake up.

100
00:09:21,231 --> 00:09:22,030
Heed my order.

101
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,600

Asura.

105
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:56,270
So I woke up at just the right time.

106
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,630
Also,

107
00:09:58,191 --> 00:09:59,910
I don't like being called Celestial.

108
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,510
You can call me Hua Zhaoyang.

110
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,790
I've been waiting for you.

111
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,030
Let's bring this to an end.

112
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,231
Will our Senior win?

113
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,030
He doesn't want to win.

114
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:20,071
How could she lose?

115
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,790
Your Senior has lost some memories.

116
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:28,870
After tonight,

117
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,390
no one shall mention anything
from five years ago.

118
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:34,591

I tried.

121
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:07,991
