9
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:50,239
Rongyue,

10
00:00:50,758 --> 00:00:52,919
do you think Zhaoyang and Ye Tian

11
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:54,398
will be together?

12
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:55,519
Master,

13
00:00:55,959 --> 00:00:56,998
to be honest,

14
00:00:57,318 --> 00:00:58,758
their five elements

15
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,519
are incompatible.

16
00:01:00,919 --> 00:01:01,959
It's pretty ambivalent

17
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:03,438
with ups and downs.

18
00:01:04,758 --> 00:01:07,239
Everything is either interdependent
or conflicting.

19
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:10,079
I can't handle Zhaoyang,

20
00:01:10,198 --> 00:01:13,079
but Ye Tian has his own way
of dealing with her.

21
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:17,038
Ye Tian and Ye Xun are interesting.

22
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:20,278
They make our sect lively.

23
00:01:22,038 --> 00:01:25,118
I've lived for over 2,000 years.

24
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:29,359
The older I get,
the more I like young folks,

25
00:01:29,678 --> 00:01:30,999
enjoying lively things.

26
00:01:32,038 --> 00:01:34,398
Your hard work is the world's blessing.

27
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:37,318
If the world can't be peaceful,

28
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:39,478
what can be the blessings?

29
00:01:40,918 --> 00:01:42,118
I don't even know

30
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,359
when I had an obsession,

31
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:46,079
constantly feeling
that I could establish a sect

32
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:48,519
to cultivate
extraordinary celestial beings.

33
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
I've even waited a lifetime

34
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:53,519
for you and Zhaoyang.

35
00:01:55,639 --> 00:01:56,439
I'm old.

36
00:01:56,999 --> 00:01:59,918
All my memories are vague,

37
00:02:00,038 --> 00:02:01,439
full of ambiguous things.

38
00:02:03,278 --> 00:02:03,999
Rongyue,

39
00:02:04,198 --> 00:02:05,398
did Ye Tian

40
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,519
write some stories?

41
00:02:07,758 --> 00:02:09,558
Why don't you tell me about them?

42
00:02:09,678 --> 00:02:11,479
Just for a bit of fun.

43
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:12,799
Collection of Fish and Birds?

44
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,319
I've read it.

45
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:16,759
But up to now,

46
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,398
Ye Tian has written two volumes.

47
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,079
Which volume would you like to hear?

48
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:22,079
What is it about?

49
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:26,199
The first volume describes a fairy
coming to the mortal world

50
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,959
and encountering a dejected prince.

51
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,438
She untied his mental knots

52
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:31,479
and saved the world.

53
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,319
But in the end,
they had to forget each other.

54
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:37,799
The second volume is about a plague.

55
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,678
The prince and the fairy met again.

56
00:02:40,558 --> 00:02:41,598
But in the end,

57
00:02:41,998 --> 00:02:43,799
they had to forget each other again.

58
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:47,398
Speaking of which,
both volumes are similar.

59
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,359
Master, which one
do you want to hear first?

60
00:02:51,678 --> 00:02:52,438
Well...

61
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:54,639
Master,

62
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,199
what's wrong?

63
00:02:57,998 --> 00:02:59,039
Well,

64
00:02:59,438 --> 00:03:01,278
the firelight illuminated the darkness.

65
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:04,199
The strong wind dispersed the fog.

66
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,598
I'm awake. Come in.

67
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:28,359
It's time.

68
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:30,398
You're sure it's foolproof, right?

69
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:32,799
Don't worry at all.

70
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:34,278
Our fellow disciples

71
00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:35,799
will set fire and fight the fire.

72
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:37,919
We'll slip out during that time.

73
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:40,759
But don't make a big scene.

74
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:42,559
After all, I'm afraid...

75
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:43,718
You don't need to worry.

76
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,959
It's all fake.

77
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:45,878
No danger.

78
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,558
Don't worry.

79
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:50,158
Now we wait for Rongyue and Ye Xun.

80
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,079
We'll be free soon.

81
00:03:54,278 --> 00:03:55,558
We can go

82
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,278
wherever we want.

83
00:04:22,718 --> 00:04:23,798
Hey, come in.

84
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:28,798
Why were you

85
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,758
standing outside?

86
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:30,798
What if they saw you?

87
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:32,598
I...

88
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,199
Have you seen Ye Xun?

89
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,439
He seems to be in the main hall.

90
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,679
In the main hall?

91
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:42,038
Why is he there?

92
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:44,838
No time to waste.

93
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:46,439
Why don't we go see him?

94
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:47,358
Okay.

95
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:50,439
Zhaoyang and I will wait here for you.

96
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:52,158
Well...

97
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,838
If the three of us go,

98
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:57,079
we'll be easily discovered by others.

99
00:04:57,358 --> 00:04:58,918
You go bring Ye Xun back.

100
00:05:00,398 --> 00:05:02,038
You're very thoughtful.

101
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,478
Okay, Master,

102
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:04,639
you wait here for me.

103
00:05:11,398 --> 00:05:12,838
Are you hiding something from me?

104
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,838
Rongyue, this is the first time
you've avoided me.

105
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,079
What's going on?

106
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,838
Zhaoyang, you can't go anywhere tonight.

107
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,798
Ye Tian is not what he seems.

108
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:33,158
Ye Xun.

109
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:35,798
Ye Xun.

110
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,999
Isn't he here?

111
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,999
He always holds me back.

112
00:05:41,408 --> 00:05:41,999
Ye Xun.

113
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:43,478
Ye Xun.

114
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:01,398
Great Master.

115
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:08,352
I...

116
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,119
Great Master.

117
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:12,439
It was my own decision

118
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:13,838
to run away tonight.

119
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:15,319
It has nothing to do with others.

120
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:17,439
I'm guilty.

121
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,238
You're not.

122
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:20,798
But...

123
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:25,959
Ye Tian,

124
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,079
I'm sorry.

125
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:32,038
What do you mean?

126
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,598
It's all my fault.

127
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:38,038
I found the Celestial Flower
in your body.

128
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,798
So, I thought
you could become a celestial being.

129
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,879
Unexpectedly,

130
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,559
you're the reincarnation of Asura.

131
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:49,679
The Celestial hasn't emerged.

132
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,918
I have to kill you.

133
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:53,759
Impossible!

134
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,559
How could Ye Tian be Asura?

135
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:56,798
Our Master has gone mad.

136
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,559
It's rare to meet Asura.

137
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,959
I think you've gone mad.

138
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:02,158
He is the Asura by your side.

139
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,679
You have no idea what happened.

140
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,879
Inside that jade...

141
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,598
What jade?

142
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:12,838
Zhaoyang, what's wrong with you?

143
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,079
Don't you believe our Master and me?

144
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,079
In any case,

145
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:19,038
I can't watch Ye Tian being trapped.

146
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:20,158
I must go save him.

147
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:22,158
Come back.

148
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:23,959
Rongyue,

149
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:25,918
you're no match for me.

150
00:07:27,119 --> 00:07:28,119
I won't let you go.

151
00:07:31,559 --> 00:07:32,879
Asura's reincarnation?

152
00:07:33,344 --> 00:07:33,879
I...

153
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,879
I just wanted to...

154
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:37,238
Your stories

155
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:38,958
made me suddenly understand

156
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,838
many events over this millennium.

157
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,598
(I didn't know why I couldn't)

158
00:07:56,358 --> 00:07:57,559
(remember those things,)

159
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,838
(like the mist in the mountains,)

160
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:02,398
(vague and indistinct.)

161
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:04,959
(But your stories)

162
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,838
(let me sort everything out.)

163
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,918
(I don't know why the details
in my memory)

164
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,879
(have been altered.)

165
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:17,439
(But you are the man involved.)

166
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,079
(You were inspired)

167
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,639
(merely by your past life.)

168
00:08:44,079 --> 00:08:45,319
(Over 2,000 years,)

169
00:08:46,118 --> 00:08:47,638
(I have met countless people.)

170
00:08:48,518 --> 00:08:51,838
(His Majesty, General,
and you look alike.)

171
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,679
(I thought it was a coincidence.)

172
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,199
(In retrospect,)

173
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:00,518
(I realized that all of this)

174
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,838
(was destined by fate.)

175
00:09:03,838 --> 00:09:04,358
Next one.

176
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:05,399
(The two of them)

177
00:09:06,518 --> 00:09:08,998
(may have been very close to Asura.)

178
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:13,718
(Now in this life, you'll be Asura.)

179
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:19,838
Great Master,

180
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:21,998
you told me before

181
00:09:22,638 --> 00:09:24,878
that Asura was born from the darkness.

182
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:26,279
But I am

183
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:28,799
at most mischievous.

184
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:29,838
Well...

185
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,959
I'm sad about it.

186
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,838
Perhaps there's time
before the darkness emerges,

187
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,838
but I have no time
to wait for the celestial being.

188
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,478
A tragedy is already destined.

189
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,319
Asura will inevitably be reincarnated.

190
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:49,598
Zhaoyang,

191
00:09:50,638 --> 00:09:51,679
our Master can't be wrong.

192
00:09:52,439 --> 00:09:53,838
Ye Tian is Asura's reincarnation.

193
00:09:53,998 --> 00:09:55,358
He's doomed.

194
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,358
As the most capable disciple,

195
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,039
you can be a Celestial.

196
00:09:59,638 --> 00:10:00,479
You're responsible

197
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,039
for the safety of the entire world.

198
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:03,358
Don't act rashly.

199
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:05,758
I don't care!

200
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:08,279
If anything

201
00:10:08,718 --> 00:10:09,838
happens to Ye Tian,

202
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,238
I will definitely leave here.

203
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,159
I hope that a celestial being

204
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:18,199
will stop you in your next life.

205
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:18,959
Great Master.

206
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,638
I knew it.

207
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:57,679
Master.

208
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:14,199
Master, I'm begging you.

209
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:15,718
Please don't kill Ye Tian.

210
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,238
Let us go.

211
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:18,199
We will find a way

212
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,598
to stop the Asura plague.

213
00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:21,319
Celestial hasn't emerged.

214
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,279
So, there is no other way.

215
00:11:24,878 --> 00:11:26,199
I have no choice.

216
00:11:28,718 --> 00:11:31,079
Bind the soul with a spirit.

217
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:37,399
This strike will

218
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:39,598
give the world another hundred years.
