00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:49,965
Miss Hua.

10
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,285
Miss Hua, can we talk?

11
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:39,965
Ye Tian.

12
00:01:46,368 --> 00:01:46,924
Tian.

13
00:01:49,085 --> 00:01:50,284
What did you do to him?

14
00:01:50,484 --> 00:01:51,684
Nothing.

15
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:54,005
I knew you were up to something.

16
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,605
But I still came too late.

17
00:01:55,764 --> 00:01:56,885
- Guards.
- Here.

18
00:01:58,445 --> 00:01:59,924
- Seize her!
- Yes.

19
00:02:01,365 --> 00:02:02,165
What are you doing?

20
00:02:03,005 --> 00:02:04,245
I don't know what happened.

21
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:05,525
I didn't even touch him.

22
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:08,605
You think I'll believe such nonsense?

23
00:02:09,284 --> 00:02:09,885
Seize her.

24
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:10,605
Wait.

25
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:15,365
Imperial Preceptor.

26
00:02:20,672 --> 00:02:22,272
(Astonishing spiritual power.)

27
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:24,844
Who injured the sixth prince?

28
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:42,045
I've seen the registration book.

29
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:44,045
You're a folk herbalist.

30
00:02:44,485 --> 00:02:47,245
Your name is Hua Zhaoyang, right?

31
00:02:47,325 --> 00:02:49,805
That's right. But I didn't hurt Ye Tian.

32
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:51,205
Stop lying.

33
00:02:57,965 --> 00:02:58,844
Since you are both

34
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,045
honored guests
invited by the sixth prince,

35
00:03:01,444 --> 00:03:02,485
I shouldn't offend you.

36
00:03:03,444 --> 00:03:05,884
I have a truth-revealing talisman
that can detect lies.

37
00:03:05,965 --> 00:03:07,444
If someone lies while holding it,

38
00:03:07,965 --> 00:03:09,724
the talisman will not react.

39
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:12,844
Otherwise, it will heat up.

40
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:15,965
The more sincere you are,
the hotter it becomes.

41
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:20,325
Would you like to try
to prove your innocence?

42
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:25,164
I'll try it.

43
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,085
(No way.)

44
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:37,765
- You witch, what tricks did you pull?
- Wait.

45
00:03:39,724 --> 00:03:42,525
It's proven that Miss Hua did not lie.

46
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,325
But...

47
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:44,844
The talisman can't be wrong.

48
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,004
Facts speak louder than words.

49
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,245
Imperial Preceptor, then my brother...

50
00:03:54,844 --> 00:03:56,245
I'll try to heal him first.

51
00:03:57,085 --> 00:03:58,124
I appreciate it.

52
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:07,564
You witch.

53
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,044
Believe it or not,

54
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:12,085
I didn't lie.

55
00:04:29,284 --> 00:04:32,244
I have cleared all your meridians.

56
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:35,284
Thank you for saving me.

57
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:40,085
As far as I know,

58
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,924
Your Highness had
quite a few old injuries.

59
00:04:44,604 --> 00:04:45,365
But they have

60
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:47,085
all healed.

61
00:04:47,804 --> 00:04:50,765
Did Your Highness
find some miraculous elixir?

62
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:54,724
There is no such thing.

63
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:55,805
If there were,

64
00:04:55,885 --> 00:04:57,525
I would have sent it to Father.

65
00:04:58,445 --> 00:05:00,005
I thought you cured me

66
00:05:00,085 --> 00:05:02,445
of my external injuries just now.

67
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:03,925
It seems

68
00:05:04,005 --> 00:05:05,765
that I didn't get the chance

69
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:07,765
to offer any help.

70
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,604
How did Your Highness

71
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:12,604
get injured today?

72
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:27,484
Do you not wish to tell me?

73
00:05:34,205 --> 00:05:37,005
I haven't really met that Miss Hua

74
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:38,645
in your chamber before.

75
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:40,885
I found her on the street.

76
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:43,724
Does Your Highness know

77
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:45,484
which sect she's from?

78
00:05:51,364 --> 00:05:52,484
Imperial Preceptor,

79
00:05:52,604 --> 00:05:54,085
you don't trust her?

80
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:55,284
I can assure you

81
00:05:55,965 --> 00:05:57,525
that she is not a bad person.

82
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:00,245
I do not know

83
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,125
what Your Highness has been through.

84
00:06:02,965 --> 00:06:05,445
But I might as well speak frankly.

85
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,644
Your meridians are clear

86
00:06:07,724 --> 00:06:08,965
and injuries are gone.

87
00:06:09,565 --> 00:06:11,524
But you have heavy toxins

88
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,325
in the Bubbling Cauldron Pulse,

89
00:06:13,685 --> 00:06:14,965
hidden and hard to trace.

90
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,284
It can't be uprooted.

91
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,005
This is extremely strange.

92
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:21,844
I'm just concerned that the herbalist

93
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,284
may hurt Your Highness.

94
00:06:23,965 --> 00:06:26,284
But if Your Highness vouches for her,

95
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,244
I can't help but ask,

96
00:06:29,244 --> 00:06:31,445
could it be that Your Highness

97
00:06:31,885 --> 00:06:33,804
has a hobby of taking poison?

98
00:06:39,244 --> 00:06:40,525
What a weird question.

99
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:42,284
I don't understand.

100
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:46,765
Your Highness.

101
00:06:47,765 --> 00:06:49,724
Don't hold on to the darkness.

102
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,885
If anything unpleasant happens to you,

103
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,125
I'm willing to be your listener

104
00:06:55,445 --> 00:06:57,005
and share your worries.

105
00:06:58,604 --> 00:06:59,885
You are overly concerned.

106
00:07:02,404 --> 00:07:02,965
Fine.

107
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,005
Rest plenty and feel better.

108
00:07:09,484 --> 00:07:10,404
Take care.

109
00:07:18,484 --> 00:07:21,244
(Three liang of poisoned wine,
five fen of aconite,)

110
00:07:22,164 --> 00:07:24,965
(half an inch of heartbreak grass,
and two qian of love flower.)

111
00:07:25,484 --> 00:07:26,965
(This deadly poison)

112
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,885
(is the best antidote for me)

113
00:07:29,604 --> 00:07:31,125
(to relieve past resentments.)

114
00:07:34,484 --> 00:07:35,205
(Ye Xun.)

115
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:36,925
(I will help you)

116
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:38,804
(keep the secret until the last moment.)

117
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,364
(Anyone who leaves scars on you and me)

118
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,244
(must take this medicine)

119
00:07:44,844 --> 00:07:46,284
(and sleep forever.)

120
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:56,804
Imperial Preceptor.

121
00:07:57,445 --> 00:07:59,724
I've been troubling you

122
00:08:00,085 --> 00:08:02,805
with my ever-worsening health condition.

123
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:03,484
Your Majesty.

124
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:05,765
Please don't say that.

125
00:08:06,645 --> 00:08:07,604
To be honest,

126
00:08:08,085 --> 00:08:09,325
I feel guilty.

127
00:08:10,164 --> 00:08:13,364
Why do you feel guilty?

128
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:14,804
I feel guilty

129
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:16,604
that I've been studying

130
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,924
spiritual power and spells for years,

131
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,685
holding the title
of the best cultivator,

132
00:08:23,765 --> 00:08:25,484
yet I can't cure Your Majesty.

133
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,445
Don't push yourself so hard.

134
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:33,765
I have never hoped for a full recovery.

135
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:35,925
I just want

136
00:08:36,685 --> 00:08:37,884
to hold on

137
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:40,445
until Tian forgives me.

138
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,124
His mother

139
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,884
died in the war.

140
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,764
And his younger brother
couldn't be granted titles due to Rong.

141
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,965
I couldn't do much about it.

142
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:56,565
I only hope that time will be the cure.

143
00:08:57,165 --> 00:08:59,285
Once he forgives me,

144
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:02,604
I can finally die in peace.

145
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,764
I will do my best

146
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,764
to look after the sixth prince.

147
00:09:09,965 --> 00:09:12,565
I knew you'd understand.

148
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,244
Once Tian grows up,

149
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,244
I can release you from the palace.

150
00:09:18,445 --> 00:09:22,085
And you can keep looking
for that dangerous Asura.

151
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,600
(The Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon)

152
00:11:00,965 --> 00:11:01,604
How come...

153
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,524
I didn't want to
embarrass you in the palace.

154
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:09,325
So, I changed my clothes.

155
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:11,285
Did Ye Xun make fun of you?

156
00:11:12,844 --> 00:11:14,244
How would he dare?

157
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:17,405
I-I just feel that I look a bit sloppy

158
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:18,884
and want to dress up.

159
00:11:19,604 --> 00:11:20,244
How do I look?

160
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:21,685
It fits you well.

161
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:22,965
You look great.

162
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:31,244
Right, I'm here to explain something.

163
00:11:31,244 --> 00:11:32,285
- Today...
- No need.

164
00:11:33,884 --> 00:11:35,644
I believe you didn't do it on purpose.

165
00:11:37,165 --> 00:11:38,165
You believe me?

166
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:39,644
You saved my life.

167
00:11:40,085 --> 00:11:41,184
Of course, I believe you.

168
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:44,844
But

169
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,724
how did you get in

170
00:11:47,844 --> 00:11:48,925
at this hour?

171
00:11:50,925 --> 00:11:53,124
The two guards at your door
wouldn't let me in.

172
00:11:53,445 --> 00:11:55,285
So, I climbed in through the window.

173
00:12:10,205 --> 00:12:11,884
Are you hungry?

174
00:12:26,565 --> 00:12:29,124

surpassing mine.)

(all his injuries
healed without a trace.)

177
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:37,524
(And that bizarre poison in his bones.)

178
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,405
(He remains unfazed by the insults)

179
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,604
(and has so many secrets.)

180
00:12:46,045 --> 00:12:47,364
(Your Highness,)

181
00:12:48,644 --> 00:12:50,644
(what exactly are you plotting?)

182
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,644
(Are you the Asura)

00:12:54,724 --> 00:12:56,724
