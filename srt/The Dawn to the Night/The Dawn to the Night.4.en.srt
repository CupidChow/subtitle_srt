9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:00,418
What a fancy meal.

10
00:01:01,658 --> 00:01:02,859
As long as you're fed.

11
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:04,219
- Dig in.
- Alright.

12
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:08,179
It smells nice.

13
00:01:12,259 --> 00:01:12,819
Is it good?

14
00:01:14,298 --> 00:01:15,259
It's really tasty.

15
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,259
Of course.

16
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,899
I picked it up in the mountains.

17
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:20,819
My sister and I often had fruits

18
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:22,099
in the mountains.

19
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:24,938
We drank the spring water

20
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:27,099
and ate the wild fruits
in the mountains.

21
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:29,979
By the way, it took me a great effort

22
00:01:30,218 --> 00:01:31,938
to get that Celestial Flower

23
00:01:32,379 --> 00:01:33,778
when I was gathering herbs.

24
00:01:34,778 --> 00:01:35,938
Thank you for saving me.

25
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:37,418
I'm really grateful.

26
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:39,418
You'd better be.

27
00:01:41,058 --> 00:01:43,539
I'm glad that you're having a good time

28
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:44,938
in the palace.

29
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:46,619
Rest assured.

30
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,659
I will not freeload.

31
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:50,539
I know.

32
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:51,498
You want me

33
00:01:51,578 --> 00:01:53,019
to cure His Majesty.

34
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:54,379
I'll do my best.

35
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,858
Although I am

36
00:01:57,058 --> 00:01:58,899
merely a nobody,

37
00:01:59,338 --> 00:02:00,698
I have lofty ambitions.

38
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:02,698
I knew when I found

39
00:02:02,778 --> 00:02:03,418
Celestial Flower

40
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,379
that celestial beings
exist in the world.

41
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,338
I'll surely become a Celestial
to bring justice

42
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:11,178
to the world.

43
00:02:13,659 --> 00:02:14,979
I didn't believe in those.

44
00:02:15,698 --> 00:02:16,418
But now,

45
00:02:16,618 --> 00:02:17,698
I believe that you can

46
00:02:18,178 --> 00:02:19,659
materialize your dream

47
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:20,979
and be a Celestial.

48
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:28,939
What's wrong?

49
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,379
I don't feel very good.

50
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:33,578
It's a meridian blockage.

51
00:02:34,618 --> 00:02:35,819
Did you cure

52
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:37,259
His Highness?

53
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:39,018
Yeah, so what?

54
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:40,498
So you've also realized

55
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,778
that the cause lies in

56
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,178
the Bubbling Cauldron Pulse.

57
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,179
His Highness

58
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,819
harbors many secrets.

59
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:48,138
I can't help him.

60
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:50,259
But he's severely intoxicated.

61
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:51,939
When the critical moment comes,

62
00:02:52,698 --> 00:02:53,378
please save him

63
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:54,259
at all costs.

64
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,099
You have ample spiritual power.

65
00:02:57,418 --> 00:02:58,179
Just direct it

66
00:02:58,259 --> 00:02:59,939
into His Highness's meridian cycle.

67
00:03:00,259 --> 00:03:01,099
It will circulate

68
00:03:01,578 --> 00:03:02,779
and suppress the poison.

69
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,659
I have spiritual power?

70
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,819
How do I direct it?

71
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,618
(It's happening so soon?)

72
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:25,760
Be careful.

73
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:32,939
Let's hide.

74
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:45,698
C-Can you run?

75
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:47,168
Be careful.

76
00:03:55,898 --> 00:03:56,898
(The medical book says)

77
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,219
(that the energy goes)

78
00:03:58,539 --> 00:03:59,232
(to the heart)

79
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:00,259
(through the lips.)

80
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:02,578
(If I really have spiritual power,)

81
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:06,018
(I'll have to bet on
a mouth-to-mouth transfer.)

82
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,138
Forget it.

83
00:04:19,058 --> 00:04:20,659
Assassin. Freeze!

84
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:22,219
Get him.

85
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,699
(Why do I have these flashbacks?)

86
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:09,858
Are you alright?

87
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:13,818
What happened?

88
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:15,779
The assassin got away.

89
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:16,938
But we found this.

90
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,608
(Crown Prince's token)

91
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:26,618
It wasn't me.

92
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:27,738
I know.

93
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:30,378
It's the Crown Prince's token.

94
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,699
His people did it.

95
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:36,298
So,

96
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:38,219
the injuries you had back then...

97
00:05:38,498 --> 00:05:39,498
This is the palace.

98
00:05:40,459 --> 00:05:41,818
Not an ordinary household.

99
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:43,099
Injuries?

100
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:44,818
He tortured you again?

101
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:45,979
Tian.

102
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:47,498
Why didn't you tell me?

103
00:05:47,818 --> 00:05:48,858
It's nothing serious.

104
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:51,378
Taoist Master Hua has cured me.

105
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:53,099
Don't worry.

106
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:55,178
It doesn't go like that.

107
00:05:55,378 --> 00:05:55,938
Enough.

108
00:05:56,139 --> 00:05:57,178
It's getting late.

109
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,818
- Go to sleep.
- Wait.

110
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:02,178
Since you and the Crown Prince

111
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:04,099
have become archenemies,

112
00:06:04,738 --> 00:06:06,418
the assassinations won't stop.

113
00:06:11,298 --> 00:06:11,938
Rest assured.

114
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,378
I will do my best

115
00:06:14,618 --> 00:06:15,738
to protect you.

116
00:06:29,743 --> 00:06:31,328
(Crown Prince's token)

117
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:32,576
Useless.

118
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:33,699
Sorry.

119
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:37,658
How much more time do you need

120
00:06:37,738 --> 00:06:38,899
to make a decision?

121
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,618
Your Highness, why are you so stubborn?

122
00:06:53,938 --> 00:06:54,858
You got me wrong.

123
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,779
I have no interest

124
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,699
in wealth.

125
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,178
So you only care about

126
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:08,659
how to be a Celestial.

127
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:11,258
All the tips you want can be bought.

128
00:07:12,418 --> 00:07:13,098
Once you

129
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:14,659
get rid of that cultivator,

130
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:16,298
all this will be yours.

131
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:17,738
Since you've asked,

132
00:07:18,378 --> 00:07:20,618
I should not turn you down.

133
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:23,139
But I have to survive

134
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,298
to enjoy the wealth.

135
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:28,019
I've tested that cultivator

136
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:29,818
with the spirit-testing talisman.

137
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,019
Her spiritual power far surpasses mine.

138
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:38,219
I'm afraid I am not able
to take her down.

139
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:41,938
Don't worry, Imperial Preceptor.

140
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:45,498
Even my useless subordinates
managed to run away.

141
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,019
Let alone you.

142
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,219
I'll give you one last chance.

143
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:52,979
Don't embarrass me
in front of the Imperial Preceptor.

144
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:53,858
Understood.

145
00:07:57,779 --> 00:07:58,579
It's such a waste

146
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,979
for a useless one to possess

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,738
so much spiritual power.

148
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:04,298
If you could claim the spiritual power,

149
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:06,539
wouldn't that be the best?

150
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:08,618
Perhaps this ample spiritual power

151
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:11,339
can be of use to you.

152
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:22,178
Your Highness is truly farsighted.

153
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:25,539
I really admire you.

154
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:36,979
(Father,)

155
00:08:37,138 --> 00:08:39,099
(why did you summon me
so late at night?)

156
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,979
(I heard)

157
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:43,179
(that earlier tonight,)

158
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:46,378
(Rong sent someone to assassinate you.)

159
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:49,258
(Father.)

160
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,299
(Please take the Fushou I made for you.)

161
00:08:52,738 --> 00:08:53,939
(Don't be bothered)

162
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:55,378
(by our issues.)

163
00:08:55,538 --> 00:08:57,658
(You are always like this,)

164
00:08:58,258 --> 00:08:59,698
(just like your...)

165
00:08:59,778 --> 00:09:00,378
(Father.)

166
00:09:01,179 --> 00:09:02,419
(I will find a way)

167
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:04,099
(to reconcile with Rong.)

168
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:05,939
(Take it and rest early.)

169
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:12,192
Tian.

170
00:09:13,738 --> 00:09:14,378
What's wrong?

171
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,179
Don't tell anyone that Miss Hua and I

172
00:09:20,538 --> 00:09:21,819
were attacked tonight.

173
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:24,320
Tomorrow is the alchemy meeting.

174
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,618
I won't compete
with Ye Rong at the meeting.

175
00:09:27,738 --> 00:09:29,778
Our top priority is to heal Father.

176
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:32,498
I found a remedy in the pharmacopeia.

177
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,099
Miss Hua will do her best.

178
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:36,778
Tomorrow,

179
00:09:36,858 --> 00:09:38,419
she will tell you what to do.

180
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:39,498
I see.

181
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:43,059
Miss Hua knows how to cure people.

182
00:09:44,538 --> 00:09:47,179
Her sister Hua Rongyue
is a skilled fighter.

183
00:09:48,498 --> 00:09:49,618
I'm more at ease

184
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:51,258
with them here.

185
00:09:51,898 --> 00:09:52,416
Tian.

186
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:53,979
What are you trying to say?

187
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:55,979
Why do I feel...

188
00:09:56,059 --> 00:09:56,898
Ye Xun.

189
00:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,939
You are always impulsive

190
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,658
and reckless.

191
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,419
Be more careful

192
00:10:03,738 --> 00:10:04,819
and always think twice

193
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:06,378
in the future.

194
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:17,138
Why are you here?

195
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:19,099
I came tonight

196
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:21,059
to ask you a favor.

197
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:25,138
What is it?

198
00:10:26,378 --> 00:10:28,459
I think my brother
is hiding something from me,

199
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:30,378
and it might be extremely important

200
00:10:30,738 --> 00:10:31,898
and dangerous.

201
00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:34,579
I'm worried that

202
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:36,819
he'd risk his life

203
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:38,658
to defeat Crown Prince, Ye Rong.

204
00:10:39,258 --> 00:10:41,099
It is too hard to defeat
the Crown Prince.

205
00:10:41,898 --> 00:10:43,738
Once we go against him,

206
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:45,898
my brother will be in grave danger.

207
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:46,979
No way.

208
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,538
His Highness

209
00:10:48,618 --> 00:10:50,778
told me not to attend
the alchemy meeting tomorrow

210
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:52,579
to appease the Crown Prince

211
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:53,898
lest things get worse.

212
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,059
I know he's talked to you.

213
00:10:56,778 --> 00:10:57,979
What else did he say?

214
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:00,979
He asked me to take you out
to look for the cure tomorrow.

215
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,858
I think he's hoping that

216
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:05,618
I can find another Celestial Flower.

217
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:07,616
Something's wrong.

218
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:08,778
Don't listen to him.

219
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:10,898
Something will happen at the meeting.

220
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:13,819
You have strong spiritual power

221
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,819
and you saved my brother twice.

222
00:11:16,299 --> 00:11:17,138
Please

223
00:11:17,699 --> 00:11:19,459
attend the meeting
and protect my brother

224
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:21,419
tomorrow.

225
00:11:22,579 --> 00:11:24,419
This kingdom rules the world

226
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,018
by waging wars against other kingdoms.

227
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:28,418
My mother

228
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:30,618
was a princess from a distant land.

229
00:11:31,378 --> 00:11:34,419
After her kingdom fell,
she was taken by Father,

230
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,778
His Majesty, as a concubine

231
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,059
But we are not natives.

232
00:11:41,498 --> 00:11:44,139
His Majesty couldn't prevent

233
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:46,219
that led to my mother's death.

234
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:47,658
Since then,

235
00:11:48,419 --> 00:11:50,858
Ye Rong, Crown Prince, has been
tormenting my brother even more.

236
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,858
We couldn't save our mother

237
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,898
when we were young.

238
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:56,979
But today,

239
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,819
I can't let my brother step onto a path

240
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:00,339
of no return.

241
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:03,939
(If you want to live,)

242
00:12:04,138 --> 00:12:06,498
(don't take His Majesty's pulse.)

243
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:10,538
I'll think about it.

244
00:12:11,778 --> 00:12:12,419
Please.
