9
00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,734
As you killed the Asura,

10
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,295
your merits are immeasurable.

11
00:00:52,975 --> 00:00:54,815
Walk the Celestial Path

12
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:56,935
and you will become a true Celestial.

13
00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:59,454
I thought I became a Celestial
the moment

14
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:00,855
I came out of seclusion.

15
00:01:02,094 --> 00:01:04,774
Everything is as it was written
in the ancient scroll.

16
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:07,854
Asura is born from the darkness.

17
00:01:08,455 --> 00:01:09,934
After you slay the Asura,

18
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:12,615
this Yin-Yang Jade
will split into two pieces.

19
00:01:13,414 --> 00:01:15,214
Once you piece it up,

20
00:01:15,455 --> 00:01:17,175
you can step onto the Celestial Path

21
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,175
and become a true Celestial.

22
00:01:25,214 --> 00:01:26,175
(But it was)

23
00:01:26,494 --> 00:01:28,815
(already in two pieces when I woke up.)

24
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:32,735
Is this jade a gift from you, Master?

25
00:01:33,574 --> 00:01:34,934
How come I don't remember?

26
00:01:35,414 --> 00:01:36,735
You have forgotten many things

27
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:38,815
in the past five years.

28
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:40,694
But it doesn't matter.

29
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:42,815
Walk the Celestial Path.

30
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:31,614
Is this the staircase to the heavens?

31
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:36,975
Hua Zhaoyang,

32
00:02:37,174 --> 00:02:40,134
you've completed your cultivation
and taken down the Asura.

33
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,694
But if you want to
ascend as a Celestial,

34
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,215
there is one more trial.

35
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,095
What is it?

36
00:02:45,854 --> 00:02:48,015
Satisfy the strongest obsession

37
00:02:48,095 --> 00:02:49,854
in the mortal world

38
00:02:50,134 --> 00:02:51,935
and save the one who most needs saving.

39
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:22,614
Asura?

40
00:03:23,255 --> 00:03:25,614
Look for him
in the cycle of reincarnation.

41
00:03:25,894 --> 00:03:27,614
Remove the root

42
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:30,174
of his suffering in the past.

43
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,614
Transform the flower
bred by the darkness.

44
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:34,375
The jade pendant in your hand

45
00:03:34,535 --> 00:03:36,134
is born of heaven and earth.

46
00:03:36,294 --> 00:03:38,055
It is the only thing

47
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:40,815
that can escape reincarnation.

48
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,655
Your celestial power

49
00:03:42,935 --> 00:03:44,614
will be sealed into the spiritual jade

50
00:03:44,854 --> 00:03:47,294
and follow you into reincarnation.

51
00:03:47,854 --> 00:03:51,255
Your memories
will be sealed deep within your soul,

52
00:03:51,495 --> 00:03:53,414
waiting to be awakened.

53
00:04:01,055 --> 00:04:03,174
Asura is born from the darkness.

54
00:04:03,775 --> 00:04:05,335
After you slay the Asura,

55
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:08,014
this Yin-Yang Jade
will split into two pieces.

56
00:04:13,655 --> 00:04:14,574
I have a question.

57
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:19,294
How many times
has this jade been split up

58
00:04:19,374 --> 00:04:20,975
throughout the reincarnation?

59
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:26,814
Have I been trapped in a loop,

60
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:29,494
going over the same things?

61
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:33,975
This jade

62
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:36,854
seems to carry some burdensome memories.

63
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,734
You two are always so troublesome.

64
00:05:28,975 --> 00:05:29,975
What happened?

65
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,614
This is a world of constant ebb and flow

66
00:05:33,734 --> 00:05:35,614
where yin and yang
complement each other.

67
00:05:36,455 --> 00:05:39,414
All previous celestial beings
slew the Asuras.

68
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:42,215
All previous Asuras sought revenge.

69
00:05:42,614 --> 00:05:46,095
The light and darkness
achieved balance in this universe.

70
00:05:46,934 --> 00:05:49,254
But when it came to you and Ye Tian,

71
00:05:49,455 --> 00:05:50,934
everything went wrong.

72
00:05:51,374 --> 00:05:52,734
You had to fall in love

73
00:05:52,934 --> 00:05:55,854
with each other in every cycle.

74
00:05:56,695 --> 00:05:59,414
I gave you 3,000 chances.

75
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:00,975
But it was always like this,

76
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:02,734
forming an eternal cycle.

77
00:06:03,934 --> 00:06:05,775
The end becomes the beginning.

78
00:06:06,254 --> 00:06:08,655
The beginning becomes the end.

79
00:06:09,174 --> 00:06:10,095
But isn't it good

80
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:11,814
that I've woken up?

81
00:06:12,335 --> 00:06:14,895
I will remove your memory again.

82
00:06:15,455 --> 00:06:17,655
Even if you reincarnate 30,000 times,

83
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:21,095
you have to reach the destined end.

84
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,494
What if I refuse to comply?

85
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,095
(No one can defy the heavens.)

86
00:06:29,814 --> 00:06:31,854
Do you know what Ye Tian would say?

87
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:34,775
Heavens, my foot.

88
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,335
Do you remember me?

89
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:05,054
I haven't forgotten you for a moment.

90
00:07:10,575 --> 00:07:11,734
(I'm a cultivator.)

91
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:13,575

Tian,

156
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:02,614
she is just a fraud who's been applying

157
00:11:02,734 --> 00:11:03,935
to be the Imperial Preceptor.

158
00:11:04,254 --> 00:11:05,335
She just won't give up.

159
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:06,894
Let's meet her.

160
00:11:07,415 --> 00:11:08,975
It's an important position.

161
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,415
We can't be reckless.

162
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:12,935
Of course not.

163
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:17,254
Come in.

164
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:26,415
Greetings, Your Majesty.

165
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:41,095
You're the one who wants to be
the Imperial Preceptor?

166
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,695
It depends on the wage.

167
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,055
If you want to talk about the wage,

168
00:11:50,014 --> 00:11:52,815
why not consider another position?

169
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:09,095
Hua Rongyue.

00:12:14,295 --> 00:12:15,415
control your temper, okay?

173
00:12:16,254 --> 00:12:16,894
Shut up.

174
00:12:18,774 --> 00:12:19,335
Ye Xun,

175
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:21,014
just bear with it.

176
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,134
I'm only bringing

177
00:12:24,534 --> 00:12:25,614
someone here to apologize.

178
00:12:26,614 --> 00:12:27,734
Is this how you apologize?

179
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,175
I'm not the one apologizing.

180
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:31,374
Leave me alone.

181
00:12:32,734 --> 00:12:33,374
Ye Tian.

182
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:45,095
Long time no see.

183
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:20,614
What are you doing?

184
00:13:20,854 --> 00:13:21,415
How about it?

185
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:22,854
It's the new spell I learned.

186
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:24,134
Isn't it impressive?

187
00:13:24,854 --> 00:13:26,134
Impressive, my foot!

188
00:13:26,335 --> 00:13:26,975
Let go.

189
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:28,934
Master, do you feel

190
00:13:29,014 --> 00:13:30,654
that you need to learn another spell?

191
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:32,175
What spell?

192
00:13:32,335 --> 00:13:34,335
The spell to make me obedient.

193
00:13:35,254 --> 00:13:36,335
Is that so?

194
00:13:36,734 --> 00:13:37,614
Let's try it.

195
00:13:38,254 --> 00:13:39,654
- Kneel...
- Wait!

196
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:41,494
Don't you love the novel I wrote?

197
00:13:41,854 --> 00:13:43,455
I will finish it tonight

198
00:13:43,575 --> 00:13:45,215
and let you read it first, alright?

199
00:13:45,455 --> 00:13:47,134
Let's keep things separate, alright?

200
00:13:47,575 --> 00:13:48,095
Kneel.

201
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:48,975
No.

202
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:50,654
Come back.

203
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:52,455
- Come back, Ye Tian.
- No.

204
00:13:53,654 --> 00:13:54,254
Come back.

205
00:13:54,335 --> 00:13:54,975
Come here.

206
00:13:58,774 --> 00:14:00,134
- Don't run.
- Come and get me.

207
00:14:06,494 --> 00:14:08,134
This novel is quite in demand.

208
00:14:09,055 --> 00:14:10,774
Get all three books for a discount.

209
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:14,134
At dawn,
when the sky isn't fully bright,

210
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:16,374
it's the only time

211
00:14:17,134 --> 00:14:19,534
night and day can merge.

212
00:14:20,254 --> 00:14:22,654
This preface is quite cheesy.

213
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:24,774
That's the vibe.

214
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:26,215
I will give you

215
00:14:26,335 --> 00:14:27,415
an extra discount.

216
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,374
It's the perfect read for you.

217
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:32,055
The Dawn to the Night.

218
00:14:32,494 --> 00:14:35,095
