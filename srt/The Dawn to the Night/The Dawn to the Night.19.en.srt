9
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:09,702
Your cultivation talent is low.

10
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:11,702
Dantian and meridians

11
00:01:12,623 --> 00:01:14,422
are weaker than your peers.

12
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,543
And your physicality falls short.

13
00:01:20,103 --> 00:01:21,702
Does that mean

14
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:24,222
I can't protect Tian?

15
00:01:24,782 --> 00:01:25,502
Who says that?

16
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:30,623
Compared to Zhaoyang,
my cultivation talent

17
00:01:30,942 --> 00:01:31,942
is much lower.

18
00:01:32,942 --> 00:01:33,823
But I became

19
00:01:33,983 --> 00:01:35,183
Senior Sister of Guyue Sect

20
00:01:35,823 --> 00:01:36,942
by diligence.

21
00:01:37,862 --> 00:01:40,222
So, cultivation

22
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:42,023
requires not just talent,

23
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:44,183
but more so diligence and grit.

24
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:45,942
Such mindset

25
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:48,702
is far more important than talent.

26
00:01:52,502 --> 00:01:53,702
If you want to help

27
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:54,702
and protect Ye Tian,

28
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:56,103
I'll try other methods

29
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:57,383
to assist your cultivation.

30
00:01:58,663 --> 00:01:59,983
High-quality elixirs,

31
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,663
magical tools and talismans.

32
00:02:03,422 --> 00:02:05,383
These may cause you great pain.

33
00:02:06,623 --> 00:02:07,582
If you can endure it,

34
00:02:08,582 --> 00:02:10,463
you will rise above the rest.

35
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,543
What is there to be scared of?

36
00:02:17,022 --> 00:02:17,902
Thank you, Master.

37
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:25,302
You two never give me headaches.

38
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:27,263
Those two

39
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:30,022
are really troublesome.

40
00:02:30,742 --> 00:02:31,383
Master.

41
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:33,022
I'll fetch the longevity pills.

42
00:02:33,462 --> 00:02:34,263
Longevity pills?

43
00:02:36,182 --> 00:02:40,142
They might be useful
for those in 70s or 80s.

44
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,263
But I am

45
00:02:42,823 --> 00:02:44,622
over 2,000.

46
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,063
Longevity pills

47
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:48,343
won't work.

48
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:50,582
Why is it?

49
00:02:50,983 --> 00:02:51,983
Please don't say that.

50
00:03:00,302 --> 00:03:01,103
Ye Xun.

51
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:03,302
Great Master.

52
00:03:04,223 --> 00:03:07,422
What do you think of your Master?

53
00:03:08,422 --> 00:03:10,103
She didn't trust me at first.

54
00:03:10,702 --> 00:03:12,263
Perhaps she has found out the truth.

55
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:13,823
Now she treats me well.

56
00:03:14,343 --> 00:03:16,063
She didn't investigate you at all.

57
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:21,862
She just trusts you.

58
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:32,702
I will work hard.

59
00:03:32,943 --> 00:03:34,223
Never make her disappointed.

60
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,663
I trust you.

61
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:39,063
Actually,

62
00:03:39,582 --> 00:03:42,263
I need your help.

63
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:45,503
Please say it.

64
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:50,503
Zhaoyang is quick-witted.

65
00:03:51,422 --> 00:03:52,462
No matter what,

66
00:03:53,063 --> 00:03:54,422
she will live well.

67
00:03:55,223 --> 00:03:57,063
But for Rongyue,

68
00:03:58,063 --> 00:03:58,943
over these years,

69
00:03:59,622 --> 00:04:02,783
she buried in cultivation,

70
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:06,182
worrying about Zhaoyang.

71
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:09,063
That's not good.

72
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:11,343
Well...

73
00:04:12,902 --> 00:04:14,182
What should I do?

74
00:04:15,902 --> 00:04:18,022
If I knew, would I ask you?

75
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,622
Ye Tian

76
00:04:23,103 --> 00:04:25,903
always writes stories, right?

77
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:28,382
Yes.

78
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,622
Find some inspiration from them.

79
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:33,822
See if there is any way

80
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:37,742
to make your Master's life exciting

81
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:39,663
and lively.

82
00:04:40,703 --> 00:04:41,983
I will try my best.

83
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,703
In this way,

84
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:46,983
when Zhaoyang becomes Celestial,

85
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,302
you will become Rongyue's new companion.

86
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:56,302
(Ye Xun,)

87
00:04:57,382 --> 00:05:00,622
(are you ready to live without Ye Tian?)

88
00:05:11,183 --> 00:05:17,696
(Cultivation Arts)

89
00:05:27,343 --> 00:05:30,080
(Cultivation Arts)

90
00:05:33,862 --> 00:05:35,262
Master, are you looking for me?

91
00:05:39,703 --> 00:05:42,062
Where did you get this?

92
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:43,903
By the river.

93
00:05:46,903 --> 00:05:48,543
Have you read it?

94
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:49,382
No.

95
00:05:49,502 --> 00:05:50,542
It was soggy.

96
00:05:50,622 --> 00:05:51,623
I haven't read it.

97
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:52,302
Right.

98
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,302
It has been soaked.

99
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:55,742
I'll take it away.

100
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,742
I've dried it for you.

101
00:05:58,742 --> 00:05:59,382
Besides,

102
00:05:59,543 --> 00:06:00,862
this is your practice notes.

103
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,343
I should take a look.

104
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:03,143
Read it to me.

105
00:06:07,622 --> 00:06:08,862
It's nonsense.

106
00:06:09,262 --> 00:06:10,783
Not worth reading.

107
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,262
Read it.

108
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:47,023
The interplay of the spiritual power
between Yongquan and Waiguan acupoints.

109
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,583
Understanding of this skill

110
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:53,262
reminds me of my experience

111
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:56,143
in Northern Reaches.

112
00:06:57,143 --> 00:06:58,742
The brute force of that fierce beast

113
00:06:58,822 --> 00:07:00,543
parallels the connection

114
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,663
between these two acupoints.

115
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,463
Wait.

116
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:06,942
You've been to Northern Reaches?

117
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:09,862
Master,

118
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:11,703
you're interested?

119
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:12,983
No.

120
00:07:13,543 --> 00:07:14,262
Not really.

121
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:15,023
Just curious.

122
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:19,143
A frozen wasteland, barren and harsh.

123
00:07:19,903 --> 00:07:22,903
Ye Xun and I nearly died there.

124
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:27,143
Was there any tasty food?

125
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:28,742
Yes...

126
00:07:33,742 --> 00:07:34,663
Of course.

127
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:37,703
Tangerine pastries.

128
00:07:39,182 --> 00:07:41,223
Tangerine pastries?

129
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:44,783
Sounds delicious.

130
00:07:45,742 --> 00:07:47,502
Exactly.

131
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:48,983
After Ye Xun and I arrived there,

132
00:07:49,182 --> 00:07:50,783
we ate them every day.

133
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:53,622
They were so delicious.

134
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,742
Still can't forget them even now.

135
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:01,182
Anyway,

136
00:08:01,343 --> 00:08:03,223
it was particularly interesting.

137
00:08:03,463 --> 00:08:04,062
Of course,

138
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,343
besides these, there were also...

139
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,703
(Actually, she's quite cute.)

140
00:08:27,622 --> 00:08:28,663
(Not that annoying.)

141
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:35,063
Ye Tian.

142
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,142
Don't leave me.

143
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,823
Don't forget me, Ye Tian.

144
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,622
I see.

145
00:08:59,343 --> 00:09:00,142
I see.

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,382
Tian.

147
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:28,343
What are you doing here?

148
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,463
Xun,

149
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:32,583
if someone

150
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:33,902
keeps calling out

151
00:09:34,303 --> 00:09:36,142
someone's name in their sleep,

152
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:37,983
what does it mean?

153
00:09:40,382 --> 00:09:41,622
It means...

154
00:09:42,423 --> 00:09:43,622
She's dreaming of someone.

155
00:09:46,823 --> 00:09:49,583
Missing even in dreams?

156
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:54,063
No wonder

157
00:09:54,983 --> 00:09:57,423
she tried every means
to keep me in Guyue Sect.

158
00:09:58,703 --> 00:09:59,343
What?

159
00:10:02,823 --> 00:10:05,423
"You're completely unaware of my love."

160
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:09,303
Hua Zhaoyang might love me.

161
00:10:12,943 --> 00:10:15,583
Now I've become a heartbreaker.

162
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:20,992
Well...

163
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:28,862
(Cultivation Arts)
This is Ye Tian's notes?

164
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:30,303
That's right.

165
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:34,223
I would call it innovative.

166
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:38,823
Really... Bold.

167
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:39,983
Indeed.

168
00:10:40,463 --> 00:10:42,902
Do you like it?

169
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:46,022
The prose is vivid. Worth pondering.

170
00:10:46,742 --> 00:10:47,303
Pondering.

171
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:53,542
Her skin glowed.

172
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:56,022
Veins alight with spiritual power...

173
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,542
Stop it.

174
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,463
Yes, Master.

175
00:11:03,943 --> 00:11:06,183
Veins alight?

176
00:11:11,262 --> 00:11:14,382
What are they plotting?

177
00:11:16,022 --> 00:11:19,303
You still have the mind
to think about that?

178
00:11:21,463 --> 00:11:22,183
What?

179
00:11:22,463 --> 00:11:23,983
Why are you acting so weird?

180
00:11:24,703 --> 00:11:25,303
And you?

181
00:11:26,382 --> 00:11:27,423
Your heart

182
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:30,022
is filled with heavy emotions,

183
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,583
