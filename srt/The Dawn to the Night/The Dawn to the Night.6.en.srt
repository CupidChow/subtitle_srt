9
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:36,616
Such a blood smell

10
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:39,136
only comes from the legendary Asura.

11
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:42,856
As expected, Ye Tian is the Asura.

12
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:44,936
Ye Tian.

13
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:46,616
Danger!

14
00:01:49,216 --> 00:01:49,815
Ye Tian.

15
00:01:52,015 --> 00:01:53,455
Ye Tian, don't be afraid.

16
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,015
I am here to save you.

17
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:56,175
I'll kiss you

18
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:57,295
to restore my memories.

19
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:58,496
Then I'll try to save you.

20
00:02:13,255 --> 00:02:13,975
Ye Tian.

21
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:21,975
Ye Tian, wake up!

22
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:24,375
Wake up!

23
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:41,496
If you wake up,

24
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:43,496
return her memories to her.

25
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:51,616
Stand behind me.

26
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:55,815
Imperial Preceptor.

27
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:56,375
Don't worry.

28
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:58,575
I can't hurt him now.

29
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:00,535
Thunder and Lightning.

30
00:04:01,535 --> 00:04:02,415
Heaven and Earth.

31
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,255
Ghosts and Stars.

32
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:07,575
Zhaoyang is there.

33
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,936
I can no longer protect her.

34
00:05:08,135 --> 00:05:08,976
Do you remember me?

35
00:05:46,736 --> 00:05:47,695
I once used

36
00:05:47,775 --> 00:05:49,215
this Celestial Flower to save him.

37
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:53,024
Why has it become the Death Flower,
containing his resentment?

38
00:05:55,255 --> 00:05:56,335
His resentment

39
00:05:57,135 --> 00:05:58,656
can only be defused by himself?

40
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,575
(Now, he should have
reverted to Ye Tian.)

41
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:06,056
(I need to find him.)

42
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:09,656
Celestial, what is going on?

43
00:06:11,736 --> 00:06:12,544
Imperial Preceptor.

44
00:06:13,096 --> 00:06:14,416
You watch over the Death Flower.

45
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:16,936
Don't let his resentment
invade the city.

46
00:06:18,816 --> 00:06:19,375
Wait.

47
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:21,575
Celestial.

48
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:23,335
I can offer everything

49
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,496
to know how to cultivate

50
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:26,856
into a celestial being.

51
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:30,815
Not everyone

52
00:06:31,455 --> 00:06:32,856
has to become a celestial being.

53
00:06:33,656 --> 00:06:34,416
Imperial Preceptor.

54
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:36,616
You will definitely

55
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,015
become a good grandmaster,

56
00:06:38,936 --> 00:06:41,496
founding a sect
and leading the righteous people.

57
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,096
You will lead true celestial beings.

58
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,695

I understood many things.

73

The reason you came

74
00:08:04,015 --> 00:08:04,815
to find me is

75
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:07,416
that I'm about
to become the most terrifying monster

76
00:08:07,496 --> 00:08:08,815
and bring disaster to the world.

77
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:09,736
Am I right?

78
00:08:11,695 --> 00:08:13,176
At least it can be changed now.

79
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:15,856
And you

80
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:19,096
are the only celestial being
in this world.

81
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:21,736

82
00:08:22,255 --> 00:08:23,575
and your mission.

83
00:08:24,856 --> 00:08:26,056
We're meant to be

84
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:28,575
against each other.

85
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:31,536
The night falls, and the run rises.

86
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:34,775
To you,

87
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,936
(Poison Formula)
I'm like the poison.

88
00:08:42,095 --> 00:08:42,855
I'm dangerous,

89
00:08:44,136 --> 00:08:45,056
lethal,

90
00:08:46,296 --> 00:08:47,855
and must be eradicated.

91
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,815
You are not a lethal poison.

92
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:57,936
Don't belittle yourself.

93
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:02,056
I'll find a way

94
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,056
to rid you of your darkness.

95
00:09:05,095 --> 00:09:06,735
No, you can't.

96
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,016
I want everyone in the city to die.

97
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:15,855
They'll die for my dead heart and grief.

98
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:18,296
What?

99
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:20,176
What do you mean?

100
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:22,615
You know what I mean.

101
00:09:24,896 --> 00:09:25,735
Hua Zhaoyang.

102
00:09:31,615 --> 00:09:34,256
You are a celestial being.

103
00:09:35,936 --> 00:09:38,016
You should know

104
00:09:38,615 --> 00:09:39,695
I can't become the Asura

105
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,136
with my own hatred.

106
00:09:42,896 --> 00:09:44,215
Throughout the entire world,

107
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,095
everyone's sorrows

108
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:47,495
and indignation

109
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:50,416
have flowed into me now.

110
00:09:51,575 --> 00:09:53,015
Can you really remove the hatred

111
00:09:53,095 --> 00:09:54,215
completely?

112
00:09:55,575 --> 00:09:57,016
Other than killing me,

113
00:09:57,575 --> 00:09:59,416
you seem to have no choice.

114
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:12,855
Wake up!

115
00:10:20,815 --> 00:10:22,056
I'm very curious.

116
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:26,215
Back then,
if you had memories of your past self

117
00:10:26,495 --> 00:10:27,695
and knew the Celestial Flower

118
00:10:28,256 --> 00:10:30,095
would lead to the birth
of the Death Flower,

119
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,176
would you still be willing to save me?

120
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:46,335
Do you know the current situation?

121
00:10:48,455 --> 00:10:49,335
Let me tell you.

122
00:10:51,416 --> 00:10:55,215
I have turned the Celestial Flower
into the Death Flower.

123
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:59,056
It's tainted with hatred, like a poison.

124
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,575
I've scattered it in the air

125
00:11:02,855 --> 00:11:04,136
and in the river,

126
00:11:05,095 --> 00:11:08,095
so everyone
in this city will be infected.

127
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,656
They will go mad.

128
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:14,975
After that,
they will seek their own death

129
00:11:15,855 --> 00:11:17,016
to get relief.

130
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:24,376
I placed the Asura Sword
in the herbal shop.

131
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,136
It's congealed from petals.

132
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:29,296
It is the root of hatred.

133
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,176
You can retrieve it only by killing me.

134
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:35,536
If I die,

135
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:38,095
what will happen?

136
00:11:40,936 --> 00:11:42,056
If you die,

137
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:44,455
the Asura will be reborn.

138
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:46,615
He will be reincarnated again.

139
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:53,136
Due to fate, the Asura will still

140
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,296
choose me, a wretched person.

141
00:11:56,335 --> 00:11:57,495
As a celestial being,

142
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:00,815
you can't evade your responsibility.

143
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:03,896
You have to go through the cycles
of time,

144
00:12:05,296 --> 00:12:05,815
right?

145
00:12:11,136 --> 00:12:14,416
Then why not make a choice now?

146
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:19,335
Either take me back to the palace,

147
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:22,416
save my life,
and then find a good solution,

148
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:23,896
or

149
00:12:25,335 --> 00:12:26,815
kill me

150
00:12:27,975 --> 00:12:28,975
