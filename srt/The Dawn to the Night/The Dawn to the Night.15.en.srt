end me.

11

That should be the best choice.

12
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:56,422
No!

13
00:01:01,503 --> 00:01:02,062
Celestial,

14
00:01:03,742 --> 00:01:04,622
just do it.

15
00:01:13,542 --> 00:01:14,102
Ye Tian.

16
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:15,703
Come out with me.

17
00:01:16,742 --> 00:01:18,542
I will tell you everything I saw

18
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:19,742
in the flower sea.

19
00:01:42,623 --> 00:01:45,542
In this life, you harbor kindness,

20
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:48,262
yet Death Flower's not eradicated.

21
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,143
What fostered its growth

22
00:01:51,863 --> 00:01:53,382
is the obsession from your past life.

23
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:56,503
My past life?

24
00:01:59,022 --> 00:02:00,262
Ye Tian in the past life,

25
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:02,262
in the flower sea,

26
00:02:03,783 --> 00:02:05,022
waited me for 1,000 years.

27
00:02:08,143 --> 00:02:09,983
You loved each other, right?

28
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,262
I didn't know what love was once.

29
00:02:21,623 --> 00:02:23,382
But after retracing his steps,

30
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,862
and finding the small item
he kept across centuries,

31
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,422
I understood what love is.

32
00:02:32,582 --> 00:02:33,422
Love is

33
00:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,223
refusing to let go.

34
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:45,382
In his past life,
I erased his memories completely.

35
00:02:46,422 --> 00:02:47,063
So,

36
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:48,982
he always had

37
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:50,662
a desire to meet me again.

38
00:02:51,382 --> 00:02:52,382
And this desire

39
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:55,463
now resides in you.

40
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:57,783
He always wanted to know the truth.

41
00:03:00,223 --> 00:03:01,223
But I couldn't tell him.

42
00:03:02,422 --> 00:03:03,463
Revealing it

43
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,303
would have driven him away.

44
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:16,982
The Asura plague spreads extremely fast.

45
00:03:18,063 --> 00:03:21,542
If it takes my death to end all this,

46
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:23,783
then be it.

47
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,503
Your death is futile.

48
00:03:44,903 --> 00:03:45,862
Even if you die,

49
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,262
you will reincarnate,

50
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:50,503
and the plague will persist.

51
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:52,982
At least...

52
00:03:54,702 --> 00:03:55,982
This is my own decision.

53
00:03:59,982 --> 00:04:00,943
Will you hate me?

54
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:03,743
In this life,

55
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,702
I took the Love-Killing Pill willingly

56
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:08,743
to erase you.

57
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:11,702
I understand.

58
00:04:14,102 --> 00:04:15,343
If I were you,

59
00:04:15,743 --> 00:04:17,142
I might make the same choice.

60
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:20,382
But we have to admit,

61
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:23,303
the one who remembers suffers most.

62
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,142
That Ye Tian you speak of

63
00:04:28,342 --> 00:04:29,262
would ache

64
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,503
with unanswered questions.

65
00:05:00,743 --> 00:05:01,743
Think carefully?

66
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:06,462
At the end of my past life,

67
00:05:07,782 --> 00:05:09,983
I erased myself from his memories.

68
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:11,863
That's all.

69
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,063
It was because of this decision

70
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,063
that you had an obsession to see me.

71
00:05:24,262 --> 00:05:26,782
I caused your confusion.

72
00:05:28,503 --> 00:05:29,663
I see.

73
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:39,262
End me.

74
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:45,262
Don't let the people suffer
because of me anymore.

75
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:51,543
What about my pain?

76
00:05:56,342 --> 00:05:59,303
Now, I finally know

77
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:03,382
what true love is.

78
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:07,303
Hua Zhaoyang in this life

79
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,022
helped me sort out my thoughts.

80
00:06:10,743 --> 00:06:12,303
The reason I become a celestial being

81
00:06:13,462 --> 00:06:15,262
is to quell the Asura's chaos.

82
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,503
If Asura vanishes,

83
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,902
celestial beings will be useless.

84
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:25,503
I've decided to go with you.

85
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:29,022
What are you up to?

86
00:06:33,022 --> 00:06:34,142
This Yin-Yang Jade

87
00:06:34,543 --> 00:06:36,022
sealed my celestial power

88
00:06:36,743 --> 00:06:38,983
when I fell

89
00:06:39,943 --> 00:06:41,022
into reincarnation.

90
00:06:43,262 --> 00:06:44,702
I want to repair it.

91
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:50,183
But to repair it

92
00:06:51,303 --> 00:06:54,342
requires a precious catalyst.

93
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:58,183
My memories

94
00:06:59,582 --> 00:07:00,543

I will forget you.

Tian.

118
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:09,862
What's wrong?

119
00:09:11,543 --> 00:09:12,063
Ye Xun,

120
00:09:13,183 --> 00:09:15,023
I just had a bizarre dream.

121
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,303
In the dream,
I lost control of the Asura plague.

122
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:21,543
I came here to tell you about this.

123
00:09:22,183 --> 00:09:23,303
Don't worry about it.

124
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:26,303
It has been completely eradicated.

125
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:29,023
When?

126
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:31,822
I'm not sure.

127
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,222
But I awoke before you,

128
00:09:34,143 --> 00:09:36,462
and I met Tian Lantern,
the leader of Guyue Sect.

129
00:09:37,263 --> 00:09:38,582
He told me bluntly

130
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:41,822
that they came to end the plague
by massacring the city.

131
00:09:42,183 --> 00:09:44,622
However, when he's about to act,

132
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:45,943
he confirmed

133
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:48,023
that Tiandu City's safe.

134
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,263
There wasn't any

135
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:52,342
Asura's darkness inside.

136
00:09:54,582 --> 00:09:55,543
Why is that?

137
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,423
Tian Lantern said,

138
00:09:58,862 --> 00:10:01,183
perhaps celestial beings intervened.

139
00:10:03,943 --> 00:10:04,742
Celestial beings?

140
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:07,383
By the way,

141
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:10,822
she also came.

142
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:13,462
Then she...

143
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:14,822
I have told you.

144
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:16,502
You should let go.

145
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:20,822
She...

146
00:10:21,943 --> 00:10:23,622
She has forgotten you.

147
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:42,263
