00:00:54,836 --> 00:00:55,872
Bubbling Cauldron Pulse.

10
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:58,115
One of the worst pulses.

11
00:00:58,755 --> 00:00:59,675
Hyperdynamic yet empty.

12
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:02,116
Rootless like floating in boiling water.

13
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,236
Bubbling Cauldron Pulse?

14
00:01:03,435 --> 00:01:03,995
How did His...

15
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:06,075
How did he get hurt?

16
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:08,236
These look like external wounds.

17
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:10,275
How come it's so serious?

18
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:11,596
Well...

19
00:01:11,755 --> 00:01:12,956
I don't get it, either.

20
00:01:13,516 --> 00:01:14,624
Temperature is dropping.

21
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:16,475
He's a goner.

22
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:18,035
What?

23
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:20,436
It can't happen. This is...

24
00:01:23,436 --> 00:01:24,195
Not yet.

25
00:01:25,596 --> 00:01:26,436
The Celestial Flower

26
00:01:26,516 --> 00:01:27,716
contains spiritual aura,

27
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:29,675
benevolence and purity.

28
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:32,395
If the legend is true,

29
00:01:33,076 --> 00:01:33,996
then it can save him.

30
00:01:34,475 --> 00:01:36,596
Zhaoyang, you're willing to do that?

31
00:01:37,035 --> 00:01:37,755
No matter what,

32
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:39,835
life matters the most.

33
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:51,475
Crown Prince.

34
00:01:52,156 --> 00:01:54,356
Ye Tian indeed went to a pharmacy.

35
00:01:54,436 --> 00:01:56,076
It seems he is being treated.

36
00:01:56,195 --> 00:01:57,076
I see.

37
00:01:57,475 --> 00:01:58,236
Your Highness.

38
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:00,356
Ye Tian is so weak now.

39
00:02:00,796 --> 00:02:02,475
Do we really need to keep an eye on him?

40
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:05,796
The fact I can stand here
means I trust no one.

41
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,395
(My injuries have healed.)

42
00:02:32,956 --> 00:02:34,756
Celestial Flower.

43
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,675
Celestial Flower.

44
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:46,476
My precious Celestial Flower.

45
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:50,636
(Celestial Flower?)

46
00:02:55,236 --> 00:02:57,275
Celestial Flower.

47
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,320
(Two days later)

48
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:10,076
All the princes are inviting cultivators

49
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:11,916
to His Majesty's alchemy meeting.

50
00:03:12,435 --> 00:03:13,715
The whole world knows

51
00:03:14,316 --> 00:03:17,115
that His Majesty is interested
in obtaining immortality.

52
00:03:17,476 --> 00:03:18,636
I'm not interested.

53
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,576
(Ye Xun, Ye Tian's younger brother)
Tian.

54
00:03:23,115 --> 00:03:24,196
Immortality?

55
00:03:25,435 --> 00:03:28,275
There is only
good and evil in this world.

56
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:31,875
Things like celestial beings and Asuras

57
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:34,316
exist only in fictional novels.

58
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:35,995
You believe those?

59
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,155
Don't you?

60
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:43,875
Let's say there are really Celestials

61
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,915
who are not showing up

62
00:03:45,995 --> 00:03:47,036
because they don't

63
00:03:47,356 --> 00:03:48,796
want to deal with the mortals.

64
00:03:49,675 --> 00:03:50,555
What about Asuras?

65
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,196
If there were really Asuras,

66
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:55,995
why wouldn't they come to dominate

67
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:56,956
the mortal world?

68
00:03:57,756 --> 00:03:58,995
We both know

69
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,355
that it doesn't matter

70
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:01,636
whether those beings exist.

71
00:04:02,036 --> 00:04:02,675
Besides,

72
00:04:03,275 --> 00:04:04,036
we know...

73
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,916
We know how His Majesty is doing.

74
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:09,796
Now all the princes

75
00:04:10,275 --> 00:04:12,196
are competing for the throne.

76
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,916
You don't ask cultivators for cures,

77
00:04:15,036 --> 00:04:17,155
but rather read poison encyclopedia.

78
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:20,155
Herbs and poison are essentially one.

79
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:21,676
The cure for Father

80
00:04:21,756 --> 00:04:24,235
may lie in the poison encyclopedia.

81
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,835
(Tian Lantern, Imperial Preceptor)
(Besides,)

82
00:04:26,835 --> 00:04:28,795
(even the top cultivator Tian Lantern)

83
00:04:29,196 --> 00:04:31,155
(can't cure Father's illness.)

84
00:04:32,196 --> 00:04:33,636
(What's the point of looking for)

85
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:35,235
(other cultivators?)

86
00:04:37,035 --> 00:04:37,715
Sure.

87
00:04:39,795 --> 00:04:40,636
You make the call.

88
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:41,915
It's up to you.

89
00:04:45,196 --> 00:04:47,196
Tian, are we really not preparing

90
00:04:47,395 --> 00:04:48,795
for that alchemy meeting?

91
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:51,795
Rest assured.

92
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:54,676
Of course, I have plans.

93
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:07,956
Alright, I'm off.

94
00:05:22,076 --> 00:05:22,715
Shopkeeper.

95
00:05:23,155 --> 00:05:24,275
What were you talking about?

96
00:05:26,795 --> 00:05:27,516
Listen.

97
00:05:27,715 --> 00:05:29,235
He's totally unreliable.

98
00:05:29,355 --> 00:05:30,516
I saved him last time.

99
00:05:30,676 --> 00:05:32,955
He left without
saying a word or paying me.

100
00:05:33,035 --> 00:05:34,752
My Celestial Flower was precious.

101
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,595
From now on,

102
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,235
you two will have nothing to do with me.

103
00:05:38,996 --> 00:05:40,475
- What do you mean?
- That young man

104
00:05:40,835 --> 00:05:43,075
squared the book for you just now.

105
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,035
And I gave him your labor contract.

106
00:05:45,116 --> 00:05:47,436
He will be the one assigning you tasks.

107
00:05:48,275 --> 00:05:50,795
Wait, you gave him
my three-year labor contract?

108
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:53,196
That won't do.
What if their meals are terrible?

109
00:05:53,556 --> 00:05:55,636
But he has paid me.

110
00:05:55,915 --> 00:05:57,475
Besides, I can't sustain someone

111
00:05:57,715 --> 00:05:59,035
with your appetite.

112
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:00,356
- But...
- Enough.

113
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:01,116
Get going.

114
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:12,756
Thank you for saving me.

115
00:06:14,035 --> 00:06:15,556
Is this how you thank me?

116
00:06:17,475 --> 00:06:18,556
Is there a problem?

117
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:21,715
I did choose to save you

118
00:06:21,795 --> 00:06:22,956
with my Celestial Flower.

119
00:06:23,355 --> 00:06:25,275
But it doesn't mean you can buy me off

120
00:06:25,355 --> 00:06:26,395
as if I'm an object.

121
00:06:27,996 --> 00:06:30,676
Well, Miss Hua, I...

122
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:31,915
Don't call me Miss Hua.

123
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:33,475
I'm a cultivator.

124
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:35,395
Call me Taoist Master Hua.

125
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,192
Taoist Master Hua.

126
00:06:40,395 --> 00:06:41,275
Please tell me.

127
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,395
How should I return the favor?

128
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:45,715
You can give me that.

129
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:47,516
Taoist Master Hua.

130
00:06:48,956 --> 00:06:51,035
I advise you to think it over carefully.

131
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:52,715
No need.

132
00:06:52,876 --> 00:06:53,956
You can have

133
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:56,835
whatever you want for meals
three times a day.

134
00:07:01,636 --> 00:07:03,035
Work for three years here.

135
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,876
But you only have to work
for me for three months.

136
00:07:11,756 --> 00:07:12,275
Deal.

137
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,035
You're really a prince?

138
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:22,795
Tian.

139
00:07:26,355 --> 00:07:27,275
Who are you?

140
00:07:27,876 --> 00:07:29,636
Ye Xun, don't be rude.

141
00:07:30,835 --> 00:07:33,116
They are the cultivators
I invited for Father's

142
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:34,556
alchemy meeting.

143
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:36,116
Cultivators?

144
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:37,756
Tian.

145
00:07:38,155 --> 00:07:40,395
Don't be tricked
by these herbalist frauds.

146
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:41,956
Who's a fraud?

147
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:44,795
I saved your brother
with a Celestial Flower.

148
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:45,876
Celestial Flower?

149
00:07:45,996 --> 00:07:47,275
He doesn't believe in that.

150
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:48,556
Ask him again.

151
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:52,355
Ladies.

152
00:07:52,876 --> 00:07:53,956
I have told the servants

153
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,355
to get your rooms ready.

154
00:07:55,956 --> 00:07:56,876
Please take a rest.

155
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:05,835
Tian.

156
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,556
So this is your plan?

157
00:08:28,076 --> 00:08:31,155
Ye Tian is a nice guy.

158
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,956
He's serving me
delicacies and fine drinks.

159
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:38,436
And he gives me such a big room to stay.

160
00:08:39,515 --> 00:08:41,355
Had I known, I would have come earlier.

161
00:08:41,556 --> 00:08:43,115
Three months won't be a problem.

162
00:09:07,396 --> 00:09:10,235
Where did this jade pendant come from?

163
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:38,875
What a strong spiritual power.

164
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:42,355
Is it from the sixth prince's chamber?

165
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:47,676
(Let me spy on this person)

166
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:49,676
(with this spirit-testing talisman.)

167
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:52,396
Miss Hua.

168
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:02,715
