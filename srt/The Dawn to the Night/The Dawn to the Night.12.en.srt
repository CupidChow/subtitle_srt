9
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,303
Ye Tian never has the ability

10
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:52,584
to end the Asura plague.

11
00:00:53,743 --> 00:00:54,743
You're lying.

12
00:00:58,783 --> 00:00:59,584
She is not.

13
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,143
Since the Asura plague began,

14
00:01:07,544 --> 00:01:09,104
he has been absorbing the Death Flower

15
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:10,943
into his body.

16
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:13,503
What?

17
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:15,503
Is what she said true?

18
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,624
I have no reason to lie.

19
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:19,264
I came here

20
00:01:19,943 --> 00:01:21,264
to handle the Asura.

21
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:23,904
Once I succeed,

22
00:01:25,024 --> 00:01:27,863
the Asura plague will end.

23
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:36,783
I will be the Asura, right?

24
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:41,024
Otherwise,
why can I absorb the Death Flower?

25
00:01:59,664 --> 00:02:00,503
What can I do?

26
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:05,664
I need to enter your consciousness

27
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:08,783
to find the Asura Flower
that belongs to you.

28
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,064
The Asura Flower that belongs to me?

29
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,903
You are a good person
and have never done evil

30
00:02:16,104 --> 00:02:17,023
in this life.

31
00:02:17,463 --> 00:02:18,463
I need to find out

32
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:21,303
why the Death Flower takes root

33
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,384
and why you still can't free yourself.

34
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:28,344
Remove my Asura Flower,

35
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:30,023
and the Asura plague will end.

36
00:02:32,504 --> 00:02:33,264
I will help you.

37
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:35,824
Well...

38
00:02:36,303 --> 00:02:36,864
Don't worry.

39
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,064
Hua Zhaoyang still exists.

40
00:02:41,824 --> 00:02:42,863
Even if I leave,

41
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,023
she will be back.

42
00:03:32,784 --> 00:03:36,143
Which flower is Ye Tian's?

43
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:40,984
Is it you?

44
00:04:00,903 --> 00:04:02,903
In this endless sea of flowers,

45
00:04:04,303 --> 00:04:05,903
I have waited for a thousand years.

46
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,504
I seem to have been waiting for you.

47
00:04:14,224 --> 00:04:15,224
What is your name?

48
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:44,144
Why do you appear
in the sea of the Death Flower?

49
00:04:46,623 --> 00:04:48,063
Death Flower?

50
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:51,263
What a beautiful name.

51
00:04:53,344 --> 00:04:54,544
Did you plant these flowers

52
00:04:55,544 --> 00:04:56,984
by yourself?

53
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:02,664
They grow naturally.

54
00:05:04,623 --> 00:05:07,144
At first, there were
a few scattered ones here.

55
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:09,584
Until now,

56
00:05:10,904 --> 00:05:12,464
it has become a sea of flowers.

57
00:05:16,623 --> 00:05:18,183
Their desires are as strong

58
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:20,704
as mine.

59
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,823
Are you the celestial being in my heart?

60
00:05:28,263 --> 00:05:29,423
Have I been waiting for you?

61
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:32,984
Wait for me?

62
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:34,823
Why?

63
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:38,263
I don't know either.

64
00:05:40,144 --> 00:05:41,584
Since I ascended to the throne

65
00:05:42,104 --> 00:05:43,263
a thousand years ago,

66
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,623
I've had such an obsession.

67
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:13,184
(Hua Rongyue,
senior disciple of the Guyue Sect)

68
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:22,904
Hua Rongyue.

69
00:06:25,024 --> 00:06:26,024
You actually remember me.

70
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:31,784
Are you here to take Hua Zhaoyang away?

71
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:36,823
No. I don't want to bother
with my troublesome sister.

72
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:38,863
I'm here to see Ye Tian.

73
00:06:39,464 --> 00:06:42,584
I hear he has been containing
the plague in Tiandu City.

74
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:46,303
He is not available.

75
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:49,024
You cannot see him.

76
00:06:52,144 --> 00:06:52,743
Alright,

77
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,104
it doesn't matter.

78
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,503
Then I'll ask you.

79
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,224
Did Ye Tian already lose the ability

80
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:01,544
to absorb darkness?

81
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:05,544
(How did she know?)

82
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,104
Alright, I already have the answer.

83
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:16,263
Goodbye.

84
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:30,743
So, you're waiting
for a celestial being.

85
00:07:32,623 --> 00:07:33,303
At first,

86
00:07:33,784 --> 00:07:35,344
I always thought so.

87
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:37,704
But now that I see you,

88
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:39,263
I feel even more

89
00:07:39,784 --> 00:07:41,344
that the person I want to see is you.

90
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,344
You haven't told me

91
00:07:46,743 --> 00:07:47,464
who you are.

92
00:07:48,383 --> 00:07:49,544
Do we know each other?

93
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:01,104
If you don't want to say,

94
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:02,423
it's okay.

95
00:08:03,544 --> 00:08:04,784
I was presumptuous.

96
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,584
What I said seems to be groundless,

97
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,104
but actually, it is true.

98
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,383
This is my flower.

99
00:08:54,263 --> 00:08:55,184
I'm giving it back.

100
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:00,464
Giving it back?

101
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:04,903
I don't know why I said so.

102
00:09:06,824 --> 00:09:07,704
You were right.

103
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,863
Ye Tian.

104
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:14,344
Ye Tian?

105
00:09:19,783 --> 00:09:21,064
That's my name.

106
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:24,263
I haven't heard that name
for a thousand years.

107
00:09:25,863 --> 00:09:26,663
So,

108
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:28,064
we know each other?

109
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:32,663
My name is Hua Zhaoyang.

110
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:34,783
The story between us

111
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,704
is full of trouble.

112
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:39,143
Trouble?

113
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:42,743
So, something must have happened
between us.

114
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:45,344
I want to know.

115
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:52,224
(Turns out the Death Flower
of the Asura might not lead to darkness.)

116
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,863
(You are his obsession in this life.)

117
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:57,543
(You became his Death Flower.)

118
00:10:00,984 --> 00:10:03,543
Can you tell me?

119
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:08,104
(I will take you to see.)

120
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,783
You are a general in this life.

121
00:10:29,304 --> 00:10:29,984
General?

122
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,464
- Go to the imperial city with me.
- Imperial city?

123
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:39,783
Those people
in the court are unreliable.

124
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,184
If they want to end the Asura plague,

125
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,143
they won't leave Tian here alone.

126
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,304
They didn't even
give him sufficient men.

127
00:10:47,824 --> 00:10:49,184
It has nothing to do with that.

128
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,064
He must go with me.

129
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:53,824
I have to figure out

130
00:10:54,023 --> 00:10:55,224
what exactly is going on.

131
00:10:58,743 --> 00:10:59,344
Ye Xun,

132
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:01,344
you stay here and wait for us.

133
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,783
This place has never changed.

134
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:31,143
It's rare.

135
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:33,704
However,

136
00:11:33,903 --> 00:11:35,184
after you brought me back,

137
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:37,023
the people in the court...

138
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:38,584
Don't worry.

139
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:40,783
I have used the celestial power

140
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,424
to make them sleep.

141
00:11:46,184 --> 00:11:47,224
I vaguely remember

142
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,304
when I ascended to the throne,

143
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,224
I asked the Imperial Preceptor

144
00:11:51,304 --> 00:11:52,663
about celestial beings.

145
00:11:53,824 --> 00:11:54,663
Imperial Preceptor?

146
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,424
Did he remember me?

147
00:11:58,623 --> 00:11:59,584
No, he didn't.

148
00:12:00,783 --> 00:12:03,623
However,
not long after I ascended the throne,

149
00:12:04,184 --> 00:12:05,783
he found an auspicious place

150
00:12:06,304 --> 00:12:07,503
and established Guyue Sect.

151
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:11,224
I named it Guyue Sect.

152
00:12:11,663 --> 00:12:13,623
I didn't know that before.

153
00:12:23,383 --> 00:12:24,464
Back then,

154
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,383
outside this door,

155
00:12:27,143 --> 00:12:29,023
I removed the Death Flower
from your body.

156
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:31,903
If I hurt you

157
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,424
in the end,

158
00:12:35,424 --> 00:12:36,424
