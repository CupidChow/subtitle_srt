00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:36,392
But I know a simple truth.

20
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,711
You shouldn't bear

You lied to me.

42
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,471
So,

43
00:03:00,751 --> 00:03:03,191
you never planned to poison the city,

44
00:03:03,488 --> 00:03:04,072
right?

45
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:06,871
The plan

46
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,871
truly existed.

47
00:03:11,512 --> 00:03:14,031
All my hatred is real.

48
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,552
When did you give up on it?

49
00:03:21,031 --> 00:03:21,832
Right here,

50
00:03:23,552 --> 00:03:25,311
when you saved me with Celestial Flower.

51
00:03:27,591 --> 00:03:28,792
I've always been ready

52
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:31,112
to face death openly.

53
00:03:32,272 --> 00:03:33,552
But your presence

54
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:35,871
makes me start longing

55
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,911
for the next dawn.

56
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:42,871
How's your body?

57
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:45,352
Just now,

58
00:03:47,031 --> 00:03:49,751
Celestial Flower returned to my body.

59
00:03:51,151 --> 00:03:51,952
I'm fine now.

60
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:56,311
You purged your own darkness.

61
00:03:57,392 --> 00:03:59,672
I merely nudged it along.

62
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:05,711
What about the next?

63
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:07,871
What are you going to do?

64
00:04:08,512 --> 00:04:09,711
Why not stay?

65
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,711
- We can...
- Ye Tian.

66
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:14,911
I must leave.

67
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:19,472
I'll return to Celestial Path

68
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,120
to become a celestial being.

69
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,112
This is my mission.

70
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:31,592
I understand.

71
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,871
Celestials have their responsibilities.

72
00:04:35,751 --> 00:04:36,511
Just

73
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,511
visit when you can.

74
00:04:42,232 --> 00:04:43,032
(Ye Tian.)

75
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:44,472
(You don't know.)

76
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:47,111
(I must erase everyone's memories)

77
00:04:47,191 --> 00:04:48,191
(of me,)

78
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:49,871
(including yours.)

79
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:05,672
She is leaving.

80
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:09,032
You'll leave too,

81
00:05:09,871 --> 00:05:10,391
right?

82
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:11,912
Yes.

83
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:16,191
I wish to establish a sect,

84
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:18,792
preaching and teaching.

85
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,631
Is it also her suggestion?

86
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,751
It's more than that.

87
00:05:25,112 --> 00:05:25,791
This manual

88
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,672
contains insights
of celestial cultivation.

89
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:29,831
It may help you.

90
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:31,712
I'll comply.

91
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:40,232
So this is how you looked back then.

92
00:05:43,112 --> 00:05:44,712
The ancient scroll Master once studied

93
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:46,431
was written by me?

94
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,720
(Ancient scroll)

95
00:05:51,631 --> 00:05:52,232
Celestial.

96
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:54,232
Are you leaving?

97
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:00,552
By the way.

98
00:06:01,232 --> 00:06:02,311
Before returning,

99
00:06:02,592 --> 00:06:03,968
help establish Ye Tian's authority

100
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:05,672
as the Imperial Preceptor.

101
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:07,992
Make it grand.

102
00:06:08,992 --> 00:06:09,511
Understood.

103
00:06:11,152 --> 00:06:12,431
If you're founding a sect,

104
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:14,751
have you thought of a name?

105
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,071
Please bestow one,

106
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:19,992
Your Majesty.

107
00:06:23,672 --> 00:06:26,552
There's an apothecary in the south
called Guyue Zhai.

108
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:28,992
That's where I first met her.

109
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:31,751
Name it Guyue Sect.

110
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:50,032
Are you truly leaving?

111
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:54,071
Hua Zhaoyang.

112
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:57,631
Why?

113
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:00,792
You've cleansed my brother's darkness.

114
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,831
There won't be any more Asura, right?

115
00:07:04,152 --> 00:07:04,672
How come?

116
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:07,071
Not afraid I'll steal him now?

117
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:10,391
I just don't understand.

118
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:12,071
I have told you.

119
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:15,311
This world is full of injustice.

120
00:07:16,032 --> 00:07:17,592
Only celestial beings like Zhaoyang

121
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,751
can save the lost masses.

122
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:25,951
Where's Ye Tian?

123
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:28,951
He is waiting for you in the courtyard.

124
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:00,831
Zhaoyang.

125
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:03,472
I know

126
00:08:04,831 --> 00:08:05,751
I can't keep you.

127
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,631
But you must know

128
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:12,271
my feelings for you.

129
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:14,792
I like you.

130
00:08:17,152 --> 00:08:17,831
I know it.

131
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,352
But honestly, I don't know

132
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,431
what "love" truly means.

133
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,071
I thought

134
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,672
I would always live in the darkness.

135
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,472
All my past sufferings are

136
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:40,671
like a night without end,

137
00:08:42,031 --> 00:08:43,151
a cage.

138
00:08:46,511 --> 00:08:48,072
But the moment you appeared,

139
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:51,671
you lit up the world
like a beam of light.

140
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:56,712
For the first time,

141
00:08:57,712 --> 00:08:58,952
I felt my heart beat.

142
00:09:01,271 --> 00:09:04,432
You always say you saved me
with Celestial Flower.

143
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,352
But to me,

144
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:10,671
you are my Celestial Flower.

145
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,151
Ye Tian.

146
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:21,352
Do you believe in destiny?

147
00:09:24,472 --> 00:09:27,391
You are destined to fall into the Asura,

148
00:09:28,671 --> 00:09:32,031
and destined to meet me.

149
00:09:36,072 --> 00:09:37,631
Master once told me,

150
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,511
destiny is entwined

151
00:09:41,671 --> 00:09:42,911
with regret.

152
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,992
I didn't understand at that time.

153
00:09:49,312 --> 00:09:50,631
But after you kissed me

154
00:09:50,871 --> 00:09:52,631
but I have to leave you,

155
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:56,271
I felt

156
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,352
