(This life, Guyue Sect)

10
00:01:12,015 --> 00:01:12,854
Come up.

11
00:01:12,975 --> 00:01:13,568
Okay.

12
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:26,175
Someone's here.

13
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:31,168
(Ye Tian, writer)
(Ye Xun, Ye Tian's brother)

14
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,255
I-It ends now?

15
00:01:48,934 --> 00:01:49,694
Be quiet.

16
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:51,774
You nearly got us killed.

17
00:01:53,134 --> 00:01:54,735
(Collection of Fish and Birds)
So protagonists

18
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:55,815
sealed their memories?

19
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:57,056
How about it?

20
00:01:58,895 --> 00:02:00,054
It's too disappointing.

21
00:02:00,615 --> 00:02:02,375
I thought they'd find another way.

22
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:04,934
That's why we came to Guyue Sect.

23
00:02:06,455 --> 00:02:08,535
How are your novel characters

24
00:02:08,854 --> 00:02:10,375
related to this?

25
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,654
I have decided to set the third part

26
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:13,854
within the sect.

27
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:15,374
But I don't know

28
00:02:15,454 --> 00:02:16,815
what exactly the sect is like.

29
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,535
We're here collecting materials.

30
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:22,574
What's wrong?

31
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:24,294
Feeling stifled?

32
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,815
What does this imply?

33
00:02:28,255 --> 00:02:29,375
It implies...

34
00:02:30,414 --> 00:02:31,008
Tian,

35
00:02:31,655 --> 00:02:34,894
the third part of your book
will be a huge hit.

36
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:36,294
Brilliant.

37
00:02:37,734 --> 00:02:38,454
Later,

38
00:02:38,894 --> 00:02:40,255
find a crowded place.

39
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:42,655
Secretly observe

40
00:02:43,174 --> 00:02:45,055
and gather material. Understood?

41
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:45,975
Understood.

42
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:47,574
- Let's go.
- Go.

43
00:02:59,343 --> 00:03:02,688
(Hua Rongyue,
disciple of the Guyue Sect)

44
00:03:03,255 --> 00:03:05,055
Senior, not in a good mood?

45
00:03:05,255 --> 00:03:06,095
Zhaoyang will return.

46
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:08,375
Senior Hua Zhaoyang will return?

47
00:03:10,134 --> 00:03:10,655
Well,

48
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,534
our Guyue Sect's top disciple

49
00:03:12,614 --> 00:03:13,375
is returning.

50
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:14,655
Not welcoming?

51
00:03:14,815 --> 00:03:16,294
Of course.

52
00:03:16,495 --> 00:03:18,174
With her in our sect,

53
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:20,335
the whole sect gets lively.

54
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:24,495
So, I'm annoying to you guys, right?

55
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:26,574
Of course not!

56
00:03:27,014 --> 00:03:29,215
But Senior Hua Zhaoyang...

57
00:03:30,255 --> 00:03:31,255
- She is...
- Eccentric?

58
00:03:31,335 --> 00:03:31,854
Yes.

59
00:03:34,894 --> 00:03:35,614
But not exactly.

60
00:03:36,775 --> 00:03:37,454
She...

61
00:03:37,935 --> 00:03:39,014
She has the strongest

62
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,295
spiritual power perception,

63
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,495
yet acts so frivolous.

64
00:03:43,215 --> 00:03:44,534
Master pinned all hopes

65
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:46,095
of nurturing a Celestial on her.

66
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:47,414
But she just

67
00:03:48,014 --> 00:03:49,375
roams around,

68
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,894
barely returning.

69
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:52,335
She said

70
00:03:52,495 --> 00:03:54,255
she's searching
for the Celestial Flower.

71
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:56,255
You believe that?

72
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,174
Senior Hua Zhaoyang!

73
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:03,815
You're waiting for me?

74
00:04:04,335 --> 00:04:05,055
(Hua Zhaoyang, top disciple)
Return to training.

75
00:04:05,975 --> 00:04:06,535
Understood.

76
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:09,574
Hua Zhaoyang,

77
00:04:10,215 --> 00:04:11,935
you're harder to summon than Celestial.

78
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:15,294
You are exaggerating.

79
00:04:17,134 --> 00:04:17,655
By the way,

80
00:04:17,775 --> 00:04:19,095
new lead on the Celestial Flower.

81
00:04:19,254 --> 00:04:20,015
Alright, stop.

82
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:22,655
Save it for Master.

83
00:04:22,814 --> 00:04:23,535
I won't listen.

84
00:04:24,854 --> 00:04:26,535
I brought you local treats.

85
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:27,895
If Master scolds me later,

86
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,135
don't side with him.

87
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,775
Alright. Go.

88
00:04:30,934 --> 00:04:31,575
Wait any longer,

89
00:04:31,695 --> 00:04:33,054
he'll come drag you back.

90
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:34,688
Okay.

91
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:36,374
Hurry up!

92
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:37,614
Got it!

93
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,095
Do you know why I let you kneel?

94
00:04:44,015 --> 00:04:45,695
I've been out too long?

95
00:04:49,215 --> 00:04:49,975
Zhaoyang,

96
00:04:50,494 --> 00:04:52,814
how long have you left?

97
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:55,695
About half a year?

98
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:57,254
Half a year?

99
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,414
Seven months and eight days!

100
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:00,695
Do you remember

101
00:05:00,775 --> 00:05:02,775
you are our Guyue Sect's top disciple?

102
00:05:03,455 --> 00:05:04,105
Do you remember

103
00:05:04,105 --> 00:05:06,374
your Master's tirelessly
guarding the sect?

104
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,015
Master,

105
00:05:10,294 --> 00:05:12,215
I just want to find the Celestial Flower

106
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:14,054
to fulfill your wish.

107
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,335
My wish?

108
00:05:16,224 --> 00:05:16,768
You...

109
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:23,335
Fine.

110
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:25,095
So, did you find it?

111
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:28,455
I heard

112
00:05:28,535 --> 00:05:29,814
it grows

113
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,174
in the South region.

114
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:31,854
Rest assured.

115
00:05:32,054 --> 00:05:33,095
Next time, I'll go...

116
00:05:33,215 --> 00:05:33,775
Alright.

117
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:35,414
You recycled the excuse

118
00:05:35,895 --> 00:05:37,934
from Northern Reaches
to Southern Borders.

119
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,414
I called you back to say

120
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:44,015
I've already found the Celestial Flower.

121
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,174
You don't need to find it.

122
00:05:47,934 --> 00:05:48,854
Really?

123
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:51,895
You'll see in a while.

124
00:06:06,455 --> 00:06:07,095
Where is it?

125
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:24,135
Who would have thought

126
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:25,895
the legendary Celestial Flower

127
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:27,695
actually grows inside a human body.

128
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,854
And it happens to be him.

129
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:33,895
What a karmic jest.

130
00:06:34,814 --> 00:06:35,614
Master,

131
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:38,335
where did you find him?

132
00:06:39,614 --> 00:06:40,614
It's quite a coincidence.

133
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:42,374
Right in our sect.

134
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,174
(Last night)
Let's go.

135
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:50,272
Tian,

136
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,575
let's retreat.

137
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,135
Several patrols have passed.

138
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:54,814
Can't quit now!

139
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:56,775
I'm quite curious.

140
00:06:57,095 --> 00:06:58,814
How'd you write the first two parts

141
00:06:59,054 --> 00:07:01,174
so smoothly

142
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:02,455
while couldn't write

143
00:07:02,535 --> 00:07:03,814
anything on part three?

144
00:07:04,054 --> 00:07:05,135
How'd I know

145
00:07:05,294 --> 00:07:06,294
inspiration?

146
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:07,614
Ask leader of Guyue Sect?

147
00:07:08,854 --> 00:07:11,015
Do you have something to ask?

148
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,934
I am Tian Lantern. Nice to meet you.

149
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:21,854
Run quickly!

150
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:22,895
I'll find you later.

151
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,015
Such potent spiritual power?

152
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:36,455
Master,

153
00:07:36,734 --> 00:07:39,335
you just kidnapped him here.

154
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:42,015
Will it tarnish our sect's reputation?

155
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,535
This is important.

156
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:45,895
He volunteered.

157
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,534
Now that the Celestial Flower
has been found,

158
00:07:57,614 --> 00:07:58,935
why did you urgently

159
00:07:59,015 --> 00:07:59,775
call me back?

160
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,975
I want you to take him as your disciple.

161
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:08,054
Zhaoyang,

162
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,535
you are gifted.

163
00:08:09,895 --> 00:08:11,015
You are the only candidate

164
00:08:11,174 --> 00:08:13,455
for Celestial transformation.

165
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:17,534
I meant to pass you

166
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,614
my position.

167
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:19,934
But I know

168
00:08:20,135 --> 00:08:22,054
you chafe at rules,

169
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:23,975
craving wanderlust.

170
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:27,814
The Celestial Flower and Yin-Yang Jade

171
00:08:28,775 --> 00:08:31,215
are the only relics of celestial beings.

172
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,414
I don't know why
the Celestial Flower is inside him.

173
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:35,415
However,

174
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:38,295
he must be destined
with celestial beings.

175
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,254
And Yin-Yang Jade

176
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,894
responds solely to your spiritual power.

177
00:08:43,494 --> 00:08:44,254
Take it.

178
00:08:47,175 --> 00:08:49,575
I've imbued immobilizing spells inside

179
00:08:50,254 --> 00:08:51,935
to prevent those who sneak into our sect

180
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:53,575
from escaping.

181
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:55,534
But Master,

182
00:08:55,774 --> 00:08:57,335
I'm still a disciple.

183
00:08:57,774 --> 00:08:59,335
How can I teach him?

184
00:09:00,494 --> 00:09:01,455
Both of you

185
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:04,575
are perfect celestial candidates.

186
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,774
Graduate him,

187
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:08,815
and I'll let you go

188
00:09:09,534 --> 00:09:10,815
wherever you want.

189
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:13,095
I will not restrain you anymore.

190
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,175
Master, that won't work!

191
00:09:16,374 --> 00:09:17,134
Alright.

192
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:21,295
Handle it yourself.

193
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:23,975
Master!

194
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,134
(The jade can prevent him
from escaping.)

195
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:47,854
(If I lock it inside him...)

196
00:10:07,295 --> 00:10:08,654
W-Who are you?

197
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:10,575
What just happened?

198
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:11,494
I...

199
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,415
You don't need to know that.

200
00:10:15,774 --> 00:10:17,494
Anyway. From now on,

201
00:10:17,854 --> 00:10:19,095
you are my disciple.

202
00:10:19,175 --> 00:10:20,215
I'm your master.

203
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,695
From now on, I'll teach you.

204
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:23,175
Graduate quickly,

205
00:10:23,295 --> 00:10:25,374
and I'll regain freedom. Understood?

206
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:26,734
What're you saying?

207
00:10:26,854 --> 00:10:27,815
Your disciple?

208
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,014
I don't want to.

209
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,455
I won't join your sect.

210
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:33,654
Let me go!

211
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:34,528
Hurry up.

212
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:36,254
Kneel.

213
00:10:41,894 --> 00:10:42,534
Demonic arts.

214
00:10:44,215 --> 00:10:46,014
Okay, ritual's finished.

215
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:47,654
From now on, you follow me.

216
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:49,152
