00:00:49,615 --> 00:00:50,295
This strike will

10
00:00:51,054 --> 00:00:52,654
give the world another hundred years.

11
00:01:57,294 --> 00:01:58,375
Tian Lantern.

12
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:00,934
Why?

13
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:08,455
I must make you pay.

14
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:18,815
Kneel.

15
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:21,655
Ye Tian,

16
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:23,935
stop.

17
00:02:59,215 --> 00:02:59,775
Great Master,

18
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:02,935
as you know,

19
00:03:04,614 --> 00:03:06,014
this is

20
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:08,815
completely useless for me.

21
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:11,694
This is all my fault.

22
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:12,854
No.

23
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,294
You were right at that time.

24
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:20,014
I'm indeed the reincarnation of Asura.

25
00:03:22,294 --> 00:03:23,255
However,

26
00:03:24,335 --> 00:03:25,935
you became soft-hearted.

27
00:03:28,335 --> 00:03:30,014
It's my fault.

28
00:03:30,975 --> 00:03:33,134
I insisted on writing more

29
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:36,375
and coming here.

30
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:39,215
Because of me, Zhaoyang is unconscious

31
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:40,935
and in critical condition.

32
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,134
I'm increasingly feeling

33
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:46,375
that all this is destiny.

34
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:49,894
Great Master,

35
00:03:50,734 --> 00:03:53,174
why does the Celestial Flower
grow in my body?

36
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:54,894
You tell me

37
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:57,935
why Zhaoyang has uncontrollable feelings

38
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,055
for you?

39
00:04:05,655 --> 00:04:06,255
Well...

40
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,134
I also don't know.

41
00:04:10,335 --> 00:04:11,255
Perhaps

42
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:12,975
the answers to the two questions

43
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,335
are hidden together.

44
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:23,775
This is

45
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:26,254
truly cruel.

46
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,374
Have something to eat.

47
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:58,054
You don't need
to use this barrier to trap me.

48
00:04:59,455 --> 00:05:00,575
I don't want to leave.

49
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:05,695
Maybe

50
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,294
Tian and I shouldn't have come here.

51
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,734
I hate myself for being incompetent.

52
00:05:14,335 --> 00:05:15,534
I have to watch fate

53
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:17,414
crush everything we have.

54
00:05:21,775 --> 00:05:22,614
So do I.

55
00:05:25,455 --> 00:05:27,374
When on earth will she wake up?

56
00:05:50,854 --> 00:05:52,135
Are you sure about it?

57
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:56,374
This is the only way.

58
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:59,015
We must give it a try.

59
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,135
I am quite worried.

60
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,614
But I also know

61
00:06:06,215 --> 00:06:07,814
it is meaningless to worry.

62
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:11,095
We have to choose
to trust the power of Asura,

63
00:06:12,895 --> 00:06:15,135
even if it might
bring unpredictable consequences.

64
00:06:16,695 --> 00:06:17,494
It was the darkness

65
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:20,975
that turned the Celestial Flower
into the Death Flower.

66
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:23,455
But I can feel

67
00:06:24,294 --> 00:06:25,095
that this power

68
00:06:25,494 --> 00:06:27,294
has not changed because of me.

69
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,015
It's harmless to give the power

70
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:31,455
to her.

71
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:34,695
Maybe

72
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:36,655
she will become a celestial being

73
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,614
because of this power.

74
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:47,775
(Making her a celestial being)

75
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:49,494
(is the only way)

76
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,174
(to heal her and awaken her.)

77
00:06:53,254 --> 00:06:55,055
(It's also the only way)

78
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:56,174
(to end it all.)

79
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:12,957
(Two years later)

80
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:17,135
What's going on?

81
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:22,814
It's getting increasingly difficult
to control my mind.

82
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:30,294
Is it because you give spiritual power
to Hua Zhaoyang?

83
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:33,535
If the situation is

84
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,254
out of control one day,

85
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:39,374
what can we do?

86
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:42,014
Are you afraid of affecting us

87
00:08:42,815 --> 00:08:43,774
or her?

88
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:46,734
If the Asura plague occurs,

89
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:49,415
the situation will
become uncontrollable.

90
00:08:54,894 --> 00:08:55,774
What about Hua Zhaoyang?

91
00:08:58,534 --> 00:09:00,335
I'll leave enough spiritual power
for her.

92
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:04,374
Then there will be no worries.

93
00:09:05,215 --> 00:09:06,254
I can't stop you either.

94
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:10,095
When will you
transfer the spiritual power?

95
00:09:15,975 --> 00:09:16,534
Tonight.

96
00:09:24,134 --> 00:09:25,494
(I don't need your apology.)

97
00:09:26,254 --> 00:09:26,975
Instead, I hope

98
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:28,335
you can teach me carefully.

99
00:09:29,415 --> 00:09:30,175
What do you mean?

100
00:09:31,335 --> 00:09:32,774
You're interested in cultivating?

101
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:35,254
(Not at all.)

102
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:37,614
I just

103
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,014
want to protect Tian.

104
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,575
I don't want to be a burden.

105
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:01,935
Tian.

106
00:10:02,534 --> 00:10:03,095
Ye Xun.

107
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:07,134
Things have been resolved properly.

108
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:08,854
Tonight,

109
00:10:10,014 --> 00:10:10,894
we have to leave.

110
00:10:12,175 --> 00:10:13,415
They let you go?

111
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:17,975
As you know,

112
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:20,295
ever since that night,

113
00:10:21,215 --> 00:10:22,134
whether I stay or leave

114
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:24,415
is not up to the Guyue Sect.

115
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,055
I stay

116
00:10:29,734 --> 00:10:30,935
just for her.

117
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,134
That's right.

118
00:10:34,774 --> 00:10:35,854
They can't stop you.

119
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:40,935
But now,

120
00:10:42,014 --> 00:10:43,654
I can no longer treat her.

121
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,175
So,

122
00:10:46,374 --> 00:10:47,374
we must leave.

123
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:54,374
What?

124
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,654
Are you afraid of me?

125
00:11:00,295 --> 00:11:00,894
I...

126
00:11:05,455 --> 00:11:07,095
I have an appointment
with my Master tonight.

127
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:09,215
Hua Rongyue?

128
00:11:10,575 --> 00:11:12,534
Isn't there estrangement
between you two?

129
00:11:21,534 --> 00:11:22,055
Alright.

130
00:11:24,295 --> 00:11:25,695
You stay here

131
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:26,975
in case...

132
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:37,014
Tonight, can you send...?

133
00:11:47,215 --> 00:11:47,894
I understand.

134
00:11:48,854 --> 00:11:50,935
Take good care of yourself.

135
00:12:08,654 --> 00:12:09,374
Sorry.

136
00:12:13,295 --> 00:12:14,455
Sorry, Tian.

137
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,534
I'm sorry.

138
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:21,374
I'm sorry.

139
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:23,014
