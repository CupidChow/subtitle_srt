All of you, please go

11
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:10,502
and treat His Majesty.

12
00:01:10,743 --> 00:01:11,342
Wait a moment.

13
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,023
Ye Tian, I heard

14
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:18,862
you found a quite skilled herbalist.

15
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:20,823
Why didn't you bring her here?

16
00:01:21,142 --> 00:01:24,383
Don't you want to save our father?

17
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:29,983
Just as you said,

18
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:32,062
she's just an ordinary herbalist.

19
00:01:32,463 --> 00:01:35,062
She can't compare to everybody here.

20
00:01:35,543 --> 00:01:36,543
I'm incompetent.

21
00:01:37,142 --> 00:01:38,782
I'm sorry that I can't help our father.

22
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,543
And what about your brother?

23
00:01:42,743 --> 00:01:44,543
It's such an important meeting.

24
00:01:44,623 --> 00:01:45,862
Doesn't he come either?

25
00:01:47,142 --> 00:01:48,463
Xun has not been granted a title.

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,823
So, he is

27
00:01:50,183 --> 00:01:52,023
in no position to come.

28
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:53,222
Indeed,

29
00:01:53,663 --> 00:01:55,142
there's no place for him.

30
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:57,463
You and your brother are interesting.

31
00:01:57,983 --> 00:01:59,782
The alchemy meeting
has been long-planned.

32
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:01,862
Your brother is not allowed to come,

33
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:03,183
and you can't

34
00:02:03,302 --> 00:02:05,463
bring a cultivation herbalist.

35
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:07,142
If this gets out,

36
00:02:07,342 --> 00:02:09,582
it will disgrace our country.

37
00:02:09,983 --> 00:02:11,702
The crown prince of the Ye dynasty

38
00:02:12,063 --> 00:02:13,742
is so mean.

39
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,702
You're disgracing His Majesty.

40
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:43,142
Please examine my father's body.

41
00:02:44,302 --> 00:02:46,383
I've collected herbs
in the mountains for years.

42
00:02:46,783 --> 00:02:47,862
I work in an herbal shop.

43
00:02:48,223 --> 00:02:49,302
I'll do my best to help.

44
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,783
His Majesty...

45
00:03:51,343 --> 00:03:51,862
Father.

46
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:55,902
How dare you, Ye Tian.

47
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,223
You colluded with her
to kill our father.

48
00:03:58,742 --> 00:03:59,742
That's slander.

49
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:00,543
Guards!

50
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,182
Arrest these rebels.

51
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:02,862
Yes.

52
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:18,142
Imperial Preceptor.

53
00:04:18,702 --> 00:04:20,862
Please ask the ministers
and cultivators to leave.

54
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:21,862
Also,

55
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:24,262
capture his younger brother Ye Xun,

56
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:26,262
and hand him over to me.

57
00:04:30,783 --> 00:04:31,622
Your Highness,

58
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:33,583
Ye Xun is here.

59
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:34,720
Hold on.

60
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,103
Ye Rong.

61
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,463
There's one thing you don't know.

62
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,056
The copper mines in Shangyang,

63
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,742
the armament supplies in Beiju,

64
00:04:43,663 --> 00:04:45,223
and the networks of other countries

65
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,663
are all recorded
in the edict our father gave me.

66
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:49,622
If you want to know,

67
00:04:49,862 --> 00:04:51,262
I can tell you everything.

68
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,583
But I have one condition.

69
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,983
I'll go get the edict,
and you let them go.

70
00:05:09,302 --> 00:05:11,262
Let them go get it for you.

71
00:05:18,382 --> 00:05:19,543
Imperial Preceptor is here.

72
00:05:20,422 --> 00:05:21,463
So, you can trust me.

73
00:05:31,143 --> 00:05:31,942
Ye Tian,

74
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,062
I know how our father died.

75
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:36,463
I know there is

76
00:05:36,862 --> 00:05:38,223
something wrong with the Fushou.

77
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:41,742
Let's do as you said.

78
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,663
No, we must leave together.

79
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:01,103
Let's go.

80
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,302
You

81
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:20,062
kneel and wait.

82
00:06:43,783 --> 00:06:45,742
Where exactly is the edict
Ye Tian mentioned?

83
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:47,262
I don't know.

84
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,583
He's never mentioned it

85
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:49,742
to me.

86
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:51,703
I knew something would happen today,

87
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:52,903
but unexpectedly...

88
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:56,382
What if there was never an edict at all?

89
00:06:57,302 --> 00:06:59,262
Originally, Ye Tian asked me
to take you out.

90
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,422
Did he ask you
to bring anything with you?

91
00:07:02,182 --> 00:07:03,663
Let me think.

92
00:07:19,302 --> 00:07:20,342
He specifically asked me

93
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:21,382
to bring a letter

94
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:22,783
about the pharmacopoeia he wrote.

95
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,023
He told me

96
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:25,783
to read it with you.

97
00:07:29,792 --> 00:07:31,552
(Letter from Ye Tian)

98
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,742
(Forgive me for keeping something
from you.)

99
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:41,583
(When you see this letter,)

100
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:43,382
(you will understand my intentions.)

101
00:07:44,302 --> 00:07:45,023
(Ye Xun,)

102
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,502
(I've always been protecting you.)

103
00:07:47,822 --> 00:07:48,783
(This is not difficult.)

104
00:07:49,463 --> 00:07:50,784
(But it's hard to get revenge.)

105
00:07:52,062 --> 00:07:54,343
(Do you remember how our mother died?)

106
00:07:54,942 --> 00:07:56,822
(Our father was behind it.)

107
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,328
(When the ministers
criticized our mother,)

108
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,703
(our father did nothing.)

109
00:08:01,223 --> 00:08:02,382
(That's what he wanted.)

110
00:08:04,062 --> 00:08:05,023
(From beginning to end,)

111
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:06,742
(Ye Rong isn't the target
of my revenge.)

112
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:08,672
(Our father drove our mother to death.)

113
00:08:09,023 --> 00:08:09,742
(So,)

114
00:08:10,262 --> 00:08:11,663
(he must pay the price.)

115
00:08:12,903 --> 00:08:14,062
(All these days, I've had to)

116
00:08:14,262 --> 00:08:15,182
(keep my head down)

117
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:16,583
(to develop poisons.)

118
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,903
(I even took the poison
to confirm its effects)

119
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:19,903
(and the dosage.)

120
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:22,343
(Tomorrow, I will)

121
00:08:22,862 --> 00:08:24,480
(kill our enemy at the alchemy meeting.)

122
00:08:25,223 --> 00:08:26,302
(After due consideration,)

123
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,343
(I don't want
to get you and Miss Hua involved.)

124
00:08:29,223 --> 00:08:30,862
(I can hardly leave the palace alive.)

125
00:08:31,463 --> 00:08:32,103
(I only hope)

126
00:08:32,742 --> 00:08:34,143
(you'll live freely and well.)

127
00:08:41,262 --> 00:08:41,902
Take action.

128
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:42,703
Hold on.

129
00:08:49,343 --> 00:08:50,624
Imperial Preceptor, you're here.

130
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:51,703
What?

131
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,183
You knew I would come?

132
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,142
The Crown Prince instructed me

133
00:08:55,303 --> 00:08:57,022
to leave this woman's life to you.

134
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,902
Please thank His Highness

135
00:09:03,463 --> 00:09:05,183
for me.

136
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:22,662
I am here to cover you.

137
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:25,303
The Crown Prince thinks I've joined him.

138
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:27,343
How is Ye Tian doing?

139
00:09:27,622 --> 00:09:28,463
Is he in danger?

140
00:09:29,943 --> 00:09:30,583
Danger?

141
00:09:31,262 --> 00:09:32,463
The one truly in trouble now

142
00:09:32,782 --> 00:09:34,142
is the Crown Prince Ye Rong.

143
00:09:34,662 --> 00:09:35,583
What do you mean?

144
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:37,823
I

145
00:09:38,502 --> 00:09:39,862
came to the palace

146
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:41,182
to monitor the birth

147
00:09:41,262 --> 00:09:43,262
of Asura.

148
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,502
And Ye Tian

149
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:46,223
may be the Asura.

150
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:47,943
Judging from the injuries

151
00:09:48,262 --> 00:09:49,262
and the venoms,

152
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:51,463
I've confirmed my suspicions.

153
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:53,223
Ye Tian's life is tragic.

154
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,343
He has hatred.

155
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:56,022
You know that.

156
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:59,103
After Hua Zhaoyang saved Ye Tian,

157
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,622
I reaffirmed my judgment.

158
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:02,303
The medicine for him

159
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:04,183
was the Celestial Flower, right?

160
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,488
The spirit-testing talisman shows

161
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:09,472
your spiritual power
is much higher than mine.

162
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:10,823
Miss Hua.

163
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,423
You possess a high celestial power.

164
00:10:13,943 --> 00:10:15,502
That is our only reliance now.

165
00:10:16,142 --> 00:10:18,742
We will have to rely on you
to solve the predicament.

166
00:10:19,343 --> 00:10:20,223
Show your skills.

167
00:10:20,782 --> 00:10:21,823
Use your spiritual power.

168
00:10:22,823 --> 00:10:25,382
I can't use it.

169
00:10:28,343 --> 00:10:29,303
How come?

170
00:10:30,343 --> 00:10:31,183
I don't know how.

171
00:10:31,343 --> 00:10:32,703
Spiritual power is built up

172
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:33,742
through cultivation.

173
00:10:35,303 --> 00:10:36,262
How could you not know?

174
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:42,983
I guess you have

175
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:45,983
lost a part of your memory.

176
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:47,423
Impossible.

177
00:10:47,862 --> 00:10:49,423
Zhaoyang and I grew up together.

178
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:51,662
She has never lost her memory.

179
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,983
But she hasn't been good at cultivating
since childhood.

180
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:56,703
Wait.

181
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:59,463
I think I've lost a part of my memory.

182
00:11:00,343 --> 00:11:01,823
The night Ye Tian was assassinated,

183
00:11:02,622 --> 00:11:04,862
some strange memories appeared

184
00:11:05,103 --> 00:11:06,343
in my mind.

185
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:08,103
How did they appear?

186
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,423
What took them so long?

187
00:11:40,902 --> 00:11:42,183
You've already won.

188
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,223
Can't you wait even a moment longer?

189
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:47,463
Don't misunderstand.

190
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,742
I'm not waiting for your brother.

191
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,142
What do you mean?

192
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:53,223
Your Highness.

193
00:11:53,952 --> 00:11:55,072
The imperial edict is ready.

194
00:11:58,382 --> 00:11:59,063
Take a look.

195
00:11:59,742 --> 00:12:01,662
With this counterfeit imperial edict,

196
00:12:02,382 --> 00:12:04,983
(Imperial Edict)
I can immediately ascend to the throne.

197
00:12:05,542 --> 00:12:06,223
Ye Tian.

198
00:12:06,742 --> 00:12:08,103
I have to thank you.

199
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,302
You know very well

200
00:12:10,382 --> 00:12:12,423
that I've always
had someone on you, right?

201
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:14,463
Last night,

202
00:12:14,782 --> 00:12:16,103
our father summoned you.

203
00:12:16,622 --> 00:12:18,263
He knew about me trying to kill you.

204
00:12:18,343 --> 00:12:19,983
He wanted to uphold justice for you.

205
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:22,063
But he was too stupid.

206
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:23,622
He could never know

207
00:12:24,183 --> 00:12:25,862
the medicine you fed him

208
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:28,542
contains the poison you developed.

209
00:12:28,862 --> 00:12:31,023
However, I was the one
who massacred the country

210
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,903
and drove your mother to death.

211
00:12:32,983 --> 00:12:34,582
You're a low-born man.

212
00:12:34,662 --> 00:12:35,703
You deserve it.

213
00:12:37,662 --> 00:12:38,382
Ye Rong.

214
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:40,902
You're so sneaky.

215
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:42,823
You will pay for that.

216
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:49,943
You know what?

217
00:12:50,423 --> 00:12:52,103
Hua Zhaoyang

218
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:53,622
and your dear younger brother

219
00:12:53,782 --> 00:12:54,583
are dead.

220
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,262
You

221
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:58,343
got them killed.

222
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:00,742
Ye Rong.

223
00:13:01,703 --> 00:13:03,622
You animal!

224
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:08,782
Guess how I persuaded

225
00:13:08,862 --> 00:13:09,902
the Imperial Preceptor?

226
00:13:10,902 --> 00:13:11,823
I told him something.

227
00:13:12,423 --> 00:13:13,103
I said

228
00:13:13,423 --> 00:13:14,703
Hua Zhaoyang's spiritual power

229
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,983
might help him
reach the Celestial level.

230
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:19,542
So, right now,

231
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,103
she should already have been captured.

232
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,423
If her spiritual power is drained,

233
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:26,142
will it hurt?

234
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:38,902
Are you sad?

235
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:41,622
Don't be sad.

236
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,622
You're going to die too.
