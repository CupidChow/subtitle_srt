If I hurt you

10

in the end,

11
00:00:57,454 --> 00:00:58,334
will you hate me?

12
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:09,574
Why will I?

13
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:13,255
After all, you saved my life.

14
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:22,414
The most important thing now

15
00:01:23,535 --> 00:01:24,735
is to figure out the obsession

16
00:01:25,414 --> 00:01:27,134
in my mind.

17
00:01:28,615 --> 00:01:29,414
Only in this way

18
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,694
will all this be worthwhile.

19
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:44,815
Why did I lose that memory?

20
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:46,975
Did something happen afterward?

21
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:52,375
I still want to figure out first

22
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:55,934
why you have such an obsession.

23
00:02:17,414 --> 00:02:18,134
This is

24
00:02:19,535 --> 00:02:20,535
that bookmark.

25
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,134
I placed it closest to my heart.

26
00:02:28,294 --> 00:02:29,215
For some reason,

27
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,975
this small item of yours

28
00:02:32,454 --> 00:02:34,335
always touches my heart.

29
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:47,655
Hua Zhaoyang,

30
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:51,734
I liked you,

31
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:53,255
didn't I?

32
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,975
What is liking?

33
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:09,775
I only remember

34
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:13,694
that I left a kiss mark
on this bookmark.

35
00:03:14,614 --> 00:03:15,815
To recover my memory,

36
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:18,174
I kissed you.

37
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:27,014
Ye Tian,

38
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:31,215
let's watch the stars.

39
00:03:36,574 --> 00:03:38,095
Only the last memory remains

40
00:03:39,134 --> 00:03:40,335
right here in this courtyard.

41
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:44,174
It happened under the stars.

42
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:50,574
Alright.

43
00:03:51,854 --> 00:03:52,694
After you're done,

44
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:54,775
I can leave peacefully.

45
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:00,694
As you know,

46
00:04:01,894 --> 00:04:04,414
I'm just an obsession coexisting
with the Death Flower.

47
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:06,894
I've waited 1,000 years

48
00:04:08,854 --> 00:04:09,975
for you,

49
00:04:10,734 --> 00:04:11,894
and only for you.

50
00:04:13,614 --> 00:04:15,055
You help me figure out something.

51
00:04:16,335 --> 00:04:17,574
Then I can vanish.

52
00:04:38,975 --> 00:04:39,695
It smells so good.

53
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,575
Did I eat something you made before?

54
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:50,614
Actually,

55
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:52,854
I never made anything delicious for you.

56
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,054
Instead,

57
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,895
I always ate good food in your place.

58
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:11,455
What's wrong?

59
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:14,095
Nothing.

60
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:16,254
I just want to see you.

61
00:05:24,934 --> 00:05:28,095
What is the Asura plague
that Ye Xun mentioned?

62
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:31,734
It's a sign of the birth of the Asura.

63
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:34,015
The Asura plague struck people,

64
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,934
becoming the Death Flower
for the birth of the Asura.

65
00:05:39,494 --> 00:05:41,814
Why didn't Ye Tian in his past life

66
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,015
experience the Asura plague?

67
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:45,575
You acquired the Celestial Flower,

68
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:48,335
and Ye Rong made you have darkness.

69
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:50,054
It happened within a few days.

70
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:52,655
But the Asura plague in Tiandu City

71
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:55,054
had been ongoing for several years.

72
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:00,455
Physician Ye, bad news.

73
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,655
The Asura plague is starting
to spread rapidly.

74
00:06:03,174 --> 00:06:04,655
Don't panic. Just wait.

75
00:06:05,054 --> 00:06:06,535
Wait for what? Wait for the general?

76
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:07,614
He also has no solution.

77
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:08,224
No.

78
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:13,895
I mean the Celestial.

79
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,055
In this life,

80
00:06:17,135 --> 00:06:19,414
Ye Tian tried so hard
to eradicate the Asura plague,

81
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,494
but he probably never thought

82
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:25,254
that the root of the plague
would be in his mind.

83
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:27,734
It's another self.

84
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:30,215
Hua Zhaoyang,

85
00:06:31,854 --> 00:06:33,975
you just need
to tell me the final outcome.

86
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:36,414
Then everything will be resolved.

87
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:40,575
If I tell you,

88
00:06:41,335 --> 00:06:42,215
you will die.

89
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:49,494
I died a long time ago.

90
00:06:49,814 --> 00:06:50,455
No!

91
00:06:56,135 --> 00:06:56,975
I'm the Celestial.

92
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,655
I'll find a way
to stop the Asura plague.

93
00:07:00,575 --> 00:07:02,895
I will also find a way to keep you here.

94
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,375
I no longer want
to take the Celestial Path

95
00:07:06,455 --> 00:07:07,335
to be the Celestial.

96
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:09,695
To me,

97
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:11,975
it's meaningless.

98
00:07:18,854 --> 00:07:19,535
Hua Zhaoyang.

99
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:22,895
About love,

100
00:07:23,095 --> 00:07:24,374
you've given me the answer.

101
00:07:27,174 --> 00:07:27,695
Well,

102
00:07:28,535 --> 00:07:30,095
what about the final outcome?

103
00:07:41,374 --> 00:07:42,575
Something happened.

104
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,135
It hurts.

105
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:46,535
I can't take it anymore.

106
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:49,734
Hang in there.

107
00:07:49,814 --> 00:07:51,095
I will go find Ye Xun.

108
00:07:51,614 --> 00:07:52,174
I'll find him.

109
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:53,135
It relapsed.

110
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:54,575
He can't help me.

111
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:56,695
I don't want to live like this anymore.

112
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,455
I won't leave.

113
00:07:58,535 --> 00:07:59,775
I am here with you.

114
00:07:59,934 --> 00:08:01,254
I am here with you.

115
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:02,494
Run quickly!

116
00:08:02,734 --> 00:08:03,854
Help!

117
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,414
Ye Xun.

118
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,575
You finally came back.

119
00:08:18,655 --> 00:08:19,854
It has been out of control.

120
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:21,734
There were many new cases overnight.

121
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,414
If you came back any later,

122
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:25,254
the whole city wouldn't be saved.

123
00:08:25,975 --> 00:08:27,934
Hua Zhaoyang, think of a solution.

124
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:40,575
The Asura plague will spread

125
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,774
throughout the city in three days.

126
00:08:43,374 --> 00:08:45,335
Master, there's no time to hesitate.

127
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:47,614
(Tian Lantern, leader of the Guyue Sect)
If the Asura plague spreads to our sect,

128
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,095
we can't protect ourselves.

129
00:08:51,295 --> 00:08:51,854
And he?

130
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:56,014
He can no longer absorb the darkness.

131
00:08:56,215 --> 00:08:57,894
The reincarnation of the former emperor

132
00:08:58,935 --> 00:08:59,455
will only

133
00:09:00,654 --> 00:09:02,374
face the most painful failure
in the end.

134
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,774
He will watch

135
00:09:03,854 --> 00:09:05,614
the citizens of the city he cares for

136
00:09:06,975 --> 00:09:07,614
fall

137
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,695
and take ill.

138
00:09:10,014 --> 00:09:11,055
Who is the Asura?

139
00:09:11,894 --> 00:09:12,935
Can you sense it?

140
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:15,774
Sorry, I can't.

141
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,095
It's not your fault.

142
00:09:20,695 --> 00:09:21,935
After all, none of us

143
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,894
experienced the calamity of Asura.

144
00:09:26,494 --> 00:09:27,854
Give the order, Master.

145
00:09:36,295 --> 00:09:37,854
You and I will end the plague

146
00:09:39,014 --> 00:09:40,614
by massacring the city.

147
00:09:41,654 --> 00:09:42,175
Yes.

148
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:54,494
Hua Zhaoyang,

149
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,215
I tried the potion soaked

150
00:09:57,815 --> 00:09:59,175
in jade on the patients.

151
00:10:00,055 --> 00:10:01,374
Indeed, it works.

152
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:02,734
Of course.

153
00:10:03,455 --> 00:10:05,734
This celestial potion can cure them

154
00:10:05,854 --> 00:10:07,734
because I've diluted my power.

155
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,215
Just like a block of ink.

156
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,774
If it's dipped in water,

157
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:15,975
it will produce a large amount of ink.

158
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:18,134
Therefore,

159
00:10:19,254 --> 00:10:20,254
this piece of broken jade

160
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:22,494
carries your power?

161
00:10:25,295 --> 00:10:27,095
This is the best container

162
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:28,374
for holding my power.

163
00:10:29,374 --> 00:10:30,415
I see.

164
00:10:31,654 --> 00:10:32,815
Does that mean

165
00:10:34,494 --> 00:10:36,455
if we have enough celestial potion,

166
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:37,734
we can completely

167
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:39,335
end the Asura plague in the world?

168
00:10:41,854 --> 00:10:43,055
Don't worry too much now.

169
00:10:43,254 --> 00:10:45,134
Let the patients take the potion first.

170
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:47,175
To end the Asura plague,

171
00:10:47,455 --> 00:10:48,854
we still have a long way to go.

172
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:52,695
Okay.

173
00:11:09,614 --> 00:11:11,534
I gave Ye Xun three batches of medicine.

174
00:11:14,455 --> 00:11:16,055
This is not what you promised me.

175
00:11:18,215 --> 00:11:18,854
Just wait for me

176
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:20,055
to figure it out.

177
00:11:20,494 --> 00:11:21,494
Figure out what?

178
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:32,734
He returned the body to you?

179
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:34,534
Who?

180
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:42,815
The speed
at which the potion cures the infected

181
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:45,295
is slower than the speed
at which the plague spreads.

182
00:11:46,014 --> 00:11:46,975
Your celestial potion

183
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:49,455
can only save some of the people
in Tiandu City.

184
00:11:52,854 --> 00:11:54,095
I'm thinking of other ways.

185
00:11:55,134 --> 00:11:55,854
You said

186
00:11:55,975 --> 00:11:57,175
once you found my Death Flower

187
00:11:57,335 --> 00:11:58,654
in my consciousness,

188
00:11:58,935 --> 00:12:00,215
all of this would end, right?

189
00:12:00,935 --> 00:12:01,695
Have you tried?

190
00:12:02,494 --> 00:12:04,654
How exactly should the people be saved?

191
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:06,774
