1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,160
They have searched Third Sister's bedroom.

3
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,620
It looks like Noble Consort Jia is also looking for the letter.

4
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,360
I clearly saw someone come in just now.

5
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
This courtyard hasn't been visited in a long time.

6
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,000
You must have been seeing things.

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,800
Let's go.

8
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,440
If it were you,

9
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,720
where would you hide it?

10
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,280
If it were me,

11
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,140
I would burn it.

12
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,840
But as a woman,

13
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,850
where would you hide it?

14
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,960
I would hide it in a pillow.

15
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,920
After all,

16
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,760
who wouldn't want to sleep soundly after doing something wrong?

17
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
It really worked.

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,840
Who's in there?

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,560
Why are you here?

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,320
Give me the letter in your hand,

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,380
and I'll let you go.

22
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,600
Move.

23
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,920
Catch up to them!

24
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Yes!

25
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,720
Last night, we made quite a commotion.

26
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,880
Noble Consort Jia must have gotten the news

27
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,720
and will surely send people to intercept us on the way.

28
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,250
Let's split into two groups

29
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,760
and meet at the bamboo forest in front of Baima Temple.

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,360
Qingshan,

31
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,860
go with Young Madam

32
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,340
and ensure her safety.

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,320
Don't worry, My Lord.

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,250
I'll make sure Young Madam is safe.

35
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,820
Take care of yourself too.

36
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,100
Your Highness,

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,120
it's my fault.

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,250
I failed to stop them last night

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,160
and couldn't retrieve the letter.

40
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
My dear sister

41
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,240
really had a trick up her sleeve.

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,840
They must be planning to give the letter

43
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
to the Empress during her prayer today.

44
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,560
Things won't be looking good for me by that time.

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,420
Your Highness.

46
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,500
Your Highness.

47
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
How is it?

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,440
The scouts reported

49
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,120
that Lu Shaoyang and Liu Xizhao have split up

50
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,180
and are heading toward Baima Temple.

51
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,500
Who has the letter?

52
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,279
Well...

53
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,440
It's still unclear at the moment.

54
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,590
Lord Lu,

55
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,480
I'm giving you a chance to make up for your mistake.

56
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,080
Do you know what to do?

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,840
I understand.

58
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,000
Lu Shaozhen,

59
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
you betrayed your family

60
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,760
just to be the Noble Consort's lapdog?

61
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,690
You're as arrogant as your father.

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,200
I've tolerated your family long enough.

63
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,930
Then come on.

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,890
Let's see if you can stop me.

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:54,760
Get him!

66
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,720
Young Madam, you leave first.

67
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,640
I'll hold them off.

68
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Be careful.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:50,970
They are coming.

70
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm so anxious.

71
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,970
Why hasn't Xizhao arrived yet?

72
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,320
Stop being anxious.

73
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,680
Even if we go in now,

74
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,160
it will only disturb Her Majesty's prayer.

75
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,200
If we upset Her Majesty,

76
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,760
we won't have another chance

77
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,960
to overturn the case.

78
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,440
Yes.

79
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,960
Give me back my bracelet!

80
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,040
It's just a bracelet made of slightly better jade.

81
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,640
Is it really that important?

82
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,159
I don't understand either.

83
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,210
What are you going to do?

84
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
Liu Xizhao,

85
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,720
I heard from Lu Shaozhen that this bracelet is very important to you.

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,760
Is this true?

87
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,520
This is a family heirloom of our Marquis's household.

88
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,920
Of course, it's important.

89
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,880
It was bestowed by the late Emperor.

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,680
You'd better be careful with it.

91
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
Everything you do is under my control,

92
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,200
yet you are still trying to deceive me?

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,520
I heard that last time you fell into the water and lost your memory. Although you barely escaped death,

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,120
your temperament changed a lot.

95
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,980
To get this bracelet, you've gone to great lengths—

96
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,920
competing for it, calculating the date of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun.

97
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,640
What are you really after

98
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,560
by doing all this?

99
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,200
You're too curious.

100
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Have you heard the saying "Curiosity killed the cat?"

101
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
Let me ask a different question.

102
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,580
Does Lu Shaoyang have the letter?

103
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,040
What letter?

104
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,760
I don't know what you're talking about.

105
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,400
Guards!

106
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Yes?

107
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,040
Smash this bracelet!

108
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,280
No!

109
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,880
Looks like it's really very important.

110
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,300
Help me catch Lu Shaoyang,

111
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,700
or I'll destroy the bracelet.

112
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,320
Your Majesty,

113
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,840
the flowers in this courtyard are different from those in the palace.

114
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,760
So beautiful.

115
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,680
No matter how beautiful you are compared to other flowers, you will eventually wither.

116
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
It's better to be like a plum blossom, blooming alone.

117
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm tired.

118
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,280
Let's go back.

119
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,760
Her Majesty is leaving,

120
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,640
but Xizhao hasn't arrived yet. What should we do?

121
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,039
There's no time, Mother.

122
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,400
Greetings, Your Majesty.

123
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
Your Majesty, I accidentally disrupted your prayer.

124
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Please grant me a punishment.

125
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,120
I knew you were here.

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,940
Why are you only speaking now?

127
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,370
Your Majesty is truly wise.

128
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,040
I feel deeply ashamed.

129
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:08,280
Today, I have an unreasonable request:

130
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,540
Please, Your Majesty, wait a little longer for Xizhao.

131
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,640
She has important evidence

132
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,680
to present to Your Majesty.

133
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,040
What evidence?

134
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,160
It's evidence related to Noble Consort Jia

135
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,520
manipulating the underground private bank,

136
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
causing the destruction of families,

137
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,160
and ordering her confidants to steal provisions and funds

138
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,690
to frame our Marquis of Changping's Mansion.

139
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,120
Marquise Lu,

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,480
the imperial harem must not interfere in state affairs.

141
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,520
If you're asking me to help overturn the case for the Marquis of Changping's Mansion,

142
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm afraid I can't help.

143
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,300
Greetings, Your Majesty.

144
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,880
Old Madam, bad news!

145
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,120
His lordship and the Fourth Young Madam are in danger.

146
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Please save them!

147
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,600
Mother!

148
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,120
Shaoyang!

149
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:04,960
Xizhao,

150
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,010
are you okay?

151
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,320
I'm fine.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,640
How about you?

153
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,570
Did you get hurt?

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
No.

155
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,140
Let's hurry to Baima Temple to meet Her Majesty.

156
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
Shaoyang,

157
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,440
Don't move!

159
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,040
Watch out!

160
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Lu Shaoyang,

161
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,280
you didn't see this coming, did you?

162
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,490
How does it feel to be betrayed by the one you love?

163
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,520
Shaoyang,

164
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,880
I...

166
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,280
Do you really think you can get to meet the Empress?

167
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,920
Shaoyang,

168
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,920
I had no choice.

169
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,440
They took my bracelet.

170
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Cut the crap.

171
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Give me the letter.

172
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,760
You wish.

173
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,520
If you want it,

174
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,680
come and get it yourself.

175
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,720
Liu Xizhao,

176
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,800
give me the letter,

177
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,760
or kill Lu Shaoyang,

178
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,250
and I'll give the bracelet back to you.

179
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,270
I won't kill him.

180
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,280
You're a psycho.

181
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,600
I'm a psycho?

182
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,550
When you drove my Xin to death,

183
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,000
did you think I wouldn't go psycho on you?

184
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,680
Today, either you die or he dies.

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,800
Only one of you can survive.

186
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,440
I want you to experience the pain

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
of being separated from the one you love.

188
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,650
Huang Xin brought it upon himself.

189
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,440
You two worked together to manipulate the underground private bank.

190
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,500
He forced people who owed money to sell their children,

191
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,400
eventually driving them to suicide.

192
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,040
For that alone,

193
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
even if Huang Xin died 100 times,

194
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,180
it wouldn't be enough.

195
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,200
Lu Shaoyang,

196
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,520
you truly deserve to die.

197
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,940
Everyone from your Marquis's Mansion deserves to die!

198
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,890
I want to kill everyone in your mansion

199
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,200
to avenge Xin.

200
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,320
For revenge,

201
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,440
you actually dared to frame the Marquis's household

202
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,400
and even to rob the court's provisions and funds?

203
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
Yes.

204
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,080
You lost the provisions and funds,

205
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,840
so you'll be sentenced to death.

206
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,840
You could have lived a few more days,

207
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,930
but instead, you delivered yourself right to me.

208
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,640
Liu Xizhao,

209
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,890
do you want the bracelet or not?

210
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Kill Lu Shaoyang.

211
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,330
Do you want the bracelet or not?

212
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,010
If you don't do it now, I'll destroy it!

213
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,320
Lu Shaoyang,

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,320
I understand now.

215
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,280
That bracelet

216
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,370
is very important to me,

217
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,690
but what's even more important

218
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,600
is that I promised you

219
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,120
I wouldn't let you die before me.

220
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
Kill them!

221
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,000
Her Majesty is here.

222
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,650
Your Majesty, why are you here?

223
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,740
Noble Consort Jia,

224
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,580
I just heard you admit to running an underground private bank,

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,840
participating in the robbery of provisions and funds,

226
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,120
and framing loyal officials of the court.

227
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,630
Each of these alone is a serious crime

228
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:47,690
punishable by the extermination of nine generations.

229
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,760
These are merely baseless accusations from despicable people.

230
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,690
His Majesty will not believe them.

231
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,200
Save your energy.

232
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,880
Your Majesty,

233
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,600
here is a handwritten secret letter between Noble Consort Jia

234
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,240
and her associates about the underground private bank.

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Please review it.

236
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,570
I have confirmed

237
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,240
that the robbed provisions and funds

238
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
were in the courtyard behind Dream Music Hall.

239
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,040
They have been melted down into private silver

240
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,640
and are now hidden in a secret room in the residence of Eunuch Gao.

241
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,600
Eunuch Gao,

242
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,920
with both witness and material evidence here,

243
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,440
if you want to save your life, tell the truth,

244
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,440
and I will plead for you with His Majesty.

245
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,120
Your Majesty,

246
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,010
Noble Consort Jia forced me to help her hide the private silver.

247
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,400
I couldn't offend her.

248
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,960
I am innocent.

249
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,720
His Majesty

250
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,280
won't easily believe the words of a eunuch.

251
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,840
Don't waste your efforts.

252
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,880
I will personally present

253
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,160
the witnesses and evidence to His Majesty.

254
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,420
He will surely investigate thoroughly.

255
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,820
Noble Consort Jia,

256
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
whether he believes it or not

257
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,480
is not up to you to control.

258
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:06,720
You...

259
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,240
Guards!

260
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,520
Arrest them!

261
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,320
Yes!

262
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,360
Get up!

263
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:15,960
Go!

264
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,800
Let's wait and see.

265
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,660
Vice Commissioner Lu.

266
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
The Marquis's household is innocent

267
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,390
in the case of the stolen provisions and funds.

268
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,640
But you resisted the decree and escaped from prison.

269
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,040
Come back with me.

270
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,760
Yes.

271
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,540
Wait for me at home.

272
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,840
I'll be back soon.

273
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:52,920
Okay.
