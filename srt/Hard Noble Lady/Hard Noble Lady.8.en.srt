1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,280
Whoever runs the household

3
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,960
can have this bracelet.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,280
Let me try.

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,360
Fourth Sister,

6
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,720
80,000 taels of silver

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,080
is not a small amount.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,200
I'm afraid you've never even seen so much money before.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,530
Can you really solve it?

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,160
You can't solve it.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,560
Then I have to do it.,

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,210
I can't let this crisis hold our mansion back.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,080
Mother, don't worry.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,280
I have my own way

15
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,640
to make money.

16
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,140
Since you're the only one stepping forward,

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,560
just give it a try.

18
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,840
One month later,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,720
all the shops and estates under our mansion

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,440
will come to settle accounts and collect expenses.

21
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,840
If we can't get the money ready for them at the time,

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,080
people will laugh at us.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,480
I'll give you one month.

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,800
In this month,

25
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,560
you can temporarily run the household for me.

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,620
All the shops and staff of the mansion

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,490
will be under your control.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,480
Okay, Mother.

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,080
If I solve the crisis,

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,240
remember to give me the bracelet.

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,320
Let's talk after you make it.

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,880
It can't run away.

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,530
Second Young Madam,

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,880
Old Madam gave up her household management power as a reward this time.

35
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,800
Why did you give her the chance?

36
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,160
Do you think I didn't calculate?

37
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,080
Old Madam only gave us one month.

38
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,160
Even if the crop yield doubled

39
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
and all the shops sold a year's worth of goods,

40
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,440
we can't make enough money.

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,530
What does this mean?

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,250
It means if you want to take over this mess,

43
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,000
you have to put in your own money.

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,280
I don't want to pour my dowry down the drain.

45
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,400
So, this is

46
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,530
simply not worth it.

47
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,200
So,

48
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,920
the Fourth Young Madam can't solve it, either?

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,760
The managers that the Eldest Sister supported

50
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,160
lined their own pockets.

51
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,480
Plus, the Marquis's Mansion always spent a lot.

52
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,560
The money was already tight.

53
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,720
In just a month,

54
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,180
unless we sell the fields,

55
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
otherwise, there's no way to gather over 80,000 taels of silver.

56
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,240
The Eldest Young Madam has acted willfully in the mansion

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,520
for so many years just because the Old Madam backed her up.

58
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,560
But the Fourth Young Madam has only been here for a month, and has already overthrown her.

59
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
She's indeed somebody.

60
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,960
Forget it.

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Anyway, the household management power will be mine one day.

62
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,020
Let Liu Xizhao do whatever she wants for now.

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Even if the restaurants and shops reach their maximum sales

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,880
and the crops are sold at the highest price,

65
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,760
still,

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,800
it would take a year to make

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,130
80,000 taels of silver.

68
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,360
Young Madam,

69
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,520
you might as well give up.

70
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,220
Even Second Young Madam didn't dare to accept this hot potato.

71
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,640
You haven't even touched money very often before.

72
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,840
How could you make 80,000 taels a month?

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,720
Making the impossible possible

74
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,640
is what I used to be best at.

75
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,760
Actually, in your market,

76
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,220
there are still many gaps.

77
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,480
Now we should create a brand new product

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,730
and try to sell it at the highest price.

79
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,579
But we lack resources.

80
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,840
We should solve this problem first.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,760
The largest income

82
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
for the Marquis's Mansion comes from these farms.

83
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,079
Look at this Xuanqing Farm.

84
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,280
It's the largest one,

85
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,360
but in recent years,

86
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
it has paid the least money.

87
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,160
Only 150 catties of grains for every mu of land.

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,720
It was more than 600 catties per mu five years ago.

89
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,780
The difference is more than a little.

90
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,300
And look at the number of tenants.

91
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
Usually, to plant 100 mus of land,

92
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,770
ten households are needed.

93
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,820
Xuanqing Farm has 800 mus of land,

94
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,240
but there are only about 20 households.

95
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,370
Is that reasonable?

96
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,740
I don't understand these things.

97
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,500
Let's go to Xuanqing Farm.

98
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
I need to look into them thoroughly.

99
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,640
Bing,

100
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
bring some servants.

101
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
We're going to patrol the farms.

102
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes.

103
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,839
My Lord,

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,680
I've packed some clothes.

105
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,820
Are you really not going to

106
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,640
move back to live with Young Madam?

107
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,040
If there's nothing else,

108
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,330
go and air the books.

109
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,880
Yes.

110
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
I heard you're temporarily in charge of managing the household.

111
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,480
If you need my help,

112
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,480
I can consider it.

113
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,960
No need.

114
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,800
I want to borrow Qingshan

115
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,220
to accompany me in patrolling the farms.

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,960
The Eldest Sister has been grounded for three months.

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,320
No one will give you a hard time.

118
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
You could have left this mess alone.

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,170
You're not a person who covets the household management power.

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
You want Mother's bracelet.

121
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,560
What's so strange about that bracelet?

122
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,520
What can be so strange about a bracelet?

123
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
Of course I want the real power.

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,890
If I want to establish a foothold in this mansion,

125
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,000
of course I have to please the Old Madam.

126
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,760
Whether you can establish a foothold

127
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,080
is not clear yet.

128
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
The affairs of the Marquis's Mansion are intricate and entangled.

129
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,330
They are not that easy to solve.

130
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,120
I'll leave Qingshan to you.

131
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,380
I'm going to the Imperial City Division.

132
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,200
Don't look for me.

133
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
Don't look for me.

134
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
Don't look for me.

135
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Don't look for me.

136
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,840
I didn't mean it.

137
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,440
People who come here…

138
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,760
People who come here…

139
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,120
will all be cursed!

140
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,159
Will all be cursed!

141
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,240
Zhang Da,

142
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,520
you trespassed on the haunted house.

143
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,600
Now you are crazy because of the scare.

144
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,000
You're lucky to be even alive.

145
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,760
Take him away.

146
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,640
Lock him up!

147
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:58,720
You two,

148
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,290
take those away.

149
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
You will be cursed!

150
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,480
Bailiff Wu.

151
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,280
This is the Fourth Young Madam from the Marquis of Changping's Mansion.

152
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,340
She's here to patrol the farms on behalf of His Lordship and Her Ladyship.

153
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,640
So you're the Fourth Young Madam who's newly married.

154
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,100
At your wedding ceremony,

155
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,600
His Lordship treated me to a drink.

156
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,440
If we map out our family connections,

157
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,200
you have to call me Uncle.

158
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,720
I'm a woman now.

159
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,860
I can't be looked down upon by him.

160
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,400
Bailiff Wu,

161
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
Mother asked me to patrol the farmers for her.

162
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,380
Let's get down to business first.

163
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
Okay.

164
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,280
Please.

165
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,130
Young Madam.

166
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,400
These are the ledgers of the past six months.

167
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,960
We received nearly 100,000 catties of grains.

168
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Just like in previous years,

169
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,840
all the grains were sold to the grain shops in the city.

170
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
The money we gained

171
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,570
was handed over to the accounting room of the Marquis's Mansion five days ago.

172
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,360
Qingshan,

173
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,840
go with Bailiff Wu to take stock of the warehouse

174
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,720
and check the transaction documents with the grain stores.

175
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Yes.

176
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
Bailiff Wu.

177
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,080
Please.

178
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,240
Okay.

179
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,120
Please.

180
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,000
When I was checking the ledgers yesterday,

181
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,880
I accidentally knocked over the candlestick

182
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,720
and burned all the contracts with the tenants.

183
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,159
So I came here today

184
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,600
to sign new contracts.

185
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,640
Young Madam,

186
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,560
it's late now.

187
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,640
How about we do that tomorrow?

188
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,680
When Bailiff Wu comes back,

189
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,760
let him arrange it.

190
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,920
No need.

191
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,990
I've already asked the tenants

192
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,680
waiting at the gate.

193
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,680
They just need to sign it.

194
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,880
It's not too much trouble.

195
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,240
We'd better wait for Bailiff Wu to come back.

196
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,400
You mean

197
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,160
Bailiff Wu is more authoritative than me?

198
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,680
No, no, no.

199
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,280
I dare not.

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,000
I dare not.

201
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,200
Young Madam,

202
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,560
it's the same as you expected.

203
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,320
The actual number of people is different from the list.

204
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,280
Over 100 households of tenants came to sign the contract.

205
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,080
Got it.

206
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,160
Young Madam.

207
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,010
I heard that you are going to sign new tenant contracts here?

208
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,560
Many people

209
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,720
came to settle on our farm this year.

210
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,560
Originally,

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,160
I wanted to choose carefully

212
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,480
before signing the contract with them.

213
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,320
It's just a formality, Bailiff Wu.

214
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,120
Don't think too much.

215
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,010
Take me out for a walk around

216
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,840
while the sun is still up.

217
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,280
Young Madam,

218
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,160
it's raining outside.

219
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
Shall we take a rain check?

220
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,360
What?

221
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,220
Bailiff Wu, do you have anything shady going on?

222
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,200
No, no, no.

223
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,440
Young Madam,

224
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,360
please.

225
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,680
Please.

226
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,690
Young Madam.

227
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,440
This way.

228
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,410
Young Madam.

229
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,540
The land down the mountain

230
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
is the farm I planted with my people.

231
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,810
But not long ago, it suffered a pest infestation,

232
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,360
so the crop yield is low.

233
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,400
Such a big mansion.

234
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,760
Is it just left to rot?

235
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,080
Young Madam.

236
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
This yard is haunted.

237
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
Zhang Da, who had burned paper before,

238
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,720
was possessed by something here.

239
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,480
That's why

240
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,120
he went crazy.

241
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,570
Young Madam.

242
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,840
You're a noble lady.

243
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,370
You'd better not get close.

244
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
Young Madam,

245
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
this way, please.

246
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
Let me show you other fields.
