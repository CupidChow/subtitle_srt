1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:21,920
Xizhao.

3
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,970
Why are you here?

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,360
I bribed the guards.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,690
I only have half an hour.

6
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:29,880
Tell me.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,280
What on earth happened?

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,000
Leave it.

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,370
This has nothing to do with you.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,320
Take care of yourself.

11
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,120
Hurry up!

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,400
Don't you want a divorce?

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,260
I've written the divorce agreement.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,530
It's fake. Stop reading it.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,020
Tell me quickly. We don't have much time.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
On the way of transportation,

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,400
someone poisoned our water.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,200
We were ambushed.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,480
Go on.

20
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,720
I suspect there was a mole.

21
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,440
The route had already been leaked.

22
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,900
The robbers have ambushed there in advance.

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
It's Lu Shaozhen.

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,280
Yes.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,720
He also reported to His Majesty

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,800
that the provisions and funds were lost.

27
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,800
Something was wrong with your food and water.

28
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,860
The route has long been leaked by him.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,840
How is everyone in the mansion?

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,640
We're…

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,760
all trying to save you.

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,680
Anyway, the priority now

33
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,000
is to find that batch of provisions and funds.

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,039
Tell me what to do.

35
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,280
The military silver of the imperial court

36
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,759
is marked by a unique sign.

37
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,479
If it is to circulate directly in the market,

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,340
they will definitely be exposed.

39
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,400
So they need to

40
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,920
melt it down into private silver

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,640
so that it can circulate secretly.

42
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,080
It's such a large batch of silver.

43
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,740
They can never melt it at once.

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,160
To melt down such a large batch of silver,

45
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,620
they'll need a lot of coal.

46
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,759
Find someone to keep an eye on Lu Shaozhen.

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,120
Ask Qingshan to inquire

48
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,520
if any shops or workshops

49
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,200
have bought a lot of coal recently.

50
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,960
Time's up.

51
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,520
Don't act on your own.

52
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,290
With Qingshan protecting you,

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,720
I can feel a little reassured.

54
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,450
You take care of yourself, too.

55
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,120
This heartless Lu Shaozhen

56
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,850
actually kicked us out of the Marquis's Mansion!

57
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
The ancestral house is so shabby.

58
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,440
How can we live without anything?

59
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,640
The tiles on the roof are all broken.

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,970
Even the door is broken.

61
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,840
I'm so miserable.

62
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,880
Other women's husbands get promoted,

63
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,400
but I end up like a beggar.

64
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,480
Eldest Sister,

65
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,800
what's the point of saying that now?

66
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,200
Even the Marquis's Mansion is gone.

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,760
Don't act like you're still running the household!

68
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,440
Enough.

69
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,520
You've been fighting from the Marquis's Mansion to this place.

70
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,800
Save your energy.

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,280
Before the old Marquis left, he said

72
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,600
if something really happened,

73
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,730
women were useless.

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,880
Now,

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
there are only a few of us women left.

76
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,080
Now tell me.

77
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,200
Are we useful or not?

78
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Right now,

79
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,000
we need to unite

80
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,760
to settle down

81
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,040
and find a way

82
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,760
to save those men in prison.

83
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,000
You are the one!

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,200
Lvzhu.

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,760
Inform Mrs. Zhang

86
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,280
to clean this place up as soon as possible

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,210
so that Old Madam can come and rest.

88
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,160
Xueying,

89
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,440
find a doctor

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,840
to treat Old Madam.

91
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,400
Go.

92
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:36,920
Yes.

93
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
I'll go get something for the kitchen.

94
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
After all, we have to eat.

95
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,579
Second Sister,

96
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,880
your family has many connections in the capital.

97
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,360
Can you help me find out

98
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,210
if anyone has placed big orders of coal recently?

99
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,440
Coal?

100
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,110
Okay.

101
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,200
Wait for my news.

102
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,420
Thank you, Second Sister.

103
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,120
As a woman,

104
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,720
in this time of crisis,

105
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,320
I must unite the whole family

106
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,520
to overcome this difficulty together.

107
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,440
Doctor, how is it?

108
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,600
The Old Madam's heart and blood are not balanced.

109
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,960
Her Qi in the liver and spleen is stagnant.

110
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,760
She needs to replenish her energy and recuperate.

111
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,800
She can't be stimulated in any way again.

112
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,880
Otherwise, even the medication won't work.

113
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Goodbye.

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,779
Thank you, Doctor.

115
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,410
Fourth Young Madam.

116
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,840
Second Young Madam's informant reported that

117
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,600
recently,

118
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,720
someone in the city indeed bought a lot of coal.

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,400
Where?

120
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,040
We don't know where the coal was transported.

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,100
But the accounts were recorded under Dream Music Hall.

122
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,920
Dream Music Hall…

123
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,520
Go on keeping an eye on Lu Shaozhen.

124
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,600
I'll go to the music hall to find out the truth.

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,080
Yes.

126
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:46,840
Xizhao,

127
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,920
since you already know that this music hall is suspicious,

128
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,400
I'm afraid it'll be dangerous for you to go there rashly.

129
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,360
Don't let anyone know who you are.

130
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,080
Qingshan,

131
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,430
get me a man's outfit.

132
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,240
Okay.

133
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,200
Sir, you look so handsome.

134
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,480
Do you have an appointed entertainer?

135
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,360
No need.

136
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,480
Sir,

137
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,920
do you really don't need anyone?

138
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,360
Lu Shaoyang?

139
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,400
Why is he out?

140
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
The view on the second floor is better.

141
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,720
I'll go upstairs.

142
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,040
Just have a drink!

143
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,840
You promised me before.

144
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,120
Why didn't you keep your word?

145
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,000
Now, the whole Marquis's Mansion is yours.

146
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,720
What else do you want?

147
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,240
I know you took over the underground private bank.

148
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,360
So what?

149
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,570
In that case,

150
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,520
you should give me one more share of the provisions and funds.

151
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,650
If His Majesty knows

152
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,050
that the military silver is melted

153
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,740
right in the backyard of this music hall,

154
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,730
will His Majesty let you go?

155
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,000
Lu Shaozhen,

156
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,760
it's dangerous to act smart.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,800
Who's there?

158
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Guards!

159
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,080
Search every room.

160
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,560
Yes.

161
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,400
You stay here.

162
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,800
Keep searching!

163
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,560
Yes.

164
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,000
Who let you in?

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,280
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,000
Get out!

167
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,120
Let's go.

168
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,790
What are you doing?

169
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,680
Sorry to bother you.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,800
Get lost!

171
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,230
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,150
Why are you out?

173
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
Wait for me at the back alley of the market tomorrow night.

174
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,780
You're leaving without making it clear?

175
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
We must make him plead guilty today.

176
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,600
This...

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,800
Please spare my life!

178
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,330
I really don't know when Lu Shaoyang escaped.

179
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,240
I really didn't expect

180
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,500
Lord Lu of the Imperial City Division would do such a thing!

181
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,450
It's okay. I'll sit for a while.

182
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,960
Be careful, Old Madam.

183
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:30,960
Mother,

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,640
you are still sick.

185
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,770
Why did you come out?

186
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,400
Such a big thing happened.

187
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
I'm always

188
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,480
upset.

189
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,560
You think too much.

190
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,280
Your priority now is to recover.

191
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Bad news!

192
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,000
Shaoyang escaped from jail!

193
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,840
The notice is all over the place.

194
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,600
Mother.

195
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,680
I told you I had a bad feeling.

196
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,080
Where is Shaoyang?

197
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,840
Shaoyang…

198
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
Will something happen to him?

199
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,480
No, Mother.

200
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,720
Shaoyang…

201
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,880
He knows what he's doing.

202
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,440
He must have his own reason to do that.

203
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,760
Besides, Shaoyang knows kung fu.

204
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,240
He will protect himself.

205
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,440
Yes, Mother.

206
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,760
Don't worry anymore.

207
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,850
We need you to support this family.

208
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,460
His Lordship and the others are gone.

209
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
Our family can't break up.

210
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,640
You...

211
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,480
You must take good care of yourselves

212
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,920
and wait for the men to come back.

213
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,480
I have to go to the backyard of the music hall to find evidence,

214
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,080
so that I can clear Lu Shaoyang's name quickly.

215
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,740
Indeed, they're melting the military silver here.

216
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,610
Young Madam,

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,130
this is the backyard of the music hall.

218
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,600
Looks like this is the place of melting silver.

219
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,600
But judged by the traces in the yard,

220
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,420
the melted silver has been transferred.

221
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,960
What should we do then?

222
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,220
The clue runs dry here.

223
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,680
The man who sneaked in just now escaped so fast.

224
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,040
Luckily, we reacted in time

225
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,120
and transferred the silver.

226
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,920
That man seemed to be Lu Shaoyang from the Imperial City Division.

227
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,650
Lu Shaoyang?

228
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,850
Let's go.

229
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,120
I'll guard the alley entrance for you.

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,600
Okay.

231
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,210
Why did you escape from prison?

232
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,300
Are you hiding something from me?

233
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,560
If you don't tell me the truth,

234
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,690
I'll ask the constables to arrest you.

235
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,280
I was afraid you couldn't handle them,

236
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,140
so I came out to help you secretly.

237
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,320
The stolen silver

238
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,490
is all melted in the music hall.

239
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,320
They stole the military silver and melted it secretly.

240
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,600
Then, they'd circulate it through the underground private bank.

241
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Meanwhile, they can get the Marquis's Mansion raided.

242
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,760
The person behind this is very cunning.

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,930
It's Noble Consort Jia.

244
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,780
Are you afraid?

245
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,560
Xizhao.

246
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,530
Don't worry.

247
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,250
We can bring Noble Consort Jia down

248
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,290
and avenge Bing.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,080
I will protect you.
