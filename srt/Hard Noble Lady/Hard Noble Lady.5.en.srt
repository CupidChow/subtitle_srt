1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,920
You saw that, didn't you?

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,360
It’s broad daylight; it shouldn’t be a ghost, right?

4
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,880
That’s Yuanxu, the Little Young Master,

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,480
the only grandson of Old Madam and the Marquis.

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
He’s the son of the Second Sister?

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,400
Yes.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,760
I heard that he started having corpse spots

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,200
when he was very young.

10
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:31,080
They’ve found many famous doctors, but none of them could cure him.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,640
How...

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,080
how could a living person have corpse spots?

13
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,840
Didn’t you see it too?

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,560
Everyone in the mansion says Little Young Master is a living dead.

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,760
They say he's unlucky

16
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,440
and won’t live past 10 years old.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,200
I don't believe it.

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,920
There’s no such thing as living dead.

19
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,200
There must be something strange about this.

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,080
We should stay out of it.

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
It’s too ominous.

22
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,090
Young Madam,

23
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,400
Little Young Master is Old Madam’s pride and joy.

24
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,960
If anything goes wrong, we'll be in big trouble.

25
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,440
Bing,

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,360
I think Little Young Master is quite pitiful.

27
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,760
Let's go and see what's going on.

28
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,680
Young Madam,

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,440
let's not go.

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,680
Don't be afraid.

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,440
I'm here.

32
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,240
Help!

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Little Young Master is having a fit!

34
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,400
Help! Little Young Master is having a fit!

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Somebody help him!

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,039
Help!

37
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,840
Where do you feel unwell?

38
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,820
Tell me where you feel unwell.

39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,800
Why are you hitting Little Young Master?

40
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,200
Pull her away.

41
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,840
Fourth Young Madam!

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,320
Okay.

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,640
Help!

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,560
Someone is hitting Little Young Master!

45
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,200
Throw up!

46
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,920
Hurry!

47
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,640
Help!

48
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,720
Help!

49
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
Someone is hitting Little Young Master!

50
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:32,920
Help! Help!

51
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,600
Shut up!

52
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,640
What's going on?

53
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,680
What's with the noise? Outrageous!

54
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,400
Old Madam!

55
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,080
Help!

56
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,320
Old Madam, bad news!

57
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,240
The Fourth Young Madam wants to kill Little Young Master!

58
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:42,640
Let's go.

59
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,680
Help!

60
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,280
Throw up!

61
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,160
Fourth Young Madam.

62
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,039
Help!

63
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,100
What are you doing?

64
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,440
Let go of him!

65
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,039
Xu.

66
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,840
Wake up, Xu.

67
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,840
Xu!

68
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,160
Xu!

69
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,320
What grievance could a child have with you?

70
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,600
How could you be so vicious

71
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,730
as to try to kill him?

72
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,680
Liu Xizhao, how dare you!

73
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,320
Kneel properly.

74
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,680
Kneel properly!

75
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,610
Kneel properly!

76
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,360
Liu Xizhao,

77
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,240
in broad daylight,

78
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,560
you actually dared to kill Little Young Master.

79
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Xizhao,

80
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,050
if anything happens to Yuanxu,

81
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,640
I will not let you off the hook!

82
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Why are you accusing me of trying to kill him?

83
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,950
We all saw it.

84
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,520
Are you saying we’re framing you?

85
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,760
I was trying to save him.

86
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
Saving him?

87
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,880
Stop with your nonsense.

88
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,400
Yuanxu!

89
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,120
Xu!

90
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,880
Yuanxu!

91
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,640
Xu.

92
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:41,960
How do you feel?

93
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,520
Yuanxu.

94
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:43,960
Xu.

95
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,040
Let me ask you.

96
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
Just now,

97
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,400
was she trying to kill you?

98
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,800
Mother,

99
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:56,320
you’ve wronged this lady.

100
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
I was eating a chicken leg,

101
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,880
and a bone got stuck in my throat.

102
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,680
She saved me.

103
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,060
Since it was a misunderstanding,

104
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,190
you can get up.

105
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,000
Xu.

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Grandmother, I'm hungry.

107
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,640
I want to eat meat.

108
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:19,800
Okay.

109
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,520
Let's eat.

110
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,880
Here.

111
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,200
How about eating some vegetables first?

112
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,880
I don't want it!

113
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
I want meat!

114
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,520
Be good, Xu.

115
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,240
I want meat!

116
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,800
I want meat!

117
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,840
Let him eat whatever he likes.

118
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,320
Don’t be too harsh on my grandson.

119
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,960
I didn't even get a "thank you."

120
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
Forget it.

121
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,690
I should just think about how to get the bracelet now.

122
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,160
If I want to get the bracelet, I’ll have to steal it.

123
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,220
But I have no experience in stealing.

124
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,520
Who is it?

125
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:02,930
Who is it?

126
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,600
It’s me.

127
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,900
It's Fourth Young Master.

128
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,490
Let’s go.

129
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,480
The Marquis's Mansion has its rules.

130
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,680
What are you doing here at Mother’s place so late at night?

131
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,040
I...

132
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,500
was just taking a walk.

133
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,079
Do you believe it?

134
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,399
I heard that you saved Yuanxu today.

135
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Yes.

136
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,890
But your family didn't even say thank you.

137
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,080
I am not an ungrateful person.

138
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,600
If you have any requests,

139
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,480
just let me know.

140
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,280
Really?

141
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,080
I want Old Madam's bracelet.

142
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,960
It was granted by the late Emperor.

143
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,760
Unless Mother herself is willing to give it,

144
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,480
no one else can make her.

145
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,170
Okay. Let's just forget it.

146
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:43,800
I'm sleepy.

147
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,860
I’m going to sleep.

148
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,800
You can make other requests.

149
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,930
Save them for later.

150
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,570
Great, Young Madam.

151
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,680
Because you saved Little Young Master Yuanxu,

152
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,880
Old Madam has permitted you to do morning and evening greetings from now on.

153
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,320
I feel like I’ve seen an illness similar to Yuanxu’s before.

154
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,960
Why can't I remember?

155
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,930
Young Madam,

156
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,700
eating some vegetables is good for your health.

157
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Right.

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,120
I remember now.

159
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,290
I know how to save Little Young Master.

160
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,180
Fourth Sister,

161
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,720
I was too hasty yesterday

162
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,000
and didn’t have the chance to properly thank you.

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,240
Here are some osmanthus cakes, a specialty from my hometown.

164
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,720
I brought them specially for you to try today.

165
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,159
Thank you, Second Sister.

166
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,760
These careless servants.

167
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,120
If it hadn’t been for you yesterday,

168
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,040
who knows what kind of trouble they would have caused.

169
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,400
Yuanxu is the treasure of the entire Marquis's Mansion.

170
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,159
It is my duty

171
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:53,000
to help you.

172
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,560
I’m not used to saying such things.

173
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,920
Little vixen.

174
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,880
She’s always good at acting.

175
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,740
Second Sister,

176
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,840
I saw the spots on Yuanxu’s body yesterday.

177
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,560
This child, for some unknown reason,

178
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,280
has had this strange illness

179
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,890
since he was 3 or 4 years old.

180
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,120
Does Little Young Master

181
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,920
usually prefer greasy meat dishes

182
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,400
and avoid eating vegetables and fruits?

183
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,200
Yes.

184
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,760
This child

185
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,480
has always been picky with food.

186
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,740
It’s already a miracle

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
that he’s lived this long.

188
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,640
Yuanxu’s illness isn’t something

189
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,800
that can be cured just by eating some fruits and vegetables.

190
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,440
I actually think it’s not that complicated.

191
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,840
Really?

192
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,530
Do you have a method?

193
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,600
Mother,

194
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,520
what experience does she have?

195
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,640
What does she know?

196
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,600
Could she be more capable than the imperial physicians?

197
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,720
That's true.

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,120
Mother,

199
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,600
Yuanxu is at an age where he loves to play.

200
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,200
If he gets better sooner,

201
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,650
your courtyard will be lively for longer.

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes.

203
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,440
Why don't you let me give it a try?

204
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,500
I might be able to help him get better.

205
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,040
You give it a try?

206
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
If something goes wrong,

207
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
can you handle the consequences?

208
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,240
Everyone wants Little Young Master to get better soon.

209
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,100
Why do you always stand in our way?

210
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,080
When did I ever stand in your way?

211
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,560
I’m just worried about Xu.

212
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,760
Don’t try to sow discord among us.

213
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,680
How about this?

214
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,800
Let me try to treat him.

215
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,440
If it doesn’t work,

216
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,460
you can do whatever you like to me.

217
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,120
There are no cherries

218
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,560
or kiwis.

219
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,960
Lemons! There must be lemons, right?

220
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,720
Young Madam, I’ve never heard any of the things you mentioned.

221
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
Now that I've already made my statement,

222
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,850
what should I do?

223
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,400
I was hoping to cure Little Young Master

224
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,240
and that the Old Madam might lend me the bracelet for a few days if she was pleased.

225
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,800
But it's not fruit season.

226
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,840
Not to mention those rare fruits,

227
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,100
even ordinary fruits are hard to come by.

228
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,200
The underground bank and the suicide case must be related.

229
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,560
Deploy more people to keep an eye on it.

230
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,280
Report to me immediately if you find anything.

231
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,240
What about those debt collectors?

232
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,200
Should we capture them for interrogation?

233
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,720
No need.

234
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,720
Just keep an eye on them.

235
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,240
Yes.

236
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,200
By the way,

237
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,680
I heard from the servants

238
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
that the Fourth Young Madam and the Eldest Young Madam

239
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,760
made a bet about curing Little Young Master Yuanxu’s illness.

240
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,280
None of the famous doctors in the capital can cure Yuanxu’s illness.

241
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,350
Isn’t she just setting herself up to fail?

242
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,800
The Young Madam seems to be looking for some fruits.

243
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,260
My Lord,

244
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,400
will you help her?

245
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,160
Although the vitamin C content is a bit low,

246
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,560
it’s still better than nothing.

247
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,919
Lu Shaoyang?

248
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,720
What are you doing here?

249
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,600
I heard that

250
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,000
someone is trying to cure Xu’s illness.

251
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,120
I’m just acting out of goodwill.

252
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,080
You’re not going to accuse me of illegal medical practice and have me arrested, are you?

253
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,540
I’m just here to remind you

254
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,800
that Mother treasures Xu very much.

255
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,320
If anything happens to him,

256
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
your life won’t be enough to compensate.

257
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,200
You’re overthinking it.

258
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:58,840
Don’t worry.

259
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,970
I’ll take care of it.

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:01,840
Leave now.

261
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,080
Wait.

262
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,560
Lord Lu,

263
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,040
you know

264
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,960
a lot of people outside, right?

265
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,920
Surely you can find some fruit,

266
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,280
like lemons, kiwis, and cherries, can't you?

267
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,360
Fruits?

268
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
That is your request?

269
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,080
You can’t even

270
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,840
manage that?

271
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,360
Of course I can.

272
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,980
My Lord,

273
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,280
these are all the prisoners involved in smuggling

274
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,360
and trading goods from the Western Region.

275
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,120
I have an opportunity for you to atone for your crimes.

276
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,280
Seize it.

277
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,560
Raise your heads!

278
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,960
Look.

279
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,420
Does anyone recognize

280
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,060
the fruits in the picture?

281
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,720
Who can find some?

282
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,240
Lord Lu,

283
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,600
I know these two.

284
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,440
Maybe I can find some.

285
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Qingshan,

286
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,640
take him

287
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,300
and find the fruit.

288
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:10,920
Yes.

289
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,000
Here, Yuanxu. Be good.

290
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,240
You need to take the medicine to recover.

291
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,570
Here.

292
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,510
I won’t drink it, I won’t!

293
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,360
Look at you.

294
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,640
If you don't take the medicine,

295
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,200
I'll force it on you.

296
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,880
Oh dear.

297
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,080
Xu.

298
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,600
My grandson is weak

299
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,720
and has a bad temper.

300
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,580
Last time, he almost passed out when we tried to force medicine on him.

301
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,400
Alright. We won’t force it this time.

302
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,600
Fourth Sister, you're here.

303
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,280
Have a seat.

304
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,440
Second Sister,

305
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,080
I'm here to bring the medicine to Little Young Master.

306
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,640
Medicine?

307
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,840
Don't cry, Xu.

308
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,040
Be good.

309
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,160
Little Young Master,

310
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
look.

311
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:53,240
What is this?

312
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:54,720
Look.

313
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,520
It smells good.

314
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,480
Cherry-flavored ice cream.

315
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,100
This is the medicine you brought?

316
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,440
How could this possibly cure a disease?

317
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,560
Here.

318
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,560
Wow, what is this? It tastes so good!

319
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,480
This is called ice cream.

320
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,320
Ice cream?

321
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,560
I like ice cream.

322
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
It’s so delicious.

323
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,240
If you like it, you can have some more yourself.

324
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,080
Although it’s tasty,

325
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,360
don’t overeat it.

326
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,780
Just one bowl a day.

327
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,680
You still need to take your medicine.

328
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,720
As long as you behave,

329
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,780
I’ll give you ice cream in different flavors every day.

330
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,040
What’s it made of?

331
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,800
I’ve never seen it before.

332
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,080
It looks quite pretty.

333
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,920
It’s made of fruit, milk, and ice shavings.

334
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,870
Kids love it.

335
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,600
Eat slowly.

336
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Eat slowly.

337
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,920
Xin.

338
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,160
I know it was me

339
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,720
who made you so angry.

340
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,160
You did all this for my marriage.

341
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,650
If it weren’t for me,

342
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,760
Mrs. Liu wouldn’t have died tragically.

343
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,200
I dare not cause you any more trouble.

344
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,880
Don’t say that.

345
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,840
It was all that little wretch Liu Xizhao’s fault.

346
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,920
We need to come up with a plan to deal with her.

347
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,750
Liu Xizhao is indeed despicable,

348
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,240
but you need to be careful.

349
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,760
Since Mrs. Liu's death,

350
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
I’ve been very unsettled

351
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,300
and have been constantly put down by Liu Xizhao.

352
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,500
Now, you’re the only one I can rely on.

353
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,480
Xin,

354
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
ever since Liu Xizhao

355
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,240
fell into the water,

356
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,880
her temperament has completely changed.

357
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,360
And now Shaoyang is so protective of her.

358
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,800
I'm thinking,

359
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,820
could it be that she’s using some kind of dark magic?

360
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,480
Dark magic?

361
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,080
Are you saying

362
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,720
she’s using it to control Lu Shaoyang?

363
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,880
Would she dare?

364
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,330
Using dark magic to control others

365
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,960
could get her arrested.

366
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,800
Xin,

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,880
think about it.

368
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,440
Liu Xizhao married above her station

369
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,680
and climbed the social ladder.

370
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,880
Using some means to keep her husband tightly in her grasp—

371
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,200
even if it’s risky—

372
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,940
wouldn’t be a loss for her.

373
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,560
I’ve heard

374
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,710
that there are potions that can dispel dark magic.

375
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,600
We should find a way to get some.

376
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Don’t worry, Xin.

377
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,040
I'll do as you say

378
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,620
and use the potion to remove the dark magic from Liu Xizhao.

379
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,080
I will always be here for you.

380
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,920
Good sister.

381
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,520
What a fool,

382
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,720
to actually believe that dark magic exists.
