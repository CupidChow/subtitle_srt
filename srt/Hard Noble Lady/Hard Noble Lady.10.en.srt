1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,280
Lord Lu.

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,920
Lord Lu.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,840
People from the underground private bank were so cautious.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,370
I was discovered in the end.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,120
I've been hiding my real identity for so long.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,120
But I didn't even see the mastermind.

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,320
However, I've heard that

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,920
the underground private bank's money laundering institution

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,720
is located in the Yongle Casino.

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,160
Yongle Casino?

12
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,880
Qin Zhiyuan,

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,120
35 years old,

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,640
used to work as a tenant farmer in the Li's Estate.

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,500
He's literate.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,960
He's applying for the position of bailiff.

17
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,520
Ms. Zhang,

18
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
28 years old,

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,240
has never worked outside before as she's a woman.

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,900
She's applying for the position of wine brewer.

21
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,800
Since you're literate and have studied at school before,

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,000
then I'll ask you a question to test you.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,180
Imagine that there are 500 combs now.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,260
You need to sell them all to the monks.

25
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,930
What are you going to do?

26
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,880
Young Madam, have you asked a wrong test question?

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,920
I'll give you some time to think about it carefully.

28
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,050
Think it through before you answer me.

29
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,930
Fourth Young Madam,

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,039
monks don't need combs.

31
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,240
However,

32
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,039
the guests who come to offer incense may need them.

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,440
We can ask the temple to engrave the sutra on the comb

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,759
and name it

35
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,080
"Peace Comb", "Virtues Accumulation Comb" or "Good Deeds Comb".

36
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,120
They can give the combs to those guests who have donated money to the temple.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,440
It'll not only promote the ideas of Buddhism,

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,800
but it'll also be a way to thank the people for their kindness.

39
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Very good.

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,440
Literate men are supposed to be quick-witted.

41
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
You are hired.

42
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,130
Thank you, Fourth Young Madam.

43
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,560
I really don't understand such a test question

44
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,360
you've asked.

45
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,400
I'm leaving first.

46
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,000
Wait.

47
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
You're

48
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,400
hired, too.

49
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,280
Young Madam.

50
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,740
She didn't even say a word.

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
As soon as Ms. Zhang came in,

52
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,000
I smelled the fragrance of osmanthus.

53
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,440
If she hadn't dealt with wine for many years,

54
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,640
she wouldn't have got the smell of wine.

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,480
The smell of the wine is quite mellow,

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,360
which can last for a long time with a slightly sweet fragrance.

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
I can sense that

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,240
she's very good at brewing wine.

59
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,000
What's more, Ms. Zhang is wearing a wine spoon on on her waist.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,320
It's obvious that Ms. Zhang usually loves brewing wine.

61
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,360
My Lady, I've heard that you're a very resourceful woman.

62
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,560
Seeing you here today, I think that it's true indeed.

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,680
No wonder that evil-hearted Bailiff Wu

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,840
was punished by you.

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,079
You have no idea

66
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:45,240
how much trouble he has brought to tenants like us.

67
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,079
Yes.

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,840
Alright.

69
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
You're

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,120
all hired.

71
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
Come to work tomorrow.

72
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,200
We're all hired?

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,880
That's great.

74
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you, Fourth Young Madam.

75
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
Is my monthly salary

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,840
the same as the other wine brewers'?

77
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,640
Of course.

78
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,920
In my place, the distinctions of monthly salaries

79
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,560
are definitely not decided by gender,

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,200
but your ability and skills.

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,180
I have faith in you.

82
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,600
Thank you, Ma'am.

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,800
I'll do my best.

84
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,280
I didn't expect that though Fourth Young Madam looks young,

85
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,200
she would be such a capable woman.

86
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,290
Just think about what we should do.

87
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,520
Without this job,

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,200
how should we make a living in the future?

89
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,960
If she is in charge of the Marquis's Mansion's affairs in the future,

90
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,160
and we offend her now,

91
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,800
we'll suffer a lot.

92
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,480
Yes.

93
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,079
If she gives the evidence to His Lordship,

94
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:32,880
we might

95
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,579
be sued if we don't handle it well.

96
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,320
-Young Madam.
-Young Madam.

97
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,920
We know that it's our fault, Young Madam.

98
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,680
-Please spare us.
-Please spare us.

99
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,340
Please spare us, Young Madam.

100
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,600
Young Madam.

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,880
Please spare us.

102
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,560
We'll do anything for you.

103
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,000
We'll be at your disposal.

104
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,800
Alright!

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,260
Bailiff Zhang.

106
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
You are a smart man.

107
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,720
If you want me to spare you,

108
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,440
you have to show some sincerity, don't you?

109
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,720
Isn't the grain you've deducted quite enough?

110
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,880
You have to tell me how much money you've embezzled

111
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,040
in the past three years, don't you?

112
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Young Madam.

113
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,720
Currently, the grain costs ten copper coins per catty.

114
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,230
We need to sell a lot of grain

115
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,360
to get 80,000 taels.

116
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,360
Bing.

117
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,320
Your Young Madam wants to sell the grain at the price of 20 taels per catty.

118
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Do you believe it?

119
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,570
Twenty taels per catty? How is that possible?

120
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,720
If I want to get 80,000 taels

121
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,200
within such a short time,

122
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,080
I have to use an unusual tactic.

123
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,409
We just need to find a way

124
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,760
to make those rich officials' descendants

125
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,630
and those rich merchants buy the grain.

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Just wait and see.

127
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,770
Second Young Madam.

128
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,920
I beg you.

129
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,120
Isn't this Bailiff Wu?

130
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,920
Why are you here

131
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,760
when it's not a festival now?

132
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,450
Fourth Young Madam deposed the old employees like us

133
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,410
and promoted some people she had found from nowhere.

134
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,760
Although I've embezzled some money,

135
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,240
I have done many things

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,120
for the Marquis's Mansion all these years.

137
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
Please tell me what to do, My Lady.

138
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,600
Bailiff Wu.

139
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,660
It's not that I don’t want to help you.

140
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,640
She has just taken over the post, so she's applying strict measures.

141
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,440
I don't know what to do, either.

142
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,920
However,

143
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
the financial condition of our mansion is not quite good now.

144
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,000
If someone comes here to ask us to pay the bill, and we can't pay it,

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,200
there will be a big trouble by that time.

146
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,159
I understand.

147
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,130
Thank you, Second Young Madam.

148
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,980
The fire is not strong enough.

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,480
How is it?

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Young Madam.

151
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,120
So you want to use the grain to make wine?

152
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,120
Greetings, Fourth Young Madam.

153
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,520
It's time to pay the bill for the goods of your apparel fabric shop.

154
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
Please check the accounts, Fourth Young Madam.

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
In the first half of the year,

156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,120
the cost is 1,200 taels of silver altogether.

157
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,640
Over 1,000 taels? It's that much?

158
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,440
Mine is less.

159
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,880
The cost is only 700 taels.

160
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,409
Please pay my bill first, Fourth Young Madam.

161
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,800
I also need the money urgently.

162
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,460
Just pay both bills together.

163
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,640
The payment date is next month.

164
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
It's not easy to do our small business.

165
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,159
It's stressful if we don't receive the payment of goods soon.

166
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,520
We also can't afford to delay receiving the payment.

167
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,600
The Marquis's Mansion is such a wealthy and big household.

168
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,400
Can't you even settle this small payment of goods?

169
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,920
Since there is a document,

170
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,600
let's do it according to the contract.

171
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,860
Come again next month.

172
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,840
Well…

173
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,600
You refuse to pay the money like this.

174
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,320
Is there something behind it?

175
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,440
If the Marquis's Mansion doesn't value its reputation

176
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,720
and can't settle the payment of goods,

177
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,380
I will inform other merchants

178
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,760
not to supply goods to the Marquis's Mansion.

179
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,720
Only after you settle the payment of goods

180
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,360
will we continue to supply goods to the Marquis's Mansion.

181
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,520
Gentlemen,

182
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,240
now I'm in charge of the affairs of the Marquis's Mansion.

183
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,160
If you still want to work with the Marquis's Mansion

184
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
and earn money from the Marquis's Mansion,

185
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,280
you'd better not offend me.

186
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,560
Our Marquis's Mansion is a wealthy and big household

187
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,320
and has a close relationship with other officials' mansions.

188
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,920
If the news that you don't comply with the documents gets out,

189
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,560
which mansion will be willing to cooperate

190
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
with you two in the future?

191
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,520
Well...

192
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,610
In addition,

193
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,520
look.

194
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,560
The liquor workshop of our Marquis's Mansion

195
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,320
has just received so much grain.

196
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,440
We're surely capable of settling the payment of your goods, aren't we?

197
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,240
Don't worry.

198
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,520
When the payment time comes next month, you can come and ask for the money.

199
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,180
I'll settle all your payment.

200
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,920
In that case,

201
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,520
we'll come again next month.

202
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,800
Please forgive us, Fourth Young Madam.

203
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
Please forgive us.

204
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,600
Young Madam.

205
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,170
What if we still don't have money in the accounts next month?

206
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,240
Don't worry.

207
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,920
I'm sure there will be money next month.

208
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,120
Young Madam,

209
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,320
please taste these three kinds of wine.

210
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,800
Though they

211
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,000
taste good,

212
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,640
there's nothing special about them.

213
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,480
If other liquor workshops can make such wine,

214
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,539
then it's not okay.

215
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,720
Young Madam,

216
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,760
this is the best wine that is sold in the market.

217
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,770
What kind of wine do you want to make, Young Madam?

218
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,920
Ms. Zhang, let me ask you.

219
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,600
For the wine you make,

220
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,500
how much of it can make people get drunk usually?

221
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,630
It depends on the drinking capacity of the one who drinks it.

222
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,600
If this person gets drunk easily,

223
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,080
he'll be drunk after drinking two or three bowls of it.

224
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
If this person has a big drinking capacity,

225
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,000
he'll only get drunk after drinking two or three jars of it.

226
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,880
How big is the bowl?

227
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,920
How big is the jar?

228
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,400
It's probably as big as the biggest jar on the right.

229
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,800
And it's a bowl like that.

230
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,030
According to this amount,

231
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,830
it costs a lot of money to have a drink in your place.

232
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,880
I'm going to lead you to make

233
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,240
strong liquor.

234
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
Come with me.

235
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,120
Look at this.

236
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,080
Normally, what's your procedure of making wine?

237
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,760
Grain selection.

238
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,440
soaking,

239
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,080
steaming,

240
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,600
cooling,

241
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,320
adding wine yeast,

242
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,880
accumulation

243
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,940
and fermentation.

244
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,700
Add one more step from tomorrow onwards.

245
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,660
Distillation.

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,260
What is distillation?

247
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,560
Seal the fermented vinasse

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,040
and heat it up with slow fire.

249
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,360
Through this jar,

250
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,720
slowly collect the liquid that flows out after the vapor is condensed.

251
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,640
Then we'll get the strong liquor I want.

252
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
We'll just use this?

253
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,200
We'll just use this alchemy furnace?

254
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,320
Besides, will this strong liquor

255
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,080
be feasible?

256
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,960
Of course.

257
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,040
I just want to earn 80,000 taels

258
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,240
with this strong liquor.
