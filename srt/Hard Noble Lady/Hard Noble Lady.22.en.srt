1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,800
Bing.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,520
Bing.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,280
Young Madam.

5
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,850
Young Madam, I'm sorry.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,159
I know you're very sad.

7
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,720
But you shouldn't have committed suicide.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:36,920
Young Madam.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,440
Be careful.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,560
Young Madam.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,860
I heard that you argued with His Lordship

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,520
because of me today.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
You've just become a member of the Marquis's Mansion and haven't gained a foothold yet.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,880
I can't be your burden.

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,600
If I die,

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,280
you can do the things that you want to do

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,680
and will have no worries.

18
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,000
Why are you so stupid?

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,530
You're not even afraid of death. Why are you afraid of these things?

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,440
Bing, trust me.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,880
I will never sacrifice you

22
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,400
or let you...

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,130
Young Madam.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,760
My fate is just like this.

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,360
I don't want to bring you any trouble again.

26
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:20,240
Don't talk nonsense.

27
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,600
Promise me

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,400
to live well.

29
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,400
I won't let you marry that eunuch.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,160
Young Madam.

31
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,600
I'll cancel your servitude indenture.

32
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,039
In this way, His Lordship

33
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:42,170
won't be able to force you to marry him.

34
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,000
Okay.

35
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,200
Xizhao.

36
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,200
I don't think this is appropriate.

37
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,240
With His Majesty's favor,

38
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,280
Eunuch Gao has done many things to bully others.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,080
If he likes someone, he will try his best to get her.

40
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,740
Once Bing leaves here,

41
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,479
I'm afraid it'll be more dangerous for her.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,760
Fourth Young Master.

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,890
Fourth Young Madam.

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,120
Old Madam wants Fourth Young Madam to go to see her.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,380
There's something she wants to discuss.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,760
Mother.

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,079
Is Father really going to marry Bing to Eunuch Gao?

48
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,600
I've heard

49
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,070
that old eunuch is such a pervert.

50
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,280
He has married many concubines one after another.

51
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,410
Several maidens have even died because of his coercion.

52
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,480
When Xizhao comes later,

53
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,280
let's not

54
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,160
mention what happened to Bing.

55
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,400
She has been her maid since childhood.

56
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,130
Of couse she feels bad about it.

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Women's fate

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,840
is all the same.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
No matter what our family background is,

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,079
in the end,

61
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,320
we still can't control our own fate.

62
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,920
Mother.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,920
Eldest Sister-in-law.

64
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,250
Second Sister-in-law.

65
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,680
You're in a good mood.

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,500
Just now, we were worried that

67
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,450
you would be sad because of
what had happened to Bing.

68
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,520
You worry too much.

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,920
Come on.

70
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,690
Let's get down to business.

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,600
I asked you to come here

72
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,520
because the Empress invited me to go talk with her.

73
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
I can only take one person with me to go there.

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
I'm thinking

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,720
I should take Xizhao to meet her this time.

76
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,579
I'd like to ask for your opinions.

77
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,040
I've met the Empress before.

78
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,210
I won't go this time.

79
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,680
Recently,

80
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,040
there have been many affairs in the mansion.

81
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,560
I also don't have time to go.

82
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,200
Since both of them don't have time,

83
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,910
then I'll take you there.

84
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,220
You can also socialize in the palace.

85
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,000
Thank you, Mother.

86
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,320
Thank you, Eldest Sister-in-law.

87
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,250
Thank you, Second Sister-in-law.

88
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,800
Bing can be saved.

89
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:57,520
Oh, wait!

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,520
What are you carrying?

91
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,650
It's a betrothal gift from Eunuch Gao.

92
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,280
Bing!

93
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,990
Where is Bing?

94
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:13,520
Bing?

95
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,000
Didn't you ask Bing to go out?

96
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,760
Oh no.

97
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,290
Why did Fourth Young Madam ask me to come here?

98
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,210
I don't know.

99
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,850
Ms. Bing, please wait here.

100
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
How come it's you?

101
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,120
What do you want to do?

102
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,760
Miss Bing, you still remember me?

103
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,760
Without seeing you for just a day,

104
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,040
it feels as if three autumns had passed.

105
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,320
Why don't you let me do some exercises first?

106
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,040
Let go of me!

107
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,600
Let go of me now!

108
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,520
Let go of me!

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,600
Let go of you?

110
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,560
It was not easy for me to catch you finally.

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
I just don't want to let go of you.

112
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
Let go of me!

113
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,520
Help!

114
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,180
It's useless to call for help.

115
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,880
The more you shout, the more excited I get.

116
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,960
This fragrance of a virgin...

117
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,240
Are you okay, Bing?

118
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,120
Young Madam.

119
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,150
How dare you hit me?

120
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm His Majesty's favorite person.

121
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,600
Eunuch Gao.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,520
This is the Marquis's Mansion.

123
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,600
How dare you be so unscrupulous like this in the Marquis's Mansion?

124
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,720
You really have no respect for the Marquis's Mansion.

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,980
Vice Commissioner Lu.

126
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,160
Do you also want to offend me?

127
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,960
If His Majesty knows about this,

128
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,480
you should worry about yourself first.

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
I've given her the betrothal gifts.

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:29,640
This little beauty will be mine sooner or later.

131
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,200
Just wait and see.

132
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,760
I won't give up

133
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,840
until I bring this bastard down.

134
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,760
Old Madam, be careful.

135
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,159
You must be careful with your words and actions when you go to the palace this time.

136
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,420
Don't act recklessly.

137
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
It's not my first time going to the palace.

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,730
Don't worry.

139
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,000
Have a seat.

140
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,120
Marquise Lu.

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I haven't seen you for a long time.

142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,680
How is your health these days?

143
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,080
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

144
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,320
I'm quite

145
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,560
healthy.

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,080
We met again,

147
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,860
Lady of Vice Commissioner Lu.

148
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,960
Your Majesty.

149
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,120
Have you received the skin-nourishing red wine

150
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,480
I specially made for you?

151
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Yes, I have.

152
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,080
Your wine

153
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,680
tastes

154
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,560
mellow and sweet.

155
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,600
Drinking a cup of it before sleep

156
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,520
can help to calm the nerves indeed.

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,480
I can

158
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,160
sleep much better now.

159
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,040
If you like drinking it,

160
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,160
I'll continue to make it for you.

161
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,440
You people from Marquis of Changping's Mansion can always share His Majesty's burden.

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,080
When His Majesty encounters something important,

163
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,280
he trusts you the most.

164
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,560
Marquise Lu.

165
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,440
From now on, come to the palace more often.

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,480
Let's talk to each other more often.

167
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,539
In this way, we can also spend more time with each other.

168
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,000
Your Majesty.

169
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,130
I have something important to report.

170
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,760
There's no outsider here.

171
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,419
Tell me now.

172
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,039
Bad news, Your Majesty.

173
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,000
There's something wrong with the imperial robe you've ordered

174
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,920
for His Majesty's birthday banquet.

175
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,640
His Majesty was about to attend the birthday banquet.

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,880
As soon as he put on the imperial robe,

177
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
he discovered a hole on it.

178
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,840
His Majesty is very furious now.

179
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,480
What?

180
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,400
I checked it myself

181
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,160
before it was sent there.

182
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,720
There weren't any holes at all.

183
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,120
How come it got broken within such a short time?

184
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,380
When it was sent there,

185
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,280
it was accompanied by the people from the Imperial Household Department and the Fabric Bureau.

186
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,000
I also followed them all the way there.

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,400
No one touched the imperial robe on the way.

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,360
For an unknown reason,

189
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,020
something went wrong when His Majesty put it on.

190
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,960
Who served His Majesty to change into the imperial robe?

191
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,400
Noble Consort Jia did it.

192
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,130
It was her again.

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,120
She must have tampered with the robe.

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,960
What should we do now, Your Majesty?

195
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,800
His Majesty is going to see the ministers soon.

196
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
His Majesty can't wear

197
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,920
an old imperial robe at the birthday banquet.

198
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,400
The Fabric Bureau has replied that

199
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,160
now it's too late to mend the robe

200
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,640
or make a new imperial robe.

201
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,570
It's obvious that they've colluded with each other.

202
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,520
I have never been hostile to her.

203
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,600
But she kept making things difficult for me.

204
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,490
What on earth does she want me to do so that she can stop it?

205
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Fine.

206
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,480
At this point,

207
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,560
I can only apologize to His Majesty myself.

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,760
Marquise Lu.

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,120
I'm sorry to let you see this unpleasant scene.

210
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,640
I have something important to do here.

211
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,880
I won't keep you here.

212
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,970
Your Majesty, please stay.

213
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,440
Your Majesty.

214
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,840
Do you have the guts to trust me this time?

215
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,570
I can help you solve the crisis.

216
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,800
Xizhao.

217
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,920
What are you talking about?

218
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,780
What kind of crisis can you solve?

219
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,240
If Her Majesty goes there to apologize now,

220
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,170
that woman's plot will become successful, won't it?

221
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,100
I have a way to help Your Majesty solve this problem.

222
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Time is running out.

223
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,200
Please ask someone to get the imperial robe back at once.

224
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,760
I'll arrange the rest of it.

225
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,800
Xizhao.

226
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,040
Do you know that if you can't solve this problem,

227
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,080
you will be beheaded?

228
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,360
Everyone in the mansion has said that

229
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,960
Bing's embroidery skills

230
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,380
are qutie good.

231
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,440
But this is the imperial robe.

232
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,320
How could it be possible that she can embroider it?

233
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,720
Mother, don't worry.

234
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,560
Bing's mother is a top embroiderer.

235
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,400
Bing.

236
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,480
Why did you become my maid?

237
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,360
Young Madam, have you forgotten it?

238
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,320
My father

239
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,240
was originally an official in my hometown,

240
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,000
and my mother was a top-class embroiderer in the Fabric Bureau.

241
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,840
Originally,

242
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,000
the life of our family was happy and harmonious.

243
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,320
I had also been learning embroidery from my mother

244
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,450
and mastered good embroidery skills.

245
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,040
But later, my father was framed by a villain and put into prison.

246
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,240
My mother and I were also sold as slaves.

247
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,200
After my mother passed away,

248
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,560
I've been your maid to serve you.

249
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,680
Your background

250
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,600
is quite pitiful.

251
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,800
But I can't believe that you've mastered some embroidery skills.

252
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,000
I've been learning embroidery from my mother since I was kid.

253
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,930
I even helped my mother embroider the imperial robe.

254
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,360
It's done.

255
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,220
The embroidery is so good.

256
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,610
The techniques are exactly the same as the Fabric Bureau's.

257
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,160
You're really something

258
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,600
at such a young age.

259
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,780
Thanks for your compliments, Your Majesty.

260
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,960
Guards.

261
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
Send it to His Majesty now.

262
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,080
Don't let His Majesty's birthday banquet be delayed.

263
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,520
Yes.

264
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,080
Xizhao.

265
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
Bing.

266
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,730
I'm going to reward you.

267
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,000
You two solved the crisis for me today.

268
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,180
I'm going to give you a big reward.

269
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Your Majesty.

270
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,020
We don't want any rewards.

271
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,360
I only hope that Your Majesty

272
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,760
can save Bing's life.

273
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
Saving her life?

274
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,320
Yes, saving her life.

275
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,680
Because Eunuch Gao, the chief eunuch in the palace,

276
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,740
wants to hurt Bing.

277
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,440
I remember that when I saw you for the first time,

278
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,160
it was at my sister's wedding in Marquis of Changping's Mansion.

279
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,720
Yes.

280
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,880
Your Highness, I feel nervous that

281
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,140
you still remember me.

282
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,880
We are relatives after all.

283
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,160
You don't need to stand on ceremony since we're relatives.

284
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,960
Stand up.

285
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,340
Thank you, Your Highness.

286
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,560
Aren't you curious

287
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,960
why I asked you to come here?

288
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm stupid.

289
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,800
Please tell me the reason.

290
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,180
I've heard from my sister that

291
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,640
you usually work so hard for Marquis Lu,

292
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,940
but you've never had any complaints.

293
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,480
I admire you very much.

294
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,240
With your talent like that,

295
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,040
you shouldn't have wasted it

296
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,540
in an official's mansion.

297
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,000
It's all due to His Lordship's cultivation.

298
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,600
I've never dared to forget it.

299
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,400
Cultivation?

300
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,240
Mr. Lu,

301
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,810
your father is Marquis of Changping's younger brother.

302
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,320
You're supposed to have a share of the family property of this Marquis's Mansion.

303
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,200
Are you really willing to be inferior

304
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,530
to them like this for the rest of your life?

305
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,280
Your Highness, what do you mean?

306
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,680
My sister's reputation was ruined in the Marquis's Mansion.

307
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,840
What do you think I should do?

308
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,520
I don't know.

309
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,620
I only know that I dare not go against Your Highness.

310
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
If you need me to do something,

311
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,720
I'll try all my best to do it.

312
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,560
You are quite smart.

313
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
I was right about you.

314
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,820
Since you are so sensible,

315
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,130
just go back and wait for my orders.

316
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,660
Just wait to take over Marquis of Changping's Mansion.

317
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,200
Why don't you thank Her Highness for her kindness now?

318
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,560
Your Highness, thanks for your great kindness.
