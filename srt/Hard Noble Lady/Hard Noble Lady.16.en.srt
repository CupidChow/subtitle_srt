1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,320
Wait.

3
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,000
Xizhao.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,800
I also have a few questions for you.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,760
I've heard that the liquor workshop adopts

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,160
the way of presale now.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,080
It's to charge the customers of the money first

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,680
and then give the wine to them in half a month.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,240
Am I right?

10
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:39,960
Yes.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,600
In that case,

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,720
there is no wine in this liquor workshop, isn't there?

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,960
As there's no wine there,

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,720
and you're also in a hurry to get some money to balance the accounts,

15
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,440
that's why you've come up with the idea of presale.

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,040
Of course.

17
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,560
In this way, you can both stall for time and balance the accounts.

18
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,680
However,

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,040
since these high-ranking officials and dignitaries dared to give money in advance,

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,640
Xizhao,

21
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,520
have you ever thought about the reason?

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,320
This Tianchun Liquor Workshop is the property of the Marquis of Changping's Mansion.

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,560
To put it simply,

24
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,760
you've used the reputation of our Marquis's Mansion as a guarantee,

25
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,920
so they dared to give you money in advance.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,280
In half a month,

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,480
if you can't give the wine to them,

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,610
does it mean that you'll have to return the money to them?

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,360
But if you can't return the money,

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,560
will someone come to our mansion to make a scene?

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,560
By that time,

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm afraid people outside will say that

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,479
the members of our Marquis's Mansion

34
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,920
are all swindlers that cheat people out of their money, right?

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,440
In that case,

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,560
Xizhao,

37
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,640
don't you think what you did is "robbing Peter to pay Paul"?

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,160
What if your wine

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,360
can't be

40
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,120
produced in half a month?

41
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,759
Xizhao.

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,440
Is your second sister-in-law

43
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,039
telling the truth?

44
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,600
Then you've caused big trouble.

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,400
Though you've balanced the accounts now,

46
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,600
the reputation of our Marquis's Mansion

47
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,840
is more important.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,480
You can't cheat people.

49
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,240
You can't cheat people.

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,520
I...

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,280
Xizhao.

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,840
You'd better make the wine

53
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,180
and fulfill your promise first before being happy.

54
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,590
Come and have a look.

55
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,290
This is the rice from our Xinglong Grain Shop.

56
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,360
Manager.

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,920
How mang dans of sorghum do you have now?

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,450
Sorghum?

59
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,840
I still have 50 dans now.

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,840
I'll buy them all.

61
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,160
Manager.

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,840
How much does it cost to buy one dan of your sorghum?

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,720
Sir,

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
we've been short of grain recently.

65
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,480
The price has increased a lot.

66
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,600
It has increased to three taels of silver per dan.

67
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,320
If it costs three taels per dan,

68
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
I'll buy them all.

69
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,840
I'll pay four taels per dan.

70
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,360
Well...

71
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,400
Five taels.

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,280
Eight taels.

73
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,690
Sir, please come into my backyard to count the goods.

74
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,120
Please come in.

75
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,130
Young Madam, what should we do now?

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,600
I know she's rich.

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,520
I didn't expect her to be so rich.

78
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,050
She has bought all the sorghum in the capital.

79
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,600
Let’s go.

80
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,530
Fourth Young Madam.

81
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,680
How come the carriage is empty?

82
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,480
Where is the sorghum?

83
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,210
Young Madam.

84
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,480
There's no sorghum.

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,480
I couldn't buy it.

86
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,000
I went to several estates nearby.

87
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,860
All the sorghum has been sold out.

88
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,400
Xizhao.

89
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,960
You'd better make the wine

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,300
and fulfill your promise first before being happy.

91
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,840
It's her who's making trouble again.

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,570
Young Madam.

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,680
I'll go to some farther estates to take a look.

94
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,400
At worst, I'll go to the suburbs

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,680
to buy sorghum from the farmers' houses.

96
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,920
I can definitely buy some sorghum and bring it back for you.

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,650
I don't think I can buy sorghum.

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,400
Even if I manage to buy a little of it,

99
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
I won't be able to make enough wine to deliver the goods in half a month.

100
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,760
Just let me give it a try.

101
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,410
Let's go.

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,480
Be careful on the way.

103
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,710
Li Jing,

104
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,329
you forced me to do this.

105
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,760
Let's have a showdown this time.

106
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,320
My Lady.

107
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,800
All the sorghum that Fourth Young Madam wanted to buy

108
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,930
was bought by us before she could do so.

109
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,450
How is everything going

110
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,920
with Liu Xizhao and her people?

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,190
It's just the same as you thought.

112
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,000
She has no money to compete with us.

113
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,880
As long as we raised the price just a little bit,

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,079
she couldn't afford it.

115
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,320
They also didn't get any sorghum today.

116
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,839
No.

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,840
She won't just give up so easily.

118
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,020
She will definitely raise money.

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
The good show

120
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,840
is still coming.

121
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,730
Here you are.

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,530
What's the amount of the money?

123
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,600
20,000 taels.

124
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,400
20,000 taels?

125
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,340
My Lord,

126
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,120
you are really a tall, rich and handsome man.

127
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,080
Cherish the money.

128
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,610
This is all the money I have.

129
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,409
Don't worry.

130
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
In terms of doing business,

131
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,080
I've never lost.

132
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,120
I'll return all the money to you with interest.

133
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,600
Even though you have the money,

134
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,440
you may not be able to defeat my second sister-in-law.

135
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,280
Her Li's Mansion is an imperial firm.

136
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,480
She's not only rich

137
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,400
but also has many channels to find itinerant traders.

138
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,200
I won't have a price war with her.

139
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
You've quite underestimated me.

140
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,140
I can understand this easy thing.

141
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,080
I know what to do.

142
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,760
Just chase me, Yuanxu.

143
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,600
Just chase me.

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Be good, Yuanxu.

145
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,760
Now I have

146
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
something important to deal with.

147
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,360
I'll come back to play with you later.

148
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,920
Okay?

149
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:27,920
Okay.

150
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,480
Go.

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,900
Come on, Little Young Master.

152
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,720
My Lady.

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,180
It's just as you expected.

154
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,520
Fourth Young Madam suddenly got some money today.

155
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,780
She also started to pay a high price to compete with us for buying the sorghum.

156
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Did she buy a lot?

157
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,800
Not much.

158
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,280
She was only able to buy it from some small retailers and farmers.

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,720
The quantity was no more than 100 dans in total.

160
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,050
Go on raising the price.

161
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,440
Let her know that

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,880
if she dares to compete with our Li's Mansion in terms of money,

163
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,200
she's not qualified to do so.

164
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,920
But My Lady,

165
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,280
we've spent a lot of money

166
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,960
buying sorghum now.

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,290
Is that really okay?

168
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,460
It doesn't matter.

169
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,240
For the money I spent today,

170
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
in the future,

171
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,860
she'll have to return it to me doubly.

172
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,080
Just go.

173
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:22,960
Yes.

174
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,320
100 catties of wheat.

175
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,760
300 catties of charcoal.

176
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,400
We bought

177
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,130
all the sorghum at a high price.

178
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,780
Be careful not to spill it.

179
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,400
Okay.

180
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Qin!

181
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
Young Madam.

182
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
Go find those farmers who have

183
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,760
ever sold sorghum to Second Young Madam as soon as possible

184
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,480
and ask them

185
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,080
whether any of them have some extra sorghum.

186
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,040
We can buy it at the price of one more tael per catty,

187
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
and we'll pay a deposit in advance.

188
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,980
Okay, Young Madam.

189
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,740
Just go now.

190
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,740
Young Madam, you're so smart.

191
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,000
They won't be able to anticipate that

192
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,880
we'll ask the farmers who have sold sorghum to them.

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,880
I call this way of buying grain "picking up residues".

194
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,400
I'm sure the farmers know

195
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,200
which of them has some extra sorghum.

196
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Second Young Madam.

197
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,000
Fourth Young Madam changed her strategy again today.

198
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,400
They secretly went to see the farmers who had ever sold sorghum to us

199
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
and increased the price by one tael of silver.

200
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,080
Then they got some residual sorghum from these farmers' relatives or neighbors.

201
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,800
What?

202
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,280
The servant over there also said that

203
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Liu Xizhao called this strategy "picking up residues".

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,040
Liu Xizhao is really something.

205
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,840
She has quite many cunning tricks.

206
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,409
Then let's set the price two taels higher than hers per catty

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,760
and buy it all for me before she can do so.

208
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,760
I'll see what else she can do.

209
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,500
My Lady,

210
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,080
all our five granaries are full now.

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,159
We don't have any space for the newly bought sorghum.

212
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,600
Then just rent some empty houses

213
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,780
and turn them all into granaries.

214
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,570
Second Young Madam.

215
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,760
Dinner is ready.

216
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,010
Just eat something.

217
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,920
It's raining so heavily.

218
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,920
I feel

219
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,049
a little flustered.

220
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,640
Don't worry, My Lady.

221
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,000
There's still a long time before the rainy season comes.

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,720
It'll rain for one night at most.

223
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,179
It will be sunny tomorrow.

224
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,840
Tell the servants

225
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
to keep a close eye on the warehouse.

226
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
Don't let the raindrops leak into the warehouse.

227
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
I've already told them to do so.

228
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
My Lady, please eat first.

229
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,880
Second Young Madam, please be careful.

230
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,920
It's obviously not the rainy season now.

231
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,050
Why hasn't it stopped yet after it has rained for a night?

232
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,680
Second Young Madam.

233
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,080
Your eldest brother asked me to inform you.

234
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,640
He said that the rainy season came early this year

235
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,560
and told you to sell the grain you have as soon as possible.

236
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Otherwise, all the grain will rot in the warehouse,

237
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,640
and you'll lose hundreds of thousands of taels of silver.

238
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,520
Second Young Madam,

239
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,800
what should we do now?

240
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,240
I fell into Liu Xizhao's trap.
