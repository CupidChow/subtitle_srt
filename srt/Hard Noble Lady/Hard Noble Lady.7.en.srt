1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,830
As an outsider,

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,040
how can I decide for you?

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:16,920
You...

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,260
It's not necessarily slander, is it?

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:27,780
My Lord.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,760
Miss Lin asked me to get some strong acid

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,620
to disguise as an exorcism potion

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,500
Eldest Sister is simple-minded.

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,600
There must be a master behind such a deliberate plan.

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,320
The nude picture that was used to frame me

12
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,760
was also you,

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,560
Lin Chuchu, right?

14
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,480
That's right.

15
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:46,850
I did it so that she could marry into the Marquis's Mansion.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,480
I fell into her trap

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,320
and kept making mistakes.

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,840
Lin Chuchu,

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,890
if you still don't confess,

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,280
it won't be as simple as you being handed over to the officials.

21
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,880
Chuchu,

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,840
if you were handed over to the officials before getting married,

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,240
and if word gets out,

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:07,040
no sensible man would marry you.

25
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,520
Confess now!

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,800
Okay.

27
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:12,570
I'll go to the Lin's Mansion

28
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,120
and tell your father everything that happened.

29
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,720
Our two families' ties

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
will be cut off from here.

31
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,280
Guards!

32
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,450
Hand her over to the officials.

33
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Liu Xizhao.

34
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,960
You're disfigured anyway.

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,200
From now on,

36
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,660
Shaoyang will no longer like you.

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,479
Your face...

38
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,720
You didn't expect it, did you?

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,000
My face is fine.

40
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,759
I underestimated you.

41
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,039
You pretended to be disfigured

42
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,000
to draw people's attention to Cuiwei Pavilion

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
to bring down my cousin.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,130
Eldest Sister is innocent.

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,680
The culprit is you.

46
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,580
The one I want to bring down

47
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,520
is also you.

48
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,039
Did he steal things from the mansion?

49
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,840
Mind our own business.

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,760
Let's go.

51
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,400
Stop!

52
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,120
How dare you run after stealing from the master?

53
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,720
Come here!

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,360
Bro.

55
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,120
Bro, keep it a secret for me.

56
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,040
How about we three

57
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,600
split the money by then?

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,040
No way.

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,240
If the masters find out, I'll be flogged.

60
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
I'd better tell His Lordship.

61
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,000
No, no, no.

62
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,490
I'll tell you the truth.

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,160
After this is done,

64
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,040
there will be more gold rewards.

65
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,520
As long as you keep it a secret for me,

66
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,240
I'll give you half of the gold.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,000
Who are you doing this for?

68
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
You can get so many rewards.

69
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,640
Miss Lin wants me to ruin Fourth Young Madam's face.

70
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,500
Who are you to compete with me?

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:19,980
Liu Xizhao,

72
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,740
with such a lowly background,

73
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,880
do you think you're worthy of marrying into the Marquis's Mansion?

74
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,760
I will never let you off.

75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,560
Father!

76
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,920
Father.

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,040
I know I was wrong.

78
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,800
Please forgive me.

79
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,510
Did you only take the money from the Cuiwei Pavilion incident?

80
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,320
What else?

81
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,450
Tell me everything.

82
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,079
Shaozhen.

83
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,440
Yes.

84
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,240
Check all the accounts in these years.

85
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to see

86
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
how she's managed this family.

87
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,400
Yes.

88
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:49,920
You…

89
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,400
Just kneel here.

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,680
We'll talk about it when everything is made clear.

91
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,640
And you.

92
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,400
You pretended to be disfigured

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,240
and made the mansion a mess.

94
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,960
If I don't punish you,

95
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,280
you won't learn your lesson.

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:07,920
Guards!

97
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,920
Take Fourth Young Madam out!

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,440
Wait.

99
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
She didn't do anything wrong.

100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,240
Father, why do you punish her?

101
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,680
If it weren't for her,

102
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,959
all the people in the Marquis's Mansion

103
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,839
wouldn't be in panic today.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Do you mean that even if she's bullied,

105
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,660
she should just endure it?

106
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,360
If she was really disfigured,

107
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,160
what would the outsiders think?

108
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,200
I think

109
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,340
you should thank her instead.

110
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,970
How come he's speaking like a normal person all of a sudden?

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,870
Fine.

112
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,440
There's a reason for this.

113
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,400
I'll spare you this time.

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,760
If it happens again,

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,720
I'll punish you according to our family rules.

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,790
Let's go.

117
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,120
Master.

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,760
Uncle.

119
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,240
The money in the accounting room and the warehouse have all been counted.

120
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,920
For the past few years when the Eldest Young Madam has been managing the household,

121
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,040
she has used the money from the Marquis's Mansion

122
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:43,970
to buy some shops

123
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,360
and fields.

124
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,240
Now,

125
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,080
the failed investment in the shops and the loss due to the embezzlement,

126
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,120
in total,

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,060
are over 80,000 taels.

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,120
Look what you did!

129
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,159
Father.

130
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,800
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,600
Shaolin,

132
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,000
plead with Father on my behalf.

133
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:03,920
Father,

134
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,080
please let Xin go this time.

135
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,040
From now on,

136
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,460
I will discipline her.

137
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,360
Is this the good wife you've disciplined?

138
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,420
She fed her own nest

139
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,000
and caused a mess in our mansion.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,240
She's lost 80,000 taels.

141
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,680
If we didn't find it in time,

142
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,160
the mansion would have been destroyed by her!

143
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,760
Father!

144
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,680
She made mistakes in her duties as a housekeeper.

145
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
I'm willing to take the punishment for her.

146
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
Please give her another chance to turn over a new leaf.

147
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,960
Father, Mother,

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,000
I have borne children for the Marquis's Mansion

149
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,530
and managed the household.

150
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,640
I've at least worked hard, even without merits.

151
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,520
I'm not good at running shops.

152
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
I was deceived by them

153
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,830
and lost a lot of money.

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,960
I dare not tell you.

155
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,960
I fixed one problem by creating a bigger one.

156
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,840
And the deficit kept getting bigger.

157
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,000
Later, there was no extra money

158
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
to repair the villa.

159
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,640
That's why I listened to Lin Chuchu's malicious advice

160
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,360
and used inferior wood to pose as the expensive Zhennan wood.

161
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,560
I know I was wrong.

162
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,000
I dare not do it again!

163
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,240
Father.

164
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,440
Please forgive me.

165
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,760
Please forgive me this time.

166
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,680
My Lord,

167
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,200
please think twice.

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,280
She

169
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
is wrong,

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,880
but if this gets out,

171
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,620
our reputation will be...

172
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Father,

173
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,320
give Xin another chance.

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,040
Bastard!

175
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,040
You'll have to kneel in the ancestral shrine for three days

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,900
and be grounded for three months.

177
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,140
Teach her a lesson!

178
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,720
Thank you, Father.

179
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,440
Thank you, Father.

180
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,500
Thank you, Father.

181
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,400
And you.

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,520
If you didn't indulge

183
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,080
and protect her all the time,

184
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,760
would this have happened?

185
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
You should reflect on yourself

186
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,600
and make up for the deficit.

187
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,400
Bing,

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,040
bring some good wine and dishes.

189
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,560
Let's celebrate today.

190
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,320
Okay.

191
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,600
Why are you here?

192
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,320
Bing.

193
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,560
Why is he here?

194
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,720
Didn't you always complain that Young Master didn't come here?

195
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,640
I think you've been thinking too much lately.

196
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,240
I want to give you a surprise.

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,040
Seize the chance.

198
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,760
Come on!

199
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,280
No…

200
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,360
I didn't know you were so capable.

201
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,780
Kill two birds with one stone.

202
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,240
You punished Eldest Sister

203
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,370
and exposed Lin Chuchu's true colors.

204
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,400
I just don't want to be bullied all the time.

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,720
I used to think you were a coward

206
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,320
and wouldn't cause any trouble.

207
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,280
But now,

208
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,929
it turns out I've underestimated you.

209
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,460
There's nothing I can't do

210
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,039
as long as I want to do it.

211
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,960
I feel like you've changed somehow.

212
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
But I don't know

213
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,340
what exactly it is.

214
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,650
It's like I've met someone new.

215
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,280
Anyway,

216
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
you helped me twice.

217
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,840
I'll remember all of that.

218
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,570
Don't worry.

219
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,320
It's late. You can go back.

220
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

221
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,520
No way.

222
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,690
He actually wants to sleep with me?

223
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,240
Lu Shaoyang,

224
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,960
I don't think of you that way.

225
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,980
You were not like that before.

226
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,920
It was before.

227
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,120
Now, it is different.

228
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,610
Today, I'll set the rules with you.

229
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,880
I won't cause you any trouble from now on.

230
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,440
And you can't have improper thoughts about me.

231
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,200
Understand?

232
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,050
That's exactly what I want.

233
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,720
This place is getting more and more dangerous.

234
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,320
I have to find a way to go back.

235
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,400
Your eldest sister

236
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,920
really let me down.

237
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,680
Now, the mansion has 80,000 taels of deficit.

238
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,160
Do you have any idea how to fix that?

239
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,840
She only thinks of us now that something bad has happened.

240
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,440
At this point, anyone who steps forward

241
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,920
will be the one to suffer.

242
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,160
The deficit of over 80,000 taels…

243
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,800
It shows how biased Old Madam used to be.

244
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,200
Jing,

245
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,920
I know you're good at managing.

246
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,640
Do you have any good ideas?

247
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,920
Mother,

248
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,640
you think so highly of me.

249
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,640
I'm really flattered.

250
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,360
But it's not a small amount after all.

251
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,320
I can't

252
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,120
think of anything at the moment.

253
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

254
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,520
Sit.

255
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:53,880
Mother.

256
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,930
I don't know anything about it.

257
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,720
Hey?

258
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Why do you skip me?

259
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,870
If any of you

260
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,960
can solve this urgent matter in our mansion,

261
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,040
I'll give her the household management power.

262
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,760
Does that mean

263
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,380
you will also give that person the bracelet?

264
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,280
Yes.

265
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,230
Whoever runs the household

266
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,960
can have this bracelet.
