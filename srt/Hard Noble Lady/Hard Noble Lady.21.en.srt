1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,240
Don't you think there's something fishy about this matter?

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,920
She admitted her relationship with Huang Xin quite soon.

4
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,840
But when she saw that Huang Xin was badly injured from being beaten in jail,

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,640
she didn't care about him at all.

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,890
Anyway, I think it's very strange.

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,870
What's more, their testimony is extremely similar.

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,330
It's as if they had discussed it beforehand.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,800
Behind this,

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,760
is there anything else that we don't know?

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,720
Third Brother and Third Sister-in-law love each other so much.

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,780
There was no reason for Third Sister-in-law to do that.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,520
How about

14
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,160
letting me talk to Huang Xin?

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,780
Maybe I can find out about something after I ask him.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,239
You want to see Huang Xin

17
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,720
in order to ask him about the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun, right?

18
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,380
What on earth do you want to do?

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,250
I can't tell you the reason.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,340
But anyway, this matter is very important to me.

21
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,480
Huang Xin has been transferred to the Supreme Court.

22
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,539
No one can visit him

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,680
before the trial of the case.

24
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:26,200
However,

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,480
I can help you find a way.

26
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,460
But you have to figure out how to repay me.

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,560
Really?

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,590
My Lord, wait for me.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,680
My master, Huang Xin, has been in charge of the divination.

30
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,440
He always said that I was stupid,

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,200
so I could only assist him by his side.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,680
I'm sorry but I'm not able to do this.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,600
Junior Director Zheng,

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,710
this matter is very important to me.

35
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,880
Please help me.

36
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,320
If you want some rewards, just tell me.

37
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,380
I can say yes to you.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,680
Well...

39
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,120
I often hear people say that

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,120
you work very hard.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,340
I think you're also very eager to gain recognition.

42
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,680
Vice Director Huang has been put into the imperial prison.

43
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,139
He asked me to tell you that

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,520
he was usually very strict with you

45
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,600
so that you could make progress.

46
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
You're a very gifted man.

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,880
It's time to take your responsibility.

48
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,320
Did my master really say that?

49
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,040
Yes.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,840
He told us that

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,760
we could put forward any request to you as we wanted,

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,240
and you could also achieve what he was able to do.

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,500
Then I'll give it a try.

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
Oh, by the way,

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,600
I need to prepare something before the divination.

56
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,760
Please give me some time.

57
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,880
I'll try my best to make the estimated time accurate.

58
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,230
Thank you, Junior Director Zheng.

59
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,680
Okay.

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,960
Liu Xizhao seems to suffer from astigmatism.

61
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,290
It's not in focus at all.

62
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Have you found it?

63
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,240
Not yet.

64
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,680
According to the Records of the Grand Historian,

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,840
the ladle always carries the Dragon Horn Star with it,

66
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,400
the spoon handle is related to the Sagittarius,

67
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
and the head of the spoon always points at the head of the Alnitak.

68
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,000
Then you can find the Big Dipper.

69
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,840
So we need to find the location of the ladle's head first.

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,300
Only after that can we locate them one by one.

71
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,280
What are you talking about?

72
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,360
I found it! I found it!

73
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,240
Come on.

74
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,050
Give me five.

75
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,480
Raise your hand.

76
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,240
Okay.

77
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,170
I didn't expect you to know a lot about constellations.

78
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,519
Actually, I want to say something that's more appropriate for this situation.

79
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,399
What is it?

80
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,320
I wish that I could be a star and you could be the moon

81
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,000
so that we could shine together every night.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,550
I don't quite understand what you mean.

83
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
I mean,

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,159
I hope that from today onwards...

85
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:58,960
I've figured out the time!

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,920
I finally figured out the time!

87
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,800
I've figured out the time!

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,440
I've figured out the time.

89
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,760
You've figured out the time?

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,360
When is it?

91
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:03,880
Look.

92
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,140
Well...

93
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,440
When is this?

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,120
At 2 p.m. on June 15th.

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,080
There are still 20 days before that.

96
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,810
Twenty days?

97
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
There are still 20 days before that.

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,760
Bing!

99
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,360
I know the time of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun.

100
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,960
Really?

101
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,480
That's great.

102
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,400
When is it?

103
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,240
In 20 days.

104
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,880
I can go back in 20 days.

105
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,500
You can go back?

106
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,420
Where are you going, Young Madam?

107
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,440
Nowhere.

108
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,460
Why are you crying?

109
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,520
Nothing.

110
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:05,610
Something went into my eyes just now.

111
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,840
Did someone bully you?

112
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,320
Young Madam.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,120
Who dares to bully me now?

114
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,400
Look.

115
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,080
A few days ago, didn't you say that your cuffs were broken?

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,480
I've mended them for you.

117
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
As for your favorite Thousand-silk Fur Coat,

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,730
I'll also make one as soon as possible.

119
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,280
It's a winter coat.

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,160
Why do you want to make it now?

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,080
Tell me the truth.

122
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,050
What are you hiding from me?

123
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,960
I've heard that

124
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,530
your embroidery skills

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,920
are as good as the female embroiders' in the palace.

126
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,920
But if you embroider the clothes for me when you're unhappy,

127
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I would rather not wear the clothes.

128
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,800
I'm really not unhappy.

129
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,240
I just want to take good care of you

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,670
and finish all the things that I should do

131
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,360
before I leave the Marquis's Mansion.

132
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,420
You'll leave here?

133
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
Where will you go?

134
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,690
Young Madam.

135
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,840
I'm going to get married.

136
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,080
I can't serve you anymore.

137
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,800
You're going to get married?

138
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,300
His Lordship has arranged a marriage for me.

139
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,880
Getting married

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,880
might be a good thing.

141
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
Whom will he marry you to?

142
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,920
His Lordship is considerate towards the servants.

143
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,800
As a servant, I should be grateful.

144
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,400
It doesn't matter whom I'll marry.

145
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,560
But I'll live a good life

146
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,000
according to

147
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,680
what you've told me.

148
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,520
Liang!

149
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,690
Young Madam.

150
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,280
Tell me.

151
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Whom will His Lordship marry her to?

152
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,159
Tell me!

153
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,200
He's a eunuch in the palace.

154
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Eunuch Gao.

155
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,159
My Lord.

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,140
There's a verbal instruction from His Majesty.

157
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,400
The war at the border is in a tense situation now.

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,800
It's necessary to ask a trustworthy man to transport the provisions and funds.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,860
His Majesty ordered you to select some elite soldiers to do this task.

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,200
It's the duty of our Marquis's Mansion

161
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,120
to work for His Majesty.

162
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,840
When the imperial edict is issued in a few days,

163
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,840
I'll come here again to announce it.

164
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Oh, by the way,

165
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,360
you must have heard about it, too.

166
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,520
His Majesty wants to select some new candidates among the descendants

167
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,240
of noble families and appoint them to important positions.

168
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,559
This is a good opportunity for the young masters of the Marquis's Mansion.

169
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,799
Whether my incompetent sons

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,799
can be selected by His Majesty for important positions

171
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,840
will depend on their own fate.

172
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,160
Human effort

173
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,840
is the decisive factor of everything.

174
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,040
Eunuch Gao.

175
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,860
You're His Majesty's favourite person.

176
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,780
Please put in a good word for my sons in front of His Majesty more often.

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh.

178
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,040
This girl

179
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,480
is so pretty.

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,560
Eunuch Gao.

181
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,560
Eunuch Gao!

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
You...

183
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,720
Fourth Young Madam.

184
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,200
Eunuch Gao is here to announce the imperial edict.

185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,160
His Lordship wants Bing to go there.

186
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,560
He came at the right time.

187
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,600
Young Madam!

188
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,640
According to Heaven's will,

189
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,160
His Majesty hereby declares that

190
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Marquis Lu is dedicated to his job

191
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,720
and shares the burden by making great contributions,

192
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,840
so Marquis Lu is ordered to transport military provisions and funds

193
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,560
to the fortifications at the border.

194
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,820
No mistake is allowed.

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
Respect this.

196
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll accept the imperial edict.

197
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,410
Congratulations, My Lord.

198
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,360
Thank you, Eunuch Gao.

199
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,320
Eunuch Gao.

200
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
May I have a word with you?

201
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,260
Eunuch Gao.

202
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
I'm going to give Bing to you.

203
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,800
She can help you massage your legs and stretch your shoulders when you're free.

204
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,480
That's great.

205
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,050
You're so considerate towards me.

206
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,160
Thank you for letting her marry me.

207
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,240
Then I'll go back to get ready to be a groom.

208
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,440
Okay.

209
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,200
As for my sons,

210
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,960
please remember to put in a good word for them.

211
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,880
The Marquis's Mansion's business is my business.

212
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,040
Don't worry.

213
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,920
My Lord!

214
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
Bing is my maid.

215
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,880
If you want to marry her to someone,

216
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,760
you should ask for my permission first, right?

217
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,600
She's not a kitten or a puppy. She's a human.

218
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,560
On what grounds can you give her to whoever you want?

219
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,760
It's none of your business.

220
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
You may leave now.

221
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,360
Bing doesn't want to marry this old eunuch.

222
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,520
You...

223
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,720
No one can force her.

224
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,480
Just give up.

225
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,640
How dare you!

226
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,880
Drive her out now!

227
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,740
Just forget it!

228
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
My Lord.

229
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,440
The maids and women are so arrogant and wilful here.

230
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,700
Now I've seen the family customs of the Marquis's Mansion.

231
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,880
Goodbye!

232
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,170
Eunuch Gao! Eunuch Gao!

233
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,780
Take care, Eunuch Gao.

234
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,920
You...

235
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,320
You...

236
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,370
No one can change

237
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,730
the decision I've made.

238
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,430
It's hard to change what my father has decided.

239
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:42,360
That's not okay.

240
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
Marriage is such a big matter.

241
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
Bing's opinion is very important.

242
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,920
Besides, he's a eunuch.

243
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,580
She doesn't like him, either.

244
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,080
I didn't like you at first,

245
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,030
but my father still forced me to marry you, didn't he?

246
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,800
Lu Shaoyang.

247
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,130
It's not the same, is it?

248
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,580
That's not what I mean.

249
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,280
I don't regret marrying you.

250
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,120
You are brave and you pursue fairness.

251
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,250
You don't care about wealth and ranks.

252
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,080
I think you are a woman who can show her true-self the best.

253
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,160
Help!

254
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Help!

255
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,960
Bing hung herself!
