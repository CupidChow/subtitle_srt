1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,720
Did you pack all these things

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,820
to make a run for it?

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,480
The Old Madam only gave me one day.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,640
But I have no clue at all right now.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,000
If I don’t run away, should I just wait to die?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,530
I believe you are innocent.

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,439
But if you just run away,

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,640
have you ever thought

10
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,720
how others would think of me?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,730
Young Madam.

12
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,980
Young Master Shaoyang may have a way.

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,680
Why do you trust me?

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,360
I am the Commander of the Imperial City Division.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,420
There are too many flaws in this case.

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,960
Well.

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,400
But the main problem is that we don’t have any clues yet.

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,240
We don’t even know where to start.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,920
Naturally, we should start with the other person involved.

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,760
You're right.

21
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,670
Let's go.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:15,690
Bing.

23
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:16,880
Could it be that I really did

24
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,920
have something going on with that Lu Shaozhen?

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,520
Young Madam, what are you talking about?

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,039
How could you say that?

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,350
Then why did he know about the birthmark on my chest?

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,160
I don't know either.

29
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,640
Young Madam.

30
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,039
Are you suspecting me?

31
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,640
What are you doing?

32
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,320
Get up.

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,800
Why would I suspect you?

34
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,360
Also,

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,680
don't kneel down to others all the time.

36
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Okay.

37
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,120
Hurry up.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,479
Coming. Let's go.

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,080
That beating I took was so unfair.

40
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,690
I didn’t paint that nude portrait.

41
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,070
and I’ve never even spoken to Fourth Sister-in-law.

42
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,000
How could I have an affair with her?

43
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,100
Fourth Brother, Fourth Sister-in-law.

44
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,360
Why are you here?

45
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,440
It’s not the right

46
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,840
time to meet.

47
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,000
Young Master Shaozhen.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,530
I know you're also a victim.

49
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,680
What’s the deal with that painting?

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,480
I swear

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,120
I didn’t paint it.

56
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,960
Sir,

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,760
how much is this painting?

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,480
Young Master, this painting costs five taels.

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,440
So cheap?

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Is it not an original?

61
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
I don't know if it's real or not.

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,240
Buy it if you think it's worth it.

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
Wrap it up.

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,480
Okay.

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,320
Here you go.

66
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Young Master Shaozhen.

67
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,690
You look so happy today.

68
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,240
What good painting did you find?

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,720
I saw this "Distant Mountains" painting by Wen Keming on East Street,

70
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,480
but it was selling for a very low price.

71
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,080
I don't know if it's a fake.

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,840
So please help me see if this is an original.

73
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,160
Greetings, Young Master Shaozhen.

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,840
I’m here to collect the monthly allowance from Young Madam Shaolin’s courtyard.

75
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
Please sign here.

76
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,480
Here.

77
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,360
Here's your money.

78
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,280
Young Master Shaozhen.

79
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,720
What famous painting do you have there?

80
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,320
Open it and let me have a look.

81
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,500
"Distant Mountains".

82
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,640
Oh my.

83
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,640
Isn’t that Young Madam Shaoyang?

84
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,030
This...

85
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,960
Oh my goodness.

86
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:32,680
What's going on?

87
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,240
This...

88
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,570
So you got Wen Keming's "Distant Mountains"?

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,160
Yes.

90
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,320
I’m sure I didn’t mistake it.

91
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,960
It was obviously a "Distant Mountains" painting.

92
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,760
How did it...

93
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,150
This painting

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,340
must have been tampered with.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Mrs. Liu.

96
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,120
Mrs. Liu.

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,120
Don’t think that just because you did a small favor,

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,780
you can come to me every day asking for handouts.

99
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,320
Mrs. Liu, don't worry.

100
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,280
This money is enough for me to spend for a while.

101
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,880
Enough.

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,520
Just go.

103
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,320
What do you think?

104
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,980
It seems Hong is also working for Yan Xin.

105
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,480
But why are they picking on me?

106
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,840
We've found a starting point.

107
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,560
We’re bound to get witnesses and confessions.

108
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,820
All we’re missing is physical evidence.

109
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,290
That painting?

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,240
Yes.

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
That painting must hold some hidden clues.

112
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,200
Now all this

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,400
is not enough to prove that they’re behind it.

114
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,440
Young Madam Shaolin took her cousin Lin Chuchu

115
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,510
to the Marquis's Mansion every day.

116
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,680
They are eager for you to leave

117
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
so that Lin Chuchu can marry Young Master Shaoyang.

118
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
Who else could it be but them?

119
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,760
My Lord.

120
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,240
Why don’t you go and steal the painting?

121
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Why should I steal it?

122
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
You’re still too inexperienced

123
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,300
to compete with me.

124
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,200
Let's see how you can prove your innocence.

125
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,680
Mrs. Liu.

126
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,570
Young Madam Xin is looking for you.

127
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,120
Tell Her Ladyship I'm coming.

128
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,360
Young Madam.

129
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,240
According to your order,

130
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,960
I've burned

131
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
the painting to ashes.

132
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,240
Once the time’s up tomorrow,

133
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,640
she will be drowned.

134
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,120
Can she

135
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,770
be drowned that easily?

136
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,720
Mother is so angry.

137
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,560
It would be surprising if she wasn’t killed.

138
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,840
After she dies,

139
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,490
I’ll talk to Mother about your situation.

140
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,600
You can then enter the household

141
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,740
and help me manage all these matters.

142
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,610
Cousin, have you encountered any difficulties?

143
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,080
It's about the Cuiwei Pavilion that we built

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,280
for the Third Young Master’s marriage.

145
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,840
That woman is flaunting her status because her sister is a royal concubine,

146
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,170
insisting that even the wood for the pavilion must be the finest Zhennan wood.

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,000
Cousin,

148
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,920
did you follow my suggestion?

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,400
Of course.

150
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,000
We managed

151
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,960
to build it at the time,

152
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,560
but recently the Cuiwei Pavilion needs repairs.

153
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,000
I’m afraid our use of inferior wood

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,130
for the pavilion might be discovered.

155
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,850
Young Madam.

156
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,040
Here's the food.

157
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,260
Put it on the table.

158
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,710
Bing.

159
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,300
Quickly pack everything.

160
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,880
As soon as we finish eating, we’re leaving the Marquis's Mansion.

161
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,200
The people here are too evil.

162
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,520
I can't stay here any longer.

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,360
Wherever you go, Young Madam

164
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,240
I'll go.

165
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,640
Are things packed up?

166
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,360
Anyway, by the time something goes missing,

167
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,000
you'll have already left the Marquis's Mansion,

168
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,060
so no one will bother investigating.

169
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,840
You’ve got some nerve.

170
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,680
How dare you steal from your master's house?

171
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,360
Young Madam.

172
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm innocent.

173
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,640
I was just keeping it safe for you,

174
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,550
afraid you might lose it.

175
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,920
Yes.

176
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,230
I was just keeping it safe for you.

177
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,800
Bing.

178
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,440
Yes.

179
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,760
Go to the Imperial City Division and call the Young Master Shaoyang.

180
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,480
Have him bring Hong for a proper interrogation.

181
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,000
Yes.

182
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,090
Young Madam.

183
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,440
Young Madam, please don’t send me to the Imperial City Division.

184
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
I know I was wrong.

185
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,540
I won't do it again.

186
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,200
Young Madam.

187
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,660
Please spare me this time.

188
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,520
Spare you?

189
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,440
Have you forgotten

190
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,880
what I said before?

191
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,360
I won't do it again.

192
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll do whatever

193
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,960
you ask me to do.

194
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,640
Please give me another chance.

195
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,440
Why are you asking for money again?

196
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,440
My brother is sick.

197
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,520
So of course, I need money.

198
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,360
Besides,

199
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,480
I did so many things for Young Madam Shaolin.

200
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,200
What’s wrong with asking for some money?

201
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,710
Keep your mouth shut.

202
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,720
Say less.

203
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
Watch your tongue.

204
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,880
Why is there so little?

205
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
Did you pocket some for yourself?

206
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I want to talk to Young Madam Shaolin.

207
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,440
Stop!

208
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,280
Come back!

209
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,160
Who gave you the nerve

210
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,600
to be so arrogant?

211
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,440
I know a lot about your dirty business.

212
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,510
If you don’t give me the money

213
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,880
I’ll shout it out loud.

214
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,160
Looks like you won't keep your mouth shut.

215
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,290
I'll make you shut your mouth forever!

216
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,120
Stop!

217
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,240
My Lord. My lady.

218
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,310
Mrs. Liu is really loyal to her masters, isn't she?

219
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,120
Guards.

220
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
Take these two to the main hall for questioning.

221
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,040
Yes.

222
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,800
Go.

223
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,500
Let go of me!

224
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,960
Let go!
