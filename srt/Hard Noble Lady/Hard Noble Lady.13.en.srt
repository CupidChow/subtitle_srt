1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,320
Here.

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,520
Today, I’ve invited everyone here,

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,840
firstly to catch up,

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:22,680
and secondly to celebrate my grandson Yuanxu’s recovery.

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,680
Thank you.

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,320
Please, My Lord.

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:24,920
Thank you.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,120
Thank you for coming.

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,920
Shaoyang.

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,020
I’m entertaining guests.

12
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,040
Why are you bringing people in here with weapons?

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,600
The Imperial City Division is here on official business.

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
I need to take the second son

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,880
of the Minister of Personnel with me.

16
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,640
Who dares?

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,840
My Lord.

18
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,640
Are you hosting a trap for us here at this banquet?

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,520
Very well.

20
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,880
Since the official and his son are guests of my father,

21
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,280
I’ll accompany you.

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,760
I'll let the young master finish his wine first

23
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,760
before I take him.

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,400
How rude!

25
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,880
Shaoyang.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,160
Don’t cause trouble here.

27
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:03,680
Father.

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,800
The second son of the Minister of Personnel

29
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,600
has been manipulating the Yongle Casino,

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,920
laundering money for an underground private bank,

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,680
and has caused the deaths of more than ten people.

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,160
This is official business.

33
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm not causing trouble.

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,480
Second Young Master, you’re not eating.

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,960
Looks like you're done eating.

36
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,220
I’ll be taking him now.

37
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,120
Take him away.

38
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:23,760
Get up.

39
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,400
Father!

40
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,740
The most foolish people are those

41
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,120
who try to play hero in the Imperial City Division.

42
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,600
I have 100 ways to make you confess.

43
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,880
Liu.

44
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,800
Proceed.

45
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,560
Yes.

46
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,680
My Lord.

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,720
Please spare my life.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
Please spare my life.

49
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:53,789
I'll confess.

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,360
The mastermind

51
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,759
behind the underground private bank

52
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,920
is Huang Xin, the Deputy Director of the Board of Astronomy.

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,050
Three days from now,

54
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,050
I will meet him in the bamboo forest

55
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,720
of the Board of Astronomy

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,240
to trade the laundered money.

57
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,800
Take him away and record his confession in detail.

58
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,600
Yes.

59
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,700
My Lord.

60
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,680
Huang Xin is an imperial official.

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,010
We have no evidence now.

62
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,610
We can't arrest him easily.

63
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,170
Three days from now,

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,480
I’ll go to the bamboo forest at the Board of Astronomy

65
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,560
to investigate.

66
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,680
Huang Xin.

67
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,360
Bravo!

68
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,960
Everyone,

69
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,760
I'm determined to win today.

70
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,440
It seems the liquor workshop of the Fourth Young Madam

71
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,300
of the Marquis's Mansion will soon be under my name.

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,040
Great!

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,120
Mr. Cai, if you don't get drunk,

74
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,720
I will keep my promise.

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,920
Fourth Young Madam, you’re so generous.

76
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,960
Let’s begin.

77
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,040
Wait.

78
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,250
Give it to me.

79
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,760
It's water.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,040
This is wine.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,880
There is indeed a mechanism in this pot.

82
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,240
It has a hidden compartment.

83
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,170
There are both water and wine in it.

84
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,480
He uses his identity as a magician

85
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,480
to make people think he has some secret,

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,480
but in reality, the person pouring the wine is the key.

87
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
He fooled us with such a simple trick.

88
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,890
Young Madam.

89
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,840
I’ll go catch the servant who poured the wine.

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,880
Don't alert him.

91
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
I'll deal with him tomorrow.

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,160
Mr. Cai,

93
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,530
let someone else pour your wine today.

94
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,360
Please.

95
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,730
Something is wrong with him today.

96
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,320
Please.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,180
What's wrong with him?

98
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,560
Mr. Cai.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,060
Your trick didn’t work today, did it?

100
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,920
I’m not feeling well today.

101
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,440
If you’re not well, you can withdraw from the contest.

102
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,000
Drinking is bad for your health.

103
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,640
You don’t want to make yourself worse.

104
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,160
You two.

105
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,640
You may now cross the single-plank bridge.

106
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
You can't drink without cheating?

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,280
You...

108
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,520
Cheating.

109
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,000
Hurry up and drink.

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,440
Cheating.

111
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,560
Hurry up and drink.

112
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,080
Hurry up and drink.

113
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,280
Hurry up and drink.

114
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Please.

115
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,040
You scoundrel.

116
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
You promised to pour me water,

117
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,240
so I could win the silver.

118
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,810
How dare you deceive me?

119
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,680
You did it on purpose to make me look foolish, didn’t you?

120
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,810
Fourth Young Madam.

121
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,040
Don’t listen to him.

122
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,320
I wouldn’t dare deceive you.

123
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,180
Wouldn’t dare?

124
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Didn’t you take

125
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,000
half of the silver the other day?

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,440
Get down.

127
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,920
Fraud.

128
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,800
That's too much.

129
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,440
Cheating.

130
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,080
Indeed.

131
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,360
Leave, fraud.

132
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,240
Don't embarrass yourself any further. Just leave.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:22,840
Everyone,

134
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
no one

135
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,200
won today.

136
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,970
The wine on the stage

137
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,240
is free for tasting.

138
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Although the wine is good,

139
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,760
don’t overindulge.

140
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,960
Great!

141
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,000
Please.

142
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,160
By the way,

143
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,040
do you know anyone from the Board of Astronomy?

144
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,560
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

145
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
Nothing.

146
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Just have a small matter I want to consult them about.

147
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Does this have anything to do with the 80,000 taels of silver?

148
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,440
It’s none of your business.

149
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,900
Do you know someone or not?

150
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,840
I don’t.

151
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,200
Useless.

152
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,610
Young Madam.

153
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,120
I heard from the servants that you and Young Master

154
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,850
came back in the same carriage.

155
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,250
Young Master even helped you down from the carriage.

156
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,400
So you people

157
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,480
love gossip too?

158
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,200
Is there a WeChat group for this?

159
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,640
How does news spread so fast?

160
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,370
I was just concerned about you.

161
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,200
Stop talking nonsense.

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Let me tell you.

163
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,040
Right now, in every street, in shops and restaurants,

164
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
everyone is talking about our wine.

165
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,010
We’ll be busy in the days ahead.

166
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,120
Okay.

167
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,320
Manager Liu.

168
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,320
Yes?

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,720
It seems your tavern is doing quite well.

170
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Thanks to your support.

171
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,920
Over the years, with the care from you and your father,

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,780
I've been able to open a few branches in the capital.

173
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
I’ve heard

174
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,120
that the new wine brewed by the Fourth Young Madam

175
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,280
of the Marquis' Mansion is quite popular recently.

176
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,840
I wonder if you have it for sale here.

177
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,760
Her wine is indeed excellent.

178
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,360
Many wealthy customers have been asking about it

179
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,600
and want to taste it.

180
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,560
However, you instructed us last time,

181
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,220
so I dare not

182
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,560
sell it.

183
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,120
I see that you are a wise man, Manager Liu.

184
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,960
Yes.

185
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,040
Whether that particular wine is sold or not doesn’t matter much.

186
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,960
But whether you want to continue doing business with the Li family

187
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,880
depends on whether you understand the rules.

188
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,740
Second Young Madam. Don't worry.

189
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
None of the taverns or shops under my name

190
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,240
will sell her wine.

191
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,560
It's not just that you can't sell it.

192
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,000
No shop in the entire capital

193
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,360
will sell her wine.

194
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,540
Our Li family has enough influence for that.

195
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
But don’t worry.

196
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
I will speak well of you

197
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,240
in front of my father.

198
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,770
Thank you, Second Young Madam.

199
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,600
Take care.

200
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,930
Take care, Second Young Madam.

201
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:35,680
Young man.

202
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,600
Please, do me a favor

203
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,680
and take the wine.

204
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,640
Sorry, bro.

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,760
We really can't

206
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,960
sell this wine here.

207
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,480
You should try elsewhere.

208
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,680
Qin, what's going on?

209
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,120
Fourth Young Madam.

210
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,960
All the taverns and shops

211
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,560
in the capital

212
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,120
have refused to sell our wine.

213
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
Even the ones that had placed orders

214
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,570
have returned them.

215
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,560
The person behind this is quite something.

216
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,440
First, they sabotaged my marketing strategy,

217
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,520
and now they've cut off my sales channels.

218
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,780
This tactic may be old,

219
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,400
but it's effective.

220
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,970
Shop assistant.

221
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,560
Do you have the wine from the Who Is the Best Drinker competition?

222
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,120
Sorry.

223
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,040
but we don’t sell that wine here.

224
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,720
Fourth Young Madam.

225
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,840
What should we do?

226
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,210
Our wine is priced high.

227
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,650
If we sell it ourselves,

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,960
we won't be able to sell it.

229
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,840
Even the Vice Director Huang from the Board of Astronomy couldn’t buy this wine.

230
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,700
We shouldn’t even bother trying.

231
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,120
Sir,

232
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,600
did you just see someone from the Board of Astronomy?

233
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,600
The man who just walked past was him.

234
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
Do you know where we can find him?

235
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
He’s on duty at the Board of Astronomy outside the city, in the bamboo forest.

236
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,560
Thank you.

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
Qin.

238
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,040
Take the wine back to the liquor workshop.

239
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,120
I need to go out.

240
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,560
When I return, we’ll discuss our next move.

241
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,960
Yes.

242
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,980
Why is the Board of Astronomy so far away?

243
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,200
Sir,

244
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,900
do you know the way to the Board of Astronomy?

245
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,880
Liu Xizhao?

246
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,200
Lu Shaoyang?

247
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,440
What happened to you?

248
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,690
What are you doing here?

249
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:03,800
Come on. Let's go.
