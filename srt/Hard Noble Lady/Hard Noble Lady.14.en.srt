1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,360
Are your eyes okay?

3
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,200
Are you

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,760
worried that your husband will become blind?

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,360
Why didn't you bring

6
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,640
Qingshan with you?

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
He has other tasks.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,130
Why did you come here alone?

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm going to the Board of Astronomy to find someone.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,560
Someone?

11
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,920
Who?

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,800
Vice Director Huang.

13
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,160
I want a favor from him.

14
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,010
You'd better stay away from Huang Xin.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,640
Mother.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,600
Xuanxu, what's wrong?

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
Mother, I'm hungry.

18
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to eat the jelly Fourth Auntie made.

19
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,920
Xizhao,

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,880
I will repay your kindness towards Yuanxu.

21
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
But what I want...

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,400
I will never give up.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,280
Let's go, Yuanxu.

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,960
I'll take you to eat something better.

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,830
Xizhao,

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,880
thanks to you today.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,160
The doctor said if the eyes of Shaoyang weren't cleaned in time,

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,840
there would be severe consequences.

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,960
Mother, you exaggerated.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
That was just something I should do.

31
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,920
Why don't you give me the bracelet now that you are so touched?

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,640
Shaoyang,

33
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,000
since you got married,

34
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,680
you've always been sleeping in the study.

35
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,880
That is not proper.

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
Listen to me.

37
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,320
Tonight,

38
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,520
move to Xizhao's room.

39
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,920
No!

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,320
Well...

41
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,120
Actually,

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,840
my wound

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,400
hasn't fully recovered yet.

44
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,530
It's too tiring to move around now.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,130
Let's wait until I recover.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,280
He's right.

47
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,160
Mother.

48
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,220
I'll take my leave.

49
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,000
Bing,

50
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,440
are you close to Qingshan?

51
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,110
Do you know what case Lu Shaoyang has been investigating recently?

52
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,800
According to what Qingshan told me,

53
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
it seems

54
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,079
to be a case about an illegal private bank.

55
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,079
So, Huang Xin committed economic crimes.

56
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,840
It's okay as long as it's not murder or arson.

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
Focus

58
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,560
and get the wine-selling thing done.

59
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,640
I'll think about other things after getting the bracelet.

60
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,520
Bing,

61
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,040
our wine is currently not selling well.

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,040
No restaurants sell our wine now.

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,920
If we don't want the capital chain to be broken,

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,560
we must find the key to solving the problem.

65
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
We invited

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,000
five shop owners to today's dinner.

67
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Remember to pour water for me later.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,320
I must deal with them.

69
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,770
Fourth Young Madam.

70
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,480
Old Madam wants to see you.

71
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Yes.

72
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,400
Xizhao.

73
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,120
Come here.

74
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,000
I heard about the wine shops.

75
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,840
It's not difficult.

76
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,960
So, don't worry.

77
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,640
You don't have to beg others

78
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,320
when it comes to selling wine.

79
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,800
Ask your second sister

80
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,720
to find someone.

81
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,040
Your second sister's family is the royal merchant.

82
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,920
All shops in the capital

83
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,680
will give her some respect.

84
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,760
We are all family.

85
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,280
You can just leave the wine-selling

86
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,540
to your second sister.

87
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,310
Indeed, she's the one behind this.

88
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,480
Thank you, Mother and Second Sister.

89
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,440
I know what to do.

90
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Mother, see?

91
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,160
I told you Fourth Sister was a smart and capable person.

92
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,600
Before, we all

93
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,960
misunderstood her.

94
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,120
I'm nothing

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
compared to you, Second Sister.

96
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
I only know working hard.

97
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,839
I'm not as smart as you.

98
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,600
I need to learn from you in these aspects.

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,640
Fourth Sister is indeed much more composed than when she first came here.

100
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm not capable.

101
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,250
I can't share Mother's burden.

102
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,680
Fortunately, you stepped forward in time.

103
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
Now that I'm needed,

104
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,280
then, I

105
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
must help you network for the wine-selling business.

106
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,000
It's just…

107
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,960
it might take some time.

108
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,880
I wonder if we can make it.

109
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
I think you are very competent.

110
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,600
Manager Liu of Qingchun Restaurant is one of your people, right?

111
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,240
And those restaurants all refused to sell my wine.

112
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,370
You were the one behind it, too, right?

113
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,980
Fourth Sister,

114
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,840
you can't accuse other people

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
without evidence.

116
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,180
I just want to help you share your burden.

117
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,800
You misunderstood me.

118
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,240
In that case,

119
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,750
I should thank you?

120
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,840
We are family.

121
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,360
Don't mention it.

122
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,220
Second Sister is so calculating.

123
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,300
She always hits me where it hurts.

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,860
Her maiden family is so powerful.

125
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,520
How can I fight against her?

126
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,480
I heard you sighing when I was still outside.

127
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,810
Are you still worried about selling wine?

128
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,080
Young Madam.

129
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,600
Bing.

130
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,760
His lordship asked me to choose an outfit for him.

131
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,890
But I haven't a clue about such things.

132
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,960
Help me

133
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,920
and see which one suits him better.

134
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
Why does he want to choose an outfit?

135
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,960
His Majesty has invited meritorious officials to a banquet tomorrow.

136
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,760
His lordship is also among them.

137
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,010
His Majesty's banquet?

138
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,680
Yes.

139
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,200
My Lord.

140
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,720
My Lord.

141
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,060
I have something to discuss with you.

142
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,560
Can you bring me to the palace with you?

143
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,920
This is His Majesty's banquet.

144
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,270
I can't bring you in.

145
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,200
Then, why can Qingshan go with you?

146
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,680
Young Madam, you misunderstood.

147
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,210
I'll just be waiting outside the palace gate.

148
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,610
If you want to enter the palace,

149
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,540
I can take you there next time.

150
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,120
I haven't finished yet.

151
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
Actually, I meant well.

152
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,659
Think about it.

153
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,380
Your eyes just recovered,

154
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,680
and Qingshan can't go in with you.

155
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,720
It's dangerous.

156
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,570
Besides,

157
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,770
His Majesty didn't say you can't bring your wife, right?

158
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Wait.

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,860
What do you want to do to come into the palace with me?

160
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,850
I'll tell you the truth.

161
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,240
Second Sister joined forces with all shops and restaurants

162
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,040
to stop them from selling my wine.

163
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,280
I have no choice.

164
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,800
I can only enter the palace to find a new market.

165
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
This is the royal palace.

166
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,640
Don't act recklessly.

167
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,370
Don't worry.

168
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,520
I know what to do.

169
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,580
In case anything happens,

170
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,020
I won't implicate you.

171
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,400
How can I offer my wine?

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,880
Ministers,

173
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,090
you spared no effort in sharing my burden.

174
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,600
I appreciate your hard work.

175
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,200
That's why I especially hold this banquet

176
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,440
to have a chat with you.

177
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,240
It's our honor

178
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,840
to share Your Majesty's burden.

179
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,169
Your Majesty's burden.

180
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,200
I especially had the lychee cake made.

181
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,080
Please have a taste.

182
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

183
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,080
Have a seat.

184
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,960
My wine is mellow enough.

185
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,680
Let them smell it first.

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,240
Xizhao.

187
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,300
What are you doing?

188
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,210
Don't worry.

189
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,760
I won't do anything rash.

190
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,600
Everyone, have you noticed?

191
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,040
The dance was so wonderful just now,

192
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,080
but Vice Commissioner Lu Lu

193
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,600
always looked at her wife.

194
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,420
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

195
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
What's wrong with

196
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,880
having a good relationship with your wife?

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,480
Sit down.

198
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,720
Ministers,

199
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,240
you can have a good drink today!

200
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,560
What happened?

201
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,820
Why did she spill the wine?

202
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,240
It shouldn't be.

203
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,520
Please punish us, Your Majesty.

204
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,480
Why did she spill the wine without a reason?

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,530
Is this the Emperor's aura?

206
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,920
It's indeed a bit intimidating.
