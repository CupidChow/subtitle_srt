1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,100
It's been raining for three days.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,800
Everything is wet.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,360
I feel I'm going to go moldy.

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,280
Li Jing must be very annoyed now.

6
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,360
She was only focused on getting as much as sorghum

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,160
and didn't expect that the rainy season

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
would come a month early this year.

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,120
Her plan has failed.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:36,770
Young Madam.

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,400
How did you know the rainy season would come a month early?

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,800
I'll give it a try anyway.

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:44,760
Let's go.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,560
Be careful.

15
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,180
Li Jing.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,600
You made me do this.

17
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,390
Let's see who will win this time.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,480
Vice Director Huang.

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,720
You are?

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,200
Vice Director Huang, are you free now?

21
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
I need your help.

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,370
Please go ahead.

23
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,360
Do you know when a total solar eclipse will occur?

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,760
Do you mean the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun?

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,560
Yes.

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,440
The Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun.

27
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,920
To calculate when it will occur, I need to observe stars at night.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,450
I'm afraid it will take days to get the result.

29
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,320
So long?

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,400
Then could you please calculate

32
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,810
when the rainy season will come this year?

33
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,200
I can help you with that.

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,440
Please.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,110
Thank you.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,979
If I'm not capable enough,

37
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,640
how can I be your Young Madam?

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,890
Young Madam.

39
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,280
I feel you're a different person now.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,410
You're increasingly different from whom you used to be.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,560
Really?

42
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,120
But I prefer the way you are now.

43
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,180
You've become very brave and lively.

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,000
You haven't been so happy for a long time.

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,120
Bing.

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,730
You should be happy too.

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,100
You should be brave

48
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,440
and try to become

49
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,970
the master of your own fate.

50
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Second Sister, you are really poised.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
You're in great trouble but you don't look worried at all.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,680
Xizhao, you're really clever.

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,240
Not only did you come up with a good plan

54
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,300
but also you made right predictions.

55
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,160
Since I started to harvest sorghum hurriedly,

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,840
you've known this year's rainy season would come earlier.

57
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
So your plan was

58
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:56,560
to use me to help you get enough crops for making booze

59
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,800
without a tael of silver of yours.

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,080
I really admire you

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,000
for your business acumen.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,680
Second Sister, you're so smart.

63
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
It was so lucky for me

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
that the weather favored me.

65
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,400
Otherwise,

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,130
I would definitely lose to you.

67
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,400
Tell me.

68
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,640
How low do you want my price to be?

69
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,460
Second Sister.

70
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,010
Let's collaborate.

71
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,480
I promise you won't suffer any losses.

72
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,200
I'll give you half of the profit

73
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,560
from the pre-sales of our booze.

74
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,920
As women,

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,460
we have very little power in this era.

76
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,840
But if we as women can be united,

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,980
we will be invincible.

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,680
I promised

79
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
that the one who could solve the crisis for Marquis's Mansion

80
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,520
will be given the household management power.

81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,000
Liu Xizhao

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,400
was assigned the task at the critical moment.

83
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,680
These days,

84
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,839
she has been taking good care of the mansion.

85
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,680
And she has solved

86
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,480
the problem that even I didn't know how to deal with.

87
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,560
She has strengthened the foundation of our family

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,620
and enhanced our family reputation.

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,120
Today,

90
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,520
I will fulfill my promise

91
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,740
and give the household management power to you.

92
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,840
This jade bracelet

93
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,480
was passed down to us by the late emperor.

94
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,920
It's our family heirloom.

95
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,320
Today,

96
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,310
I'll let you keep it.

97
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,420
Thank you, Mother.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Mother.

99
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,880
It's my pleasure

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,200
to do something for Marquis's Mansion.

101
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,440
But

102
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,600
I'm afraid

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,880
I cannot take the household management power.

104
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
I know little about

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,040
the rules of noble families.

106
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
I need more training.

107
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,280
I think

108
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
Second Sister

109
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,010
is more suitable than me to manage the affairs of our family.

110
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,990
Mother.

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,130
Please consider letting her take the household management power.

112
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,200
Xizhao.

113
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,480
You've been working hard for so long.

114
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,040
Wasn't it for the household management power?

115
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,120
Xizhao, why are you recommending me?

116
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,270
You are so smart.

117
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,200
It’s easy for you to manage the affairs of Marquis's Mansion.

118
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,120
Don't refuse.

119
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,820
Second Sister.

120
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
I mean what I said.

121
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,100
You are more suitable than me.

122
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
But Mother.

123
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,280
I have a small request.

124
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,080
Can you

125
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,320
let me wear the jade bracelet

126
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
for a few days?

127
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,520
When I don't want to wear it anymore,

128
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,320
I'll return it to Second Sister.

129
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,830
Jing.

130
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
You're very capable.

131
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,520
It's easy for you to manage our mansion well.

132
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,250
Our Marquis's Mansion is so big

133
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,040
that I need to let someone reliable manage it.

134
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,040
Just take it.

135
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,880
Then I'll accept it.

136
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,280
Hope my sisters will often help me in the future.

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,520
Actually, Second Sister is smart and decisive.

138
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,980
She was so desperate to beat me that she became narrow-minded.

139
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,280
Otherwise, I might have lost to her.

140
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,560
Unfortunately,

141
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,690
she'll be restricted in the mansion forever.

142
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,720
She'll never be able to go to the outside world and start her own career.

143
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,840
I didn't expect

144
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,640
you could turn the tide

145
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,320
and have a good win.

146
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,320
I just took advantage of the information I had got in advance.

147
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,960
If she lived in the modern times,

148
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,560
she might be a very successful businesswoman.

149
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,080
Modern times?

150
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,240
You often say something so confusing.

151
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,040
But I like it.

152
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Bing.

153
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,240
You can never

154
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,900
expect others to protect you.

155
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,880
No matter what era you are in,

156
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,480
you need to develop your own ability.

157
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,600
Only when you can create value

158
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,400
will others not look down on you.

159
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,840
From now on, we need to learn more skills.

160
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,570
Understand?

161
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,180
I've been here for so long.

162
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,600
This is my first time to roam on the street.

163
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,159
If you like it,

164
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,800
I'll take you here often.

165
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
You'd better not.

166
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,000
Why not?

167
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,040
It's hard to say

168
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,920
whether we'll see each other again in the future.

169
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,360
We live together every day.

170
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,890
How come we won't see each other in the future?

171
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,800
I misunderstood you before.

172
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,720
I'm sorry.

173
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,280
Now I know

174
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,160
you're not a boring person that I thought you were.

175
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,480
I used to believe that the gender makes much difference.

176
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Actually, I shouldn't

177
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,340
have judged people based on gender bias.

178
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,000
Su Bing.

179
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,340
Do you know what I admire you for the most?

180
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,320
I admire you

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,159
because you can work as hard as a man.

182
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,419
You're not as vulnerable as other women.

183
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,679
You can say I work hard.

184
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,679
But why did you have to say I work as hard as a man?

185
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,080
Fine.

186
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
Let me put it another way.

187
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,400
I think as a woman,

188
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
you have a strength

189
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,120
which is that you've been trying to prove

190
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,280
that you're no inferior to men

191
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,610
so you always work hard.

192
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Mr. Liu.

193
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,800
I found that you not only have misunderstandings about women

194
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,330
but also hold huge prejudices against women.

195
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,720
Honey.

196
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,040
How about I take you

197
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,910
to Zuixian Pavilion and try the Eight Treasure Roast Goose there?

198
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:04,570
Where is it?

199
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,890
Let's go.

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Follow me.

201
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,100
So you're Lu Shaoyang's wife.

202
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,120
No wonder you tried to get close to me a few days ago.

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,870
Both you and Lu Shaoyang should die.
