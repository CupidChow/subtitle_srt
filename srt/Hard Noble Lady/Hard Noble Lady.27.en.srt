1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,840
What brings you here?

3
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,200
Are you blaming me for letting you suffer this?

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,160
So you are.

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,990
Sister.

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,210
You're already the emperor's noble consort.

7
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,740
And you're leading a luxurious life.

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,920
You should stop now.

9
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,380
You think what I've done is for a luxurious life?

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,680
I'm not doing it for myself.

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,720
I want power,

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,040
status,

13
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,200
and dignity.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,960
You won't understand.

15
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,039
It's too late to stop.

16
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,680
Now you have to

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,520
be the scapegoat for me and for Prince Song's Mansion.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,200
Our whole clan will be proud of you.

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,600
Is there really no turning back?

20
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,440
Idiot!

21
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,900
How can I turn back?

22
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,480
Do you expect me to kneel in the hall and beg for His Majesty's mercy?

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,520
Do you expect me to ask him to sentence me to death

24
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,979
and then spare our family?

25
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,940
If they find out what I did,

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,370
everyone in Prince Song's Mansion will be executed.

27
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,039
So,

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,280
from the beginning,

29
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,479
you saw me as a scapegoat

30
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,080
who could replace you to die.

31
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,000
I entered the palace alone

32
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,840
and went through numerous difficulties to get what I have now.

33
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,900
Do you know how much I've sacrificed?

34
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,520
You and your stupid husband

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,920
have been leading an easy life for so long.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,250
It's time for you to do something for Prince Song's Mansion.

37
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,280
Sister.

38
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,160
I can replace you to die.

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,079
But please give me some more time.

40
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,920
I'm pregnant with Shaoming's child.

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,050
Please let me give birth to this child.

42
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,300
After that, I'll replace you to plead guilty and get executed.

43
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,800
I've told you

44
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,560
it can't be delayed.

45
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
We have no other choice.

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,700
Just accept the fact that your unborn child is unlucky.

47
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,780
Fourth Sister, how have you been?

48
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,690
Why are you here?

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,329
What a coincidence.

50
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,920
The other day in the music house, I met someone

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,120
whose figure looked very similar to yours.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,280
I'm here today

53
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,720
to see

54
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,160
how you are doing.

55
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,240
You must be doing very well.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,079
You can still go to places like the music house and the dance house.

57
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:40,010
I didn't know there were such good places in the city.

58
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,280
We

59
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,010
are so poor that we almost have no rice to cook.

60
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Unlike you

61
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,360
who can go out and have fun all day.

62
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,120
Fourth Sister, you must be joking.

63
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
If you just want to see

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,320
how miserable our lives are,

65
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,560
you've seen it.

66
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,350
Leave.

67
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,980
Fourth Sister.

68
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,440
You!

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,500
Fourth Sister.

70
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,460
Why didn't you tell me there was a dog in the yard?

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,840
The water was supposed to be used to water flowers.

72
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,680
But it was wasted on an animal.

73
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,920
Just stay here.

74
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,769
Don't cause me trouble.

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,720
Don't irritate me!

76
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,810
What should I do?

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,280
Stop walking around. It's giving me a headache.

78
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,280
Eldest Sister!

79
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
What took you so long?

80
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,480
What happened?

81
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,120
Someone from my parents' family said

82
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,180
Her Majesty was going to pray at Baima Temple tomorrow.

83
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,720
Her Majesty is going to Baima Temple?

84
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
It's a good thing.

85
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,600
If we can get to see Her Majesty,

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
we may have a chance to get her help.

87
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,400
When the royal family is praying in the temple,

88
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,640
the temple will be heavily guarded.

89
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,720
There's no way for us to get in.

90
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,880
What should we do?

91
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,970
How about

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,160
we go in and hide there in advance?

93
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Even if we get to see Her Majesty,

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
we must show her adequate evidence.

95
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,720
Without adequate evidence,

96
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,250
she won't be able to help us.

97
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,320
So the most important thing now

98
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,120
is to find convincing evidence.

99
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,800
I'll go with you.

100
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,760
Mother.

101
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,560
Mother.

102
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:25,400
I know the abbot of Baima Temple.

103
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,440
Let me go with you.

104
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,600
Mother.

105
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,120
You've just recovered.

106
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
You shouldn't be overworking yourself.

107
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,680
Just wait for our news.

108
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,350
Yes.

109
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,240
Marquis's Mansion is in trouble now.

110
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,360
You're willing to overcome difficulties together.

111
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
As the mistress of the family,

112
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,820
I can't just sit there and do nothing.

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,760
I'll go with you.

114
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,520
I'm a senior.

115
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,760
Her Majesty might agree to help us for my sake.

116
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,040
Mother.

117
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,880
Xizhao.

118
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,080
We'll talk to Her Majesty.

119
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,650
You must do your best to find the evidence.

120
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,640
Be quick.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you.

122
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Third Sister.

123
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,970
What are you doing here?

124
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,760
I plan to meet Her Majesty and ask her for help,

125
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,240
trying to gain a chance to get you out of here

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,700
and help you and Shaoming get back together.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,360
He and I have long lost the chance to get back together.

128
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,560
Don't waste time on us.

129
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,080
You're right.

130
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,580
If you continue to do nothing,

131
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,880
Shaoming won't have much time left.

132
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,710
What do you mean?

133
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
Don't you know?

134
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,280
The property of Marquis's Mansion has been confiscated.

135
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Shaoming has been put in the imperial prison.

136
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,640
Of the three brothers,

137
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,690
he should be the one who's beaten the hardest.

138
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,820
If you want to know the reason,

139
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,320
you should go ask Noble Consort Jia.

140
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,000
She's secretly manipulating the underground private bank again.

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,660
I don't know how many people will be involved and killed this time.

142
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
You two are really good sisters.

143
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,020
You replaced her to be in the jail.

144
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,360
But she's having fun out there

145
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,120
and has become the pride of the whole family.

146
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
And you

147
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,920
have become the disgrace to your parents' family

148
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,480
as well as to your husband's family.

149
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,280
Enough.

150
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,360
Stop.

151
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Third Sister.

152
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,840
We know each other.

153
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,960
I feel sorry for you.

154
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,159
Noble Consort Jia's crimes will be revealed sooner or later.

155
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,620
By then, the whole Prince Song's Mansion

156
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
will be doomed.

157
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,080
You can shield her this time but you won't be able to shield her forever.

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,720
What will happen in the end

159
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,720
is that your parents

160
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,460
and even the whole Song family will be executed because of her.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,040
You know it very well, right?

162
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,380
Why didn't you go to His Majesty to tell him the truth

163
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,120
and beg him for mercy?

164
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,360
It's not as simple as you think.

165
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,080
His Majesty won't let us off.

166
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,440
How do you know if you don't give it a try?

167
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,680
Third Sister.

168
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,780
Stop letting others hurt you at will.

169
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,460
You need to be the master of your own fate.

170
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,700
Tell me, Third Sister.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,530
How can we testify against Noble Consort Jia?

172
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:40,240
I know how to keep you alive.

173
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,320
Don't you hate me?

174
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,160
Why should I hate you?

175
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,160
You jumped into the lake for the first time

176
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,680
because you saw

177
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,080
my sister and I discussing the business of the underground private bank.

178
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,040
My sister ordered someone to push you down into the lake.

179
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,300
Later I thought you had lost your memory.

180
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,680
Since I was saved,

181
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,420
you've never tried to kill me.

182
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
Third Sister.

183
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,480
You are not a cruel person.

184
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
You are so kind.

185
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,320
Stop doing bad things for your sister, okay?

186
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,760
Go testify against Noble Consort Jia

187
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,020
and clear the name of Marquis's Mansion.

188
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,200
Then Prince Song's Mansion will also not be in danger.

189
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,500
Most importantly,

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
you'll be able to save Shaoming.

191
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,440
Then you two can be reunited.

192
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,760
Sister.

193
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
I can replace you to die.

194
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,280
Please give me some more time.

195
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm pregnant with Shaoming's child.

196
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,530
Please let me give birth to this child.

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
After that, I'll replace you to plead guilty and get executed.

198
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,840
I told you

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,480
this can't be delayed.

200
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,730
We have no other choice.

201
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,940
Just accept the fact that your unborn child is unlucky.

202
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,640
I have a letter

203
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,320
which was from my sister to a rich merchant in Jiangnan Region.

204
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,380
In the letter, they discussed business of the underground private bank.

205
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,320
I hid it in my bedroom.

206
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,680
The Minister of Justice is arriving to interrogate the suspect.

207
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,440
Leave now.

208
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,200
Take care.
