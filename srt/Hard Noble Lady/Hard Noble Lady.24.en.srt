1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,360
Shaozhen,

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,820
do you know what mistake you made?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,120
I don't know.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,680
Prince Song's Mansion is a royal family!

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,610
Why did you get involved with them?

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,640
Noble Consort Jia has caused a lot of trouble in the palace these years.

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,080
Do you think you can have the backing of her

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,360
after being close to her?

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,560
You'll only get yourself into trouble.

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,620
All these years, if it weren't for me,

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,680
you couldn't have lived a carefree life like this.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,920
Kneel here

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,760
and reflect on yourself!

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,680
Prince Song's Mansion and Lu Shaoming have become in-laws.

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,880
But when it comes to me,

17
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,360
even just speaking to them is considered trying to flatter them.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,480
Why?

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,320
If it weren't for me,

20
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,570
you wouldn't have died, right?

21
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,560
Xizhao,

22
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,890
the dead can't be brought back to life.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,920
Pull yourself together.

24
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,240
There are still many things waiting to be handled.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,080
Tell me,

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
if I hadn't come here,

27
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Bing wouldn't have died, right?

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,980
How could it be your fault?

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,280
Bing died because of Noble Consort Jia's order.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,880
No.

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,320
It's my fault.

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,400
If I didn't go to Huang Xin

33
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,600
or the empress

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,220
and I didn't mess with the noble consort,

35
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,480
Bing wouldn't have died.

36
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,760
Liu Xizhao,

37
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,700
what's wrong with you?

38
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,980
It's the same for everyone

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,260
in Marquis's Mansion.

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,880
It's a life-and-death struggle for everyone.

41
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,280
I warned you

42
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,450
from the beginning.

43
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,910
Don't think marrying into Marquis's Mansion is a good thing.

44
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,040
It's your courage

45
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
and fearlessness

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
that have made me believe

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,090
you are different from others.

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,560
I'm willing to accompany you

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,840
be your truest self.

50
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,740
Do you understand?

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm not as good as you said.

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,640
I just want to leave here.

53
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,920
Bing is lying here.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,620
If you want to run away,

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,760
just tell Bing.

56
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,880
Tell her the one she wanted to become like the most

57
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,880
and trusted the most

58
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,940
wants to leave her.

59
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,010
Young Madam,

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,520
I'm going to the kitchen to get you some food to build up your health.

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,320
Young Madam,

62
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,600
eating vegetables is good for your health.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,720
My Lady, seize the chance.

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,250
Go for it.

65
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:45,960
Well...

66
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,860
I just want to take a walk here.

67
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,800
Why are you following me like Lu Shaoyang did?

68
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I should protect you at any time.

69
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,740
I can't let you be in danger again.

70
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,090
Young Madam,

71
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,480
I think you've changed.

72
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
You've become increasingly different from how you were.

73
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,200
But I like the current you more.

74
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,440
You've become very brave

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,280
and outgoing.

76
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,900
You haven't been so happy for a long time.

77
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,800
Bing.

78
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,690
You should also be happy

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,800
and brave.

80
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,560
Try to become a woman who can control her own fate.

81
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
Bing is dead.

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,570
We can't let the murderer get away with it.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,720
No!

84
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
Your Highness!

85
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Your Highness, what can I do for you?

86
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
Has Xin's body been taken care of properly?

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,080
Don't worry, Your Highness.

88
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,200
He has been buried.

89
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,480
This is the ring on Lord Huang Xin's finger.

90
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:58,280
Xin,

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,640
don't blame me.

92
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,430
They have left me no choice.

93
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,960
I had to let you die.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,080
It's their fault.

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,000
It's all because of them.

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,320
I will kill everyone

97
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,400
involved in this!

98
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,040
Star-reading Pavilion is where Huang Xin and Noble Consort Jia met in private.

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,900
Maybe there is evidence of their involvement in running the underground private bank.

100
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,880
They even have a secret room.

101
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,200
Sir, you look distinguished and noble.

102
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,670
Which mansion are you from?

103
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,320
I'm just a dog of a rich family.

104
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,360
I have to be obedient

105
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
in order to get food.

106
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,600
What a waste.

107
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,280
Mr. Lu, you're very talented.

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,200
You should achieve your ambition in the court,

109
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,000
instead of being others' stepping stone in Marquis's Mansion.

110
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,800
Mr. Gao,

111
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,520
if you have any requirement, just tell me.

112
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,120
I will do my best to help you.

113
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,250
It's not really a requirement.

114
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,320
In the future, when you

115
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,880
become successful,

116
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,880
don't forget me.

117
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,080
We both work for Her Highness.

118
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,480
We're one.

119
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,600
Okay.

120
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
Please.

121
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,240
Bottoms up.

122
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,570
What is this?

123
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:33,900
Be careful!

124
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,000
Lu Shaoyang,

125
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,710
are you okay?

126
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,310
There are traps in this room.

127
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,040
Don't act rashly.

128
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I wanted to come here to protect you,

129
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,820
but you need to take care of me now.

130
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,200
Stop making a fuss.

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,840
I wanted to come to Star-reading Pavilion.

132
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,970
I must take you back.

133
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Hang in there.

134
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,410
I always thought we still had a lot of time,

135
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,220
so there was no need to rush it.

136
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Now it seems

137
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,040
fate is unpredictable.

138
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Lu Shaoyang,

139
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,820
don't you think it's too early

140
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,380
to say your last words now?

141
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
I swear

142
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,400
I won't let you die before me.

143
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,500
Let's go. I'll get you out of here.

144
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
I'm fine.

145
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,740
No matter how you want to avenge Bing,

146
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,880
I'll support you.

147
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
I don't know

148
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,720
insisting on avenging Bing is right or not.

149
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,360
Xizhao,

150
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,240
why did you come to me?

151
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,840
Bing is dead.

152
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,520
Third Sister was put in jail.

153
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,360
And you're injured.

154
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,320
If we continue the investigation,

155
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,640
Noble Consort Jia will definitely kill us.

156
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,760
Lu Shaoyang,

157
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,120
you know what?

158
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,580
This place is different from what I thought.

159
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,360
I overestimated myself before.

160
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,320
I don't want to investigate it anymore.

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,900
I'm worried...

162
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm worried you and I will be

163
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,850
the next ones lying in the yard.

164
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,560
Liu Xizhao,

165
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,700
now is not the time to blame yourself.

166
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,040
If I can't solve the underground private bank's case,

167
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,770
I will be guilty of negligence.

168
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,640
It doesn't matter whether I'll die or not.

169
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,840
It has nothing to do with you.

170
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,400
I'm just scared!

171
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,920
I'm scared, okay?

172
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,800
I just want everything

173
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,840
to go back to the way it was.

174
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,600
I want everyone

175
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,120
to be where he should be.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,240
I don't want this to happen.

177
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,200
I just want all of us to be fine.

178
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,440
Bing has left me.

179
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,220
I don't want anything to happen to anyone again.

180
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm here.

181
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:01,960
My Lord.

182
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,400
Her Ladyship sent someone here

183
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,520
to ask you and Young Madam to go back to discuss something.

184
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,600
Everyone must be there today.

185
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,200
A few days ago, His Majesty ordered

186
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,400
Marquis of Changping's Mansion

187
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,080
to escort military provisions and funds to the border.

188
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,360
We should depart in three days.

189
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:20,960
Shaoyang,

190
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,680
your second brother is busy with court affairs.

191
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,920
It's not convenient for him to return to the capital.

192
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,640
This time,

193
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,720
I want you and Shaozhen to go with me.

194
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
Pick more elite soldiers to ensure safety.

195
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,000
Shaozhen,

196
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,120
you'll be the vanguard.

197
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Don't tell anyone

198
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,240
about the route.

199
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,490
Uncle, don't worry.

200
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,320
I will make a careful plan.

201
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,470
I guess it will take some time

202
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,980
to complete this mission.

203
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,160
The Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun is approaching.

204
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I'm afraid I can't watch it with you.

205
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,560
Should I tell him

206
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,120
I plan to leave?

207
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,380
Take good care of the mansion these days.

208
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,200
Don't let anything happen again.

209
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,400
My Lord, don't worry.

210
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,080
Our second daughter-in-law is quite good at managing domestic affairs.

211
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,840
Even if something happens,

212
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,080
Xizhao can help us.

213
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,220
You are just women.

214
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,600
What difference can you make?

215
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,800
It is a man who makes the decision at critical moments.

216
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,330
Don't act on your own again.

217
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay.

218
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,200
Here.

219
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:35,960
What is this?

220
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,200
You didn't seem to be yourself when we were eating just now.

221
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
You must be worried about my trip.

222
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,880
During my absence,

223
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,480
my Ruyi Crossbow

224
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,410
will protect you for me.

225
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Who came up with this idea for you?

226
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
Qingshan.

227
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,840
I didn't expect him to be so thoughtful.

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,880
I don't need it.

229
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,560
Keep it for yourself.

230
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,060
What about you?

231
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,560
Don't worry about me.

232
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,050
Then I'll ask Qingshan to stay with you

233
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,220
to protect you.

234
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,040
Shaoyang, Shaozhen,

235
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,680
you must take good care of His Lordship.

236
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,240
Aunt, don't worry.

237
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,160
Mother, don't worry.

238
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,840
Be careful.

239
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,730
Wait for me to come back.

240
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,640
I'll be gone by that time anyway.

241
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,330
Goodbye.

242
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,560
Let's go!

243
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,800
Shaoyang,

244
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,120
the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun will take place in five days.

245
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,960
I'll be gone when you come back.

246
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,480
Take care.
