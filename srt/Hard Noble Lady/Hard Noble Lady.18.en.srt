00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,040
Xizhao.

3
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,080
Third Sister?

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,860
Third Brother?

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,740
Fourth Sister.

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,300
Today is Huan's birthday.

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,650
You and Fourth Brother must come tonight.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,650
It's your birthday, Third Sister?

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:29,520
Okay.

10
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,500
I'll be there on time tonight.

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,640
We'll go back and prepare for the banquet now.

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,560
See you tonight.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,040
Okay.

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's go find the Eldest Sister and the Second Sister

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,040
and ask them to come over tonight.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,480
Okay.

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
You hold birthday parties here?

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,080
Yes.

19
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,480
The Third Young Master and Young Madam love each other very much.

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,280
They hold a banquet on the Third Young Madam's birthday every year.

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,610
The ladies in the mansion are all envious.

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,640
That's great.

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,480
Let's go.

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,480
-Happy birthday.
-Happy birthday.

25
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,920
Thank you.

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,850
I'll just take a sip.

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:10,600
You guys drink more.

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,890
You can drink so much. Why only one sip?

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,120
Third Sister.

30
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,480
Third Brother

31
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,680
hosts a birthday banquet for you every year.

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,360
He really

33
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,360
loves you.

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,000
Huan and I have an agreement

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,320
to grow old together.

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,880
Even when we get old,

37
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,840
I'll always love her.

38
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,560
Alright.

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,000
Stop talking nonsense.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:35,800
Huan,

41
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,600
as long as you like it,

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,210
everything is worth it.

43
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Look.

44
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,120
Third Sister is so lucky.

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,520
Third Brother is with him every day.

46
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm so jealous of her.

47
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:47,560
Yeah.

48
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,280
Unlike your big brother, he isn't at home every day,

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,960
I don't know what he's busy with.

50
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Seriously!

51
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,340
Eldest Sister.

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,080
Here.

53
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,370
One more.

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:58,200
One more.

55
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,320
This is for you.

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,880
For me?

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,490
When others receive gifts,

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,260
you must have one, too.

59
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,240
I'm okay.

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,760
Come on.

61
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,560
One more.

62
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,190
Drink.

63
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,720
Drink.

64
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,320
Here.

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,560
Hello.

66
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,020
Is Vice Director Huang in?

67
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,560
Vice Director Huang went to the Star-reading Pavilion

68
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,760
to check the astrology diary.

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,620
He won't come back if it gets late.

70
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,140
I'll come another day.

71
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,760
Sir,

72
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,920
may I ask

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,440
where the Star-reading Pavilion is?

74
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,760
It's right on the mountain, five miles ahead.

75
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,040
But it's raining.

76
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,890
It's hard to go up the mountain.

77
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,480
I see.

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,079
Thank you.

79
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,280
You're welcome.

80
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
The Board of Astronomy is really good at choosing places.

81
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
They actually have a villa here.

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,440
Xin.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,600
These days,

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,850
you must be careful.

85
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,200
Take care of yourself.

86
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,480
Why does this voice

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,040
sound so familiar?

88
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,480
Third Sister?

89
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,700
It must be hard for you.

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
I really can't come out to see you recently.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,080
It's okay.

92
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,040
I have you in my heart.

93
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,200
I don't care about the short-term gains or losses.

94
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
What...

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,200
Isn't she much in love with Third Brother?

96
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,040
How could it be?

97
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,100
This is obviously not the first time.

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,610
Why does her back

99
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,800
look so familiar?

100
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,409
You go first.

101
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,720
Leave it to me.

102
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,480
Young Madam,

103
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,680
you are finally back.

104
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,880
Fourth Young Master is waiting for you.

105
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,680
Where did you go, Fourth Sister?

106
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,940
You're in such a hurry.

107
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,490
Third Sister, you just came back, too?

108
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,320
Why didn't you bring Third Brother along?

109
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,960
Isn't he always nice to you?

110
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,640
The flowers in your house may not smell as good as wildflowers,

111
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,840
but what if wildflowers are poisonous?

112
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,840
I've been looking for you for four hours.

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,770
Where did you go?

114
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
Should I tell him

115
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,210
about the Third Sister?

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,010
I said, where did you go?

117
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,280
I want to ask you first

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,440
how Third Brother and Third Sister

119
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,560
meet each other?

120
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,480
They met at the polo club.

121
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,480
After that, Third Brother asked Father to go to Prince Song's Mansion to propose marriage.

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:14,080
At that time, Third Sister's father thought Third Brother was too weak.

123
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,940
But she insisted on marrying him.

124
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,160
Then, why did she cheat on him?

125
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Why do you ask?

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,160
Nothing.

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,580
I'm a little tired.

128
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
I want to rest.

129
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,120
I'll take you to the night market tonight.

130
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,200
We'll talk about it tonight.

131
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,080
Go back first.

132
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,120
I thought she had lost her memory after falling into the water

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,200
and couldn't remember anything in the past.

134
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,760
But she had to come back with yellow mud on her shoes

135
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,890
and with bamboo leaves on her clothes.

136
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,200
You can only find those things in Star-reading Pavilion.

137
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,260
If it wasn't her, who else could it be?

138
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,720
I've asked around.

139
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,640
Fourth Young Madam

140
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,980
went to the Board of Astronomy to look for Lord Huang today.

141
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,810
What on earth does she want?

142
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,960
No matter how much she knows,

143
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,700
she can't be here anymore.

144
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,560
Liu Xizhao.

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,040
You asked for this.

146
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,120
You can't blame me.

147
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,810
Inform the people outside to do it.

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,720
Yes.

149
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,400
It looks ordinary,

150
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,460
but it tastes good.

151
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,930
What other yummy food do you have here?

152
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,320
Lotus Leaf Chicken. Five-flavored Goose.

153
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,780
You even have Five-flavored Goose here?

154
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,960
How is it made?

155
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,480
Find a chance to run!
