00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,980
Noble Consort,

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,320
Lu Shaozhen and Eunuch Gao have confessed their crimes.

4
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,760
They were ordered by you to snatch the provisions and funds.

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,680
Why haven't you confessed your crime yet?

6
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,520
No.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,160
I...

8
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,160
I'm innocent.

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:34,960
Your Majesty.

10
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,720
It's all Song Huan's fault.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,000
Song Huan tricked me.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,200
She was jealous that I was favored by Your Majesty.

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,360
She tricked me into opening a private bank with her to snatch the provisions and funds.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,960
I knew nothing.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,730
She tricked me into writing that letter, too.

16
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,200
Your Majesty,

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,800
if Noble Consort Jia is really innocent,

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,560
why did she ask someone to kill us

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
and stop me from giving the evidence to Her Majesty?

20
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,160
You obviously watned to kill me because you feared that your secret would be revealed.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,280
At this point,

22
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,120
you still want to shirk your responsibility and frame others?

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,840
don't believe in her slanderous words.

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,570
She colluded with the Empress.

26
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,560
They are jealous that I've gained Your Majesty's favor.

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,880
They framed me.

28
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,720
Your Majesty.

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,280
Don't trust them.

30
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,280
You're talking nonsense!

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,530
I'm so disappointed in you.

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
Pass my order.

33
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,840
From today onwards,

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,720
Noble Consort Jia's title is deprived.

35
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,280
She'll be confined in the Hall of Repentance

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,810
and will never be released.

37
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,920
Your Majesty!

38
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,480
No!

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,600
Your Majesty!

40
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,000
Your Majesty!

41
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,160
Your Majesty!

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,759
Are you happy now?

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,530
I've been banished to the Cold Palace.

44
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:42,220
But you have freendom now.

45
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,520
I will

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,580
take good care of our parents.

47
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,140
Sister, take care.

48
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Thanks to our daughter-in-laws' joint efforts,

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,920
the crisis of our Marquis's Mansion was solved this time.

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,680
That was why

51
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,210
the verdict of our case could be reversed.

52
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
They are just a few women,

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120
and they merely made a tiny contribution.

54
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
In terms of reversing the verdict of the case,

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,240
that was because His Majesty and Her Majesty

56
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,970
pitied our Marquis's Mansion.

57
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,480
It's all in the past.

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,200
From now on,

59
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,079
don't let them expose themselves in public again.

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,920
My Lord.

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,640
What you said is so disappointing.

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
Xizhao went hither and thither to ask for help

63
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,440
for the Marquis's Mansion.

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,640
Our eldest and second elest daughter-in-laws worked so hard day and night.

65
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,900
You said it was just a tiny contribution?

66
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,670
It's fine for you to be like this at ordinary times.

67
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,960
But all of us have been through such a big crisis.

68
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,220
I think you should change your attitude!

69
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,720
You...

70
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,680
You...

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
How dare you talk back to me?

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,480
The members of our family haven't got together like this for a long time.

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,560
Harmony in a family brings prosperity.

74
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,160
Nothing is

75
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,520
more important than being with our family.

76
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,320
Yes.

77
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,320
Xizhao.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,040
Huan and I managed to get out of trouble this time.

79
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,300
You made the biggest contribution to it.

80
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,350
Thank you so much, Xizhao.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,200
Actually, this time,

82
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,960
Mother, Eldest Sister-in-law and Second Sister-in-law

83
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,400
all made a contribution.

84
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,120
It was not just my own credit.

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,560
It's inappropriate for a woman

86
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,560
to do business

87
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,300
and expose herself in public.

88
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,160
In my opinion,

89
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,920
a woman had better take good care of domestic affairs,

90
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,960
assist her husband and educate her children.

91
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,600
Right?

92
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,560
If they had only known how to assist their husbands and educate their children,

93
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,200
our family wouldn't have been reunited today.

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
If they

95
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,290
had not exposed themselves in public,

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,640
they wouldn't have acquired the evidence of the Noble Consort's crimes.

97
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Even if Her Majesty had come to the Baima Temple ten times,

98
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
she wouldn't be able to see the injustice of our Marquis's Mansion,

99
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,680
let alone reporting it to His Majesty

100
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,600
to reverse the verdict of our case.

101
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,400
That's right.

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Xizhao found the evidence.

103
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,399
In the Baima Temple, Mother,

104
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,810
Second Sister-in-law and I were also the ones who stalled Her Majesty.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,120
What we did for the Marquis's Mansion

106
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,260
could be seen by everyone obviously.

107
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,840
Father, you can distinguish it clearly, can't you?

108
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,800
How come you've been talking to me like this lately?

109
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
How did I talk to you?

110
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,760
Am I wrong?

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,520
All that I said is the truth.

112
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
Every word I said is right.

113
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,000
When did I say that you were wrong?

114
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,440
I just said that women should...

115
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,040
What do you mean by "should"?

116
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,800
Gosh.

117
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
Father, if you want to refute what she said,

118
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,900
you should explain it with the truth, right?

119
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,360
Father, Mother,

120
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,840
stop arguing with each other.

121
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
Just now, I noticed that Huan was hungry.

122
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,480
How about

123
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,200
we go have lunch now?

124
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,800
Okay.

125
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Let's have lunch.

126
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,040
Let's go.

127
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Let's have lunch.

128
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,920
I thought that you would be angry with me.

129
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,280
Anyway,

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,520
thank you.

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,720
Why would I be angry with you?

132
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
As long as you are safe,

133
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,300
nothing else matters.

134
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,080
You really don't blame me?

135
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,880
No, I don't.

136
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,790
Everyone has something that he cares about very much.

137
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,440
Maybe that bracelet

138
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,400
really has a special meaning to you.

139
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,520
I don't know what its meaning is,

140
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
but as long as you care about it,

141
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,340
I'll care, too.

142
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,500
Then let me tell you the truth.

143
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,680
Although you may not believe it even if I tell you about it.

144
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
Then tell me about it.

145
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,740
Let me listen to it.

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,000
As long as I have that bracelet,

147
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,880
with the occurrence of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun,

148
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,920
I can go back to my original world.

149
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,040
See?

150
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,240
I said that you wouldn't believe it even if I told you about it.

151
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,280
I'm thinking

152
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,220
no matter where you go,

153
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,330
you'll have to take me with you.

154
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,320
Otherwise,

155
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,660
I won't allow you to go.

156
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,680
Congratulations, Third Young Madam.

157
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
The fetus in your belly is fine.

158
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,840
Then I'll take my leave.

159
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Take care.

160
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:55,960
See him off.

161
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,600
Good.

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,880
From now on,

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,680
the atmosphere of our mansion will be very lively.

164
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,880
That's great.

165
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Congratulations, Mother.

166
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,530
Congratulations, Third Sister-in-law.

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,880
Mother.

168
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,220
Till now, Xizhao and Shaoyang haven't slept together yet.

169
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,440
Will that work?

170
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,360
Why can't it work?

171
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,360
Do you want to have a grandchild?

172
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Of course.

173
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,440
Xizhao.

174
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,159
Why did you walk so quietly?

175
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,010
That was because you were too focused.

176
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,000
So there's nothing to do in the Imperial City Division today?

177
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,330
You still have time to wander around here?

178
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,920
The credit for the previous case of the underground private bank

179
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,360
has offset the wrongdoing of escaping from the imperial prison.

180
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
Now I have nothing to do and have no burden.

181
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,960
You escaped from the prison in order to investigate the case, didn't you?

182
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,960
Why is His Majesty so petty-minded?

183
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,050
Honey, please mind your words.

184
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,600
Oh, by the way,

185
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,040
a few days ago,

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,000
I went to the Board of Astronomy.

187
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,280
Junior Director Zheng told me that

188
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,760
the occurrence of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun was really rare.

189
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
You're lucky, Honey.

190
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,060
You saw it once.

191
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
But no one knows

192
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,730
when it'll happen again next time.

193
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,600
I got it.

194
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,120
Thank you.

195
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,640
However,

196
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,840
as for the so-called original world you've mentioned,

197
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,299
what on earth does it mean?

198
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Nothing.

199
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,250
Now it's like something which happened in my previous life.

200
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,360
Actually, you can regard the capital

201
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,800
and the Marquis's Mansion as your own home.

202
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,220
Now I'm not able to go back.

203
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,290
In this life, as a woman,

204
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,480
I'll spend the rest of my life here with Lu Shaoyang.

205
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,280
I think it'll also be quite nice.

206
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,160
Xizhao.

207
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,980
No matter where you go,

208
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
I will always protect you.
