1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:14,640
Guards!

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,530
Take her down and throw her into the river.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,400
Old Madam.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,200
Young Madam has been with me all day

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,440
and never left the house.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
And she has never seen his nephew-in-law.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,400
Please investigate.

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,960
If she didn't have an affair with anyone,

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,920
how would others know the birthmark on her chest?

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,000
A simple examination

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,260
will reveal the truth.

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,480
Oh.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,920
Old Madam, look.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,330
The birthmark is exactly the same as the one in the painting.

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,800
So, you really did have an affair with him.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
What do you have to say for yourself?

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,920
He drew a birthmark and stamped my name.

19
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,480
Is he afraid that people wouldn’t know the person in the painting is me?

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,560
Based on just a painting,

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,120
you conclude that I have something to do with that person.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,520
You are shameless to falsely accuse me like this!

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,650
How dare you deny it?

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,080
Slap her!

25
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,520
Who made Mother so angry?

26
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,120
It’s this wretch.

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,560
I told you from the beginning

28
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,840
that I didn’t like Liu Xizhao,

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,200
but you insisted that I marry her.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,760
Now,

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,680
she’s made Mother this angry

32
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,640
I think it's better to poison her to mute,

33
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
and throw her out.

34
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,000
Divorcing her

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,530
means nothing to me.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,600
Lu Shaoyang.

37
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,080
You look decent.

38
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,940
I didn't expect you to be so crude.

39
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,039
I didn’t do anything.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,810
Why are you doing this to me?

41
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,520
Five days.

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,440
I'll give her five days

43
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,770
to prove her innocence.

44
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,080
If she can't,

45
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,479
I'll divorce her

46
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,640
and kick her out.

47
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,770
How could you...

48
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:53,680
Fine.

49
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,400
Five days it is.

50
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,080
This Marquis's Mansion is too dangerous.

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,740
None of you are kind-hearted.

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,520
I need to find a way to go back.

53
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
Is there a lake

54
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,480
in this place?

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,840
Yes.

56
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,880
Take me there.

57
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,440
Young Madam, are you going to jump into the lake again?

58
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,520
Why do you have so many questions?

59
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,120
Let's go.

60
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,750
Hurry up.

61
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,120
Don't pull me.

62
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,200
Young Madam.

63
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,320
Young Madam.

64
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,440
Young Madam, you can't die.

65
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,170
Young Madam.

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,320
Young Madam.

67
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,440
What should I do if you die?

68
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,720
Young Madam.

69
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,400
Young Madam.

70
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,520
Young Madam.

71
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,010
Young Madam.

72
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
Young Madam.

73
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,730
Young Madam, are you alright?

74
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,400
Young Madam, come up.

75
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,840
Young Madam, are you alright?

76
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,079
Why am I still here?

77
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,400
Did I not jump into the lake the right way?

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,400
Let's do it again.

79
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,250
Young Madam.

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,280
Even if the Marquis's Mansion is a place of danger,

81
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,640
I will be with you.

82
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,600
Please, just live well.

83
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,079
Why isn’t it working?

84
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,640
Bing.

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,640
I think I'm poisoned.

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,920
Young Madam.

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,840
Young Madam, are you alright?

88
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,570
Young Madam.

89
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,880
Young Madam.

90
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,640
Warm your belly.

91
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,280
And the pain will go away.

92
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,960
Young Madam,

93
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,920
you are not poisoned.

94
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,920
You’re just having your period.

95
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,640
It’s bad enough that I’ve transmigrated into a woman,

96
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,360
and now I even have to deal with… Oh.

97
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,280
Young Madam, you should take a good rest this time.

98
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,960
You are weak and have lost your memory.

99
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,600
You must take good care of yourself

100
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,260
to avoid any lasting illness.

101
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,000
What are you doing?

102
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,280
Helping you change clothes.

103
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,680
If you stay in wet clothes, you’ll get sick.

104
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:39,480
Bing.

105
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,360
From now on, you don’t need to help me

106
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,040
with things like changing clothes or bathing.

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,040
I can do it myself.

108
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,960
Why?

109
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,190
I’ve been taking care of you since childhood

110
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,480
Do you dislike me?

111
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,160
Why do you ask so many questions?

112
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,079
Anyway, you don't have to do it.

113
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,800
A person about to die

114
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,060
still needs someone to serve her.

115
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,760
Eat.

116
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,510
Stop!

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,680
Are you taking advantage of the situation?

118
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
Listen.

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Yan Xin and others will never succeed.

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,720
I won’t be drowned by them.

121
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm warning you now.

122
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,850
If you dare to disrespect me again,

123
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,440
I'll sell you out of the mansion

124
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,840
and sell you to a brothel,

125
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,360
so that you can never rise again.

126
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,420
Do you understand?

127
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,520
Young Madam.

128
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,400
I know I was wrong.

129
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,800
Please forgive me this once.

130
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I know I was wrong.

131
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,520
Please forgive me this once.

132
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,320
Young Madam.

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,340
Get out.

134
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,159
Thank you, Young Madam.

135
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,360
Excuse me.

136
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,530
What do you mean by that?

137
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,280
I'm talking to you.

138
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
Can’t you see someone is working here?

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,480
Move.

140
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,460
Yeah, working.

141
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,800
You...

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,120
All of you, come here!

143
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,880
Listen carefully.

144
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,360
I’m not someone you can

145
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,570
easily push around.

146
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,680
Behave yourselves from now on.

147
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,280
If anyone dares to mess with me again,

148
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,280
I'll break their legs and throw them into the latrine.

149
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,159
Understand?

150
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,560
Put less salt.

151
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,000
Young Madam Xin has a light palate.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes.

153
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
Cut the vegetables properly.

154
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,520
Also,

155
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,840
clean the water spinach

156
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,680
thoroughly.

157
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,440
Yes.

158
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,640
Mrs. Liu.

159
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,090
What food do we have now?

160
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,120
Our Young Madam hasn’t eaten in a long time.

161
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
She hasn’t even paid her respects to the Old Madam

162
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,660
and already she’s here to eat?

163
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,600
People from small families

164
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,960
don’t know the rules.

165
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Is this chicken soup?

166
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,730
Give it to me.

167
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,320
Some random person

168
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,120
dares to drink the chicken soup?

169
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:24,920
You should know

170
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,640
this soup

171
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,560
is specially prepared for Young Madam Shaolin.

172
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,420
How dare you think you’re worthy?

173
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,560
Just make do with it, Young Madam Shaoyang.

174
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,800
Get back to work. What are you looking at?

175
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,480
Yes.

176
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,480
Look at you.

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
Not thinking about doing your work

178
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,700
but only about how to bully your masters.

179
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,960
Will you dare to do it again?

180
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
No.

181
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,080
What are you staring at?

182
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,760
What...

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,590
Bing.

184
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
What happened to your face?

185
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,000
Mrs. Liu said you’re not worthy of drinking the chicken soup,

186
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,960
so she gave me a cabbage instead.

187
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,640
She even hit me.

188
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
She hit you?

189
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,080
If I don't teach them a lesson,

190
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm afraid I'll be bullied to death before I prove my innocence.

191
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,840
Where is Mrs. Liu?

192
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,690
Lead the way.

193
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,640
Oh.

194
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
Isn't this Young Madam Shaoyang?

195
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,970
What brings you to the kitchen?

196
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,320
Well,

197
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,760
I'm not blaming you.

198
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,320
As a newly married woman,

199
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,159
you've been having an affair with other men behind your husband’s back,

200
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:39,420
how do you even have the face to come to the kitchen for food?

201
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:53,280
Just because you’re wearing a tiger’s skin, you think you’re the king of beasts

202
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,800
and can bully anyone?

203
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,320
Today, I’ll show you

204
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,320
what kind of person I really am.

205
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:01,510
You...

206
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,560
How dare you!

207
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,680
I’ve served in this Marquis's Mansion for years,

208
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
Even the Old Madam

209
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,520
treats me with respect.

210
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,800
If you don't mess with me,

211
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,120
I won't provoke you.

212
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,880
But if you do,

213
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
I’ll make sure you suffer.

214
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,360
I...

215
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,000
I’ll go to the Old Madam and report you.

216
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,920
Report me?

217
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,049
Did you all see that?

218
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,760
Anyone who dares bully my people

219
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
will end up like this.

220
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,320
Bing.

221
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,280
Take the chicken soup.

222
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,809
Let's go.

223
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,400
Alright.

224
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,280
What are you looking at?

225
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,210
Get back to work.

226
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,800
Yes.

227
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,240
How dare

228
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,800
that little wretch!

229
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,000
How dare she

230
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
bully someone close to me!

231
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
If I let this slide,

232
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,440
the second and third young madams will laugh at me.

233
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,240
Cousin,

234
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,680
don't be angry.

235
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,730
Liu Xizhao is about to be drowned in a few days.

236
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,680
Why bother stooping to her level?

237
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,210
I'm the first daughter-in-law after all.

238
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,600
I can’t swallow this insult!

239
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,920
No.

240
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,520
I'll deal with her now.

241
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,120
Cousin.

242
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,200
Cousin.

243
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,000
I mean

244
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,640
if you teach her a lesson now,

245
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,040
people will gossip about you.

246
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,560
Are you saying

247
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,920
you have a plan?

248
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,520
Aren't you going to

249
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
pay respects to the Old Madam soon?

250
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,520
We can deal with her then.

251
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,760
You're so smart. I almost fell into her trap.

252
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,880
Come on, let’s plan this carefully.

253
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,920
You too, come over here.

254
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
What should we do?

255
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,600
I think...

256
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,280
I heard that Young Madam Shaoyang is crazy.

257
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,000
She just hit Mrs. Liu from Young Madam Shaolin’s courtyard.

258
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,930
I heard that too.

259
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,880
A servant accidentally bumped into her while sweeping,

260
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,480
and she nearly broke his leg.

261
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,840
Let's go.

262
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,440
Liu Xizhao

263
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,380
is getting more interesting.

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,280
You’re late in paying respects to Mother.

265
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,160
As soon as you come in, you’re looking around.

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,420
What are you scheming?

267
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,580
Did you hear me talking to you?

268
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,290
Young Madam.

269
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,000
quickly pay your respects to the Old Madam.

270
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,340
Greetings, Old Madam.

271
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,720
Xizhao, did you get hurt from falling into the water before?

272
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,400
Why are you acting so casually today?

273
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,120
Liu Xizhao.

274
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,730
You've caused so much trouble lately.

275
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,490
And now you’re showing such a lack of manners.

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,280
As the eldest sister-in-law,

277
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,800
I will teach you the rules of a noble family today.

278
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,490
First, go and serve Mother tea.

279
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,640
If it weren’t for your father saving the Old Marquis back then,

280
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,480
how could a lowborn like you

281
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,340
ever marry into our Marquis' family?

282
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,440
And yet you dared to have an affair with another man,

283
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,040
and cheat on Shaoyang.

284
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,520
Now all the servants in the marquis’ mansion know about it.

285
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,780
If this spreads throughout the capital,

286
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,460
where would that leave the reputation of the Marquis’ family?

287
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,640
The tea isn’t even full yet, and you can’t hold it properly.

288
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,360
Do you think you’re fit to be Young Madam Shaoyang

289
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
when you can’t even hold a cup of tea?

290
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Should you go in and stop this?

291
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,220
Let’s wait and see.

292
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh.

293
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
I'm sorry.

294
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,410
It's too hot.

295
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,330
How dare you!

296
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,600
You wretch!

297
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,300
How arrogant and disrespectful you are!

298
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,880
You hit me again.

299
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,560
Don't think I dare not hit women.

300
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,640
Looks like I didn't teach you enough.

301
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,440
I...

302
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:02,960
You...

303
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,240
You...

304
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,160
How dare you push me!

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
Old Madam! Young Madam Shaolin!

306
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,520
Our Young Madam fell into the water and lost her memory.

307
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,960
Please

308
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,200
have mercy on her.

309
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,520
If you show me an inch of respect, I’ll give you a mile.

310
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,400
But if you dare impose your useless rules on me

311
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,360
and make things difficult,

312
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,690
I’ll make you regret it.

313
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Mother.

314
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Did you hear what she just said?

315
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,400
This is outrageous!

316
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,560
If this gets out,

317
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,480
what will happen to the reputation of our Marquis’ family?

318
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:29,960
Bing.

319
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,080
Let's go.

320
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,720
Stop!

321
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,000
Guards!

322
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:35,960
Yes.

323
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,440
Liu Xizhao.

324
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,440
It concerns the reputation of the Marquis’ family.

325
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,960
I will not tolerate it.

326
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,780
If you can't prove your innocence tomorrow,

327
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,840
I will have you drowned immediately.
