00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,220
Are you looking for me?

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,220
Aren't you looking for me?

4
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,360
It seems someone set this up on purpose.

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,490
Why don’t we just have a meal together?

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,400
You should have some food too.

7
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:48,960
Okay.

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,560
Before,

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,830
I always had some prejudices against her.

10
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,360
But if it weren't for her,

11
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,120
our family wouldn't be as harmonious as it is today.

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,720
She even saved my life.

13
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,960
From now on,

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,760
if anyone dares to bully her again,

15
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,160
I won’t let it go easily.

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,560
What are you talking about?

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,080
As if any of us ever bullied her.

18
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,960
Eldest Sister-in-law. How dare you say that?

19
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,020
Can't I just say it?

20
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,600
It’s clear

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,260
this was prepared for us by the sisters-in-law.

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,520
Here.

23
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,200
Thank you.

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,680
Lu Shaoyang.

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,240
I made the wine.

26
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,680
Then let's

27
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
drink this today.

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,000
Here.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,530
Let's get drunk!

30
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,410
Let's get drunk!

31
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,360
One more.

32
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Look.

33
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,560
In the world of martial arts,

34
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
who doesn’t get hurt?

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,160
Two strikes to kill you!

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,560
Four strikes to kill you!

37
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,280
You lost.

38
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,840
Four strikes to kill you!

39
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,079
Two strikes to kill you!

40
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,120
One strike to kill you!

41
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,160
Four strikes to kill you!

42
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,760
Drink!

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,060
I’m going to play a proper round with you now.

44
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,800
In the world of martial arts,

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,880
who doesn’t get hurt?

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,210
Two strikes to kill you!

47
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,280
Drink.

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,840
I lost.

49
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,760
You're amazing.

50
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,450
Half a cup is enough.

51
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Let go.

52
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,740
Stop drinking.

53
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,600
Let me tell you.

54
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,800
This wine…

55
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,850
Look at them.

56
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,800
Lu Shaoyang.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,760
Do you know

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,360
how hard it’s been for me

59
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,920
since I came here?

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,720
Darling.

61
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,980
I will take care of you.

62
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,370
You won’t have to struggle like this anymore.

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
What did you say?

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,400
Let me tell you.

65
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,200
From now on,

66
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
you have to

67
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,000
love me properly.

68
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Got it?

69
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,560
Let's go.

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,480
Come on.

71
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,840
Bring everything inside.

72
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,560
Put them here.

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
Take down

74
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,430
these curtains.

75
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,830
The color can be changed.

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:10,640
Yes.

77
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,040
Put a rack here.

78
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,520
Fourth Young Master’s clothes can go here.

79
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,400
You’re awake?

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,080
Eldest Sister-in-law.

81
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,010
Why are you here?

82
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,120
You’ve been working hard for the mansion lately,

83
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,160
so mother has rewarded you with many good things.

84
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,490
She asked me to come and help set things up.

85
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,010
Thank you, Eldest Sister-in-law.

86
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,340
How are things with you and Shaoyang?

87
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Things between us

88
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
aren’t exactly what you all think.

89
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,520
Is Shaoyang not treating you well?

90
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,120
No.

91
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,880
He actually...

92
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
Darling, do you think

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,720
there’s something I’m not doing well enough?

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,480
I can change.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,760
No.

96
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,920
I think you did very well.

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,800
Very well.

98
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,040
Very well.

99
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,040
That's good.

100
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:51,840
Mother also

101
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
rewarded you with some clothes.

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,380
Come on.

103
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,150
Try them on.

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,840
Look at this color, isn’t it beautiful?

105
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,240
Eldest Sister-in-law.

106
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,960
I’ll try it on later.

107
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,200
Just try it on.

108
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,770
I have a terrible headache.

109
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,320
Eldest Sister-in-law.

110
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Is it inconvenient because there are too many people around?

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:07,920
Alright.

112
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,840
I’ll leave it here.

113
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,080
You can try it on later.

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,610
Let's go.

115
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,220
I'll make you some hangover soup.

116
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,760
Be careful.

117
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,560
Take this.

118
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,210
This will be useful.

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
Handle that one gently.

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,810
Alright.

121
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,970
Second Young Madam.

122
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,300
What are you doing?

123
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,220
Aren’t these all Shaoyang’s things?

124
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
I’m just helping him move them back to Xizhao’s room.

125
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,800
Be careful.

126
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,840
Yes.

127
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,720
I'll help too.

128
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,640
Be careful.

129
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,800
What should I do?

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,240
We are not a legitimate couple.

131
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,540
Do I really need to consummate with Lu Shaoyang?

132
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,570
Fourth Young Madam.

133
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,960
The Old Madam has summoned you.

134
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,400
Got it.

135
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,460
Look at this embroidery pattern.

136
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,520
Mother.

137
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
You want to see me?

138
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,120
Look.

139
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,730
This little garment

140
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,570
is so lovely.

141
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,200
What do they mean?

142
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,120
Are they asking me to have a child?

143
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,000
No way.

144
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,680
Xizhao.

145
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,840
You’ve been here for a while.

146
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,780
If Shaoyang still doesn’t want to live with you,

147
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,050
you must let me know.

148
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,960
Mother.

149
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,760
That’s not true.

150
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,600
Shaoyang isn’t unwilling.

151
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,880
Then

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,360
has he upset you?

153
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
I’ll go deal with him right now.

154
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,760
Mother.

155
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,610
You misunderstand.

156
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,600
Shaoyang is very good to me.

157
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,530
Then when are you

158
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
going to give me

159
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
a grandchild?

160
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,060
My Lord.

161
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,860
It's ready.

162
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,320
This is it.

163
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,320
How do I look?

164
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,360
My Lord. You look handsome.

165
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,289
It inspires deep admiration in your humble servant.

166
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,240
Not bad with the flattery.

167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,100
But you shouldn’t misuse idioms.

168
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,780
You speak wisely, My Lord.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,800
Darling.

170
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,770
Don't come over.

171
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,090
Darling.

172
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,520
I have something to tell you.

173
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,780
Then speak from there.

174
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,930
Darling.

175
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,320
The bracelet from before was broken.

176
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,850
But I know you treasured it.

177
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,960
Though it couldn’t be restored,

178
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,160
I made a wind chime from it for you.

179
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,520
I hope it brings you

180
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,040
some comfort when you see it.

181
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,440
We should have exchanged tokens of affection

182
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
before marriage.

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,000
But we ended up doing things in reverse.

184
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,780
Today, I use it as a substitute

185
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,280
for the token I owed you on our wedding day.

186
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Shaoyang.

187
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,250
Thank you for doing all this for me.

188
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,280
Are you not happy?

189
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Are you still upset with me for neglecting you before?

190
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,560
You didn’t neglect me.

191
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
It’s the Old Madam.

192
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,130
She wants a grandchild.

193
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,220
Don’t you want one?

194
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
I know in the past

195
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
I was wild and reckless, and I hurt you.

196
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,440
I apologize for that today.

197
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,650
It’s not your fault.

198
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,360
It's

199
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,800
my own problem.

200
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Darling. Why do you say that?

201
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Actually,

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,060
I’m not the same Liu Xizhao as before.

203
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,200
I know.

204
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,400
Through this time I’ve spent getting to know you,

205
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sure

206
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,250
I prefer who you are now.

207
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,360
Shaoyang.

208
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,100
You’re wonderful.

209
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,520
It’s just that

210
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,090
I don’t know how to face you.

211
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,320
Xizhao!

212
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,520
He’s awake.

213
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,400
Mr. Liu.

214
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,360
Mr. Liu.

215
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:06,720
Mr. Liu.

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,200
Mr. Liu.

217
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,400
You're awake.

218
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,240
It felt like a dream.

219
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,480
Your blood pressure and temperature are normal.

220
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,240
You’re fine.

221
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,040
Nice to meet you.

222
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,320
I’m your attending physician,

223
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,960
Lu Shaoyang.
