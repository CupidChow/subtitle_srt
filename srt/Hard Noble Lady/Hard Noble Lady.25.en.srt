00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,640
Uncle.

3
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,650
Fourth Brother.

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,400
Father.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,420
We need to get to the next posthouse before dark.

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,160
The mountain roads have been quite challenging these days.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,080
We should set out as soon as possible.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:32,880
Okay.

9
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,720
Tell everyone

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,800
we'll set out immediately.

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,600
Okay.

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,380
Protect the fleet!

13
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:09,039
You bandits,

14
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,120
die now!

15
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,360
Father.

16
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,920
Father and Shaoyang are not in the mansion.

17
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,650
The mansion looks quite empty.

18
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,240
I don't know why

19
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,560
I feel uneasy.

20
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
It's like...

21
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,480
something happened.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,320
Where has His Lordship arrived?

23
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,040
Father sent a letter yesterday.

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,600
He said it would take a few more days to get there.

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,200
Mother, you must feel uneasy

26
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,980
because the weather is muggy.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,560
Don't worry too much.

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,200
Where is Xizhao?

29
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,840
She said she is not feeling well,

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
so she wouldn't come out.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,760
I guess... she misses Fourth Brother.

32
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,680
The weather is changing.

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,040
It seems today is indeed the day

34
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,970
of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun.

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,680
Did you just say

36
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,480
Marquis Lu was attacked on his way to escort the provisions and funds

37
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,840
and the provisions and funds have been taken?

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,200
Calm down, Your Majesty.

39
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,480
His Lordship wanted to come back to report as soon as possible,

40
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,520
so he took a route in a forest he had never taken before.

41
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,920
I couldn't persuade him.

42
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,600
I could only protect him in secret.

43
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,040
But... we were still ambushed.

44
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,120
Besides, the guards were not familiar with the terrain,

45
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,120
so the bandits took advantage of us.

46
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
I'm guilty of negligence.

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,720
Please punish me, Your Majesty.

48
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,520
Ridiculous!

49
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,390
Military provisions and funds are so important.

50
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,400
How could Marquis Lu be so careless?

51
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,560
Your Majesty,

52
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Marquis Lu lost the provisions and funds

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,490
and jeopardized the war at the border.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,640
This matter must be handled carefully.

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,200
And we should figure something out to make up for it.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,460
Otherwise, the morale will be destroyed

57
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,880
and we might lose cities.

58
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,519
Your Majesty, please give an order as soon as possible

59
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,920
to stabilize the morale.

60
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,320
Pass my order.

61
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,240
Marquis of Changping failed in escorting the provisions and funds

62
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,120
and jeopardized the war at the border.

63
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
Ask the Ministry of Justice to handle the case

64
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,000
and punish him according to the law

65
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,080
as a warning.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,280
Yes.

67
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
Shaoyang,

68
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm the commander responsible for escorting the provisions and funds.

69
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,320
Remember,

70
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,290
don't say anything stupid.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,000
Father,

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,100
the dungeon is dark and humid.

73
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,560
Can you stand it?

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,240
I'm fine.

75
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
But I'm afraid Marquis's Mansion

76
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,120
is going to suffer.

77
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,960
I wonder what the situation in the mansion is.

78
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,440
With Xizhao and Mother in the mansion,

79
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,840
everything will be fine.

80
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,120
Right,

81
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,080
where is Shaozhen?

82
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,010
How is Shaozhen?

83
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,390
Shaoyang.

84
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:18,920
Move!

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:20,560
Move!

86
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,440
Shaoyang!

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,320
Your Highness,

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,800
you have finally taken care of Marquis of Changping's Mansion.

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,080
Lu Shaozhen is indeed useful.

90
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,200
His Majesty already ordered

91
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,760
the Ministry of Justice to handle the case.

92
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,600
I

93
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,030
already told Lord Qin of the Ministry of Justice

94
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,120
what you said.

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,120
This time, everyone in Marquis of Changping's Mansion

96
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,600
will be put in prison.

97
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,960
Even if all of them will be put in prison,

98
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,320
it can't relieve the hatred in my heart.

99
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,320
Of course.

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,400
The solar eclipse is finally happening.

101
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,800
I can go back now.

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,920
Qingshan?

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,080
Why are you here?

104
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,600
I'm not trying to drown myself.

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
I have something very important to do.

106
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,180
Young Madam, bad news.

107
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,080
Nothing else is more important than what I want to do now.

108
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,810
Young Madam,

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,560
His lordship and Marquis have been put in prison.

110
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,320
His Majesty gave an order

111
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,640
to confiscate Marquis's Mansion.

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,570
What did you say?

113
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,159
The provisions and funds were taken halfway.

114
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,400
His lordship and Marquis have been put in prison.

115
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Now the soldiers have started to confiscate the mansion and arrest people.

116
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Shaoyang has been put in prison.

117
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,320
Marquis's Mansion is going to be confiscated.

118
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,120
Should I leave

119
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:15,920
or not?

120
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,040
Young Madam.

121
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,400
Fourth Sister.

122
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Xizhao.

123
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,280
Fourth Sister.

124
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,750
Fourth Sister.

125
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,480
Xizhao.

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,280
Don't let anyone go!

127
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,000
Take all of them back!

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,400
Mother.

129
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Why are you arresting people in Marquis's Mansion?

130
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,920
Old Madam,

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,320
we're here to confiscate the mansion under His Majesty's order.

132
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,120
Sorry.

133
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,320
Take them away.

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,980
-Yes!
-Yes!

135
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,600
Wait.

136
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Shaozhen,

137
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,800
why are you back alone?

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,920
Where are His Lordship

139
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,960
and Shaoyang?

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,200
What on earth happened?

141
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,040
Can't you see

142
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,360
what happened?

143
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,160
Confiscating Marquis's Mansion

144
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,490
is His Majesty's order!

145
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
I just honestly

146
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,410
reported his guilt to His Majesty.

147
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,010
I was just being impartial.

148
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
Now,

149
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,280
His Majesty has rewarded me with this mansion.

150
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
Looks like if I want to be successful,

151
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,740
I should still rely on myself.

152
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,640
Lu Shaozhen,

153
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,880
we treated you well.

154
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,150
Why did you do that?

155
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,840
You treated me well?

156
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,919
His Lordship doesn't trust me at all.

157
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,919
Shaozhen,

158
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,120
how could you be so shameless?

159
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,880
I don't care what you say.

160
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,040
For old times' sake,

161
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I will take good care of the mansion.

162
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,440
I knew you are ungrateful long ago.

163
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,920
But I didn't expect you to be so cruel!

164
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,720
Big Brother,

165
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,400
sorry.

166
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm afraid the title of marquis

167
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,520
will be mine.

168
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,000
You...

169
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,640
Lu Shaozhen,

170
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
you bastard!

171
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,440
Mother.

172
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,360
Old Madam.

173
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,480
Mother.

174
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,320
So,

175
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,480
you are the evilest person.

176
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
Shut up.

177
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,280
Now everyone is here, right?

178
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,960
Guards,

179
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,560
take all of them away!

180
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,040
I'm here to deliver Her Majesty's oral order.

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,280
Marquis of Changping's Mansion is guilty of losing the provisions and funds.

182
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,680
However, His Majesty and Her Majesty pity the women in the mansion

183
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,160
because they didn't make any serious mistake.

184
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,480
So, the women don't have to be put in prison

185
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,800
and should wait for your punishments.
