1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,250
Young Madam,

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,260
please come in.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,800
Young Madam,

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,210
get some rest early.

6
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,480
The conditions in the mountains are quite basic,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,210
so please make do for the night.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,630
You two,

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,270
stand guard at the courtyard gate

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,240
and ensure the Fourth Young Madam's safety.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,100
Did you hear me?

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:32,920
Yes.

13
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,400
Young Madam,

14
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,230
get some rest.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,510
He said it's for protection,

16
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,240
but it's really just surveillance.

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,120
The grain he embezzled

18
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,640
is probably still hidden in the estate.

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,040
Thanks to the rain over the past few days,

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,680
the grain hasn’t been transported out yet.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,140
With your sudden arrival,

22
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,490
he was caught off guard.

23
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,410
From the tenant contracts we collected earlier,

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,340
there are over a hundred households in this estate.

25
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,980
Roughly estimating the labor force,

26
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,360
he must have embezzled more than half of the grain harvest.

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,560
So much grain?

28
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,440
We’ve inspected the estate but haven’t found it.

29
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,840
Where could it be hidden?

30
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,760
We haven’t checked the haunted house.

31
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,880
From the inspection just now,

32
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,910
there are at least three other abandoned houses

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,110
like the haunted one.

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
Qingshan.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,880
Yes.

36
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,320
I have a task for you.

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,120
Did anything happen?

38
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,420
Don’t worry, Bailiff.

39
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,640
We've been keeping a close eye on them.

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,600
They've been in the courtyard the whole time

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,660
and never came out.

42
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,440
Okay.

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Keep a close eye on them.

44
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:43,960
Yes.

45
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,080
Go and check

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,759
what happened.

47
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,120
Hmm.

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,130
Young Madam.

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,160
Qingshan,

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,120
well done.

51
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,079
Young Madam,

52
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,810
you go first.

53
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,920
I'll deal with them first

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,880
and catch up soon.

55
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,760
Be careful.

56
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,130
Okay.

57
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:17,640
Why can't I push this door open? It's not even locked.

58
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,290
Bing, what's wrong?

59
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm scared.

60
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,320
Scared?

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,880
What are you scared of?

62
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,680
There's no such thing as ghosts.

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,920
Why does this basin

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,920
look like it's welded to the ground?

65
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,560
So much grain?

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,440
It's not grain.

67
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,640
It's silver.

68
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,680
Young Madam,

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,880
why must you push us so hard?

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,800
Can’t you just turn a blind eye?

71
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,440
Bailiff Wu,

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,850
you've withheld so much grain.

73
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,600
You're truly wicked.

74
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,159
Does the Marquis's Mansion really lack this bit of money?

75
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,890
Young Madam,

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,720
you're newly in charge

77
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,200
and still establishing yourself.

78
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,120
What good does it do you

79
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,000
to make things difficult for us old bailiffs?

80
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
When I entered the estate, you were already here playing tricks,

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,400
trying to keep me away.

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,960
And when I came to inspect the estate today,

83
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,760
you got the news right away.

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,320
Quite fast.

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,400
Yes.

86
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,760
I've been at the Marquis's Mansion

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,960
longer than you have.

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,600
Xuanqing Estate

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,860
clearly has over 100 tenant households,

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,160
but you reported only about 20 to the Marquis's Mansion.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,400
You took the harvests from the remaining eighty-some households

92
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,260
and sold them for your own profit.

93
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,160
What a good plan.

94
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,130
Young Madam,

95
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,100
you are a smart person.

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,680
Why don't we split it evenly?

97
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,270
From now on,

98
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
we can share the profits fifty-fifty each year.

99
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
What do you think?

100
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,080
This was how you and Yan Xin split the profit before, right?

101
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,240
No wonder the Marquis's Mansion couldn’t find out.

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Young Madam,

103
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,680
I advise you to think it through.

104
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,760
You’re all alone.

105
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,440
In this remote place,

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,120
if something happens to you,

107
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,130
no one would be able to save you.

108
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,490
What are you going to do?

109
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,280
Bailiff Wu,

110
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,600
you must be tired of living to dare offend your master!

111
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,330
Do you think the two of you women

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,240
can take on the three of us?

113
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,640
Get them!

114
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,280
Why are you here?

115
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,280
Now, do you think you alone

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,680
can take on the four of us?

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,080
Fourth Young Master?

118
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,280
Fourth Young Master!

119
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,680
Please spare my life!

120
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,159
Honey, you’re so brave.

121
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,960
You actually dared to venture so deep into danger

122
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,360
and remain unflustered.

123
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,840
Since you’re here, just follow my lead.

124
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,760
Me following your lead?

125
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
Since there's an issue with Xuanqing Estate,

126
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,200
it's likely that the nearby farms have problems too.

127
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,960
Send people to inspect the nearby farms overnight

128
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,440
and directly search for hidden grain.

129
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,440
Once we find the embezzled grain,

130
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,240
everything will be much simpler.

131
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,560
I rushed over on horseback to save you,

132
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,600
and before I could even take a sip of tea,

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,530
you're already ordering me around as your enforcer?

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,730
You're a man.

135
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,360
What’s with the whining?

136
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,460
A little hardship won’t kill you.

137
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,960
Do you think Qingshan can handle this alone?

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,790
With Xuanqing Estate taken down,

139
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,920
the other bailiffs

140
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,040
shouldn’t dare be so bold.

141
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,960
Luckily you came.

142
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
Otherwise, I really wouldn’t have known

143
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,980
if I could handle Bailiff Wu on my own.

144
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
It's getting late.

145
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,560
Young Master, Young Madam, please rest early.

146
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,640
Then let's make do tonight and share a room.

147
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,320
You're not shy.

148
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,920
What I mean is, I'll take the bed,

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,659
and you can sleep on the floor.

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,180
My Lord,

151
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,720
you can rest assured and return to investigate the underground private bank case.

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,650
Leave this to me.

153
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,360
Make sure to protect her.

154
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,360
Take care, My Lord.

155
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,120
I will protect Young Madam.

156
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,320
Okay.

157
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,880
We want to see the Fourth Young Madam!

158
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,240
I've been at the Marquis's Mansion for most of my life.

159
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
I may not have made any contributions, but I’ve endured many hardships.

160
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,720
You actually came in the middle of the night to inspect the estates.

161
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,919
Since you don't trust us,

162
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,850
we'll just quit!

163
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,320
Yes!

164
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:35,960
We quit!

165
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Yes!

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,880
We quit!

167
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,400
Qingshan,

168
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,450
let him talk.

169
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,919
We're all relatives of the Marquis's Mansion.

170
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,650
The Marquis watched me grow up,

171
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,720
and the Marquis's Mansion has never treated me so harshly before.

172
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,040
When Old Madam was in charge,

173
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
we were never treated like this.

174
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,680
Qingshan,

175
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,120
how much grain did you find from other estates last night?

176
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Young Madam,

177
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,070
last night I searched three estates.

178
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,960
Each one, like Xuanqing Estate,

179
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,440
had over a hundred thousand catties of grain hidden away.

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,080
Nonsense!

181
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
That's not hidden grain.

182
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,400
That's unsold grain.

183
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,000
We planned to sell it

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,040
and then hand over the money.

185
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,720
How dare you accuse us of hoarding!

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,280
Shut up!

187
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,040
Stop twisting the facts!

188
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
You must be the new Young Madam in charge, right?

189
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,520
Searching the estates and tying people up—

190
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,280
so unreasonable and overbearing.

191
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,080
Fine,

192
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
we quit.

193
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,680
Since you like inspecting estates so much,

194
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,840
then go ahead and lead the tenants

195
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,440
to work the fields yourself.

196
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,400
Qingshan,

197
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,780
get the documents.

198
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,530
Have them sign and get lost.

199
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:28,960
Yes.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
Do you really think

201
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,480
I can't find capable people other than you?
