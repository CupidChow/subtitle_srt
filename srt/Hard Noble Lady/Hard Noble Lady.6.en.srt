1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,720
Young Madam, please don't sneak out of the mansion.

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,400
The Third Young Madam's villa is quite enjoyable.

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,240
No need.

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,400
Let's go there.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,760
What's so interesting about a villa?

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:21,600
Don't try to deceive me.

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,400
Well, there's a Cuiwei Pavilion made of Zhennan wood.

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,120
Fine.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,900
Let's go there and take a look.

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,140
Did he steal something from the mansion?

12
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,100
We'd better not get involved.

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,720
Let's go.

14
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,880
Well,

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,540
how's the renovation of Cuiwei Pavilion going?

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,480
Don't worry, Xin.

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,440
I've arranged for people

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,640
to paint over the inferior wood.

19
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,080
No one will notice.

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,720
You always have a way.

21
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,879
Eldest Young Madam, bad news!

22
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,320
Someone splashed something

23
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,880
on Fourth Young Madam's face.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,010
Her face was ruined.

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,400
Was it just now?

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,640
What?

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,039
Who had the audacity to do that?

28
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:18,480
Where did it happen?

29
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,650
At Cuiwei Pavilion.

30
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,570
What we did to Cuiwei Pavilion won't be exposed, will it?

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,160
Eldest Young Madam,

32
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,400
something serious happened in the mansion.

33
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,130
His Lordship asked for you to go to the front hall.

34
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,560
Xin,

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,960
since His Lordship needs to see you,

36
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,920
I'll take my leave for now.

37
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,240
Wait a moment.

38
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
His Lordship

39
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,440
wants Miss Lin to go as well.

40
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,440
Ma'am,

41
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,240
may I go to the inner room

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,160
to get a sachet?

43
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,570
Please be quick.

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,160
Chuchu.

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,160
Miss Lin,

46
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,320
are you done?

47
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,920
His Lordship is waiting.

48
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,480
Mrs. Zhang,

49
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,610
please lead the way.

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
Let's go.

51
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,120
Let's go.

52
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,640
How is Xizhao?

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,060
The doctor said her life is not in danger.

54
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,210
But it seems her face

55
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
can't be saved.

56
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,120
So many things have happened in the mansion lately.

57
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,560
How have you been managing this household?

58
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,400
I've already had every courtyard in the mansion sealed

59
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,920
and sent Shaozhen and his men to investigate Cuiwei Pavilion.

60
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,780
They will surely find out who ruined Xizhao's face.

61
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,320
Master.

62
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,600
Old Madam,

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,010
I've brought them here.

64
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,840
From now on,

65
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,980
you'll stay in the front hall.

66
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,090
Once we have leads on the disfigurement case,

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,000
we'll let you go.

68
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,250
Young Master Shaozhen is here.

69
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,850
Young Master Shaozhen.

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,680
Young Master Shaozhen.

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,140
The mansion is sealed now.

72
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,579
None of you can escape.

73
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,280
Who ruined the Fourth Young Madam's face?

74
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,600
It's better to confess now.

75
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,590
If I find out myself later,

76
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,240
it will be too late

77
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,160
to speak.

78
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,840
What are you two here for?

79
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,400
You look unfamiliar.

80
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,400
Step forward and answer!

81
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,090
Raise your head.

82
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,970
Raise your head!

83
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,380
Why is there gold paint in the bucket?

84
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,160
Guards,

85
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,600
drag these two out

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
and give them 20 strokes of the cane.

87
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,519
Young Master,

88
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,560
please spare us.

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,040
Say it.

90
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,250
What's going on?

91
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,240
We were hired by the Eldest Young Madam to refurbish Cuiwei Pavilion.

92
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,900
The wood of Cuiwei Pavilion had faded over time.

93
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,780
The Eldest Young Madam told us

94
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,600
to paint the columns and balustrades

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,860
with gold paint when no one was watching.

96
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,570
But Cuiwei Pavilion was made of Zhennan wood.

97
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,760
Why would it need to be painted?

98
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,680
The wood used to build Cuiwei Pavilion

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,080
was of inferior quality.

100
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,620
To deceive people,

101
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,810
we had to use gold paint to make it look like Zhennan wood.

102
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,840
Eldest Sister actually dared to pass off inferior materials as the real thing.

103
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,200
Young Master Shaozhen,

104
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,440
The Fourth Young Madam wants to talk to you about the real culprit.

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,840
Okay.

106
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:04,810
This way.

107
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
With so many people,

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,170
we can't even catch the assailant.

109
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
My Lord, please calm down.

110
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,320
There really isn't any sign of the assailant in the mansion right now.

111
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,780
They must have escaped in the chaos earlier.

112
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,810
It looks like they haven't found out about Cuiwei Pavilion.

113
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,560
You may go back now.

114
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Shaozhen, keep investigating.

115
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,760
Yes.

116
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,440
Miss Lin.

117
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
Is the carriage ready?

118
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,600
Don't worry, Miss Lin.

119
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,560
I've arranged everything.

120
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,560
You can leave now.

121
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,920
Okay, I got it.

122
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,200
Keep your mouth shut.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:09,520
Yes.

124
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,240
Don't let anyone know what I asked you to do.

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,160
Yes.

126
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,840
Miss Lin!

127
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:20,840
It's you?

128
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,640
Take this vial of potion

129
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,390
and find an opportunity to splash it on the Fourth Young Madam's face.

130
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,050
You'll be richly rewarded once the task is done.

131
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,640
Yes.

132
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,880
You made me cause such a big mess.

133
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,840
You have to help me escape.

134
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,640
Leaving now

135
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,810
would only confirm your guilt.

136
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,650
Why don't you stay here quietly for a few days?

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,120
Miss.

138
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
What about the promised reward?

139
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,320
Shouldn't you give it to me now?

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,800
Miss Lin.

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Come with me.

142
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,600
What happened?

143
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
Look at what your cousin has done.

144
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,720
Lin Chuchu,

145
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,840
even though our families are connected by marriage,

146
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,770
you harmed the Fourth Young Madam.

147
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,640
I will have to have you arrested.

148
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,800
My Lord, why am I being arrested?

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,480
Shaozhen has already caught you and the servant.

150
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,140
What else is there to explain?

151
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,360
Xin,

152
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
at this point,

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,920
I can't keep hiding it for you.

154
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,360
My Lord,

155
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,920
it was Xin who asked me to do all these things.

156
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,080
I...

157
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,970
Who exactly asked you to harm the Fourth Young Madam?

158
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,160
It was Miss Lin and her maid who contacted me.

159
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
My Lord,

160
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,560
Xin did ask me to send a bottle

161
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,620
of anti-evil potion to this servant.

162
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
Don't worry, Xin.

163
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,680
I'll do as you say

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,260
and use the potion to remove the dark magic from Liu Xizhao.

165
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
But I didn't know

166
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,800
it was to

167
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,320
destroy the Fourth Young Madam's face.

168
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,530
Besides,

169
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,560
I have no grudge against her.

170
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,000
Why would I want to harm her?

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,080
So you're saying

172
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,919
all this was done by your cousin?

173
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,159
Yes.

174
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,320
You...

175
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
I've been planning everything for you.

176
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,480
And now, this is how you repay me?

177
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
How could you do this to me?

178
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,280
Xin,

179
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,280
even if you have grievances against the Fourth Young Madam,

180
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,400
you shouldn't have used me like this.

181
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
I've already covered up the matter of the naked painting for you.

182
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,970
What do you mean?

183
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
My Lord,

184
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,700
the Baiqi incense used in the naked painting

185
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,680
was bought by Mrs. Liu under Xin's orders.

186
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,720
Mrs. Liu

187
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,760
was just a scapegoat.

188
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,080
Bitch!

189
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,520
You've washed your hands of this.

190
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,380
But weren't you the one who incited me to do all this?

191
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,040
Father, Mother,

192
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,800
I was incited by her.

193
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,480
I was just used by her!

194
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,280
My Lord!

195
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
I'm just a distant relative of the Marquis's Mansion.

196
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,600
Who would listen to me in the entire mansion?

197
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,520
Xin,

198
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,090
since you're framing me like this,

199
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,400
I have no choice but to prove my innocence with my death.

200
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,840
Save it!

201
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,400
Father,

202
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,840
all these years

203
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
I've been managing the household affairs.

204
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,640
I may not have made any contributions, but I've endured many hardships.

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Please don't believe this little wretch's words.

206
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:47,600
She...

207
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,210
She is...

208
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,770
She's been inciting me.

209
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,790
She's always been inciting me.

210
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,600
Managing the household affairs?

211
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,240
You've managed it very well.

212
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,520
Let me ask you:

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Why was gold paint

214
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,080
used to repair Cuiwei Pavilion?

215
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,800
Zhennan wood rots

216
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,520
when exposed to paint.

217
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,120
How can you repair it with paint?

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,690
It was your pampered daughter-in-law

219
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,360
who replaced the Zhennan wood

220
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,090
with inferior wood in building Cuiwei Pavilion.

221
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,930
The money for the purchases

222
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,760
must have gone straight into her pocket long ago.

223
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,920
Xin,

224
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,120
is this true?

225
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,400
I've been treating you well.

226
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,800
Even though you've made mistakes many times,

227
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,460
I haven't held it against you.

228
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,100
And yet, you dare to embezzle in a task

229
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,160
appointed by the Noble Consort?

230
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,190
Mother,

231
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,800
it was Lin Chuchu who asked me to do it.

232
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,530
I wouldn't have dared to pass off inferior goods myself.

233
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,960
It was all her idea!

234
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,720
You!

235
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Xin!

236
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,840
How long are you going to accuse me falsely?

237
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
How could an outsider

238
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,040
like me possibly have any control over you?

239
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,800
You...

240
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,640
It might not be a false accusation.
