1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,440
Xizhao.

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,400
Don't worry.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,680
I will handle Bing's matter.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,040
It's a blessing for Bing

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,840
to have Your Majesty's help.

7
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,440
It's her fortune

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,840
to have a master like you.

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,400
What happened today

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,080
scared me.

11
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,320
Your Majesty.

12
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,160
You must be very careful from now on.

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,280
Your Majesty. If you want to drink,

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,120
let me know.

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,920
I will have someone from the Marquis's Mansion deliver it to you right away.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,720
Xizhao.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,960
Come to the palace more often

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,280
and chat with me.

19
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,600
I don't know why,

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,880
but I like your personality.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,110
You're straightforward

22
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,240
and genuine.

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,120
It's getting late.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,760
I should get some rest.

25
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,960
Farewell, Your Majesty.

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,120
Xizhao.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,000
You were too bold today.

28
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,720
Do you know how dangerous what you did was?

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,800
Mother.

30
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,440
I had no choice today.

31
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,000
Fortunately, Bing held her own.

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
Young Madam, I was actually terrified.

33
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,250
My legs were trembling.

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,920
Don't be afraid. It's all over.

35
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,440
You

36
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,280
don't have to marry that eunuch.

37
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,520
Your Highness, watch your step.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,170
Lu Shaoyang.

39
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,280
Why didn't you tell me earlier

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,410
that Noble Consort Jia and Song Huan look exactly alike?

41
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,080
They are sisters.

42
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,100
What's so strange about that?

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,850
Then do you think

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,160
it’s possible that what I saw

45
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
that day was actually Noble Consort Jia and Huang Xin?

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,360
If that's the case,

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,040
many things would make sense.

48
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,920
Yes.

49
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
If what I saw that day was Noble Consort Jia,

50
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,840
then Third Sister-in-law is innocent.

51
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,170
She was taking the blame for someone else.

52
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,290
So the real mastermind behind the underground private bank is Noble Consort Jia.

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,640
My Lord.

54
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,770
Huang Xin committed suicide in the imperial prison.

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,000
Huan.

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,900
I brought you your favorite lotus pastries.

57
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
We've divorced.

58
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,410
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,560
Huan.

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
I will always wait for you.

61
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
I don't believe you did all this.

62
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,040
I don't want to see you.

63
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,720
Leave.

64
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,720
Huan,

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
you are so kind.

66
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,579
You wouldn't do these things.

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,440
Tell me

68
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,780
if there’s something you can’t speak of.

69
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,640
Liu Xizhao,

70
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
Come at me if you have any tricks.

71
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,540
Don't get this fool involved.

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
I've been curious.

73
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,290
With someone like Third Brother being so devoted to you,

74
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,480
why did you fall for Huang Xin?

75
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,079
It has nothing to do with you.

76
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,600
I thought you were the one I saw that day.

77
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,690
Until today, when I saw Noble Consort Jia.

78
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,320
Liu Xizhao.

79
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,880
I hate self-righteous people the most.

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
I understand.

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,790
But I want to remind you.

82
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,220
You think you’re protecting her.

83
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,470
But it will only make her more unhinged.

84
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,940
You can say whatever you want.

85
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,840
But you don't understand my situation.

86
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,440
How can I not understand you?

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,360
You just want to protect her status and reputation

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,840
and the dignity of your Prince Song's Mansion.

89
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,440
You want to sacrifice yourself for the sake of everyone else.

90
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Isn't that right?

91
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,360
Huan.

92
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,290
Cooperate with me and Lu Shaoyang.

93
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,650
We will find a way to get you out.

94
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,280
This is my last warning.

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,260
There are things that you can't control.

96
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
Stop pestering me.

97
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,900
I don't want to see you.

98
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:45,880
Leave!

99
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,640
Huan.

100
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,610
This time, just listen to Fourth Sister-in-law.

101
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,680
Leave!

102
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
So beautiful.

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,880
I have never seen anything so beautiful in my life.

104
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,010
Isn't it beautiful?

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
So beautiful.

106
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,720
It’s just exquisite.

107
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,560
Young Madam.

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,320
Her Majesty’s gift has arrived.

109
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
Look.

110
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,560
Her Majesty’s gift?

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:28,960
Yes.

112
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,320
So many treasures.

113
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Bing.

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
How did that matter turn out?

115
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
Her Majesty has issued an edict.

116
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,680
Eunuch Gao dared not disobey.

117
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,120
He took all the betrothal gifts away.

118
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,840
Really?

119
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,960
Great.

120
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,850
By the way, Young Madam,

121
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,760
this suits you very well.

122
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,960
How does this look?

123
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,520
Let me put it on for you.

124
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
So beautiful.

125
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,680
Really?

126
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,850
Thank you, Bing.

127
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,000
I am going to see Lu Shaoyang now.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,260
Just stay here and enjoy your treasures.

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
Wait for me to come back.

130
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:01,920
Okay.

131
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,380
Here’s one for each of you.

132
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Really?

133
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,600
Thank you, Bing.

134
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,010
How about this?

135
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,840
You both share these things.

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,920
From now on, work hard.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
Serve the Fourth Young Madam well.

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,250
Don’t be so clumsy all the time.

139
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,600
Take your things and leave.

140
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,840
We’ll take them with us.

141
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,400
Yes.

142
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,280
Really?

143
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
You take them.

144
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,920
Thank you, Bing.

145
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,680
Young Madam.

146
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,240
I'm not blessed.

147
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
And my fate is not in my hands.

148
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
Since you appeared,

149
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,840
I realized that

150
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,760
that people can control their own fate.

151
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,840
I envy you.

152
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,080
I wanted to be

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,840
a woman like you.

154
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,440
You have treated me like a sister.

155
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,760
I have no way to repay you.

156
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,800
Today, as we part,

157
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
if we meet again in the next life,

158
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,560
I would still like to be your maid.

159
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,960
May you have no worries

160
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,440
and always be yourself.

161
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,880
Stop!

162
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,040
Miss Bing.

163
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,400
Noble Consort Jia asked me to bring you a message.

164
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,480
Noble Consort Jia said

165
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
Bing, the daughter of a sinner,

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,360
actually attached herself to the Empress and stirred up strife in the harem.

167
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Such behavior is a grave violation of protocol.

168
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,880
You should be sentenced to death by poison

169
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,480
to atone for your crimes.

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,800
Miss Bing.

171
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
It’s fine

172
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,880
that you’ve offended me,

173
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,039
but you’ve also offended someone you shouldn’t have.

174
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,360
The Empress

175
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
can’t handle Noble Consort Jia.

176
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,680
How could your Fourth Young Madam do anything?

177
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,560
If you defy the order,

178
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,560
your Fourth Young Madam

179
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,080
might also end up facing death.

180
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,960
Accept the reward.

181
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,200
Third Sister-in-law has been wrongfully imprisoned.

182
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,060
Huang Xin has committed suicide.

183
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,740
But Noble Consort Jia has left no traces behind.

184
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,760
Lu Shaoyang, where have you been?

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,800
I've been waiting for you.

186
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,000
How's the matter with Third Sister-in-law going?

187
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,800
Xizhao.

188
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,960
Let’s put Third Sister-in-law’s matter aside for now.

189
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,750
Put it aside?

190
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,800
She’s being wrongfully imprisoned. How can we just put it aside?

191
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
Don't touch me.

192
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,120
Xizhao.

193
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,400
Bing...

194
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,580
What happened to Bing?

195
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,370
She committed suicide.

196
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,490
Impossible.

197
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,360
Xizhao.

198
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,600
Bing.

199
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,880
Bing.

200
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,960
Bing.

201
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,120
Bing.

202
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Bing.

203
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
Stop joking.

204
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Wake up.

205
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,280
You wouldn't be so silly, right?

206
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,560
You wouldn't be so silly.

207
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm back.

208
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,040
Didn't you promise me

209
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,800
to wait for me?

210
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,440
Didn't you promise me?

211
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,640
You would never break your promise to me.

212
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,480
Bing.

213
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,320
Wake up!

214
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,360
Wake up!

215
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,160
Bing.

216
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,160
Bing.

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,990
Your Highness.

218
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,080
The maid who embroidered the imperial robe for the Empress

219
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,960
has committed suicide by poison.

220
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,120
I want them to know

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,660
that even if they align with the Empress, they can't challenge me.

222
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,120
If they want to go against Your Highness,

223
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,000
it's a death wish.

224
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,040
What's Your Highness's plan

225
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,560
for Lu Shaozhen?

226
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,880
Let him wait.

227
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,120
We will need him someday.

228
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,200
Liu Xizhao and Lu Shaoyang

229
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,840
have not yet

230
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,900
stopped investigating the underground private bank.

231
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,780
Huang Xin has committed suicide.

232
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,540
My sister has pleaded guilty.

233
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
Yet they still want to investigate.

234
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,090
The people of the Marquis of Changping's Mansion

235
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,440
deserve to die.
