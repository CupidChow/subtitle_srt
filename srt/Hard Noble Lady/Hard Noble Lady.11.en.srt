1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:16,920
Qingshan.

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,680
The manager of Yongle Casino

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,400
is the second son of the Minister of Personnel.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,440
The Minister of Personnel and Marquis are good friends.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,840
We can't arrest his people without convincing evidence.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,280
Let's collect the evidence first.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,280
Don't alert them.

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:27,930
Okay.

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,600
Smells good.

11
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,640
Is this the liquor?

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,000
Is it good?

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,800
It smells so good.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,720
It smells different from other alcoholic drinks.

15
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
It smells so good.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,140
It smells really good.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,960
Yes, it smells so good.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
It smells so good.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,080
Who wants to try it?

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,340
Let me have a taste.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,410
Young Madam.

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
The liquor is really strong.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,510
You're amazing.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,600
This is the best alcoholic drink I've ever tried.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,660
Then can we start selling our liquor?

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,920
But to make the liquor

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,680
will consume many more crops than I expected.

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,080
This is not good news.

29
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
If we sell it at 20 taels of silver per catty, we can make profits.

30
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
But now I'm afraid the price has to be 50 taels per catty.

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,160
50 taels per catty?

32
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,039
20 taels can cover

33
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:40,400
the yearly expenses for an ordinary household.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,600
If our liquor is priced at 50 taels per catty, no one can afford it.

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,280
Yes.

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,080
If we hope to sell an ordinary product

37
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,539
at a price much higher than its usual prices,

38
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:50,120
we can't rely on the practicality of the product.

39
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,630
Instead, we should rely on the pleasure the product can bring for the consumers.

40
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,840
Such products are usually called luxuries.

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
What's a luxury?

42
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,140
I've never heard of it.

43
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,480
Xizhao.

44
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,620
It's so late. Why do you want to see me?

45
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,710
I want a map.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,200
It would be better if all shops

47
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
and restaurants in the capital are marked on the map.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,930
What do you want the map for?

49
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,480
I want to hold a competition named Who Is the Best Drinker.

50
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,560
It's a drinking competition.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,320
The liquor I make now

52
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,150
is not famous enough.

53
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,840
I have to market it.

54
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,480
Do you have any requirements for the venue of the competition?

55
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,640
Well.

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,190
It can't be too small.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,800
It can't be remote.

58
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,720
And it should be widely visited.

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,400
The biggest restaurant in the capital

60
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,800
is Qingchun Restaurant.

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,450
Many customers and businessmen come and go there every day.

62
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,400
So the map...

63
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,640
Thank you.

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,010
What were you reading just now?

65
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,840
This is the Capital Journal.

66
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,079
It records the major events happening in the capital every day.

67
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,160
If you like it,

68
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,760
take it.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,640
Thanks.

70
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,840
Bye.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,320
Please.

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,300
It's so strong.

73
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,079
It smells good and tastes mellow.

74
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,200
I haven't tasted good liquor like this for a long time.

75
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,200
I've long heard that you, Manager Liu of Qingchun Restaurant,

76
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,240
is an expert in judging alcoholic drinks.

77
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,440
Glad to see you today.

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,300
You deserve your reputation.

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Here.

80
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
Here's to you.

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:37,680
Okay.

82
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,080
Please.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,159
Manager Liu.

84
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,960
Would you like to collaborate with me?

85
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,330
Fourth Young Madam, you select my restaurant

86
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
because my restaurant is very popular.

87
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,520
Don't worry.

88
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,840
We can discuss the rent.

89
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,440
What I want

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,570
is not just the rent.

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,900
How about this?

92
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,560
After the Who Is the Best Drinker competition,

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,090
your liquor can only be sold at my restaurant.

94
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,520
I believe

95
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,080
my restaurant is your best choice.

96
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,640
No problem.

97
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,720
Here.

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,380
Let me toast you again.

99
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,680
Your liquor is too strong.

100
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,720
Why am I feeling dizzy?

101
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,000
Manager Liu.

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,600
Hope we'll have good collaboration.

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Well...

104
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
I believe we will.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,680
Take a look.

106
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,240
Registration for the Who Is the Best Drinker competition is now open.

107
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,280
Sigh up for

108
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,920
our Who Is the Best Drinker competition!

109
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,960
Come and have a look.

110
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,160
Sigh up for our Who Is the Best Drinker competition!

111
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
Madam.

112
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,960
Is it true that the winner of the competition

113
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,080
will be given a reward of 100 taels of silver?

114
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
Sir.

115
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,040
Our  liquor

116
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,900
is very strong.

117
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,320
If you finish drinking and don't get drunk,

118
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,680
the 100 taels will be yours.

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,140
Really?

120
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
Remember to come to the competition on time.

121
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:18,800
Okay.

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,120
The competition will be held in three days.

123
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
It will last three days.

124
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,840
The avenue is Qingchun Restaurant.

125
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,640
If you can be the winner for three consecutive days,

126
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,300
you'll not only get 300 taels,

127
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,440
but also a mysterious gift.

128
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,280
Come and sign up for our competition.

129
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,880
Take a look.

130
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
I'll sign up.

131
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,560
I want one too.

132
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,200
Here.

133
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,520
Give me one.

134
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,000
Don't rush.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,720
There's no hurry.

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,400
I'll give one to everyone.

137
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,280
Give me one.

138
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,040
Give me one.

139
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,760
Give me one.

140
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,840
After the competition,

141
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,370
my liquor will be famous all over the capital.

142
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,680
What?

143
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,600
Liu Xizhao

144
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,600
discussed collaboration with Manager Liu of Qingchun Restaurant?

145
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,159
That's right.

146
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,440
I saw it.

147
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,410
Thank you, Second Young Madam.

148
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
Xueying.

149
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,880
Take this letter

150
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,840
to Qingchun Restaurant and give it to Manager Liu.

151
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Then...

152
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
Go.

153
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,320
How should I name my liquor?

154
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
It deserves a cool name

155
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,250
which people can remember easily.

156
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,800
In the spring of the Year Seven in the reign of the Li Emperor,

157
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,040
on the seventh day of the fifth lunar month,

158
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,280
one of days of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun,

159
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,640
Liu Xizhao, Fourth Young Madam of Marquis of Changping's Mansion

160
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,320
jumped into the lake.

161
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,250
She didn't die but lost her memory.

162
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,980
The Capital Journal is just a newspaper.

163
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,120
The Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun?

164
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,720
You're such an arrogant man.

165
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,230
Go to hell!

166
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,560
Not only is the bracelet needed,

167
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,760
but also the occurrence of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun.

168
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,520
Young Madam.

169
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,060
Young Madam, bad news.

170
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,800
What's wrong?

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,640
Someone from Qingchun Restaurant said

172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,680
they decided to cancel the collaboration with us.

173
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,400
What?

174
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,320
Why?

175
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,320
I don't know.

176
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,960
We also asked other big restaurants in the capital.

177
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,640
But none of them would like to collaborate with us.

178
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,770
What about the competition tomorrow?

179
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,799
How about this unoccupied area?

180
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:44,630
Not bad.

181
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,440
Go find Qin now and ask him to take some people there to set up a platform.

182
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,600
No matter what happens,

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,080
the competition must go smoothly tomorrow.

184
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,760
Okay.

185
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,720
Who is behind this?

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,450
Go up the stairs carefully.

187
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,080
Be careful.

188
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,970
Young Madam.

189
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,920
It's going to rain.

190
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,080
Let's find a shelter.

191
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,600
It's okay.

192
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
Let's help them.

193
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,320
Young Madam, don't worry.

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,400
Leave it to us.

195
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,480
We'll finish setting up the platform soon.

196
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,360
It's going to rain.

197
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,490
Let's keep working.

198
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,480
Okay.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,880
Give it to me.

200
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,650
It's raining. Let's hurry.

201
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,080
Hurry up.

202
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,400
Let's hurry.

203
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,640
Why are you here?

204
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,220
Don't move.

205
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,080
You can let me do these things for you from now on.

206
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,610
You're the manager and I'll take your orders.

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,400
You are my wife.

208
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,720
Don't do this alone. Let me help you.

209
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,520
All restaurants refused to collaborate with us all of a sudden.

210
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,780
I have no other choice.

211
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,600
Looks like someone is trying to cause you trouble.

212
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
At tomorrow's competition,

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,310
you need to be very careful.

214
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,570
No matter who they are,

215
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,920
I will earn 80,000 taels of silver which will make up for the losses.
