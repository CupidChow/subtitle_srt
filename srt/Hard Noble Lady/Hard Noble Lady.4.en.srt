00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,680
My Lord. Old Madam.

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,290
Please investigate it.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,960
Hong

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,520
helped Young Madam Shaolin buy herbs from her hometown.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,480
So she threatened Young Madam Shaolin

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,740
and asked for a reward.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,160
I can't stand it.

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,640
I fought with her

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,040
because of anger.

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,370
You want to strangle her

12
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,080
just because of such a trivial matter?

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,960
This lowly servant hit me first.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,240
If I didn't fight back,

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,960
she would have beaten me to death.

16
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,640
Hong.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,480
Tell us what happened.

18
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,200
I want money

19
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,720
because Mrs. Liu

20
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,120
asked me about Young Madam Shaoyang's personal affairs.

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,050
What did you say?

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,880
I told her the birthmark of the Young Madam Shaoyang.

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
So you told her.

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,360
Tell me, how did you know?

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,000
On the day you fell into the lake,

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,680
Bing changed your wet clothes.

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,810
I happened to see it.

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,200
But I only told Mrs. Liu

29
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,720
about the position and the shape of the birthmark.

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,880
I don't know anything else.

31
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,750
I've never been involved.

32
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,160
My Lord. Please investigate it.

33
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,220
You lowly servant!

34
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,400
Nonsense!

35
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,050
When did I ask you about Young Madam Shaoyang?

36
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,280
You have no evidence and you're framing me.

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,720
My Lord, Old Madam,

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,080
I'm innocent!

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,039
I won't accept it! I'm innocent!

40
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,840
Mrs. Liu.

41
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,039
I'm good at

42
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,490
making people confess.

43
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,760
Mrs. Liu.

44
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,480
Just having a tough mouth

45
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,520
won’t help.

46
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,900
Even the hardest bones

47
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,550
can’t withstand my methods.

48
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,320
There's no need for your methods.

49
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,720
If you have something to say, say it.

50
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,180
Father,

51
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,840
this matter concerns my reputation.

52
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,170
If she doesn't confess,

53
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,550
I won't go easy on her.

54
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,120
Well...

55
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Young Master Shaoyang.

56
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,720
You...

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,320
Don’t try to trick me.

58
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,320
I didn't do anything.

59
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,640
I don't know anything.

60
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Are you sure the painting you burned

61
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,680
was the tampered one?

62
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,160
This doesn’t require your interrogation methods.

63
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,560
The painting

64
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,759
Cousin Shaozhen bought

65
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,400
was originally a "Distant Mountains" painting by Wen Keming.

66
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,120
But while admiring it, the image changed.

67
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,880
I thought of checking the physical evidence

68
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,680
but found that Mrs. Liu had secretly burned it.

69
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,350
Were you trying to destroy the evidence?

70
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,960
Ah.

71
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,440
Young Master Shaoyang.

72
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,560
I did burn the painting,

73
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,680
but I did it

74
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,000
for the sake of your reputation!

75
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,480
So you admit to burning it.

76
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,440
Mrs. Liu.

77
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,560
Do you know that even if you burn a painting to ashes,

78
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
we can still determine

79
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,090
if the paper was soaked in a special solution?

80
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:30,960
Besides,

81
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,290
are you sure you burned it completely?

82
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,560
The paper you burned was treated with a special wax,

83
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,400
which makes it smooth like silk.

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Only three shops in the entire capital

85
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,320
sell such high-grade paper,

86
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
so it won’t be difficult to find out

87
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,130
who was behind this.

88
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,240
Here's a new landscape painting

89
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,560
I had Master Wen Keming

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,400
recreate using special ink.

91
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
This...

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,480
This ink...

93
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,800
It’s made from ink mixed with a special solution.

94
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,860
Could the scent...

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,120
It's Baiqi incense

96
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,579
from the Western Regions.

97
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,520
When the incense is burned,

98
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,579
it causes the solution to disappear,

99
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,060
revealing the underlying

100
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,240
pattern

101
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,370
on the soaked paper.

102
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,960
Mrs. Liu.

103
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,160
Am I right?

104
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,600
You...

105
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
You’re framing me!

106
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,680
I didn't do anything.

107
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,400
You...

108
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,800
You’re framing me!

109
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,240
We’ve checked all the shops

110
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,680
in the capital that sell paper and Western exotic incenses.

111
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,280
The only person associated with

112
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,400
the Marquis' Mansion who purchased paper,

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Baiqi incense, and a special solution

114
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,720
is Hong.

115
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,530
Unfortunately,

116
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
Hong wasn’t aware of the implications.

117
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,120
Your plan was well-crafted.

118
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,720
You thought

119
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,520
Hong would buy the items

120
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,280
and you could blame me

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,440
while shifting the guilt onto her.

122
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,200
But you didn’t anticipate

123
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,720
Hong is greedy,

124
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,960
so she bought ordinary ink instead.

125
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,320
Left with no choice

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,000
Mrs. Liu, you personally went to a distant shop

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
to purchase the special solution.

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,159
The shopkeeper who sold it to you is right outside.

129
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,690
Do you still want to deny it?

130
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,520
Speak!

131
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,850
Who instructed you?

132
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,050
Father, Mother.

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,960
Mrs. Liu is my nanny.

134
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,240
She has been very helpful

135
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
in managing the household.

136
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,520
A few days ago,

137
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,080
I complained about Xizhao in front of her,

138
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,760
and she must have misunderstood.

139
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,320
It's my fault.

140
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,440
Young Madam Shaolin.

141
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,159
It’s not a misunderstanding.

142
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,800
Young Madam Shaoyang punished me

143
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,840
in front of the servants,

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,040
humiliating me.

145
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,080
I was filled with resentment

146
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,840
and tried to slander her

147
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,680
to get her expelled from the Marquis's Mansion.

148
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,440
I also tricked Hong

149
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,440
into falsely accusing the Young Madam Shaoyang.

150
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,500
My Lord, Old Madam,

151
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,360
I'm guilty.

152
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
I plead guilty. I'm willing to be punished.

153
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,810
I'm willing to be punished.

154
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
Women are truly terrifying.

155
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
Liu Xizhao,

156
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,040
you’ve become quite bold.

157
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,400
You finally stopped pretending and showed your true colors.

158
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,520
Your Liu family is greedy for wealth.

159
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Young Master Shaoyang doesn't enter your room,

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,280
so you vent your anger on me.

161
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,920
You little wretch!

162
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,480
Enough!

163
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,080
A servant

164
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,120
made you disregard your dignity and manners.

165
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
This is the Marquis's Mansion, not a marketplace.

166
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Look at you.

167
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,610
You don't look like a master at all.

168
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
Master.

169
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,880
Guards!

170
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,600
Yes.

171
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,360
drag out this insubordinate, slanderous servant

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,680
and flog her twenty times!

173
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,840
Then, throw her out of the household.

174
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,680
No, Mother.

175
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,159
Mrs. Liu is old. She will die if she can't stand the caning.

176
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,160
She’s served us well despite her faults.

177
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,280
please forgive her, Mother.

178
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,410
You're so stubborn.

179
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,800
Drag her out now.

180
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,120
Flog her twenty times!

181
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,600
Let all the servants at home watch.

182
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,400
I beg you, Mother.

183
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:10,880
Let's go.

184
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,720
Mrs. Liu.

185
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,000
Mother.

186
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
Father.

187
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,680
Please spare Mrs. Liu.

188
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,440
Mrs. Liu

189
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,440
is my nanny.

190
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,760
She's old and can't stand the flogging.

191
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
This kind of rebellious servant

192
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,560
won't be tolerated

193
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,660
in this household.

194
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,360
You'd best

195
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
be quiet.

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Given your work for the household,

197
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,240
we didn't hold you responsible for not managing her better.

198
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,040
Mother.

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,920
Cousin.

200
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,170
Have you forgotten the family teachings?

201
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
Now you're begging for mercy for a servant.

202
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,760
Cousin, have you lost your mind?

203
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,720
Young Madam.

204
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,960
The whole mansion knows

205
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,710
about how Fourth Young Master helped you today.

206
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,170
Why are you still unhappy?

207
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,140
Don't you think this is wrong?

208
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,880
I just want to clarify.

209
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,540
I didn't expect them to beat people to death.

210
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,320
I only know that

211
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,960
since you married into the Marquis's Mansion,

212
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
you've been living in fear every day.

213
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
Now that you have Fourth Young Master protecting you,

214
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
you will never be bullied again.

215
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,170
That's not what I meant.

216
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,909
Mrs. Liu made a mistake first.

217
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,760
She should be punished by the family.

218
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,290
If you make a mistake, you should be punished.

219
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,680
Bing.

220
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Have you ever thought

221
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,960
if I was beaten today,

222
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,920
I wouldn't be able to see the sun tomorrow, either.

223
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,010
The rules here are too terrifying.

224
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,720
If I had known, I wouldn't have tried to clear things up.

225
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,520
Young Madam, you must be joking.

226
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,130
Only those who make mistakes will be flogged.

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,960
In this place, you could lose your life at any moment.

228
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,960
I can't stay here.

229
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,650
Young Madam.

230
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,360
Even if this Marquis's Mansion is a mountain of knives and a sea of fire,

231
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,720
I will be with you.

232
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,680
Please live well.

233
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,480
Why not?

234
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,080
The bracelet.

235
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,380
It must be the bracelet that caused the time travel.

236
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,720
Let's go.

237
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:24,640
Bing.

238
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,640
I think I'm poisoned.

239
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,960
How dare you be late to pay your respects to Mother.

240
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,840
You come in and start looking around.

241
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,880
What are you thinking about?

242
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,679
This is it.

243
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
I can go back once I get it.

244
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,919
I must get the bracelet from Old Madam as soon as possible.

245
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,200
My Lord,

246
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,660
why don’t you go in?

247
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,900
Greetings, Fourth Young Master.

248
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,200
Fourth Young Master, wait

249
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,520
Young Madam doesn't allow you to go in.

250
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,720
Why?

251
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,280
Young Madam has been praying in her room.

252
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
She doesn't see any guests.

253
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,080
Of course,

254
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,360
including you.

255
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,320
Me?

256
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
I just want to ask her out for dinner.

257
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,440
Maybe Young Madam was scared yesterday.

258
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,560
She'll be fine in a few days.

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,360
I will take good care of Young Madam.

260
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,880
Don't worry.

261
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,140
Was I not handsome enough yesterday?

262
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,060
Why the change in attitude today?

263
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,000
Young Madam,

264
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,880
since you married into the Marquis's Mansion,

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
this is the first time the Young Master has invited you to dinner.

266
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,800
Why did you refuse?

267
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,440
I need to get the bracelet. I don't have time for him.

268
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,040
By the way,

269
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,570
tell me about the bracelet.

270
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,800
The bracelet was bestowed by the late emperor.

271
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,760
The Old Madam always wears it and never takes it off.

272
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
But Old Madam once promised

273
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,040
to give it to the next daughter-in-law who would manage the household.

274
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,680
But she doesn't like you.

275
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,730
I don't think she'll give it to you.

276
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,160
Who would want to

277
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,740
manage this broken Marquis' household?

278
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,130
I'll be flexible later.

279
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,170
If it doesn't work, I'll find a way to steal it.

280
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,460
In order to go back,

281
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,600
I have no choice.

282
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,060
Fourth Young Madam, please wait.

283
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,800
I’m here to see Old Madam.

284
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
Old Madam has said

285
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,040
that from now on, you're excused from the morning and evening greetings.

286
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,560
You don't need to pay your respects anymore.

287
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,760
Are you saying

288
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,880
the Old Madam doesn't want to see me anymore?

289
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,440
Yes.

290
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,520
I've thought about everything.

291
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
But I didn't expect that

292
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,940
that Old Madam doesn't want to see me.

293
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,800
What should I do?

294
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,520
Young Madam.

295
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,250
You are so considerate.

296
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,760
You know I'm worried.

297
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,000
so he came here to make tea for me.

298
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,810
Young Madam,

299
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,720
these tea tools are for you.

300
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,200
For me?

301
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,960
If you want to please Old Madam,

302
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,240
you still need to restore your tea-whisking skills.

303
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,320
The Old Madam loves your tea the most

304
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,600
and says it's the best in the household.

305
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,560
Pour hot water here.

306
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,640
The tea powder you're holding is what you'll use.

307
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,570
Put them inside and stir it slowly.

308
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,240
Let me try.

309
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
What a coincidence.

310
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,240
Fourth Sister. Are you preparing some tea?

311
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,080
Third Sister, why are you here?

312
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,540
Let me try your handiwork.

313
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,680
Please.

314
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,920
I heard that you're good at whisking tea.

315
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,220
I was learning recently, so I came to learn from you.

316
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,740
I didn't expect...

317
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,200
Sorry, Third Sister.

318
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,120
I fell into the water a while ago.

319
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,960
I forgot everything,

320
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,560
now to mention whisking tea.

321
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,800
That's great.

322
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Sister.

323
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,680
if you remember something,

324
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,360
it might harm everyone around you.

325
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,240
Since you're so honest, I won't bother you.

326
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,920
I'll go back first.

327
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,610
Young Madam.

328
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,480
Third Young Madam looks kind.

329
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,360
She doesn’t look like a difficult person.

330
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,160
Kind?

331
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,040
Why do I feel she's talking in a weird way?

332
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,280
How do your Young Madams

333
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,000
make Old Madam happy?

334
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,700
They will buy a lot of gifts to coax the Old Madam.

335
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,600
But our residence is poor.

336
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,720
There's nothing we can offer.

337
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,040
Find out

338
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,440
what the Old Madam needs recently.

339
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,970
Let's offer what she likes.

340
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,640
Little Young Master Yuenxu broke Old Madam's Nine Dragons Cup

341
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,160
I heard that hot water in that cup won't get cold after a long time.

342
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,020
But there are only a few ones left.

343
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,280
Even Second Young Madam and Third Young Madam can’t get them,

344
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,520
let alone us.

345
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,440
Find me a bronze craftsman.

346
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,570
A bronze craftsman?

347
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,740
It's so beautiful.

348
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,530
Young Madam,

349
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,440
is our cup really better than the Nine Dragons Cup?

350
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,760
Of course.

351
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,820
I'll show you something great later.

352
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,920
Why are you out?

353
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,760
Didn't Mother say

354
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,360
she didn't need your greetings?

355
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
Why are you wandering around again?

356
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,760
Mother,

357
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I heard that your Nine Dragons Cup is broken.

358
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,520
So I asked someone to customize this thermos cup for you.

359
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
This cup is amazing.

360
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,800
After you pour hot water into this cup,

361
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,080
even in winter,

362
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
the temperature of the water inside

363
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
won't drop for hours.

364
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
This is a necessary tool for modern travel.

365
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,080
You're be convinced by it.

366
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,360
Goodness.

367
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,960
What a joke.

368
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:43,360
So all the maids in our mansion are decorations?

369
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,760
You don't use the maids who can boil water.

370
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,490
But you use your stupid bottle.

371
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,600
Fourth Sister.

372
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,920
we are not ordinary people.

373
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,840
To serve us masters to drink water,

374
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,080
there are special boiling maids.

375
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,040
The water that the masters drink

376
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,800
must be freshly boiled.

377
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,200
No matter it's winter or summer,

378
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,680
the maids will prepare water for the right temperature

379
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,840
for the masters to drink.

380
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:10,880
Alright.

381
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,240
When you're free,

382
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,760
learn something useful.

383
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,440
Don't focus on useless things.

384
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,400
Don't come here again

385
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,780
without my orders.

386
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,720
Leave.

387
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,200
Go.

388
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
I underestimated you.

389
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,000
The landing strike failed.

390
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What's good about the Marquis's Mansion?

391
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,560
You even got maids who're in charge of boiling water.

392
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,200
It's a waste of manpower.

393
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,280
I'm sorry, Young Madam.

394
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,080
I didn't make it clear.

395
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,680
It's not your fault.

396
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,340
I underestimated your place.

397
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,290
Young Madam.

398
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,600
Young Madam, let's go another way.

399
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,160
Why?

400
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,840
It's closer to go this way.

401
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,840
Isn't it good to go home quickly?

402
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,800
People in the mansion say it's unlucky.

403
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,240
Don't be superstitious.

404
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,880
What's unlucky about it?

405
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,610
Young Madam.

406
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,640
There's a living dead here.

407
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,920
A living dead?
