1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:28,600
My Lord.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,920
Catch him alive.

4
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,240
Yes.

5
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,200
There's poison in his mouth

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,260
and no clues on him.

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,440
He’s a deadly assassin.

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:49,500
A deadly assassin?

9
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,280
Why did he want to kill me?

10
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,280
Could it be her?

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,290
Investigate it.

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,120
Find out who hired the deadly assassins

13
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,440
and had the audacity to kill in public.

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,040
Yes.

15
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,060
Liu Xizhao,

16
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,720
what kind of trouble have you gotten yourself into?

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,780
I'm a bit confused.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,570
Give me a moment.

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
You’re not allowed to go anywhere during this time.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,720
Young Madam,

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,120
please listen to the Young Master this time

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,380
and don't go anywhere.

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,440
Someone wants to kill me!

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:31,920
Lu Shaoyang!

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,979
I will protect you.

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,930
That's not what I meant.

27
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,580
What I’m saying is,

28
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,920
someone wants to kill me!

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,320
I need to find Huang Xin as soon as possible.

30
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:42,840
Let's go home.

31
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,850
I'll have a good talk with you about Huang Xin.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,720
You mean Huang Xin is the mastermind behind the underground private bank

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,250
and has caused many deaths?

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,880
Yes.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,759
So,

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,440
you shouldn't go near Huang Xin anymore.

37
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Besides, it seems he has noticed that I'm investigating him.

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,640
Think about your status.

39
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,920
You are my wife.

40
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,380
It's dangerous for you to be near him.

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,770
Well, I'll just wait for you to catch him first

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,280
and then go to him for help.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,039
Why do you have to ask Huang Xin for help?

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,600
Because I need him to calculate the date of the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun.

45
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,400
The Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun?

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,800
Why?

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,160
I'm an astronomy enthusiast,

48
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,320
okay?

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,320
Anyway,

50
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,040
you mustn't go outside and put yourself in danger.

51
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,600
Got it.

52
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,400
Do you think

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,440
those assassins will come into the mansion to kill me?

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,370
It's hard to say.

55
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,500
They hired deadly assassins.

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,810
It's hard to say what they might do.

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,940
Then you have to protect me this time too.

58
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,160
Thank you.

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,640
Is the floor hard?

60
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,700
Do you want to come up here and stay with me for the night?

61
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,400
You...

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,040
What are you doing?

63
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
Just now, you...

64
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
I didn't mean that.

65
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,800
Just go!

66
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,160
I don’t need your protection anymore!

67
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,920
Go now!

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:50,320
Come on...

69
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,000
You...

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,960
Get out!

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,960
Third Young Madam,

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,279
that person is here again to urge you

73
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,140
to deal with the hidden dangers as soon as possible.

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,760
Got it.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,760
I just want to take a walk here.

76
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Why are you following me like Lu Shaoyang?

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
I need to protect you at all times

78
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,500
to prevent you from encountering danger again.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,080
Greetings, Fourth Young Madam.

80
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
Does Second Sister want to see me?

81
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,680
The Second Young Madam asked me to tell you

82
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,880
that every year at this time,

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,720
the Old Madam takes the ladies of the mansion

84
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,120
to the bamboo grove villa for a summer retreat.

85
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,159
She has already scheduled to depart tomorrow.

86
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,560
Our Young Madam has been feeling unwell recently

87
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,620
and doesn't go out.

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,600
Bing.

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,440
Are all the ladies going?

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,360
Yes.

91
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,420
They are all going.

92
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,560
Then I'll go too.

93
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,000
No.

94
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,250
It's too dangerous.

95
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,520
Besides luring them out,

96
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,080
do you have any other solutions?

97
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,560
I can’t just stay in the Marquis's Mansion for the rest of my life, can I?

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,820
Give me a few more days.

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,760
I’ll make sure to find out who wants to kill you.

100
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,880
To get any clues,

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,690
one side must break the balance first.

102
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,560
Are there any clues you haven't told me?

103
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,640
No.

104
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,530
It won’t help even if I told you.

105
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Why don't we

106
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,620
set a trap and wait for them to fall in?

107
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,960
Lu Shaoyang,

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,100
with you by my side,

109
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,820
nothing will happen to me.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,760
Wow, it smells good.

111
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,720
Yes, it's so beautiful.

112
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,520
Yes. Eldest Sister, take a look.

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,080
It really is not bad.

114
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,920
We've been on the road all day,

115
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,200
and it's already dark.

116
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,240
You all

117
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,570
should go get some rest.

118
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,160
Mother.

119
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,300
There's something I want to talk to you about later.

120
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
What is it?

121
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,640
It's okay to tell me now.

122
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,960
Well...

123
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,760
Okay.

124
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's talk later.

125
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,300
Go and get settled.

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,240
Yes.

127
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,440
Young Madam,

128
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,500
where are we going?

129
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,200
We rarely come out.

130
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
Let's take a walk.

131
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,040
Young Madam,

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,040
it’s already dark.

133
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
Why don’t you go back early and get some rest?

134
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,200
Also, His lordship has instructed me

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,840
to keep you from wandering around.

136
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,040
Okay, okay.

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,520
The Marquis's Mansion has such a villa.

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,600
It's quite big.

139
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,720
Young Madam,

140
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
let's go back.

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,380
Have you been here before?

142
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,440
Is there anything interesting?

143
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,830
Third Sister?

144
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,900
Third Sister, you know martial arts?

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,120
Liu Xizhao,

146
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,080
you are so curious.

147
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,080
Come on.

148
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,980
Just because I ran into you and Huang Xin,

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,710
you want to kill me?

150
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Knowing too much isn’t good for you.

151
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,320
This time, I won’t let you go.

152
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,330
I really don't understand.

153
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,720
You and Third Brother are such a good couple.

154
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,120
Why are you having an affair with Huang Xin?

155
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,320
I know what you want to do.

156
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,760
The Imperial City Division spies that you had stationed around

157
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,220
have been taken down by me.

158
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,000
You’ve gone to such lengths just to kill me?

159
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,340
How big of a secret are you trying to cover up?

160
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,680
Your death will be labeled as an accident caused by mountain bandits.

161
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,480
Do it!

162
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,900
Mountain bandits!

163
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,880
There are mountain bandits!

164
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,680
Mother, run!

165
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,480
Run!

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,760
Shaoyang?

167
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,080
Shaoyang!

168
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,520
Why are there mountain bandits

169
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
in this villa?

170
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,039
Thank goodness.

171
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,760
It’s good that neither of the two sisters was hurt.

172
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,559
Shaoyang,

173
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,480
what happened?

174
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,440
Mother,

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,160
it’s likely that those bandits

176
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,420
were after our wealth.

177
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,300
Everyone was frightened.

178
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,680
Let’s go inside first.

179
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,160
Okay.

180
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,560
Mother, don't worry.

181
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,040
I’ve already arranged for guards at the door.

182
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,880
Since there are bandits in the forest,

183
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,740
we should head down the mountain.

184
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,290
I’ve sent people to scout the way down.

185
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,480
I was afraid there might be ambushes on the road,

186
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,240
so I've already contacted the Imperial City Division.

187
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
They’ll send people to escort us.

188
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

189
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,440
Let's wait for Shaoyang

190
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:21,240
to bring more people before we head down the mountain.

191
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:21,600
Yes.

192
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,840
Eldest Sister, Second Sister,

193
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,600
please take Mother back to rest.

194
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,760
I have something to talk about

195
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,440
with Xizhao

196
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,560
and Third Sister.

197
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,320
Okay.

198
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,190
Third Sister, do you want to know

199
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,600
what happened?

200
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,330
Those deadly assassins who pretended

201
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,080
to be mountain bandits

202
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,940
were actually hired by Qingshan.

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,640
You thought your deadly assassins

204
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,880
had taken down the Imperial City Division’s people,

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,240
but it was actually the other way around.

206
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,500
You staged this whole play on purpose

207
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,840
just to trap me?

208
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,480
Yes.

209
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,240
Only by trapping you

210
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,260
can we make Huang Xin lose his composure.

211
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,160
You want to deceive him?
