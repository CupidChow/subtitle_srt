00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,760
Hurry! Hurry!

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,960
Keep up!

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Fourth Young Madam is dying! Hurry!

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,520
Hurry!

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,960
Hurry!

7
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,560
Keep up!

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,600
Old Madam.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,940
Fourth Young Madam was rescued too late.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,440
She’s dying.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,620
You can start to prepare the funeral.

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,240
Young Madam.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,360
What should I do if you die?

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,040
Please wake up.

15
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,880
What a jerk!

16
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,840
She has been married into Marquis's Mansion for only a month.

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,640
How dare she jump into the lake and committed suicide!

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,950
If others know about this,

19
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,600
the reputation of Marquis's Mansion will be damaged!

20
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,680
Mother, calm down.

21
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't be too angry. It's not good for your health.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,840
A girl of humble origins like her

23
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,440
didn't deserve to marry into our Marquis's Mansion.

24
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,370
Liu Xizhao's fate is unfortunate.

25
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,640
Just let her die.

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,520
She's already dying.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,960
Eldest Sister, save your useless words.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,000
Why would Fourth Sister jump into the lake?

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,920
You

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,060
should know the reason very well.

31
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,720
Stop it. I'm tired.

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,370
Go back to your rooms first.

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,080
Mother, be careful. Let me help you.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,560
Young Madam is awake!

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,919
Young Madam.

36
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,210
How come she's alive again?

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,160
Don't panic.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
Where am I?

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,160
Who are they?

40
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,530
Young Madam.

41
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,900
Be careful.

42
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,079
Young Madam.

43
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,200
Liu Xizhao.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,079
You should be grateful for marrying into Marquis's Mansion.

45
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,440
If you dare to commit suicide by jumping into the lake

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,800
and damage the reputation of Marquis's Mansion again,

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,860
I won't let you off.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,800
Bing.

49
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,850
Keep an eye on your Young Madam.

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Yes.

51
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,000
What is this old lady talking about?

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,000
Young Madam.

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,610
Wasn't I just downstairs outside the company building?

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,670
I'm glad you're fine. You're finally awake.

55
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,160
The doctor said you were unable to wake up.

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,200
I was so worried.

57
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,400
Su Bing.

58
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,770
How dare you push me into the water?

59
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,420
Young Madam, what are you talking about?

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,290
How come my voice is different?

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,760
How come I've become a woman!

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,040
Young Madam, what's wrong?

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,040
How come I've become a woman!

64
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,680
You are Fourth Young Madam in Marquis's Mansion.

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,079
Of course you are a woman.

66
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,160
What Young Madam?

67
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,200
I'm your boss.

68
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
You pushed me into the water.

69
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,560
Su Bing.

70
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,120
I think as a woman,

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,280
you have a strength

72
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,520
which is that you've been trying to prove

73
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,760
that you're no inferior to men

74
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,090
so you always work hard.

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,860
Mr. Liu.

76
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,280
I found that you not only have misunderstandings about women

77
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
but also hold huge prejudices against women.

78
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
Then you can quit.

79
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,560
Fine, I quit.

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,760
Okay.

81
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,000
When your next employer calls me and does background check about you,

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,600
don't expect me to say anything nice about you.

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,680
You're such arrogant man!

84
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
Go to hell!

85
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,600
Young Madam.

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,800
I've been your maid since I was a child.

87
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,720
When you married into Marquis's Mansion, I came with you.

88
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,440
I am deeply loyal to you.

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,460
How dare I push you into the water?

90
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,280
Then tell me

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,600
where I am now.

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,769
Young Madam.

93
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,560
Did your brain get damaged in the water?

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,360
Why do you think

95
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,680
Fourth Young Madam jumped into the lake and tried to commit suicide?

96
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,520
Fourth Young Madam is so unlucky.

97
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,560
Marrying Fourth Young Master

98
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,159
makes her life more miserable than ours.

99
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,159
Fourth Young Master is the commander of the Imperial City Division.

100
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,430
He is cruel and callous like a devil.

101
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,159
It's said that many people got killed because of him.

102
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,820
Anyone who marries him would jump into the lake.

103
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,080
The surroundings...

104
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,800
And the people around...

105
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,770
So I'm really in the ancient times.

106
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,280
Is this time travel?

107
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,760
What should I do?

108
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,820
Greetings, Fourth Young Master.

109
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,790
Liu Xizhao.

110
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,960
Listen.

111
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,520
No matter how hard you try,

112
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,000
you can't change the fact that I don't like you.

113
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
If you really want to die,

114
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,680
I have a knife.

115
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
Fourth Young Master.

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,920
Young Madam accidentally fell into the water. She didn't commit suicide.

117
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,120
You misunderstood.

118
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,040
The rain has got your clothes wet.

119
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,280
Why not go get changed?

120
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
This new outfit

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
was made for you by Young Madam a few days ago.

122
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,700
You can change into it now.

123
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,409
Yes, My Lord.

124
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,320
Please change into it

125
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,720
so you won't catch a cold.

126
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,320
Young Madam.

127
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,400
This is a rare opportunity.

128
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:52,920
Go.

129
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,780
How can I help him get changed?

130
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,160
I advise you to stay here.

131
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,480
Don't play tricks.

132
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,450
I married you because your father saved Marquis.

133
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,910
I had to marry you to repay your father.

134
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:10,040
Don't think that marrying into my family is a good thing.

135
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,600
I don't feel you're repaying my family.

136
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,920
Instead, I feel you're taking revenge.

137
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,850
What did you say?

138
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,800
Listen.

139
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
There are rules to follow in Marquis's Mansion.

140
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,120
If you act improperly again,

141
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,530
I won't be able to protect you.

142
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,960
Why are you so talkative?

143
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,740
Do you think I want to stay in Marquis's Mansion?

144
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,000
Shameless!

145
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,540
Turn around and stop looking.

146
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,880
Shameless?

147
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,520
It's just an eight-pack.

148
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,680
I have one too.

149
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,420
My Lord.

150
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,159
Are you sleeping in the study again tonight?

151
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,320
You've been married for a month.

152
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,680
Sleeping in the study is not a long-term solution.

153
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,010
You'd better move back.

154
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you think

155
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Liu Xizhao is a bit different today?

156
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,630
Is she?

157
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
Xin.

158
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,520
Who made you angry?

159
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,200
Let's eat first.

160
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,010
It's all because of Liu Xizhao.

161
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,000
I thought after she died,

162
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
you would be able to marry Fourth Young Master.

163
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,920
To my surprise, that slut came back to life.

164
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Looks like Fourth Young Madam is really lucky.

165
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,240
I have to find a way

166
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,840
to deal with her soon before she becomes a threat.

167
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,400
Well.

168
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,960
Have you got a plan?

169
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,700
To get her to be kicked out.

170
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,850
We have to find a way to make Fourth Young Master and Mother hate her.

171
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,480
Xin, you're right.

172
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,159
There is a thing.

173
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
If a woman loses it,

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,400
her husband will hate her.

175
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,080
What is it?

176
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,240
Xin.

177
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,000
I think if...

178
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,050
Then she will be doomed.

179
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,960
Liu Xizhao's body is so weak.

180
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,170
Just a sword could get her to be scared so much.

181
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,980
Old Madam wants to see you.

182
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,990
She has sent a message

183
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,280
to let you go to her earlier.

184
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm not feeling well.

185
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm too sick to go see her.

186
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,720
Fourth Young Madam.

187
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,039
You’d better get up early.

188
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,000
Or we'll lift your quilt later.

189
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,610
Young Madam,

190
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,440
If you want to survive in Marquis's Mansion,

191
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,100
you'd better go see Old Madam.

192
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,380
We can't afford to offend any of them.

193
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,240
Why not?

194
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,960
Eldest Young Madam, Yan Xin,

195
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,680
is the eldest daughter-in-law of Marquis's Mansion.

196
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,400
She married into Marquis's Mansion first.

197
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,800
Her father is a senior government official.

198
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,760
Because she's from a powerful family,

199
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,760
she has always been arrogant and domineering in our mansion.

200
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,420
Second Young Madam is Li Jing.

201
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,500
Her parents are royal merchants.

202
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,800
She's very smart and shrewd.

203
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,560
When she married into Marquis's Mansion, she had a glorious wedding ceremony.

204
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,420
Second Young Madam is super rich.

205
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,560
Third Young Madam is Song Huan.

206
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,590
She's from the noblest family.

207
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:22,120
She's Noble Consort Jia's younger sister who is loved by the emperor the most.

208
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,240
To welcome her,

209
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,040
masters in the family built a courtyard for her.

210
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,680
None of them is easy to deal with.

211
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,240
No wonder Liu Xizhao would jump into the lake.

212
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,480
Of all the female members in Marquis's Mansion, Old Madam is the most influential.

213
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,810
She's the mistress of Marquis's Mansion.

214
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,450
Everyone needs to obey her.

215
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
-Greetings, Mother.
-Greetings, Old Madam.

216
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,000
Have a seat.

217
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,040
So,

218
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,020
you'd better go and see Old Madam.

219
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,080
Old Madam, you want to see me?

220
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Liu Xizhao.

221
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,120
Kneel down!

222
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,480
I didn't do anything wrong.

223
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,540
Why should I kneel?

224
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,480
Old Madam, look.

225
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,920
This is a picture of Liu Xizhao being naked.

226
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,640
How could you do such a shameless thing?

227
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,120
You think the girl in the picture is me?

228
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,600
How dare you deny it?

229
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,400
You fooled around with a man

230
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,440
and let him draw such a dirty picture of you!

231
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,160
You are really a slut.

232
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,440
Fourth Young Madam.

233
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,120
I found this from Young Master Shaozhen.

234
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,510
We've found that you two have an affair.

235
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,640
See it for yourself.

236
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,880
The woman in this picture is you.

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,160
And the seal mark on the picture

238
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,480
says

239
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,600
Xizhao.

240
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Greetings, Young Master Shaozhen.

241
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm here to get the monthly allowance for Eldest Young Madam's house.

242
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,040
Please sign here.

243
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,600
Young Master Shaozhen.

244
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,460
Let me take a look at this picture.

245
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,520
Oh!

246
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,100
This...

247
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:58,800
This...

248
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,460
Isn't she Fourth Young Madam?

249
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,360
Oh my god!

250
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,470
Bing.

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,730
Do I really have something to do with Lu Shaozhen?

252
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,120
Guards!

253
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,960
Take her down and throw her into the pool.
