1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,060
Is this the aura of an emperor?

3
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,620
It’s indeed somewhat intimidating.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,320
What smells

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,640
so good?

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,720
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,800
It seems to be the fragrance of the wine

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,560
Mrs. Lu spilled on the table.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,200
What kind of wine has such a unique aroma?

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,800
Your Majesty,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,520
this wine was specially brewed by me.

12
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,040
If Your Majesty wants to try it,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,640
I can pour you a cup.

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,800
It's not proper

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,760
for His Majesty to sample your craft.

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,040
Your Majesty,

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,970
this wine is distilled and brewed,

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,480
with a unique taste.

19
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,680
It has a rich body

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,680
and a long aftertaste.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,040
The fragrance lingers in the empty cup.

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,480
If Your Majesty is concerned,

23
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,080
I can

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,720
drink a cup first.

25
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,040
Very well.

26
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,320
Then I shall have a cup too.

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,080
Go.

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
It smells good.

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,360
I want to try it too.

31
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,480
Yes, I want to try it too.

32
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,920
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

33
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,720
Thank you.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,120
-It's good.
-Good wine.

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,400
Someone,

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,600
pour me a cup as well.

37
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,640
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,079
It's alright.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,530
Pour me another cup.

40
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,280
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,760
You can't drink anymore.

42
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,880
Don't worry.

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,360
Your Majesty.

44
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,640
This wine is quite strong.

45
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,360
You should sip it slowly

46
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,130
and savor the subtle sweetness within the taste.

47
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,880
Good wine.

48
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Good wine.

49
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,960
This is indeed good wine.

50
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,820
If His Majesty approves, then it truly is good wine.

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,240
What is

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,079
the name of this wine?

53
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,000
Your Majesty.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,860
This wine doesn't have a name yet.

55
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
The taste is smooth and fragrant upon entry,

56
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,040
with a sweet aftertaste.

57
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,520
It’s like

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,880
Heavenly Nectar.

59
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Thank you, Your Majesty, for bestowing a name.

60
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

61
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,480
Rise.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,440
This wine greatly pleases me.

63
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,440
A reward.

64
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:18,880
Take it easy.

65
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,279
Lord Lu.

66
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,040
Mrs. Lu.

67
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,000
Remember to prepare some of this wine for me.

68
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,040
And for us as well.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,880
I’ll have someone come to your residence to pick it up later.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,610
Don't worry.

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,840
I’ll make sure to save some for all of you.

72
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you, Mrs. Lu.

73
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,520
It's my fault to act on my own.

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,560
But you don't have to be so angry.

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,560
I know you're usually decisive.

76
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,360
But I didn't expect you to be this decisive.

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,280
Everything is settled now.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,680
His Majesty even rewarded me.

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,140
Shouldn't we all be happy?

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,360
So it's my fault then?

81
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,320
That's not what I meant...

82
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,320
My Lord.

83
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Wait for me!

84
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,160
Don't walk so fast.

85
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,160
Young Madam,

86
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,200
you're amazing.

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,760
The entire mansion is talking about it.

88
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
They say the Emperor especially liked our wine

89
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,820
and even gave it a name.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,680
Isn't your lady incredible?

91
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,160
Now the Second Young Madam can no longer take credit for your work.

92
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,560
Now our wine has become the imperial wine.

93
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,080
Let those taverns that refused us regret their decision.

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,840
Great!

95
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:41,040
Great!

96
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

97
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,409
The rainy weather today is a good omen.

98
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,440
Encountering water signifies prosperity.

99
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,520
Our Tianchun Liquor Workshop is officially open!

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,280
Great!

101
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,840
Welcome.

102
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,360
Welcome.

103
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,940
Sometimes, in urgent situations, I can be a bit impulsive.

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,000
Please be more understanding.

105
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,360
Do you have any idea how dangerous it was yesterday?

106
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,000
If the Emperor had been angry,

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,060
how many heads would you have to lose?

108
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,200
But nothing happened, right?

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,240
Don't be angry.

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,860
I've already apologized.

111
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,540
One day, you'll suffer a big loss.

112
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,720
What loss?

113
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,450
Let's go.

114
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,920
I'll treat you to a drink.

115
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,360
If one drink isn't enough, we'll have two.

116
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,600
We'll drink until you're no longer angry.

117
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,130
Let's go.

118
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,040
Hurry.

119
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:09,920
Bing.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,400
I just did a rough calculation.

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,840
In a few days, we'll be able to make up the mansion's deficit.

122
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,640
Great.

123
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Fourth Young Madam.

124
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
We're out of grain for brewing.

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,400
I sent someone to buy some,

126
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,130
but they haven't returned yet.

127
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,680
We can't stop our business.

128
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
We must continue.

129
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,560
Ms. Zhang.

130
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,890
Where are you going?

131
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,650
Young Madam.

132
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,080
We’re out of wine.

133
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,610
We can only use the samples.

134
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,630
What do we do if we run out of wine?

135
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,000
In that case,

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,530
there's only one solution.

137
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,320
Limited pre-sale?

138
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,920
Yes, Second Young Madam.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,130
Tianchun Liquor Workshop is offering

140
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,650
a membership pre-sale.

141
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,840
Due to the high demand for imperial wine,

142
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,200
if you pre-pay 500 taels,

143
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,320
you get an extra bottle.

144
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,760
If you pre-pay 1,000 taels, you get the same wine that the Empress drinks.

145
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,120
It's limited to 100 people.

146
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,640
Only those who pre-pay will be able

147
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,280
to collect their wine in half a month.

148
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,760
The noble families are going crazy,

149
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,760
afraid they won't secure a spot.

150
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,320
How can they still do business without wine?

151
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,560
This year, the Marquis's Mansion didn't produce much grain.

152
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,360
I had already predicted

153
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,280
that she would run out of wine by now,

154
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,540
but I didn't expect her

155
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,720
to come up with the idea of pre-sales.

156
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,600
The wine is being promoted as so scarce now.

157
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,680
The harder it is to get,

158
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,600
the more people want it.

159
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,360
So, this Liu Xizhao

160
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
even knows this trick?

161
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,720
What should we do next?

162
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,880
Xueying.

163
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
Go to the Li's Mansion

164
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,530
and find my big brother.

165
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,120
Tell him I want to buy up all the grain

166
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,320
from farmers in and around the capital.

167
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,360
Have him use his connections

168
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,760
to buy up all the sorghum

169
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,080
from the distilleries.

170
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,600
Go.

171
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,240
Yes.

172
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,020
You, find my third brother

173
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,440
and have his fleet

174
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,560
stop any shipments from reaching the capital for now.

175
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,080
Yes.

176
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,880
Liu Xizhao.

177
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,360
I've already made sure you have no wine to sell.

178
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,360
Now, if I deprive you of grain to make wine,

179
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,160
let's see what you'll do.

180
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,780
So what if you have pre-sales?

181
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,320
You'll still lose to me in the end.

182
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,360
Mother.

183
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,160
This is the 80,000 taels

184
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,130
I managed to gather within a month.

185
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,160
Together with the 5,000 taels from the other shops,

186
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,890
it’s just enough to cover the mansion's deficit.

187
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,040
Xizhao.

188
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
Thank you for your hard work these days.

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,520
Mother.

190
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,440
I'm glad you're satisfied.

191
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,760
I didn't let you down.

192
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,120
I'm satisfied.

193
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,880
I'm satisfied.

194
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,920
This child

195
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,400
is indeed wise.

196
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,870
It's been a long time since I've seen Mother this happy.

197
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,560
With Xizhao managing the household,

198
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,620
Mother can finally enjoy some peace.

199
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,840
Hold on.
