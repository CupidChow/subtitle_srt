1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,720
Good.

3
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,680
Good.

4
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,320
Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,440
The rule for today's Who Is the Best Drinker competition

6
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,640
is very simple.

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,120
You drink two cups of the liquor made at our workshop

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,000
and cross the single-plank bridge.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,480
As long as you finish crossing the bridge

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,120
and don't fall from it in the end,

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,920
you will be rewarded 100 taels of silver.

12
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,360
Good.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,080
If you manage to do it for three consecutive days,

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,280
you'll be rewarded 300 taels of silver.

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,640
300 taels?

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,120
Hey.

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,520
You'd better cancel the competition if you don't have enough liquor.

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,580
Your liquor is far from enough for me.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,920
That's right.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,720
An eight-year-old kid in my family

21
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,520
drinks with a bowl this big.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,600
Look at her bowls. They're so small.

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,840
So ridiculous.

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,760
Everyone.

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,310
Our liquor

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
is very strong.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,520
Usually,

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,720
you may be able to finish three bottles of alcoholic drink.

29
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,600
But today,

30
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,640
you might get drunk after drinking three bowls of our liquor.

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,680
I don't believe

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,600
your liquor is that strong.

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,640
That's right. Such strong liquor doesn't exist.

34
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,440
Everyone.

35
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,650
This liquor of ours is indeed very strong.

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,720
You'd better not drink too much of it.

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,760
Otherwise, you may feel uncomfortable.

38
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,640
Fourth Young Madam.

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,200
I don’t believe we'll all get drunk

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,800
after drinking your liquor.

41
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,720
Right.

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you sure you're not exaggerating?

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,360
You can believe me or not.

44
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,220
Please have a try and you'll know.

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,800
I'm a famous for my large tolerance to alcohol.

46
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,930
Young Madam, do you dare to bet with me?

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,120
Right.

48
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,039
Do you dare?

49
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,300
You want to bet with me?

50
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,840
What do you want if you win the bet?

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,960
How about your liquor workshop?

52
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,440
She won't dare to have a bet with you.

53
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,160
That's a good bet.

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,960
If I don't get drunk after drinking your liquor,

55
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,520
you'll give me your liquor workshop.

56
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,720
If I do,

57
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,640
I'll give you 500 taels of silver.

58
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Good.

59
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,360
Will you have the bet with me?

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,960
So,

61
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,040
you dare not?

62
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,760
Then why do you keep saying your liquor is so strong?

63
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,800
You must be bragging.

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,280
I think

65
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,080
you'd better cancel the competition.

66
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,680
Yes, she doesn't dare to bet.

67
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,840
She must be bragging.

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,680
Fine.

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,360
I'll bet with you today.

70
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,760
If

71
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
one of you can be the winner for three consecutive days,

72
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,360
I'll not only give them 300 taels of silver

73
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,480
but also my liquor workshop.

74
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,640
Really?

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,520
Okay.

76
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,520
Deal.

77
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,240
Okay.

78
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,960
When you lose your liquor workshop to us,

79
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,070
don't regret and cry.

80
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,960
I hereby announce

81
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,079
the Who Is the Best Drinker competition

82
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,360
starts now!

83
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,440
Good.

84
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,640
Come on. Pour the liquor.

85
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
I'll definitely be the Best Drinker.

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,800
This is for kids.

87
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,800
Fill it up.

88
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,160
How strong!

89
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,680
Good!

90
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,000
Swallow it!

91
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,280
The rule says you must swallow it.

92
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,760
Why is he not swallowing it?

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,680
Come on.

94
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,880
Come down.

95
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,080
Good.

96
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,880
The liquor is really strong.

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,920
Let me try crossing the single-plank bridge.

98
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,440
If you cross the single-plank bridge successfully,

99
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,570
you win this ground.

100
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:25,880
Young Madam.

101
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,610
More and more people have come.

102
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,360
Soon,

103
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,890
our liquor will be famous across the capital.

104
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
I think he's walking stably.

105
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,800
Yeah.

106
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:11,800
Awesome.

107
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Good!

108
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,280
I announce

109
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,680
he

110
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
is today's winner.

111
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,760
Good!

112
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
Congratulations.

113
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Congratulations.

114
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,000
You are really good at drinking.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,240
The competition will continue tomorrow.

116
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,080
You're welcome to come tomorrow.

117
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
Okay.

118
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,730
Your liquor is not that strong.

119
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,640
Good.

120
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,700
Congratulations.

121
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,600
Everyone.

122
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,060
At the same time tomorrow,

123
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,080
the Who Is the Best Drinker competition will continue here.

124
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,640
If you want to win 100 taels,

125
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,200
you can sign up now.

126
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,159
Okay, I'll sign up.

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,880
Young Madam, how much did you drink?

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,010
You reek of alcohol.

129
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,400
You smell it?

130
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,720
It's so strong. How can I not smell it?

131
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,040
I only had a few cups and I reek of alcohol.

132
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,640
How come he drank two bowls

133
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,800
but didn't smell of alcohol at all?

134
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,000
Are you talking about the winner today?

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,640
Young Madam, you should rest early.

136
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,640
You'll be very busy tomorrow.

137
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,720
Bing, I told you that I preferred to get changed by myself

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,980
and that I would do it on my own from now on.

139
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,200
Do me a favor.

140
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,330
Ask Qingshan to keep an eye on today's winner.

141
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,840
I think he's suspicious.

142
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll do it later.

143
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,080
Wait.

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,760
There's one more thing.

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
Do you know

146
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,200
who can calculate when an eclipse of the sun will occur in the capital?

147
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,080
It's the Board of Astronomy's duty

148
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,710
to predict the weather.

149
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,520
You can turn to Fourth Young Master.

150
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,320
He knows them.

151
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,160
The Board of Astronomy?

152
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Good.

153
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,560
Young Madam.

154
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,320
We have found some information of the person you asked us to investigate.

155
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,760
What information have you got?

156
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,000
Qingshan said his name is Cai Hai.

157
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
He's a heavy drinker.

158
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,760
But he has another identity.

159
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,440
He is a magician.

160
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,280
Everyone, wait.

161
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,880
To ensure the fairness of the our competition,

162
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,400
please cooperate with Qin

163
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,880
who will check if you have anything on you

164
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,680
that can help you cheat.

165
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,440
How are we going to cheat while drinking?

166
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,880
It's not necessarily impossible.

167
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,800
Excuse me.

168
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,040
Go on.

169
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,570
Young Madam.

170
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,240
Is he really able to drink so much?

171
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,120
Wait.

172
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,040
Fourth Young Madam, what are you doing?

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,170
Are you afraid that I'll drink too much

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,160
so you regret?

175
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,560
You're so good at drinking.

176
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,960
I think you'll be the winner again today.

177
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,520
Then I'll thank my opponents

178
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,100
for not trying their best.

179
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Good.

180
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,060
Gentlemen.

181
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,850
Next, please cross the single-plank bridge.

182
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Good!

183
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,280
Congratulations.

184
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,800
The man has won again!
