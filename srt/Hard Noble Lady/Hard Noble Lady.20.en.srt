00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,200
My Lord,

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,040
the team escorting Song Huan is almost at the government office's gate.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,120
What about Huang Xin?

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,980
Where is he now?

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,560
As per your instructions,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
we've brought him to the government office for brief questioning.

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,720
Should we let him go now?

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:30,520
Yes.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,840
When he gets to the government office's gate,

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,300
we’ll put on a show for him.

12
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,240
Whether it will work or not

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,640
depends on this attempt.

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,280
Yes.

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,800
Are there any clues you haven't told me?

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,160
No.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,970
It won’t help even if I told you.

18
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Why don't we

19
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,940
set a trap and wait for them to fall in?

20
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,920
Alright.

21
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,480
For the sake of our mutual cooperation and benefit,

22
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,000
I’ll give you a clue.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:03,800
A few days ago,

24
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,040
I ran into Third Sister secretly meeting

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,360
with Huang Xin

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,130
at the Star-reading Pavilion of the Board of Astronomy.

27
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,160
Third Sister?

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,440
A secret meeting with Huang Xin?

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,200
Could it be that Huang Xin’s backing is Third Sister?

30
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,960
Third Sister comes from a noble family.

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,000
In terms of capability,

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,520
she does indeed have the qualifications to run an underground private bank.

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,000
This clue is very timely.

34
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,240
After you capture him,

35
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,760
make sure to find a way to help me ask him

36
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,420
when the Heavenly Dog Eating the Sun will occur.

37
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,080
To catch Huang Xin red-handed,

38
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,160
it seems we’ll have to pressure him once.

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,440
He probably thinks we don’t have any evidence,

40
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,080
so he assumes we won’t dare to act against him.

41
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,280
But as long as we find a way to cut off Huang Xin’s contact with Third Sister

42
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,160
and make him believe that she has been captured,

43
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,960
he will definitely take action.

44
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's do it.

45
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
Third Sister.

46
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,680
Have you captured Huang Xin?

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Not yet.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,800
But he won’t escape tonight.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,280
Liu Xizhao,

50
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,240
I’ve always had a question.

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,680
Please go ahead.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,530
Did you really lose your memory or not?

53
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,760
Does it matter now?

54
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Actually, I didn’t come today to ask you

55
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,480
about the underground private bank.

56
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,370
I want to know how you want me

57
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,700
to explain your situation to Third Brother.

58
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,160
It doesn't matter.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,520
I’d rather believe

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,160
that none of this is real.

61
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
Everyone has their own fate.

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,720
I accept it.

63
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:26,920
Yes.

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:28,880
Follow me.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,080
My Lord,

66
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,480
will we really run into trouble this time?

67
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Just in case,

68
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,080
that person has already been captured.

69
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,080
Burn all the bills and letters.

70
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,080
Okay, okay.

71
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,680
Let’s hope

72
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,940
this person is dead and left no evidence.

73
00:04:59,360 --> 00:04:59,960
My Lord,

74
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,480
what should we do then?

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,240
We?

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,120
Come.

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
There's no "we."

78
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
There's only you.

79
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,160
Take the criminal Huang Xin back to the Imperial City Division for a thorough interrogation.

80
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,640
Yes!

81
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Third Sister,

82
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,760
my people have already found the usury loans

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,400
and related contracts from Tianxi Pawnshop

84
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,680
that were issued

85
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,020
by the underground private bank.

86
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,920
For such a big deal,

87
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,050
Huang Xin couldn’t have done it alone.

88
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,520
Huang Xin

89
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,580
is quite weak-willed.

90
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,810
With just a bit of pressure,

91
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,680
he confessed everything

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,280
and admitted that he colluded with you.

93
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
So that's true.

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,810
Since he has confessed,

95
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,640
why are you asking me?

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,400
From this remaining ledger,

97
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
it’s clear that

98
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,520
you are responsible for the deaths of dozens of people.

99
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,850
This is a capital crime.

100
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,160
Don't you have anything to say?

101
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,960
No.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,280
I did it all by myself.

103
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,880
Huan.

104
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,159
Why did you do these things?

105
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,010
Why are you here?

106
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,580
I don't want to see you.

107
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,200
Third Sister,

108
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,360
the underground private bank case

109
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
has attracted the Emperor’s attention.

110
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,560
If you have any hidden truths, you should say them as soon as possible.

111
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,360
Lu Shaoyang,

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
it has nothing to do with others.

113
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,760
Huan,

114
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,000
tell us the truth.

115
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,580
Fourth Brother...

116
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,570
Fourth Brother won’t give you a hard time.

117
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,600
Huan.

118
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,920
Huang Xin and I have known each other since childhood.

119
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,380
We love each other but couldn't be together.

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,840
My father disapproved of him due to his low status.

121
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,040
So, even after I got married, I still couldn’t forget him,

122
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,880
so I helped him

123
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,210
amass wealth through the underground private bank.

124
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,840
Huan,

125
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,610
what are you talking about?

126
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,280
We’ve been husband and wife for so many years

127
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,810
and love each other so much.

128
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,370
It’s impossible that you would betray me.

129
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,159
Lu Shaoming,

130
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,360
I have never loved you.

131
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Everything I said

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,040
is true.

133
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:19,880
Divorce!

134
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,440
Immediately divorce her!

135
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,100
She actually did such a thing!

136
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,780
And you want me to plead for her with His Majesty?

137
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,360
Father,

138
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,960
Huan is not a greedy person.

139
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,080
The details of the matter have been investigated thoroughly.

140
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,610
What else do you have to say?

141
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,120
Third Sister did indeed participate in the case,

142
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,880
but whether she was the mastermind

143
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,600
still needs

144
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,679
to be verified.

145
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,080
No matter how much she was involved,

146
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,270
our Marquis's Mansion

147
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,330
cannot have such a daughter-in-law!

148
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,880
His Majesty has already issued a decree

149
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,040
to close the case as soon as possible,

150
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,920
and the follow-up will be handed over to the Supreme Court.

151
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,200
The Noble Consort has pleaded for Third Sister,

152
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,360
and His Majesty has promised not to impose severe punishment.

153
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,520
I don't believe it.

154
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,840
I don’t believe that Huan did all of this.

155
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,880
Third Brother’s greatest wish

156
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,920
is to grow old with Third Sister.

157
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,440
I find this matter very strange.

158
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,600
Everything seems to have ended too quickly.
