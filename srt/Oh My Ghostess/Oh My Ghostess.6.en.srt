1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,560
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,040
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,680
What do I do?

4
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,800
Na Bong-sun, please listen to me.

5
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,080
My dad has passed out.

6
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,640
But, no one knows about it.
Please call an ambulance for me.

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,640
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

8
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,800
You're the only one who can help me.

9
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,160
Please, my dad's dying.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,600
Stop doing this to me. Just go.

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,960
He's my dad!

12
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,280
He's not just anyone. He's my dad!

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,680
How can I pretend not to notice?

14
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,080
Even if I'm a ghost,
how can I just stand and watch?

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,960
Please, just make one phone call Bong-sun.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,720
I'm begging you like this, huh?

17
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,520
(Na Bong-sun... Na Bong-sun,
where are you?)

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,080
This is 911, right?

19
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,280
This is Yongsan-gu, Unyuh-ryu, 247,
a small restaurant.

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,280
Please hurry up! My dad has passed out.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,560
Thank you, thank you.

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,800
What are you doing here!

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,400
-We couldn't start because of you.
-What?

24
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,680
-Hurry, let's go.
-Okay.

25
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,040
EMERGENCY

26
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,720
Alright, I'm coming!

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
-Ow, my arm... My arm!
-Hey, Na Bong-sun!

28
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,240
Hey, hurry!

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,240
What the heck...

30
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,200
The cast member is on standby with me.
We're going to shoot right away,

31
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,280
-so come in.
-Okay.

32
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,160
-Na Bong-sun, are you okay?
-What?

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,160
Well, yeah sure.

34
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,360
(This is driving me crazy.
I have to go to my dad now.)

35
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,240
Na Bong-sun, listen to me carefully.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
Don't be nervous.

37
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,880
Don't be so tense.

38
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,160
Don't listen to what others are saying.
Just work on the dough.

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,240
If you don't have enough flour,
I'll find a way somehow, okay?

40
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,520
Okay.

41
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,079
-There isn't much time left now.
-Yes.

42
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,600
-Both teams are getting busier.
-Yes, they are.

43
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,280
It looks like Chef Kang Sun-woo's team is
preparing a salmon and leek fried pancake.

44
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,560
Yes, but they just had the
misfortune of spilling their flour.

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,400
-They won't be allowed extra ingredients.
-Ah, this is too sticky.

46
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,880
This obstacle will be very difficult
to overcome.

47
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,920
Yes, it will.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,720
-Will they be lacking flour?
-Yes.

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,960
Oh! But, instead of the flour...

50
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,680
They're mixing in bean powder and
roast grain powder.

51
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,920
-Can one make a dough in that way?
(-Dad, wait a little longer.)

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,720
-I'm not sure.
(-I'll be there soon, Dad.)

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,560
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 6

54
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,160
-Good work everyone.
-Yes.

55
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,040
-Chef Kang, that was really great.
-You did great.

56
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
-Thank you.
-You are really talented.

57
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,960
-Congratulations.
-Yes, thank you.

58
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
-Good work.
-Good job, everyone.

59
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,280
EMERGENCY ROOM

60
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,360
Dad...

61
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,640
Where is he?

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,400
-50.
-50.

63
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,360
-100.
-100.

64
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,040
-100.
-100.

65
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,280
Oh, Dad...

66
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,920
Oh! Oh, Dad!

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What a relief. You're okay, right?

68
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,640
I was so scared.

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,120
We do need to examine him some more.

70
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
But, it looks like early-stage
hepatocirrhosis.

71
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,360
What? Hepatocirrhosis?

72
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,040
Yes. It looks like hepatocirrhosis
due to alcohol.

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,720
Thankfully, it's not too far progressed.

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,640
As long as there's no inflammation, he'll
be able to receive outpatient treatment.

75
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,880
-Oh, okay.
-Of course, he'll need to stop drinking.

76
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,920
Yes, of course. Thank you, Doctor.

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,440
Thank you!

78
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,240
I'll fix your pillow for you.

79
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Thank you.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,480
You really are better than my son.

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,680
But, how did you know I was here?

82
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,400
I stopped by your store and a
neighbor said that an ambulance took you.

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,480
You really could've been in trouble!

84
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,040
You're lucky that it's not that bad.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,760
I told you to cut down on your drinking.
Even your face has gotten so dark.

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,200
You drink that much on an empty stomach.
Of course, your liver would suffer.

87
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,640
Hearing you lecture me like that,
you really do remind me of my daughter.

88
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,680
Huh?

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,720
I'm sure you didn't mean to just now...

90
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,040
But, you called me 'Dad'.

91
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,560
In my half-asleep state,
I actually thought my daughter came back.

92
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,040
It was only for a brief moment,

93
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,520
but I still liked it.

94
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, you...

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,840
You can think of me as your daughter.

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,640
I suppose so.

97
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,040
I already feel like you are my daughter.

98
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Yes.

99
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,720
Dad! Dad...

100
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,840
-Dad!
-Oh my.

101
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,480
-Dad!
-Oh my, hey kid.

102
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
What's with all the fuss? I'm fine.

103
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,400
Do you know how scared I was when I
heard you were taken in an ambulance?

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,520
Just like my sister...

105
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
I thought I was going to be an orphan.

106
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,080
-You're really mean!
-Oh my.

107
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,280
Why I ought to just...

108
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
Hey! You say that you're so worried,
but you let him get this bad?

109
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,640
What the heck? Why are you here?

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,560
-Follow me. We need to talk.
-Talk about what?

111
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
Follow me, you punk!

112
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,240
Let go of me.

113
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,720
-Gosh.
-It hurts! I said, let go!

114
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,080
Hey, when are you going to pull
yourself together?

115
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,280
Dad has hepatocirrhosis, you punk!

116
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
Hepatocirrhosis? Is it severe?

117
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,159
If it were, you'd already be dead.

118
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,800
You need to really get it together.

119
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,280
What have you been doing all this time,
while Dad's been getting ill?

120
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,920
You should've stopped him from drinking.

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,400
You're outright dropping honorifics now.

122
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,200
Is this the time to bring that up?
When his life is on the brink?

123
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,400
He's my dad, not yours.

124
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,520
If anyone's sad, it's me and
if anyone's worried, it's me.

125
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,160
Why are you pretending to be his
daughter-in-law already?

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,840
Even if you are crazy about me...

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,320
Hey, punk. Seriously?

128
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,640
Please, pull yourself together already.

129
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Dad has to be admitted and
get tests done all day today.

130
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,360
You better not play games all day
and sleep.

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
Take good care of him.

132
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,440
She's the first woman to hit me
on the head.

133
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,120
Besides my sister, that is.

134
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
Chef Kang.

135
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,120
Congrats on your second win.

136
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,720
Bean powder salmon pancake.

137
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,880
It was a fresh idea.

138
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,800
Don't do 'tag' concepts again.
It's not a game.

139
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,120
I can't do anything about it.
We had to change the format somehow.

140
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,520
What about Bong-sun?

141
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,440
She ran out in a hurry? Is she okay?

142
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
I really don't know if she's okay or not.

143
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,680
To be honest, I just got called in
by the CP.

144
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,640
He must have been watching us shoot.

145
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,720
He feels that we nearly had a broadcast
accident today.

146
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,240
And that, perhaps, it's obvious the
assistant chef is inexperienced.

147
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,760
You got in trouble?

148
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,480
Getting in trouble isn't the issue.

149
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,480
The CP would like to change the assistant.

150
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,920
Who, Na Bong-sun?

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,360
The assistant's role is only going
to get bigger.

152
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,320
What if something like today
happens again?

153
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,200
Yeah, but still...

154
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,120
Didn't you guys say that she needs
to stay on for the sake of continuity?

155
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,440
Does your station usually go back
on their word like that?

156
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,240
And cut people from shows over
one mistake?

157
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,760
Why are you reacting this way?

158
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,720
From the CP's point of view,
he could see it this way.

159
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,880
Forget it. I have no intention
of changing.

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,720
If you want to get rid of her,
get rid of us both.

161
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,240
Also...

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,560
The bean powder salmon pancake...
That was all Na Bong-sun's idea.

163
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,320
She covered up for her own mistake.

164
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,400
I'm going now.

165
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,040
Sun-woo, why are you being so sensitive?

166
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,440
So-hyung,

167
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm not the one being sensitive.

168
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,920
You... No, you guys are the ones
being insensitive.

169
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:12,880
When it comes to my employees, I keep
my eye on them for at least six months.

170
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,040
And if it's really not working out,
I find them something else before they go.

171
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,360
Why?

172
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,000
That's just common courtesy between
people.

173
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,400
It's a huge relief that it's not any
worse than that.

174
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,960
Earlier today, I felt like the sky
was falling.

175
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,080
Gosh, Na Bong-sun... Is it you again?

176
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,720
I am sorry.

177
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,240
Just think of it as your destiny,
what can you do?

178
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
I promise I'll be good. Don't worry.

179
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,080
It's not like I'll do something awful.

180
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Goodness...

181
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,880
Is she not in yet?

182
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,920
Gosh.

183
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,960
She's a funny girl, that one.

184
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,120
She just ran out of there like that.

185
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,960
Where is she that she's still not back?

186
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,560
Her mind's not even stable right now.

187
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,240
(Hello?)

188
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,720
Na Bong-sun, where are you!

189
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,800
Why? Are you worried about me, Chef?

190
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,400
Worried, am I crazy?

191
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,880
Because of you, today I...

192
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
Where are you, anyway?

193
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,080
(I'm kind of far away,
so I can't really hear...)

194
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,960
(Hello, Chef?)

195
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,400
Hello?

196
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,560
Seriously, how far is she?

197
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,120
She has a grandma outside of the city.
Did something happen to her?

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,160
Tada! Surprise!

199
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,680
You said you were far away.

200
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,960
Even if I'm far, I can come quickly.

201
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,160
I'm someone who's always living in
your heart, Chef.

202
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,680
Oh right. How did that shoot go?
Did everything end well?

203
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,520
You were really startled before,
weren't you?

204
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,360
What is it?

205
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,320
Are you having a manic episode again?

206
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,120
Is it back again?

207
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,720
I don't know...

208
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:56,320
It seems it could be that way and
it seems it might not be that way.

209
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
Oh... Oh my!

210
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,520
Where do you think you're lying down?

211
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,960
Here, right here.
Can we lie down here together?

212
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,520
-Here, here, here... Lie down please.
-Gosh!

213
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,720
Get out.

214
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,200
Just for five minutes.

215
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,280
-I have something to say.
-Then, just one minute... One.

216
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
-I have something to say!
-Just one minute!

217
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,640
Seriously! Hurry up.

218
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,280
I have something to say.
I just can't talk to you in here.

219
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,960
Gosh, seriously.

220
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,480
Why don't you just tell me in here?

221
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,760
I'm not really liking outside.

222
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,920
No, wait, why does it matter?

223
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,360
Outside can be thrilling in its own way.

224
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,160
What is it? What are we going to do here?
Huh, huh?

225
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,720
We're going to talk...

226
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,080
-Oh, talk?
-We're going to talk.

227
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,440
Na Bong, what do you want to do
in the future?

228
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,280
-You know what.
-Stop joking around.

229
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,240
What's your real dream in life?

230
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,440
Dream?

231
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,160
Dream, you say?

232
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,000
I really only have one.
That's doing it once with you, Chef.

233
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,400
Are you going to keep joking around?

234
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,920
It's not a joke.

235
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,120
You're

236
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,080
not just cooking to
earn a living, are you?

237
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,600
Don't you really want to become a chef?

238
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,760
Well... Possibly.

239
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,840
Do you want proper training from me?

240
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,160
What? Training for what?

241
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,080
We're going to have to continue
going on TV.

242
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,760
There's no guarantee that something like
today won't happen again.

243
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,760
Looking at the burnt rice pollack stew and
today's bean powder salmon pancake...

244
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,960
I think you have good instincts and
some talent.

245
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,560
But, your basic knowledge is weak.

246
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,080
So?

247
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,480
You want to tutor me?

248
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,960
I'd like that. I'm in!

249
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't treat this like a joke.

250
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,880
If I do this,
I'm going to be really tough.

251
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,800
If you're too lax,
it wouldn't be very cool.

252
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,720
Being a tough guy is the best.

253
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm in, I'm in... Totally in.

254
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,840
Wow... Really.

255
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm in.

256
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,920
Okay, follow me.

257
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,960
You're starting today?

258
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,200
Wow, he really is being tough.

259
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,600
Consider yourself a beginner and
let's start with knife work.

260
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,800
Okay, this will be easy.

261
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:20,440
That's pretty good.
The sizes of these two are different.

262
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,680
-Yes.
-It's inconsistent.

263
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,200
What can you do to make it consistent?

264
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,560
Since it's slanted like this,
you should hold it up.

265
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,560
Oh...

266
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,560
It works well, right?

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,160
It really does.

268
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,360
Slowly, slowly. Be consistent.

269
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,920
If you cut an onion along
its natural lines... Here, look.

270
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,840
It has a good texture when you sauté them.

271
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,440
The texture is good, but it'll be less
sweet and it takes longer to cook.

272
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,280
But, try cutting the other way.

273
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:56,520
If you cut the other way,
the sweetness will come out faster.

274
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,040
Because the juices come out.

275
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,160
And requires less time to cook,
but it becomes soggier like this.

276
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
It turns into mush.
Then, what happens to it?

277
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
-You mix it?
-Oh, bingo.

278
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,240
You're smarter than I thought you were.

279
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,640
When I was in school,
I was always ranked in the top ten.

280
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,120
-Okay, just chop.
-Okay.

281
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,760
Can't even pay you a compliment.

282
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,680
My arms hurt so much.
I really can't do this anymore.

283
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,080
You have to master cutting in order to
move onto the next step. Hurry up.

284
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,240
Darn it, why am I suffering like this?

285
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,960
-Ouch, I cut myself. I cut myself!
-What is it?

286
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,800
-Hey!
-Blood, blood...

287
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
-You want to die?
-No.

288
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
Let's just give it a rest now.

289
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,840
If we keep doing this,
I might just attack you, Chef.

290
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,360
You have time for jokes.
Hurry up and chop these.

291
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,800
Let's stop now, huh?
Are we going to stop or keep going?

292
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,680
-Okay, just let go.
-Are we going to stop or what?

293
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,600
-Let go, let go.
-What will you do?

294
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,640
-We won't do it.
-Will you keep going? Will you?

295
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,360
-Are we stopping? Huh?
-We'll stop, we'll stop.

296
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,560
-Really?
-Okay, let's stop.

297
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,400
Even though we're stopping,
can we stay like this?

298
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,800
I said, let's stop!

299
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,400
This is nice!

300
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,280
If she sleeps alone, this is like a hotel.

301
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,760
She has no clue that this is all
thanks to me.

302
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,600
Na Bong-sun, that girl is so ungrateful.

303
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,600
These lessons really are tough.

304
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,440
Still, they say a man and woman shouldn't
sit next to each other

305
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,000
from seven years old and on.

306
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,240
Spending all this time together can
lead to...

307
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,360
Oh my goodness!

308
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,040
I wonder what my man of vitality is doing.

309
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,200
Maybe he took a shower and
is completely naked.

310
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,040
(Chef, are you sleeping?)

311
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,400
That was a really close call.
Wow, amazing.

312
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,640
She really has odd timing.
She takes every opening.

313
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,480
This is unnecessary for people
living together.

314
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,400
You don’t give people an opening!

315
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,960
Hey, dog!

316
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,520
Why don't you acknowledge me?

317
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,280
Are you ignoring me like this just
because I told you to be quiet?

318
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,200
Huh?

319
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,680
Okay... I suppose you have your pride too.

320
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,920
Fine, let's not even make eye contact
if we don't have to.

321
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,880
Sleep.

322
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,760
What's this... What is all this?

323
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,120
-What's this?
-What is this?

324
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,280
Good morning!

325
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,200
-Bong Bong Roo Bong!
-Yes!

326
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,400
What is this?

327
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,360
What do you mean?
It's chopped up vegetables.

328
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,240
Yeah, so why is it there?
No one told anyone to do this.

329
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,440
I did it.

330
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,720
Do I need your permission to chop
vegetables?

331
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,800
No, Chef. You should've told us.
We could've done it.

332
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,680
-What's the special?
-Shrek pasta.

333
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,320
To be more precise,
I developed it on June 28, 2015.

334
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,720
And I received applause from the staff
for today's special, spinach Shrek pasta.

335
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,960
Okay, let's do the vegetable spring rolls
for today's special.

336
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,120
Yes, the vegetable...

337
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,240
What?

338
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,520
How can you suddenly do that?
I waited so long for today.

339
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,280
We need to use the ingredients we
have first. Do the Shrek pasta tomorrow.

340
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,400
-Yes. Chef.
-Yes. Chef.

341
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,160
Check for the rice and stock. Let's go.

342
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,280
-Yes. Chef.
-Yes. Chef.

343
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,960
I upgraded the recipe because he said
we're doing Shrek pasta for special.

344
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,960
Can he just change the menu like this?

345
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,640
The special is always up to the chef.

346
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,680
You...

347
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,680
(Speaks Chinese)

348
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,400
Why did you say you did it?
You should've just said I did.

349
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,960
Do you think Min-soo would be happy
if his special got pushed because of you?

350
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,360
And you...

351
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,120
Don't tell others about me teaching you.
People will misunderstand.

352
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,520
-What misunderstanding?
-Hey...

353
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,920
Hey!

354
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,040
Whatever the misunderstanding is...

355
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,960
He's kind of cute when he gets angry.

356
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,240
I want to do it more
when you're like that.

357
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,280
What do you want to do?

358
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,240
What?

359
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,960
Exercise... Exercise.

360
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,160
Why am I feeling so stiff lately?

361
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,400
-Ah...
-Yes.

362
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,720
-Bong-sun, you must feel better today.
-What?

363
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:44,360
Your face looked dark again lately,
so I was worried about you.

364
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,640
I'm so grateful for your concern.

365
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
I do find it a bit burdensome.

366
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,280
VEGETABLE SPRING ROLL SALAD

367
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,560
Oh right! Dad's being discharged today.

368
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,120
Who's this?

369
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,920
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

370
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,800
Where are you right now?
Did your father get discharged?

371
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,680
He just did. Why?

372
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,640
If you were so curious,
why didn't you come?

373
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,680
Be quiet. You take good care of him, okay?
Feed him and all that.

374
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm busy. Bye.

375
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Hello?

376
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,720
When did she get my number?
She's so shocking.

377
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,440
Is that Bong-sun?

378
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,480
She really is a smart and strong girl,
the more I see her.

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,480
She has a lot of affection too.

380
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,560
Don't open your heart to her yet.
I haven't decided if I like her or not.

381
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,560
Gosh, kid.

382
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,080
NA BONG-SUN

383
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,960
KOREAN FOOD

384
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,360
What are you doing, Officer Choi?

385
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,360
Mister!

386
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,280
Oh my... Oh...

387
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,520
I came by while patrolling.

388
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,200
I was so shocked when I heard you were
taken away on an ambulance.

389
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,760
Oh dear, I see.

390
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,560
But...

391
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,200
Is it really okay for you to be
discharged this soon?

392
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,800
Thankfully, it was discovered quickly.

393
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,360
My liver isn't well, but I will receive
outpatient treatment.

394
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
What a relief.

395
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,520
But...

396
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,560
Who found you here?

397
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,000
We don't know.
That's a mystery for us too.

398
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,360
The emergency workers say that his
daughter reported it.

399
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,320
It's not like my dead sister
came back to life.

400
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,000
-Daughter?
-Yes.

401
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,160
Goodness, I'm sure they got something
wrong.

402
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,440
Wait now. I should get you something
to drink.

403
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,360
-No, please sit.
-No, no, no.

404
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,920
Here, have one.

405
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:24,240
I'm always sorry and grateful to you,
Officer Choi.

406
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,400
You always continue to come here.

407
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,880
Oh, don't say that Mister.

408
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,200
Take care of yourself and
cut back on the drinking.

409
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
You have to think about your age now.

410
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
You're right.

411
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,800
Bye now.

412
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,480
Today's spicy noodle tastes really good.

413
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,280
This tastes good?
All I can taste are veggies, not noodles.

414
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,400
What is this vegetable fiasco?

415
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,240
Vegetable spicy noodles and spring rolls.
Still, we have more vegetables left.

416
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,240
But, didn't we get good feedback
from the customers?

417
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,080
It was a popular dish during lunch.

418
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,840
Chef is the one that created that recipe.

419
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
Really?

420
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,960
Wow, so creative!

421
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,640
Oh, don't you think our Chef is amazing?

422
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,800
He probably created more than a
100 menu items.

423
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,480
That's amazing.

424
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,600
He really is a Chef after all.

425
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,640
Next to a professional, there's a true
professional that provides support.

426
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,960
And that's me.

427
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,720
How many times have I taste-tested
his food?

428
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,080
Considering that,
you can't ignore my skills, right?

429
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,320
You guys all know, right? That all the
dishes I approved made the menu.

430
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,560
That's not true.

431
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,080
Only the items you didn't like became
super popular.

432
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,200
What is he saying?

433
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,200
Come on now. Let's not do this.

434
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,600
Our Sous Chef is the best!

435
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,160
The entire nation knows about our
Sous Chef's good sense.

436
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,240
National Sous Chef,
let's have a bite together.

437
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,120
Cheers, cheers.

438
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,280
If you're done eating, Bong, come with me.

439
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,680
To the seafood market.

440
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,440
-What? Seafood market?
-Yes.

441
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
Again?

442
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,080
Chef, you took her to the market
yesterday too.

443
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
There'll be too much to carry. That's why.

444
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,320
Min-soo, you should prep spinach Shrek
for the dinner special.

445
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:23,960
Gosh...

446
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,600
Thank you! I'll make sure it's fully
prepared.

447
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,760
-See you later.
-Okay.

448
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,240
How long has it been?

449
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,040
-Where's the spinach?
-In the fridge.

450
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
-In the fridge? Okay.
-Yes.

451
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Anyway, our Chef is taking Bong around
like she's gum stuck on him.

452
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,840
Right?

453
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,200
He treats her completely different
from the way he did before.

454
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,600
He looks at her differently.

455
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:52,680
His looks are full of love.

456
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,480
Is flip-flopping the fad these days?

457
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,920
Bong flip-flops. Chef flip-flops.

458
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,600
-Brother-in-law!
-Yes.

459
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,920
Are you going somewhere?

460
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,200
Yeah, buying bass and scallop at the
market with her. Looking for Eun-hee?

461
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,000
Yup, we're supposed to go to
the hospital today.

462
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,560
Oh, yeah? Then after the hospital,
take her home.

463
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,000
She doesn't have to come back to work.

464
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,400
Wait, wait.

465
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,200
Hello.

466
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,880
You look like you're doing well today.

467
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,040
Yes, somehow.

468
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,160
You seemed to be having a hard time
at the police station, so I was worried.

469
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,280
I'm relieved.

470
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,720
Police station?

471
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,560
Yes,

472
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,080
a few days ago in the early morning.
You don't remember?

473
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,760
A few days ago... Right!
Police station. Yes, I remember.

474
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,920
Right? I was like that.
At the police station.

475
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,960
Hey.

476
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
Go.

477
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,080
Bye now!

478
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,280
Bye!

479
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Pay attention and look closely.

480
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,400
Those who cook need to have discerning
eyes for the ingredients.

481
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,640
-As for discerning eyes, I have them.
-Stop playing around.

482
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,080
Discerning eyes just don't happen.

483
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,320
You need to touch and feel them.

484
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,640
What are you doing?

485
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,760
-You said to touch and feel them.
-Food.

486
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,120
-Food.
-Seriously.

487
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,720
I just want to have a bite.

488
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,640
-Aunt!
-Oh, my son!

489
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,840
-You came.
-Yup, you got a perm.

490
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,880
Of course, nobody has eyes like you.

491
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,120
-I admit.
-You look so pretty.

492
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,840
I want to buy you a hairpin,
but you might cheat on me, so I won't.

493
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,480
I know they are just empty words.

494
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,200
But why do they still make me feel good?
Maybe because you're good looking?

495
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,160
Right? You just need to have the looks.

496
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,760
Did the scallops come in this morning?

497
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:50,080
It came from the East Sea just now.
They are fresh.

498
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,520
Take a look. It's completely shut,
you don't even have to look.

499
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Oh, looks good. I'll take 5 kg of these.

500
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,160
5 kg that's more like 6 kg,
you know, right?

501
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,120
Of course, you think I'll ignore the
compliment that I'm pretty?

502
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,680
Move, move.

503
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,200
So cold!

504
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,440
Oh, no. What do I do?

505
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,600
So cold!

506
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,960
Here, put these on.
Aunt is lending them to you.

507
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,720
They are too shapeless.

508
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,720
We're not here for fun.

509
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,760
We have to walk a lot more,
so hurry up and put them on.

510
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,600
I think it'll be too big.

511
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,320
Let me see.

512
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,880
Well, I...

513
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,600
I mean... If you were going to
bring a pair...

514
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
You should've brought a pair that
was prettier.

515
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,920
Shut your mouth before I put
the plastic bag over your face.

516
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,200
You're doing all sorts of things, huh.

517
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:00,600
Looks so yummy.
This place must be really good, right?

518
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,200
Thank you for the food!

519
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,960
Why? What now?

520
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,440
A chef eats with her eyes, her nose and
then her mouth. A total of three times.

521
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,640
-What are you saying?
-First, you look,

522
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,760
and then with your nose

523
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,760
smell the food like this.

524
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,160
Gosh, not like someone would
say you're not a chef.

525
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,720
Look!

526
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,200
And then smell! But what is this smell...

527
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,880
Oh, my. Why would someone not finish this?

528
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,760
What are you doing?

529
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
Someone left this behind.
Don't you think it's a waste?

530
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,920
It doesn't even
look like it's been touched.

531
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,640
Um, can I ask what you're doing?

532
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,960
Oh, I was wrong.

533
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,360
I'm sorry. I thought you were done.
I'm sorry.

534
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,160
I'm sorry.

535
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,760
I'm sorry, we thought you left.

536
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,240
Are you, by chance, Kang Sun-woo?

537
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
Yes, that's right. Yes.

538
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
Do you want my autograph?

539
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,840
Hey, you don't recognize me?

540
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:03,960
Daemyung Middle School,
first year class four. Park Jin-seob.

541
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,960
Wow, I used to talk about you
to Ki Young-jo's wife all the time.

542
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,400
How odd we meet like this here.

543
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,280
Oh, Jin-seob. Yes, long time no see.

544
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,880
Hey, it's really good to see you.

545
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,040
Anyway, what are you doing here
at this hour?

546
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,080
-You're here to buy ingredients.
-Right.

547
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
-That must be.
-Yes.

548
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,040
-I work around here.
-I see.

549
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,040
I'm supposed to meet our classmates
later tonight.

550
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,880
They will be happy to hear that I met you.

551
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,920
We occasionally talk about you.

552
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,120
Then do you guys want to come to
my restaurant later? My treat.

553
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,240
Oh, really? It'll be good for us,
of course

554
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,800
if a celebrity chef is treating us.

555
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,680
We're really going to show up.
You mean it?

556
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,200
Of course, I mean it.

557
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,240
Chul-min and everyone else will be coming?

558
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,040
Of course, I should tell them about it.

559
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,000
That friend, you two weren't close, right?

560
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,960
From the looks of it,
you weren't too thrilled to see him.

561
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,080
Let's not talk.

562
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,960
Kang Sun-woo.

563
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,120
Why are you walking this way?
You're disrupting our game.

564
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,840
-I'm sorry.
-Give me the ball. Hurry.

565
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,480
What an idiot.
Kicking the ball like a girl.

566
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,640
I'm sorry, Chul-min.

567
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Never mind. Isn't he a complete idiot?

568
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,760
He's the one that got hurt,
but he says sorry to me.

569
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,960
Dad!

570
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,000
Dad, I saw a god. Dad.

571
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,760
Goodness, kid. What's with the ruckus?

572
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840
Dad, look at this.

573
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,280
I went to sis' room to get scissors,
and this was open.

574
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,240
Must be her emergency fund.
Let's split it in half.

575
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,360
My money ran out. What a perfect timing.

576
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,120
Sis, thank you.

577
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,800
Leave it.

578
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,240
Put it back exactly the way
it was in her room.

579
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,160
What? Why?

580
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,160
Let's just use it.

581
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,280
I said to go put it back! Now!

582
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,960
Dad, you never let me touch
anything of hers.

583
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,120
It's only money.
Isn't it better we use it?

584
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
What's the point of keeping it there?

585
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,000
And her cell phone too.
You lecture me about my phone bills.

586
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,640
Yet you don't even cancel her cell
phone plan when her phone is missing?

587
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,080
Your dead daughter is more important
to you than me, right?

588
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,960
Stop talking nonsense.

589
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,640
Did I ever say anything that made sense?

590
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,880
Whatever.

591
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,240
That kid...

592
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,200
SOON-AE

593
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:12,280
(The customer's phone you're trying
to reach has been turned off...)

594
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,760
(After the beep, you will
incur a call charge.)

595
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,400
I told you I'll go back to the restaurant.

596
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,760
Brother-in-law told me to do this.
So, just rest for today.

597
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,160
You're okay, right?

598
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,880
Don't be too disappointed.

599
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,080
We can try again next time.

600
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,320
Don't worry. I'm really okay.

601
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,040
You should get going.

602
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
Okay, rest.

603
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,400
Oh, right.

604
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,200
Brother-in-law and Bong-sun.

605
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,280
Yes?

606
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,719
Were they always that close?

607
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,600
No, she was always scared of my brother.

608
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,320
But, they look like they became closer
since the show.

609
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,679
Oh, yeah?

610
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,199
But, Bong-sun.

611
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,480
Was she always so scatter-brained?
And forgetful?

612
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,800
What? No, she was too timid.

613
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,880
But, she seems a lot more cheerful
these days.

614
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,199
We laugh more often because of
Bong-sun these days.

615
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,800
Oh, really?

616
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,480
Why do you ask?

617
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,320
No reason.

618
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,800
PREGNANCY NOTEBOOK

619
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,480
I wonder if it's Sung-jae's old phone.

620
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,960
How many reservations do we
have for dinner?

621
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,720
About ten, why Chef?

622
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,400
My school friends are coming at 9,
so don't take any reservations after 9.

623
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,520
And no walk-in's either.

624
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,760
What's up? You don't usually meet up
with your school friends.

625
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,320
And can you guys stay an extra hour today?

626
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,520
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

627
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,240
Where is the table cloth
I bought in Italy?

628
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,480
You want to use it today?

629
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,200
You kept it aside for year-end.

630
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,040
Just use it. It'll become crap if
we just keep it.

631
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,240
Your uniform, is that all we have?

632
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,280
Didn't we order new ones last time?
Wear those.

633
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,840
The ones you have on make you look poor.

634
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,200
-Yes.
-Yes.

635
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,320
-And today's special...
-Will be spinach Shrek pasta, Chef!

636
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,560
Change it. To truffle escargot.

637
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,800
Isn't truffle really expensive?

638
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,960
And because you said Shrek was a go,
we prepared everything.

639
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,080
We can do it next time, next time.
That damn Shrek, seriously.

640
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,360
Will spinach rot? No, right?

641
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Go take out escargots.
We're doing truffle escargot pasta.

642
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,840
And there's ginseng we bought
for Chairman Kim, right?

643
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,880
Use that for radish kimchi.

644
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
-What? Huh?
-Radish kimchi?

645
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,280
Do as I say. Now.

646
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,600
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

647
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,360
Hold on.

648
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,400
Where is that again?
My certificates of merit?

649
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,480
The ones I received from
Hong Kong and Turkey.

650
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,400
My certificates... Where are they?

651
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,880
He says Shrek is a go and then it's a no,
then yes and no again?

652
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560
Does he think I'm some mongrel?

653
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,800
Damn it, should I strangle him
with spinach?

654
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,120
He is acting weird.

655
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,920
Not like the president is coming.
Why is he so concerned?

656
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,480
My thoughts exactly.

657
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,120
Truffles are one thing. I've never even
heard of ginseng radish kimchi.

658
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,480
Are they really important friends?

659
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,840
He's never behaved this way before.

660
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,720
Tie.

661
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,920
TODAY'S SPECIAL

662
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,360
STAR CHEF KANG SUN-WOO'S SPECIAL DINNER

663
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,680
Hey, Sun-woo!

664
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,920
-Oh, hey.
-Hey, Kang Sun-woo!

665
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,800
Wow, it's been forever.

666
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,800
-You've been well, right?
-How long has it been?

667
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,440
-It's been a while.
-How have you been?

668
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,160
Welcome!

669
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,960
-Hello.
-You don't need to greet.

670
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,960
They work for me. It's okay.
Come this way.

671
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,280
Still...

672
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,680
Why so intimidated? Hurry, come this way.

673
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,800
What are you guys doing?
Go in and get ready to receive orders.

674
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,120
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

675
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,280
-Wow, this is a real corporation.
-So cool.

676
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,160
-Wow, this is worse than the military.
-Well...

677
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,720
-They are your employees?
-Yes.

678
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,280
-You really are a chef.
-Really.

679
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
I don't see Chul-min.
Is he not coming today?

680
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,080
-Oh, he's coming.
-He'll come right after work.

681
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
-Yes, Chef.
-This is my Sous Chef.

682
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,360
Hello.

683
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,720
He's my direct report.

684
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,920
We'll start them with scallop salad...

685
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,480
And extra virgin oil, and
roasted abalone as appetizers.

686
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:51,240
As for the entree, should I decide
for you guys?

687
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,920
-Yes, yes.
-We don't know much.

688
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,360
Okay, as for entrees...

689
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,040
Actually, it'll be better if I just
place the orders.

690
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,400
-That chef...
-He's no joke.

691
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,640
Alright, I'll start listing the orders.

692
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,200
For table 3,

693
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,080
One scallop, three wagyus, two abalones.

694
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,720
For table 4, two wagyus, one sea bass,
and one crawfish. Alright.

695
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,800
Min-soo, you take pasta. Dong-chul, steak.
Ji-woong and Jun, salad.

696
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,560
Jun, you also take on serving.

697
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,120
Bong, you help Ji-woong and Jun.

698
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,040
-Yes, Chef!
-Copy that!

699
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,280
-Copy that!
-Fire up.

700
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,800
Fire!

701
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
What is this. This is... Wow.

702
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,720
Wow...

703
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,600
Let's first bring out the salad.

704
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,920
Yes, Chef.

705
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,720
Actually, no. Drinks first.

706
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,800
We have some cote roux, right?
Bring that out.

707
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,920
-Yes, Chef.
-Use crystal glasses.

708
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,600
Yes, Chef. What about appetizers
for the drinks?

709
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,760
We have prosciutto and Parmesan cheese.

710
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,960
Use common sense.
And bring out ginseng radish kimchi too.

711
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,040
Yes, Chef.

712
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,760
What's with him? Has he gone crazy?

713
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,120
I don't know what's up,
but he's clearly not sane.

714
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,040
How can you make radish kimchi
with ginseng?

715
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,960
Wild escargots and truffles...
They are ridiculously pricey.

716
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,520
It'll cost way more than 1 million won.

717
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,120
It's not my money, so whatever.

718
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,720
Just hurry up.
He'll bite your head off if we are slow.

719
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,080
Okay...

720
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,120
-Looks so cool.
-Hey, Bong!

721
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,240
Yes, Chef.

722
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,560
-Untie.
-Oh, okay.

723
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,320
This must be awkward for you guys.

724
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,040
Yeah, it's like you're a king.

725
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,240
You guys must be hungry.

726
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,680
Just wait a bit.
I prepared truffles and wagyu beef.

727
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,800
Stuff you guys can't eat every day.

728
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,200
Today, I'll impress you guys with
great taste.

729
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,920
Will our tummies get first-class treatment
thanks to our famous classmate?

730
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,440
-So happy, so happy.
-What time will Chul-min get here?

731
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,960
Not sure.
He said he'll come right after work.

732
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,840
-He should get here soon.
-I'm sure he'll come.

733
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,120
Yeah. He will.

734
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
Oh, he's here!

735
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,880
Chul-min! Here! Over here!

736
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,560
He's here,

737
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,440
-It's been too long!
-Goodness.

738
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,160
-It's been a while, Kang Sun-woo.
-Yes, long time.

739
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,920
Yoon Chul-min.

740
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,440
Isn't he a complete idiot? He's the one
that got hurt, but he says sorry to me.

741
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,560
-Sit.
-Hurry and sit.

742
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,920
Wow, it feels different to have
everyone in one place.

743
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,560
It's been ten plus years?

744
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,160
-More than that.
-Yeah, more than that.

745
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,800
I mean I changed,
but Chul-min changed a lot too.

746
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,800
Back then, he had wide shoulders,
charisma and all.

747
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,240
You really can't stop time.
His face really aged.

748
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,480
Really? It's because I couldn't shave
this morning.

749
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,680
Wash your face.

750
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,640
You should take better care
of yourself. Your waist...

751
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,800
What's with that?
Who would see you and I as classmates?

752
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:01,080
I know.
Chul-min's fat all went to his waist.

753
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,120
You should work out. Exercise.

754
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,400
He should just try not to gain
any more weight.

755
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,640
-You piggy punk.
-Gosh.

756
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,720
Wasn't Chul-min our school's top dog?

757
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,400
-Yeah, he was.
-Of course, yes.

758
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, right, right. Now I remember.

759
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,960
When we went to a convenience store,
didn't we all pay tax to him?

760
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,240
He really was charismatic then.

761
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,040
Hey, hey, stop. Why bring up the past?

762
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,880
True, it's not something you
would boast about.

763
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,480
No matter how young you were.

764
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,520
Why so serious all of a sudden?

765
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,920
Oh, Chul-min.

766
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I already told them before you came.
Let me know whatever you want to eat.

767
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,160
I'll prepare them for you all.

768
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,400
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

769
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,840
Like I used to give you food
as my tax payment to you.

770
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,080
I think he may have taken my money too.

771
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,160
Hey... Come on,
that happened a long time ago.

772
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,880
For cigarette money, right?

773
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:53,000
I was asked after you.

774
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,440
-I didn't give him money.
-Me neither.

775
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,720
Be honest. How much do you make?

776
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,520
That's a bit too much. Even for friends.

777
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,800
Is the pay good or bad?

778
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,880
It's not bad.

779
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,520
I get many offers to open up
a few more spots as a chain.

780
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,320
But, I don't like creating too much work.

781
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,960
And I don't like letting others use
my name just to imitate my dishes.

782
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,040
I'm a chef, not a businessman.

783
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,880
Wow, that's cool.

784
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,280
-He's a professional.
-He's a smart chef. Set to succeed.

785
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:25,520
Hey, I'm sorry, but I have to get going.

786
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,280
-Why? Where are you going?
-You should eat first.

787
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,400
I have a full schedule today.
I only came to see you guys briefly.

788
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,840
Next time, let's hang out properly.

789
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,600
There's so much more food to come.
Why are you leaving now?

790
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,920
Sorry, I have to go.

791
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,560
-I'm going. I'll call you guys.
-Hey! What!

792
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Wow.

793
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,400
Sun-woo. He changed so much, didn't he?

794
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,600
-He did.
-Yeah, he did.

795
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,200
Talk about total transformation.

796
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,400
No matter what,
people need to be successful.

797
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,240
Did you see just before?

798
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,280
He was already so full of himself.

799
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,520
'Yes, long time. Yoon Chul-min.'

800
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,800
-He's overflowing with confidence.
-Not that much!

801
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
Right? Who'd say that's the
same Kang Sun-woo

802
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,680
who used to get bullied by Chul-min?

803
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,960
No one would imagine.

804
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,640
Back then no one could've
even imagined this.

805
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,840
-Right?
-You were like that too.

806
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,840
I was, 'You were like that too.'

807
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,160
Hey, hey.
Why don't you stay a little longer?

808
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,760
This is disappointing.

809
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:24,120
I know. I'm sorry too.

810
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,240
Gosh.

811
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:30,640
I prepared many special dishes
because they said you were coming.

812
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,880
-Oh, really?
-Yes, come again.

813
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,440
Okay.

814
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,520
And, wait.

815
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,440
This is for your cab ride.

816
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,760
-Hey, that's okay.
-No, take a cab.

817
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,160
Hey, stop messing around.

818
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,520
-Hey, hey.
-Sun-woo!

819
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,960
I'm just happy to see you. That's all.

820
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,840
I'm just really happy to see you.

821
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,960
Thanks. Oh, yeah.

822
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,960
-Oh, your business card?
-Yes.

823
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,480
I'm actually in sales. I sell vacuums.

824
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,480
You're doing well.

825
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,760
You must know many retailers.
Can you make some intros?

826
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,800
Maybe because the times are bad,
I'm having a difficult time.

827
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,400
To be honest, I'm on my way
to treat a potential buyer.

828
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,400
They may not buy,
but I can't exactly bail.

829
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,640
My waist is all because of
too much drinking.

830
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,240
I should've taken care of my body
like you.

831
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:28,400
Well, that's normal.
I mean people our age...

832
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,280
-Anyway, I had fun today.
-Yes.

833
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,760
-See you again.
-Okay.

834
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,600
-Thanks for the cab fare.
-Yeah.

835
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,400
Bye now.

836
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,280
Chef.

837
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,800
Chef, no cooking lessons today?

838
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:38,480
Hm?

839
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,720
Just practice what you learned already.

840
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:45,560
But...

841
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,200
He must be in a really bad mood.

842
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,720
YOON CHUL-MIN

843
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,560
Customer, here's the buckwheat pancake
you ordered.

844
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,200
What is this?

845
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,680
There was some buckwheat flour,
so I tried making this.

846
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,640
It didn't seem like you were eating
anything before.

847
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,280
For your appetizer...

848
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,840
-Open your mouth.
-I'm okay.

849
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,000
Can you be a little considerate and eat?
Huh?

850
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,720
-You'll damage your stomach.
-I said I'm okay.

851
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,880
-I said no...
-Here you go.

852
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,320
-Gosh.
-What do you think?

853
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,040
I killed it, right?

854
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,720
You did a decent job with seasoning.

855
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,720
Chef, you must really be something.

856
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,640
I took just one lesson from you.

857
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,360
But my cooking skills improved
exponentially.

858
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,440
Gosh.

859
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,040
You flatter me and put me down.
Just put me back to my original state.

860
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,760
My... You're even more handsome
when you smile.

861
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,160
Oh, I really want to do it with you now.

862
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,320
Gosh, you were doing just fine till now.
Seriously.

863
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,240
-Stop saying you want to do it.
-Why?

864
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,680
I wake up in the middle of the night
because you shock me.

865
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,080
Why would you get shocked by that kind
of dirty talk? Wait, you're not a...

866
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,400
Oh, my, really?

867
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,360
I mean, why?

868
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,480
Why what? What are you thinking?
Who do you think I am?

869
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,520
You sure you're not?

870
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,600
Huh? For real? Really?

871
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:38,360
You are going to get shocked
at this rate. Okay?

872
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,080
Keep this up, and you'll get in trouble.

873
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,640
That's what I mean. I really want to get
in trouble with you. Please?

874
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:46,400
I really want to get in trouble.

875
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,960
You're so vulgar. Never mind.

876
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,720
What can I say to a person
with an illness.

877
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:52,840
Gosh, seriously.

878
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,840
In this day and age,
who is really free of mental illness?

879
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,920
My point is that we should all try
to live happily.

880
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,680
After I live out my life,
that's what I can say.

881
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,480
Life can be shorter than expected.

882
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,160
So what I am saying is...

883
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,920
Every single day is very,
scarily valuable.

884
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,960
You talk as if you lived your full life.

885
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,600
Stop nit-picking, okay?

886
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,200
My conclusion is that, if possible,
forgive. And maybe take a loss.

887
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:28,080
And live happily.

888
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,120
The one who forgives can sleep in peace,
but not the one who needs to be forgiven.

889
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:33,280
Don't you think?

890
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,520
If, even then you're still pissed off...

891
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,280
Then like this...

892
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,080
Drink up.

893
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,000
And eat something yummy like this.

894
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,560
And already you become happy. Right?

895
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,280
Right?

896
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,440
Yeah, you're right.

897
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,480
Gosh... Backwash.

898
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,840
At this point,
we take a confirmation picture.

899
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,320
What confirmation shot?

900
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,560
-What picture?
-Just one.

901
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,440
Why are you doing this?

902
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,280
Just one picture.

903
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,840
-Did it work?
-Yes.

904
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,760
Oh, they turned out well.

905
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,320
Oh wow.

906
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,760
The sky looks so pretty.

907
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,840
What are you doing now?

908
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,600
The mood is really nice.
Why not just lend me your leg?

909
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:49,480
It's not like it'll rot.

910
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,640
I feel tipsy because I drank.

911
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:58,680
I'll stay like this for just a moment.

912
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:12,640
The seasoning was good,
but the dough was too watery.

913
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:14,560
Your buckwheat pancake.

914
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,560
Where is that?

915
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,080
There's a place that makes really good
buckwheat pancakes in Hongdae.

916
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:20,760
I'll take you there as a learning
experience.

917
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,600
Really, when?

918
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,520
Whenever, we can go tomorrow.

919
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,880
Oh my, really? Tomorrow?

920
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,720
Promise... Promise me.

921
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,720
-If you’re awake, then go.
-No, I'm sleepy.

922
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,600
-What's with you again?
-I'm sleepy again.

923
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,040
-I'm so sleepy.
-Let go, let go of me.

924
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,000
-Let go of me.
-I just want to do it with you once.

925
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,840
Stop saying that, would you!

926
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,360
-Oh my...
-My back, my back!

927
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,920
Oh, no! Not your back. Are you okay?

928
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,680
Are you okay? You are, right?

929
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,400
Hey, Mister.

930
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,200
Oh, you came?

931
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,120
You're not even feeling well,
what are you doing? I'll do it.

932
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,600
It's okay. This, I can do.

933
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,560
What do you mean?

934
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,560
You ought to be lying in bed.

935
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,560
What's Kyung-mo, that punk, doing?

936
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,280
He's still sleeping, isn't he?

937
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,080
I made it clear to him to be good.
That kid just doesn't listen.

938
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,160
You really are like my daughter.

939
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,000
You talk just like her.

940
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,880
It's just that...
I find him so disappointing.

941
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,480
It's fine.

942
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,160
Kyung-mo needs someone who talks
to him like that.

943
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,200
Okay.

944
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,400
Are you feeling better now?

945
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,720
Why don't you close up for a few days
or admit yourself into the hospital?

946
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:40,520
Oh no. Hospitals are suffocating.
I don't like them.

947
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,240
Even the doctor told me it's better to
walk around and get exercise.

948
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,280
Oh, exercise?

949
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,040
It'd be good to walk to the
mineral spring.

950
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,480
Yes, it would.

951
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,200
I know there's one just right up there.

952
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,440
It's not easy to get started.

953
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,720
Would you like to go to the mineral spring
with me?

954
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,560
This place hasn't changed at all.

955
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,240
Ah... The air is nice.

956
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,360
Have you been here before?

957
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,960
I was passing by before,
so I happened to come.

958
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,560
-My daughter came here every morning.
-Oh...

959
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:23,360
She always asked me to go with her and
I never did go.

960
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,960
People sure are foolish.

961
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,800
They regret once everything's passed
and it's too late.

962
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:31,680
-You shouldn't do that.
-I won't.

963
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,520
Mister, do you want to try this?

964
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,240
Should I?

965
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,600
Oh... It's refreshing.

966
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,280
It is, right?
It feels like you're getting healthy.

967
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,960
I suppose so.

968
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,040
We should come here together from now on.
I'll go to your store in the mornings.

969
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,960
-Are you in?
-I'd like that.

970
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,320
Sure, I'm in.

971
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, I had way too much chicken yesterday.
The smell of grease is making me sick.

972
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,560
I must have overdone it too.
I had diarrhea first thing, this morning.

973
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:05,640
-Dong-chul.
-Yeah?

974
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:09,920
Because we went all out yesterday, we
probably spent half of our yearly budget.

975
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,680
Did you see his expression
when he was paying?

976
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,720
His mouth half open and half closed.

977
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,240
What's with all the gossip this morning?
Aren't you going to focus?

978
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,200
-Hey, Dong.
-Yes?

979
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,200
What's with your hair?
What's going on there?

980
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:28,440
Can someone who works in the kitchen
be this dirty?

981
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,680
-And Woong.
-Yes?

982
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,000
You need to cut down on your talking.
You really talk too much.

983
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,680
Use all that energy to work... To work.

984
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,360
Why is it so noisy this morning?
Is something wrong?

985
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,160
The kids were relaxing too much.

986
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,920
You're the one who needs to stop relaxing.

987
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,400
Thanks again for yesterday.

988
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,720
I'll pay you for overtime hours,
so don't worry about that.

989
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:54,960
Min-soo, put this sign outside.

990
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,360
That's not right. I don't do hard labor...

991
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,520
Yes, Chef.

992
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:03,840
Hey.

993
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,600
What is it?
You can't make the Shrek pasta?

994
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,880
TODAY'S SPECIAL
SPINACH SHREK PASTA

995
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,600
Is it for real?

996
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,600
The Shrek is the special today?

997
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,360
Put the sign out before I change my mind.

998
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,640
Did the flour come in today?

999
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,720
What is it?

1000
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,120
Is something going on
between you and Chef?

1001
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,200
Why? What?

1002
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,960
Then, why...

1003
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Huh?

1004
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:49,120
Never mind. What business is it of mine?

1005
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,000
But...

1006
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:58,600
Don't go and get hurt on your own...
like an idiot.

1007
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,120
What's that about? Huh?

1008
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,480
I don't know what he's talking about,
but sometimes he's really handsome.

1009
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,560
Why are you so late?
I was waiting for ages!

1010
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,040
It took me less than 30 minutes to come
after I hung up the phone.

1011
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:20,800
Gosh, you rotten...

1012
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,840
Am I your lover or something?

1013
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,760
Why are you always calling me and
asking to meet?

1014
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,080
And how much does this place charge
for a cup of coffee?

1015
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,800
It'll just come right out with your pee,
so why charge so much?

1016
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,600
You're so funny! You really are charming.

1017
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,320
Goodness, why have you fallen for me?

1018
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:43,000
You're telling me.
Once I like someone, I get obsessed.

1019
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,280
You're in trouble.

1020
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:47,960
What do you want? Iced Americano?
I'll go order it.

1021
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:51,320
Wait, wait... I like caramel macchiato.

1022
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,480
Really, that rotten...

1023
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,840
How come I'm not coming across real money.

1024
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,240
Instead, I get some idiotic professor
as a friend.

1025
00:56:58,640 --> 00:56:59,800
Gosh, seriously.

1026
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,600
This is all because of the virgin ghost.

1027
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,400
Where is she hiding that I can't
see her anywhere?

1028
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,560
But, I'm getting a very strange feeling.

1029
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,760
I'm sure she's hiding somewhere in
my vicinity.

1030
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,800
I have a bad feeling that I'm missing
something here.

1031
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,080
(-Hi, this is Yoon Chul-min.)
-Hi, Chul-min.

1032
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,360
-It's me, Sun-woo.
(-Oh, Sun-woo.)

1033
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,680
(-What's going on?)
-Oh, it's just...

1034
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,720
You know how you brought up the
vacuum cleaners yesterday?

1035
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,880
-I can...
(-Sun-woo, just forget I said it.)

1036
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,080
-Huh?
(-I regretted saying it when I got home.)

1037
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,760
(I don't know about others, but
I have no right to ask you for favors.)

1038
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,880
(I should have a conscience too.)

1039
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:14,600
No, it's okay.

1040
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,680
If you change your mind, let me know.
I can introduce you to many people.

1041
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,920
(Alright, thank you.)

1042
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,360
Okay, bye then. I'll go now.

1043
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,360
(-Sun-woo?)
-Yes?

1044
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,640
(I'm sorry about the past.)

1045
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,960
Forget about it, man.

1046
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,320
It's all in the past.

1047
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,960
Have a good life.

1048
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,200
I'll let you go now.

1049
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,000
Chef, what are you doing here?

1050
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,560
I was looking at something in the storage.

1051
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,840
Chef,

1052
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,760
you haven't forgotten about the
buckwheat pancake, right?

1053
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:07,400
I haven't forgotten, I haven't. Gosh...

1054
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,400
I have to drop by my house first.

1055
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,800
So, wait for me at the bus stop
intersection after work.

1056
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:13,760
-I'll pick you up.
-Yes, Chef!

1057
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,600
(Oh, it's D-day.)

1058
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,280
What should I wear?

1059
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,240
Oh, she is really too much... Oh my!

1060
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,320
What is this? Is this a sauna?

1061
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,640
Is this clothing or inhospitality?

1062
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,880
This won't do. No, no, no...
None of these will do.

1063
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,080
No matter what happens today,
I have to get laid with the Chef.

1064
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,120
What do I do with this?

1065
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,960
Be daring. Reveal a lot.

1066
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:03,240
I'll do this here and this...
and rip this here.

1067
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,640
Oh, it'll be okay.

1068
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:13,400
One, two, three

1069
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,240
This isn't bad.

1070
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:22,600
I have to the bottom too.

1071
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,680
He won't notice that I'm wearing
air freshener. Nobody will know.

1072
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:40,720
Why isn't she coming?

1073
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,760
It's not like it's a real date.
Why do I have to wait for her?

1074
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:58,880
This isn't too bad.

1075
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,160
Look at the time!

1076
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:06,520
Chef will throw a fit. I better hurry up.

1077
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,600
Who were you again?

1078
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,240
Stop your awkward acting, you wench.

1079
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,400
I know you possessed that body.

1080
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,760
I really have no idea what you're
talking about.

1081
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:29,600
I figured it all out, you wench.
You habitually possessing that body.

1082
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:32,560
I was thinking about it and
I realized I missed that one thing.

1083
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:33,440
Huh?

1084
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,760
When I went to Sun or wherever that is...
The sound of that bell!

1085
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,760
The assistant cook and the mix of chill
and vitality that was in that restaurant.

1086
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:42,720
-Sister.
-Sister, yeah right!

1087
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,880
-They say it's the darkest under the lamp.
-Oh, hello!

1088
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,240
-Hello?
-Oh my goodness!

1089
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,120
Hey, you! Stop right there!

1090
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,440
Sister!

1091
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,400
Just calm down, calm down for today.

1092
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,800
Wait till I get my hands on you.

1093
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,960
Crap, seriously!

1094
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,920
Sister, I just need today!

1095
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:04,760
Stop right there!

1096
01:02:06,600 --> 01:02:09,920
-Please stop.
-I'm coming to get you.

1097
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,320
Taxi, taxi!

1098
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:21,200
Here.

1099
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,800
Follow that bus.

1100
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:38,440
OH MY GHOST

01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:41,720
Cooking is like being a conductor
of an orchestra in the kitchen.

1102
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,600
-Okay?
-That's very cool, Chef.

1103
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,600

1104
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,200

an evil spirit and fight me?

1110
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,720
No, don't! No!

You're like someone on
the edge of a cliff.
