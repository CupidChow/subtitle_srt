1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,440
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,960
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,680
-Na Bong-sun.
(-Yeah?)

4
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,840
I found out.

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,920
'535-2368.'

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,000
It was a car plate number, as we thought.

7
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,800
Officer Choi's car.

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,680
(Really?)

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,080
I was trying to tell people through my
diary and phone before I died.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,880
Go and tell Chef, Na Bong-sun.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,200
I'll go see you later. Okay.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
I didn't know you had that much interest
in me, Officer Kang.

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,480
What was that about my car?

14
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,280
What are you so curious about?

15
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm not curious...

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,000
Goodbye.

17
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,640
You...

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,720
Who, exactly, are you?

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,960
53OH 2368

20
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,280
You finally made an appearance...

21
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
Shin Soon-ae.

22
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,480
I remember...

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
All of it.

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,560
Why did you do that to me?

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,520
Why me?

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,440
Because you saw something...

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,880
You shouldn't have.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,600
Still, how...

29
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,840
How could a person...

30
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,640
It would've been best if you went up
without harboring a grudge.

31
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,360
Why are you being so bothersome?

32
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,160
It's no use anymore.

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,680
Your evil acts are being
revealed to the world.

34
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,200
You won't be able to get away
with things anymore.

35
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,320
I know you've become one with that
body by now.

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
-Shut up!
-You're...

37
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,720
Going pay for your crimes
trapped in that body forever.

38
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,040
I told you to shut your mouth!

39
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,760
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 15

40
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,280
3 YEARS AGO

41
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,960
This is a sobriety checkpoint.
One deep breath and blow.

42
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,720
I see you recognize me,

43
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,839
Father.

44
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,320
How could I forget the eyes
that looked at my Myung-jin

45
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,560
as if you wanted to kill him?

46
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,360
I shouldn't have brought you home
without knowing your true roots.

47
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
You became a cop?

48
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,960
Why?

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,960
Can't I become a cop?

50
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,640
I suppose there's no reason why you can't.

51
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Either way,

52
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,040
let's not run into each other
even by chance.

53
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,440
Seeing you brings up the memories
I'd rather forget and it's distressing.

54
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,480
Wait a minute now.

55
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,800
I heard Officer Choi is working
the night shift today.

56
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,520
Should I make him his favorite dish,
stir-fried bone chops?

57
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
He'll get lots of strength from it!

58
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll start cooking now.

59
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,200
-Let's go on in.
-You got all wet.

60
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,320
Oh, I'm fine.
As long as you, my son, didn't get wet.

61
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,600
Oh my, oh my. You know I got wet too.

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,240
All right, Mom.

63
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,920
-No need to get jealous about that.
-Forget it, you two play together.

64
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,600
-Oh, seriously.
-

65
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,520
Goodness...

66
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Oh, right.

67
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,880
Should I buy ice cream...

68
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,840
For Myung-jin?

69
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Yes, yes.

70
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,320
I shouldn't be standing here like this.

71
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,240
Wait now...

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,480
Where should I go to buy the ice cream?

73
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,240
53OH 2368

74
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
Report it.

75
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,600
Oh, my phone!

76
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,920
This is 911, right?

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,560
I'm at Yongsan-gu, Unyuh-ryu...
In front of the Jangwol Mart.

78
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,000
Someone has been hit by a car.
Please come quickly!

79
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,240
53OH 2368

80
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,520
Hi, Officer Choi.
This is Shin Soon-ae from the restaurant.

81
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,720
Where are you?
I have something urgent to tell you.

82
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
Oh, Officer Choi.

83
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,000
You must be on your way back
from somewhere?

84
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,080
Oh... Yes, I was.

85
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
What's going on, Soon-ae?

86
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,960
Actually, I just witnessed a hit-and-run
accident.

87
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,960
I called the ambulance and they took
the person who was hit.

88
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,320
I think I saw the license plate of
the vehicle.

89
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,240
I was going to report it to the police,
but you came to mind.

90
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,120
You did good Soon-ae.

91
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,840
So, what was the license plate number?

92
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,160
'2368.'

93
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,520
I know for certain the last digits
were 2368.

94
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
2368.

95
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,000
53OH 2368

96
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,160
What... What is it Soon-ae?

97
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,960
I...

98
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,000
I suddenly remembered something
important...

99
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,400
My dad is drinking with his friends...

100
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,160
I told him I'd go pick him up.

101
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,480
I think I should go now.

102
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
I'm sorry.

103
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
(The person you're trying to reach...)

104
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,000
We're home now.

105
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Soon-ae! Soon-ae!

106
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,080
No... Soon-ae!

107
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,040
-Oh, Soon-ae!
-Sis!

108
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Be careful.

109
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,560
-Soon-ae!
-Sis!

110
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,160
Please calm down. Calm down.

111
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,360
-Soon-ae!
-Sis!

112
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,760
Soon-ae!

113
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Sis!

114
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,560
Soon-ae...

115
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,280
(I wasn't...)

116
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,000
(A virgin ghost.)

117
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,360
(I had died so suddenly
and couldn't go up.)

118
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,640
(I was just a ghost with a deep,
unresolved grudge.)

119
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,960
Why is it raining all of a sudden?

120
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,960
Gosh...

121
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,920
That wench said she'd look into
the license plate.

122
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,760
Why haven't I heard from her since?

123
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,800
I'm dying of curiosity for goodness sakes.

124
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,080
Oh my! You rotten...

125
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,360
How many times have I told you
not to stand there like that?

126
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,120
What is it?

127
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,600
What's going on?

128
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,640
Sis...

129
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,320
Do you by chance...

130
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,680
I remember.

131
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,280
Why I died and how it happened...

132
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,360
I remember it all now.

133
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,440
Are you all right?

134
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,320
Do you feel a bit calmer now?

135
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
That's why you were roaming this world.

136
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,600
You were killed off so suddenly by
that bastard.

137
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,440
It became a grudge.

138
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,360
From this point on,

139
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,880
you need to get your head on straight.

140
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,520
Your foe is someone that is possessed
by an evil spirit.

141
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,840
Now that he has seen your face,

142
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,520
he won't let things be, for sure.

143
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,040
(Shin Soon-ae, that annoying wench.)

144
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,000
(Where did she disappear to?)

145
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,360
-Officer Choi.
-Oh, hi Mister.

146
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,400
What's all that?
Should I carry some for you?

147
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,200
Oh no. I just bought some pork hocks.

148
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,760
The one from the market is quite good
and they give you a lot.

149
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,720
But, why did you buy so much?
Can the two of you eat all of that?

150
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,200
Of course, the two of us
can't finish this.

151
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,280
We have a guest at our place.

152
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,680
-A guest?
-Yes.

153
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
I'm sure it'll be delicious.

154
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,000
(I was trying to tell people through my
diary and phone before I died.)

155
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,880
(Go and tell Chef, Na Bong-sun.)

156
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,560
CHEF KANG

157
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,800
(Yes, it's me.)

158
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,040
Chef, where are you?

159
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,920
(Where else? I'm at the restaurant.)

160
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,720
(Did you hear from her?)

161
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,120
I'll go to the restaurant, Chef.

162
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,560
(No, I'll go there. It's dangerous this
late at night. Stay there.)

163
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,280
Hi Mister, have you been out?

164
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,440
I was worried you might be hungry,
so I bought pork hock to snack on.

165
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,480
Ah...

166
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,800
Where is Kyung-mo?
Kyung-mo, come eat some pork hocks.

167
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Chef should be here by now.

168
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,200
Chef?

169
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,760
(The customer's phone is turned off.
You will be transferred to voicemail.)

170
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,520
Gosh, I told her not to
turn off her phone.

171
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,400
Maybe she couldn't charge her phone?

172
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Na Bong...

173
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,040
Yes, hello. I'm Officer Choi's
brother-in-law, Kang Sun-woo.

174
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,160
Is he in the station right now?

175
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,240
Spirit...

176
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,360
The days are strange...

177
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:17,240
Ridden by the evil spirits that commit
crimes and make a mockery of humans.

178
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,840
Entrust me with the power to punish
the evil spirits.

179
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
(Sahbaltaeohmanibolsal.)

180
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,160
(Sagalttaemamangdeurohgussal.)

181
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,200
(Excuse me, is anyone home?)

182
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,840
Who is it?

183
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,440
(Hello?)

184
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,880
Who is it?

185
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,720
-Hello.
-What is it?

186
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,200
Na Bong-sun has disappeared.

187
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,240
-As well as my brother-in-law.
-Na Bong-sun? Sis...

188
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,880
Oh my!

189
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:51,680
That evil spirit must have chosen
her as his shield.

190
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,280
What do you mean by an evil spirit?

191
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
(This ghost has finally recovered her
memories.)

192
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,200
(She witnessed Officer Choi hitting your
sister with the car.)

193
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,760
(She was going to report it to the police,
but was killed by Officer Choi.)

194
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,440
(He has been possessed by an evil spirit.)

195
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,840
(He's basically only wearing the mask of
a human being.)

196
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,160
He's still not picking up?

197
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,000
What's going on?
He's never done this before.

198
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,640
It's probably nothing, right?

199
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,000
There was the incident with Officer Han
and the station can't reach him either.

200
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm so worried.

201
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,520
I'm sure it's nothing.
He's not a one or two-year-old child.

202
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,040
He's probably meeting up with friends.

203
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,360
Good husbands sometimes need to take
a break and just relax.

204
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,840
That would be a relief.

205
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,280
I have a bad feeling.

206
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,040
-Mom.
-Yes?

207
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,800
Can you get that trunk from behind
that box?

208
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,480
-Where? That one?
-Yes.

209
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,520
Eun-hee, what is all this stuff?

210
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,600
Mom, can you hand me that wallet?

211
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,320
-This?
-Yes.

212
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
And that cell phone.

213
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,840
Whose phone is this?

214
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,000
This...

215
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,280
HAN JIN-GOO

216
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,720
What's all this...

217
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,960
Gosh...

218
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,760
-Oh my.
-Hey, Eun-hee.

219
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,080
Sun-woo, good thing you're here!

220
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,600
What is all this stuff?

221
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,440
Sun-woo...

222
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,040
I can't get a hold of Sung-jae and
look at all this stuff...

223
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,840
Oh, I ran into him a little while ago.

224
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,560
He had to go to the rural area for
a criminal complaint that came in.

225
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,400
I meant to call you and I forgot.

226
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,560
Really?

227
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,160
Goodness! If that's what it was,
why couldn't he give us a call?

228
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,360
She was so worried.

229
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,920
Then, what is all this stuff?

230
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,160
Why does Sung-jae have these things
in his bag?

231
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,800
It's Officer Han's wallet and a phone
belonging to someone I don't know.

232
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,880
What is all this?

233
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,920
Isn't this evidence from his cases?

234
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,960
He must've had reason

235
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,520
to investigate something on his own.

236
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,200
We don't know so I'll ask him.
Don't worry about it too much.

237
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,800
Oh, evidence.

238
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,760
Why would he leave this stuff at home?
It's a bit creepy.

239
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,960
He'll be home soon.

240
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,520
(Suspect Choi Sung-jae, Choi Sung-jae.)

241
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,360
(His cell phone has been recently
tracked to this location.)

242
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,920
(We request urgent mobilization.)

243
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,480
POLICE

244
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,560
-Chef, please stand down.
-Huh?

245
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,680
Stand here for now.

246
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,640
This is Officer Choi's phone.

247
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,400
He left it here on purpose and ran.

248
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,680
Na Bong-sun...

249
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,960
It's as if the customers knew Chef wasn't
here today.

250
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,960
It's so slow today.

251
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,640
Yeah, even Eun-hee is sick and away today.

252
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,360
What's going on here?
Chef's away somewhere.

253
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,080
You're right.
Chef's not acting like himself lately.

254
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,080
Yeah.

255
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,600
Oh, oh... Look at that.

256
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,840
Just because the tiger's not home,
the fox is pretending to be king.

257
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,800
Is that guy crazy?
Look at the way he's sitting there.

258
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,720
Just because he knows them,
he's hovering above them.

259
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,440
What does he think he's doing?
Is it his store?

260
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,880
This here is a spinach Shrek pasta.

261
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,320
It's one of our main dishes.

262
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,360
I came up with the recipe, Senior.

263
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,320
-Oh yeah?
-Yes.

264
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,680
What is it called?

265
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,640
It's pronounced Shrek... Shrek.

266
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,840
-Shrek?
-Yes.

267
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,080
Oh, it's good. Yes, it's good.

268
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,840
Yeah, it's really good.

269
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,920
But, my throat is feeling a little dry.

270
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,920
Then I'll make sure to change that.

271
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,360
Dong-chul! You know the Pommery that
came in?

272
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,560
Bring that and two champagne glasses.

273
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,080
Quickly.

274
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,560
Those guys work below me.

275
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
With one word from me,
they just pee their pants.

276
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,720
Heo Min-soo, you're not that loser from
Yongjin High School anymore.

277
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,480
You grew up a lot.

278
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,160
Move it, move it, move it, move it!

279
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,320
-Here's your champagne.
-Thank you.

280
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,200
-Dong-chul,
-Yes.

281
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:29,080
is your concept these days to be slow?

282
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,720
You better move faster.

283
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,080
Senior Dong-chul!

284
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,000
Aren't you Senior Dong-chul from
Yongjin High Student Disciplinary Team?

285
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,840
Oh, Jung-jin... Jung-jin!

286
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,160
-Cha Jung-jin!
-Yes, that's me.

287
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,640
-You punk.
-It's good to see you.

288
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,560
Have you been well?

289
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,200
-It's been so long.
-Yes, it has.

290
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,200
You're my senior.

291
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,560
How can this Dong-chul punk
be your senior?

292
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,760
Why you little punk.

293
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,840
You must be out of your mind.

294
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,280
Hey, don't you know Senior Cho Dong-chul?

295
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,920
He cleaned up Yongjin High with his
famous sidekick.

296
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,320
Oh, why bring up the past?

297
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,120
Why would you?

298
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,120
Sous Chef, you were my junior

299
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,680
at Yongjin High School?

300
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,640
Hey, bow down.

301
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,360
I said bow down, you punk.

302
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,520
You can bow comfortably.

303
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,040
-Bow properly.
-Bow.

304
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,760
-Oh goodness...
-This punk.

305
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,560
-Gosh...
-This is my girlfriend.

306
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,760
Yes, very nice to meet you.

307
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,960
-
-She's very beautiful.

308
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,200
We've been dating for two days.

309
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:38,880
Where in the world did this evil spirit
run off to?

310
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,680
Let's see, let's see, let's see...

311
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,320
See from the top and from the bottom.

312
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,440
See it upside down, sideways,
and from the right and left.

313
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,280
-Do you see something?
-Sis?

314
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,960
I feel like I'm about to see something,
but then I can't.

315
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,320
Just keep trying nonetheless.
Keep trying until you see.

316
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,120
I thought you had powers.

317
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,880
I thought finding people was your
specialty. Why can't you find Na Bong-sun?

318
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,920
I want to find her too.

319
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,400
I've just lost a lot of my powers lately.

320
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,280
Please try something.

321
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,200
We need some sort of clue to find her.

322
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,560
If something happens to her,
I'll be so sorry to her and Chef.

323
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,600
-Please.
-I know that!

324
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,640
You both keep looking at me with laser
beam eyes.

325
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,680
I can't see anything like this.

326
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,880
Don't look at me, okay?

327
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,440
-I really don't like it.
-Okay, okay.

328
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
-Okay.
-Let's see, let's see, let's see again.

329
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Let's see again. Where is this now?

330
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,440
I hear something. I hear... Oh!

331
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:40,960
It's in the vicinity of Seoul.
It's not far, it's not far!

332
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,240
-Really?
-Vicinity?

333
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,800
There's a noise that's causing
interference.

334
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,640
It's...

335
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,560
It's children.

336
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,800
-Children?
-Children?

337
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
There are lots of them.

338
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,680
HANEUL ORPHANAGE

339
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,760
Here I go!

340
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,160
The kids are loving this.

341
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,480
There are many people who are benefactors.

342
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:23,440
But, there aren't many people who come
in person and play with the kids.

343
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,880
Ah, I see. It's nothing...

344
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,200
I grew up here too.

345
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
I heard that.

346
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,160
I heard that you donated that car,
as well.

347
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,760
53OH 2368

348
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
Yes.

349
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,280
So, how is the place we provided for you?

350
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,080
It had been empty all this time.

351
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,000
Yes, it's nice. I'm just staying during
my time off.

352
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,800
-Hello!
-Hello.

353
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
-Hello!
-Hello!

354
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,280
You were bored, weren't you Na Bong-sun?

355
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,600
What is this?

356
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,080
You're just filled with fear.

357
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,640
I won't do anything to you too soon.

358
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,960
That would be no fun.

359
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,920
I did hear there was a fire here
a few years ago.

360
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,240
(I have to get out of here somehow.)

361
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,880
(Chef will be really worried.)

362
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,760
(Where is this place anyhow?)

363
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,360
(I think we were in the car for about
an hour.)

364
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,760
(I just can't figure it out.)

365
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:29,440
(But...)

366
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,040
(There's a familiar scent.)

367
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,360
(What is it?)

368
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,240
When it comes to papillote,

369
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,400
the quality and texture of the meat
are important.

370
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,000
What's more important than that is
this rosemary here.

371
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,040
Smell it.

372
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,600
-Rosemary.
-

373
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,880
(Rosemary.)

374
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,320
(That's right. This is rosemary.)

375
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,360
WELCOME
HERB FARM

376
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,560
(Why doesn't it make sense?)

377
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,280
Just search around kindergartens or
schools where kids are.

378
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,800
-Why doesn't that make sense?
-Of course, it doesn't.

379
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,640
There are so many in the Seoul vicinity.

380
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,640
It's not even a proper tip.

381
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,520
You can't listen to a shaman.

382
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,560
Even with a scientific investigation,
it's difficult.

383
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,320
You ought to know better.

384
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,760
How about you cops?
What are you guys doing?

385
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,160
Shouldn't you trust anyone right now
and just investigate?

386
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,320
A person is missing and has
been kidnapped.

387
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,480
Look here, Kang Sun-woo.

388
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:33,720
Don't you see us working eating ramen
because we have no time to eat properly?

389
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,200
We've been looking at all the CCTV's and
looking at the information all night.

390
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,680
-If you would just focus...
-Hey now!

391
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,280
I know you're feeling frustrated,
but this isn't the only case we have.

392
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,240
We're having a hard time too.

393
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,840
-Hey Officer Shin.
-Yes.

394
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,040
How many times have I told you to put
fried kimchi in my bowl ramen? Huh?

395
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,160
Well, I like this better.

396
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,600
Would you guys do a scientific
investigation if your sister was missing?

397
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,360
You would try anything.

398
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,040
Wait a bit longer Na Bong-sun.
I'll come find you.

399
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,200
-Hello.
-Yes, hi.

400
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,080
Have you seen this person around here?

401
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,640
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

402
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,960
Really?

403
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,320
Okay, I understand.

404
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,760
By the way, are there any other schools
in this area besides this one?

405
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,240
DAYCARE

406
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,160
-No, you can't!
-Let me just take one look.

407
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,240
No, you can't do this.
Think about what you're doing.

408
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,600
You're trying to open every massage room.
What owner would like that?

409
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm just looking for someone.
Let me take a look.

410
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,080
What are you saying?

411
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,440
If you keep this up, I'm calling the cops.

412
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,080
Stop.

413
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,440
Hey seriously! Get out, get out!

414
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,320
Hey, virgin ghost!
Are you still down here?

415
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,360
That's crazy.

416
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,200
-What are you planning to do?
-Are you all right?

417
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,840
That's not important right now.
I need help from you all right now.

418
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,120
I need to find someone.

419
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,680
(She's in her late 20's.)

420
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,840
(She's about my height, looks like
a puppy, and has half-moon eyes.)

421
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,320
(Her hair is shoulder-length and
she's been taken by a man right now.)

422
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,640
(She's somewhere near a lot
of children so keep that in mind.)

423
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,360
(I really need to find her.)

424
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,440
(-Please, help me out.
-Okay, I got it.)

425
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,080
She sure is bothersome.

426
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,000
She was annoying when she was going
around everywhere possessing everyone.

427
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,960
I guess even dislike turns into fondness
over time, so I can't ignore her request.

428
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,360
This is like looking for a needle in
a haystack.

429
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,240
You think places with children are rare?

430
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,840
Especially if you consider orphanages too.

431
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,520
What's that place?

432
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,800
What's this? Do you see me?

433
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,080
What are you looking at?

434
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
(Spirit...)

435
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,520
This is all my fault.

436
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,160
I neglected my duties.

437
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,360
I gave into my feelings and
committed a taboo.

438
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
I apologize for that.

439
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,560
Please, have mercy one last time.

440
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,480
Give me the strength to dispose of
this evil spirit.

441
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,680
I make this request of you.

442
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,000
(Sahmanamtaebul.)

443
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,160
(Saramnamiltabul.)

444
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,200
(Sahmanamtaebul.)

445
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,040
(Sahyongnameuntabul.)

446
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,200
Thank you, Spirit. (Sahmanamtaebul.)

447
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,200
Na Bong-sun, where are you?

448
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,600
Where are you hiding, huh?

449
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,480
Anyways, what about you?

450
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,040
Didn't you say you don't have
much time left?

451
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,040
I should've been the one to get caught.

452
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:30,280
I shouldn't have run.

453
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
I'm sorry.

454
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,040
Hey, you haven't found her right?

455
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:38,560
No.

456
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,199
I have to find her.

457
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,120
She opened up her heart to me and
even was concerned for me.

458
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,080
If anything happens to her...

459
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,679
You know for a ghost...
You sure are quite human.

460
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:54,040
The thing is, you've only given me one
clue that it's a place with many children.

461
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,159
That's all I have.

462
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,360
I even went to all the orphanages.

463
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,600
I couldn't even find anyone resembling
that girl you possessed.

464
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,960
I did end up getting very startled by
a guy who could see ghosts.

465
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,960
Gosh...

466
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,240
A guy who sees ghosts?

467
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,480
His qi was extremely strong.

468
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,560
He was really tall too.

469
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,920
Why is it that everyone can see ghosts
these days? Is it a trend?

470
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,880
It's getting harder and harder
to eat and get by.

471
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,760
How is his qi strong?

472
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,360
Even if I'm going to get rid of you...

473
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,040
Here.

474
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,280
Officer Choi...

475
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,240
It's not too late to turn yourself in.

476
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,400
For the sake of your family who thinks
of you, Officer Choi...

477
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,760
No, Eun-hee...

478
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,480
-Think about Eun-hee.
-Shut up!

479
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,840
Who told you to talk?

480
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,560
Do you know how much I hate people who
talk a lot?

481
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,800
(Choi Sung-jae...)

482
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,880
(Choi Sung-jae?)

483
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,080
Yes!

484
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,920
We're trying to move the kids'
dressers and so on.

485
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,080
We're all women, so...

486
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,240
Oh, of course. I'll help you out.

487
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,280
(Hey kid,)

488
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,120
(I can see you.)

489
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,720
(I'm not a bad person so don't be scared.)

490
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,880
(Have you ever moved an object before?)

491
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,560
(Can you try kicking that phone over there
to me?)

492
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,480
(Yes, that one.)

493
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,080
Hey!

494
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,960
Who got water on my apron?

495
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,560
It's you, it's you... Isn't it?

496
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,160
It's you, you, you!

497
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,760
-It's not me.
-You're dead!

498
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,440
It's really not me!

499
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,960
Where did you leave it? Where?

500
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,200
He probably left it next to the sink.

501
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,880
People should take care of their
own aprons.

502
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,480
I knew you'd say something.
I knew you would. I knew it.

503
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,760
Why are you doing that?
Okay, just come over here.

504
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,520
What's going on now?
What's all this fuss about?

505
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,960
Is there a problem out here? What is it?

506
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,920
Gosh, it's hot.

507
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,080
The kids were lacking discipline,
so I was just...

508
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,720
-What is it?
-I'm going to go poo.

509
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,040
-Poo?
-Yes.

510
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,280
Okay, you go ahead and do that.

511
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,480
Wow, Dong-chul you really are the best.

512
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,080
If we knew it'd be like this,
you should've come out earlier.

513
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,440
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

514
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,800
You just can't tell what's going to happen

515
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,920
in one's life.

516
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,280
Chef!

517
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,080
Hey, have you all been well?

518
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,520
-Yes.
-Sorry I haven't been around.

519
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,640
Yes, this is Kang Sun-woo.

520
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,040
Bong-sun?

521
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,800
It's Na Bong-sun, right?

522
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
Where are you right now?

523
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,520
What is it? You can't talk right now?

524
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,680
Is that it?

525
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,600
Okay, then can you send a text?

526
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,160
Hang up the phone and
text me your location.

527
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
Hurry.

528
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,560
HANEUL ORPHANAGE

529
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,560
ROSEMARY

530
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,800
Rosemary. What is this?

531
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,920
Rosemary... What is this?

532
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,680
Is she saying she smells rosemary?

533
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,880
What's going on, Chef?
Is something wrong with Bong-sun?

534
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Where do we get our rosemary?

535
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm not sure.
It's always a different place.

536
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,680
We get some from Yongin-gu and Ansung-gu.

537
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
Why do you ask?
Did Bong-sun go to pick rosemary?

538
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,640
Does this rosemary...

539
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,320
Belong to Eun-hee?

540
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,320
Yes, she said she bought it when she
went somewhere with Officer Choi.

541
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,480
She said there was an herb farm nearby.

542
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,080
And she was taking care of it with
affection.

543
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,440
-With my brother-in-law?
-Yes.

544
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,320
HANEUL ORPHANAGE

SEOBINGGO

546
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,160
-Yes?
(-I just heard a tip from the ghost.)

547
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,440
(Someone saw a tall man who can
see ghosts.)

548
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,600
Is it by chance...

549
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,640
Near an orphanage?

550
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,200
(Yes, that's right.
Is there a connection?)

551
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,200
It's the place he grew up in.
Haneul Orphanage in Namyang-ju.

552
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,560
Yes, Detective. This is Kang Sun-woo.

553
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,360
I have his location.

554
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,960
I'm going to send you a text.
Please track the source for me.

555
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,040
And head to Haneul Orphanage in
Namyang-ju. Hurry please.

556
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,600
Mister, Haneul Orphanage
in Namyang-ju, please.

557
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,760
I'm not going there.

558
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,720
-Sis, double double.
-Double, double!

559
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,960
53OH 2368

560
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,200
What's going on, Sung-jae?

561
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,320
My brother says nothing is wrong.

562
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,480
He says I'm being oversensitive.

563
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,200
But, I don't think so.

564
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,240
Something is going on, right?

565
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,280
Hello?

566
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,600
Hello, Sung-jae?

567
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,480
Yeah.

568
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
It's me.

569
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,880
Are you at the restaurant?

570
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,960
No, home.

571
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,160
Where are you?

572
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,400
Where are you? Is something wrong?

573
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,240
Oh no...

574
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,600
I just had some stuff to think about,
so I wanted to clear my mind.

575
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:03,560
Uh...

576
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,480
Did your brother say anything about me?

577
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,320
He just told me not to worry.

578
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,560
(But, I'm so worried Sung-jae.)

579
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,840
You're not just there to clear your mind,
are you?

580
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,040
What's going on?
Can't you tell me the truth?

581
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,960
(Are you caught up in something bad?)

582
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
(-Is that it?)
-That's not it.

583
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,480
I'll call you back.

584
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
(Sung-jae...)

585
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,080
(I don't know what's going on...)

586
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,640
Just know that I'll always be on
your side.

587
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,600
I trust in you, Sung-jae.

588
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,400
(You're a good person, Sung-jae.)

589
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,120
(Sung-jae...)

590
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,520
Sung-jae?

591
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,280
-Search this place inside and out.
-Yes, sir!

592
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:17,280
Why are you all going that way?
Some of you should go this way too.

593
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,080
-Officer Shin, you go over there.
-Okay.

594
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,680
Hey Hyun-soo, don't go there. Over here!

595
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,760
Not there, here! Check in here.

596
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,600
53OH 2368

597
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,720
'2368.'

598
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,760
Isn't that Chef Kang's car?

599
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,400
And that's Officer Choi's car in front,
2368!

600
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,400
Excuse me. Turn around!

601
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,160
What? What's he doing?

602
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,320
Stop, stop!

603
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,080
-Chef!
-Come here.

604
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,280
Come here. It's okay.

605
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:18,640
It's okay, it's okay...
You'll be okay now.

606
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,760
Na Bong-sun! Na Bong-sun, are you okay?

607
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,240
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

608
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,960
What about Officer Choi, that evil spirit?

609
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
He just left.

610
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,680
That rotten thing!

611
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,240
Let me borrow your car, man of vitality.

612
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,160
-You're going to drive?
-It's do or die.

613
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,320
Why don't you lower your speed?

614
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,160
Hey, what kind of ghost has so much fear?

615
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,360
Have you seen people slow down during
a chase before?

616
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,800
If anyone dies, it'll be me.
You won't die again.

617
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:37,600
This evil spirit ran off already.
Where did he run off to?

618
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:41,920
Sis...

619
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,080
Blood.

620
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,840
What with this unexpected situation?

621
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,240
This a godsend.
It's like a trail of breadcrumbs.

622
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,400
Let's just follow him for now.

623
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,560
Gosh...

624
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,480
She's already asleep.

625
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,320
Thank you, Na Bong-sun.

626
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,400
For coming back safely.

627
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,920
The blood tracks disappeared midway.

628
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,600
Where could he be?

629
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,080
He's not in good condition.
He can't be too far off.

630
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,520
-Sis.
-Yeah?

631
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,320
Over there.

632
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,920
It's shady and I get a strong
sense of chill from there.

633
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,480
I think I smell blood too.

634
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,720
Let's go.

635
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:14,920
I scare easily and don't even like to
watch scary movies.

636
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,080
I suppose it's better to catch the ghost.

637
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:20,480
Be quiet, would you?
You want to announce that we're here?

638
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,800
All right!

639
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,880
Hey, quiet. Up there.

640
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:00,160
Sis!

641
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,560
You sure tracked me well.

642
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:17,600
All the way here.

643
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,160
Why did you do it?

644
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,600
If you hadn't had such bad intentions,
I wouldn't have had to die.

645
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,400
-Stop your whining!
(-Amitabeurin!)

646
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,760
(Daemaninkandooturo. Saegadaemandooturo.)

647
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:05,520
(Just know that I'll always be on
your side.)

648
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,960
(You're a good person, Sung-jae.)

649
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,120
(Today was a really long day.)

650
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,720
(-How about you?
-Oh, I was busy too.)

651
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,440
(-Hold on tight. Hold on tight.
-Sung-jae.)

652
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,120
You can get annoyed with me
every now and then.

653
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,080
How can a person be an angel all the time?

654
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,280
Just make sure you don't get hurt.
I don't like it when you get hurt.

655
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,160
-What's with you!
-You're not wearing them, are you?

656
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,920
-Do you know how much they are?
-No, no.

657
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,920
-They cost 200,000 won.
-Okay, okay.

658
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,200
-I don't want to look at yours.
-You're acting really strange.

659
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,640
Wait... This one's for Officer Choi.

660
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:42,320
They have different amounts of rice.

661
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,360
Leave it out when you're done.

662
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:45,680
-Okay.
-Thank you.

663
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,880
You tie your laces in a unique way.

664
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,760
This is how I tie laces.

665
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
If you tie them like this,
they don't come undone.

666
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:31,240
OH MY GHOST

667
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,720
(I think it was fate that you came to me.)

668
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,840
(I didn't even know.)

669
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,080
(That murderer who killed my daughter...)

670
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:42,120
(He had a cerebral hemorrhage when
he fainted.)

671
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,840
(I think you should prepare
for the worst.)

672
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,080
Please keep him alive!

673
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,760
(This flower means an undying love.)

674
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,040
An eternal love.

675
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,160
(Today is the day...
The day of my third year.)

676
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,120
(You can possess me.)

677
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,160
(Chef, you have me.)

678
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:00,800
(I'm going to protect you, Chef.)
