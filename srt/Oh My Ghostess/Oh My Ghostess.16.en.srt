1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,440
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,040
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,040
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 16

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,320
Oh my! Look at all this dust.

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,480
For someone who follows the gods
to have this much dust in her home.

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,080
I ought to be punished by the heavens.

7
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,480
Spirits, I have committed a sin worth
dying for.

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
Hey...

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,400
Hold on. I need to change this door here
and change the interior.

10
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,960
With a new heart and mind.

11
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,200
Hey...

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Why do you keep calling me?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,480
I'm trying to take care of my environment
and its cleanliness.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,039
Today is the day.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,080
It's been three years.

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,280
I should say goodbye and leave.

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,600
I know that, you wench.
I have eyes. I can see the calendar.

18
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,360
You won't have to worry anymore.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,360
You had to live like a bum because of me.

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,440
You'll have good business again.

21
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,640
Of course, I will.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll be sitting atop a cushion of money
now.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,080
Do you feel a load off your mind now?
How is it?

24
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
I did resolve my grudge.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,200
It's just that I have lingering
attachments.

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,840
Show me a ghost that's cool enough
not to have lingering attachments.

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,320
Please ascend and depart well.

28
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,240
You worked hard.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
Be well.

30
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Goodbye.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,760
Gosh, I must be getting old.

32
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,240
Something must be wrong with my eyes.
I'm not even all that sad.

33
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Take care.

34
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,960
What's that for?

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
It's that day.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,440
I prepared rice. Eat.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,920
Yes, Dad.

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,160
If I prepare for her in advance,
perhaps she'll show up earlier.

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,480
That's all I was hoping.

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,160
Yes, hello?

41
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,440
Yes, I'm Shin Soon-ae's father.

42
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,040
The police station?

43
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,960
She witnessed a hit-and-run and
was trying to report it.

44
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,280
It was discovered that she was murdered

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,640
by the driver of that accident,
Choi Sung-jae.

46
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,960
Wait, so...

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,880
What you're saying is that...

48
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,560
Soon-ae was...

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,880
Soon-ae never committed suicide?

50
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,440
Yes, she was killed.

51
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,720
I feel ashamed to tell you this now.

52
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,960
He had disguised it so well to look like
she committed suicide.

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,360
Are you okay sir?

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
Hey, Detective Shin.

55
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,240
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,600
She must've been so...

57
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,920
She must've been so afraid.

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,440
And I had no idea.

59
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,000
Hi Mister!

60
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,360
(I am always thankful and sorry to you,
Officer Choi.)

61
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,320
What kind of a father...

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,880
What kind of an awful father am I...

63
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,520
For serving the bastard who killed his
own daughter...

64
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,880
Warm rice and a meal...

65
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,800
Are you okay?

66
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,200
Are you all right?

67
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Hey mister? Mister!

68
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,200
You know... My grandma says she's
still not used to me yet.

69
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,960
She says my voice has gone up one octave
and I don't seem like her granddaughter.

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
And she interrogated me

71
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:41,120
asking me if I'm the ghost.

72
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,680
I had to prove to her that I was her
granddaughter

73
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,159
by reciting our address.

74
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,760
Isn't my grandma funny?

75
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,840
What is it? Are you not used to me either?

76
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,720
-Do you find me noisy too?
-You don't have to try that hard.

77
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
I'm a lot better now.

78
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,120
Really? Are you really better now?

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,520
Somewhat.

80
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
At first...

81
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,320
It was difficult to accept the truth.

82
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,480
I have to pull myself together.
I have to think of Eun-hee and my mom.

83
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,600
And you have me, Chef.

84
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,120
I will protect you, Chef.

85
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,240
Goodness, you even know how to
exaggerate now.

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
With a teacher that boasts a lot,
the student will exaggerate a lot too.

87
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,800
I still have a long way to go.

88
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,120
You've grown a lot. You really have.

89
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,520
I've been raising a baby tiger.

90
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,159
Oh, hold on.

91
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
Wonder why he's calling.

92
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,520
Hey, Kyung-mo.

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,080
Dad?

94
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,080
Where did they go to with the door
wide open?

95
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,120
I heard that the owner of this place
passed out again.

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,240
Yes, he has.

97
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,960
Apparently, his son ran out a while ago.

98
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,280
What's going on?

99
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,520
That's life, I guess.

100
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,040
I should've gone with him when he
went to the police station.

101
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,960
Idiot... Loser.

102
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
You moron... Idiot.

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,440
You loser. Why do you even live?

104
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,400
You should just go die.

105
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,200
Kyung-mo,

106
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
just stop.

107
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,160
RESTRICTED AREA

108
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,680
Doctor, how is he doing?

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,400
Well,

110
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,400
shock is very toxic for a patient
with hepatocirrhosis.

111
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,320
On top of that, he suffered cerebral
hemorrhage when he passed out.

112
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,200
I think you should prepare for the worst.

113
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,440
Hey, hey...

114
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,080
-Gosh...
-Kyung-mo!

115
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,200
Dad, it's my fault isn't it?

116
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,400
You were traumatized because of me,
weren't you?

117
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,040
I'm such a terrible daughter.

118
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,960
I put you through such pain when I died.

119
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,160
Even after I have died,
I give you pain and trauma.

120
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm so sorry.

122
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,760
I was wrong a hundred,
no a thousand times.

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,600
Please just wake up.

124
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,000
Please wake up, Dad.

125
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,159
-He's in cardiac arrest.
-Get the defibrillator.

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,320
Dad...

127
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,400
-No, this can't happen.
-200.

128
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,360
-Dad!
-One, two, three.

129
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,840
Save him, please!

130
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,920
250.

131
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,680
Dad.

132
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,400
-Please.
-One, two.

133
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,520
Dad.

134
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Let's go again.

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,760
Dad.

136
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Dad.

137
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,440
No, Dad!

138
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Soon-ae.

139
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,680
Where are you going?

140
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,280
You can't go.

141
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,480
Soon-ae...

142
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,320
You have to stay here longer.

143
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,800
What do you expect Kyung-mo to do
here alone?

144
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
Stay here a bit longer and come back.

145
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,520
You have to see Kyung-mo get married
and see your grandkids.

146
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,600
Let's meet again after that. Okay?

147
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,360
When we meet again then...

148
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,360
We can live happily for a 1,000 or 10,000
years together.

149
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,520
I'll be born again as your daughter.

150
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,760
Soon-ae...

151
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,360
Dad... Dad!

152
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,760
Doctor! My dad opened his eyes!

153
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,120
Nurse! Here, here!

154
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,440
-He opened his eyes now?
-Yes.

155
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,400
-Check his breathing and pulse.
-Yes.

156
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,640
HOSPITAL

157
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,840
I told you to go eat something.

158
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,560
Forget it.

159
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,680
I always eat.
It won't kill me to eat later.

160
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,080
I'm feeling fine now.

161
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,920
Go on and eat now.
Why are you skipping your meals?

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
I said it's fine.

163
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm not going to take one step away
from your side.

164
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,520
Dad,

165
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,400
you know what?

166
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,720
This time I thought you were really dying
and I resented Sis a lot.

167
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,360
I started to think that she was taking
you away.

168
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,320
Just because she was bored by herself.

169
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,320
It's the opposite, kid.

170
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,080
What?

171
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,960
Your sister...

172
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,360
Saved my life.

173
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,400
Soon-ae sent me back.

174
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
What are you talking about, Dad?
Did you have a dream?

175
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,040
I don't know.

176
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,800
Was it a dream or not?

177
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,520
It was just so real.

178
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,200
She would never appear in my dreams
before.

179
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,840
But, she appeared to me looking just
as she used to look.

180
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,040
She told me to stay here longer.

181
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,040
She told me to get you married...

182
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,760
And see my grandkids.

183
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,600
-And then come back.
-Oh, did she now?

184
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,040
I'm so thankful to her.
Why... I ought to bow to her.

185
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,760
Maybe it's because I got to see her face
like that...

186
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,640
My body feels better.
And strangely, my mood feels better.

187
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,080
Today is that day.

188
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,880
I can't even prepare her ancestral rites.

189
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
What good have I done?

190
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,680
She'd understand.

191
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,600
Dad, I'll be good now.

192
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,560
I'm going to work really hard now.

193
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,240
You'll be totally surprised.

194
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,640
Gosh, please do that, would you?

195
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,960
I even like hearing the sound of that.

196
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,080
Oh, you're here?

197
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,280
-Hi.
-Hello.

198
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:47,960
Today is the day...

199
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
It's been three years now.

200
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,520
Then...

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,240
I have to go now.

202
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,560
Thank you, Na Bong-sun.

203
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,240
Sorry for everything too.

204
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,480
I think the fact you came to me
was fate, too.

205
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,040
You figured out the mystery of your death.

206
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,320
I went one step closer to Chef.

207
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,960
As for Chef,

208
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,120
although it was painful...

209
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,840
He found out the truth behind Eun-hee's
car accident.

210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,360
Now that you mention it. You're right.

211
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,680
And you...

212
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,200
You are no longer that shriveled up
Na Bong-sun from the past.

213
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,800
-Yeah.
-You've become a lot stronger.

214
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,560
You'll live well.

215
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,920
Watch over me from up above.
I'll live diligently.

216
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,400
Okay.

217
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,200
Love lots while you still can,
Na Bong-sun.

218
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,960
I'm going to go up the heavens

219
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,600
and meet someone better than Chef.
And I'll live there

220
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,400
for a thousand and ten thousand years.

221
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,320
That sounds nice. I envy you.

222
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,240
Wait a minute.

223
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,880
What about Chef?

224
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,640
You're not going to say
your last farewell?

225
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,520
What farewell?

226
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,280
Chef can't even see me.

227
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Here.

228
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,960
I'm telling you to possess me.

229
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,640
It's the last time.

230
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,360
No, I don't want to do it at the end.

231
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,080
This will be my very last time I lend
my body to a ghost too.

232
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,160
Come on.

233
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,320
Still, I don't think this is right.

234
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,560
I need to slowly prepare and open up.
I can't keep the store closed forever.

235
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,480
(Will you be okay?
Shouldn't you rest some more?)

236
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,280
I think I'll feel better if I work.

237
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,640
I'm thinking of sending Eun-hee and
Mom to the States.

238
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,680
I want to get Eun-hee medically
examined again.

239
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,400
Also, they can take a break while
they are there.

240
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,040
(That sounds good.)

241
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,040
(Sun-woo, call me whenever you need.
I'll buy you drinks.)

242
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,640
(I am your good friend.)

243
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,800
Thanks, So-hyung.

244
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,920
I'll call you again... Okay.

245
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,079
You're here?

246
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,440
How is Mister doing?

247
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,880
Why are you staring so hard?
It's embarrassing.

248
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Chef...

249
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,240
What is it?

250
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,040
Are you feeling down because Mister
isn't feeling well?

251
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,360
Why is your hand so cold?

252
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,440
You're right.

253
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,480
It's me, Chef.

254
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,120
Bong-sun...

255
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Na Bong-sun told me to say
my last farewell to you, Chef.

256
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
I see.

257
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm not sure what I should say.

258
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,560
You don't have to say anything, Chef.

259
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,440
Thank you.

260
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,040
I received...

261
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,200
So many gifts from you, Chef.

262
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,040
Like experiences I never got to have
when I was alive.

263
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,840
Those feelings...

264
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,360
Also...

265
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,880
I was truly happy when I was here.

266
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,240
I have no more regrets.

267
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,200
I...

268
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,160
I want to say thank you too.

269
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,720
For letting me find out the truth about
my sister's accident and...

270
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,800
I'm sorry...

271
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,160
You had to die because of that.

272
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,960
Don't say that, Chef.

273
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,280
It's just my fate.

274
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:50,040
Be happy, Chef.

275
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,640
Take care...

276
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,080
Shin Soon-ae.

277
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,600
I see that she's leaving,

278
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,080
that pitiful wench.

279
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,880
That's right.

280
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,920
Don't look back and leave, you wench!

281
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,880
If people knew when death was coming
and could say goodbye

282
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,400
how nice would that be?

283
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,680
It's just not possible and that's why
life is this way.

284
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,800
That's why you've got to live each day
hard like it's precious.

285
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,760
You lived harder than almost anyone!

286
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,640
That's something I know.

287
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,480
Farewell, Shin Soon-ae!

288
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,120
You lived a good life, Soon-ae!

289
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,240
Gosh, this rotten...

290
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,160
Now that the ghost is gone,
what fun am I going to have in life?

291
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,280
Yeah, it's me. What is it?

292
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,000
(Hey, where are you?)

293
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,600
(I'm not feeling that good,
so I want to have some soju.)

294
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,960
We must have telepathy.
I'm not feeling great either.

295
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,520
Let's meet at a tent vendor.
Where are you?

296
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,200
I'll go there now.

297
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,360
Yeah.

298
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm just outside somewhere.

299
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,360
Hey, hey, hey!
Hurry up and sweep the floors!

300
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,960
And look at the tables!
Finish the setting already.

301
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,880
Oh, Ji-woong!

302
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,440
I must be a workaholic, you know?

303
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,560
I thought I was going to go nuts and die
because we couldn't work for a week.

304
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,120
You're not going crazy because
you couldn't work.

305
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,360
Isn't it because you can't run your
mouth off?

306
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,760
What are you saying I did?

307
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,200
It tickles!

308
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,720
Nonetheless, I missed all of you.

309
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,000
-Come here, Ji-woong.
-Why, why?

310
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,920
Gosh, really?

311
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,200
It's really nice to be out working again.

312
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,680
Yeah, I guess people really do grow fond
of those they even dislike.

313
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,320
Sous Chef, I had a dream.
A dream about you, Sous Chef.

314
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,000
Gosh, you're so cute!

315
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,840
My charm is kind of lethal,
so I'm going to be femme fatal.

316
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
What the heck.

317
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,760
Well, the person I am most happy to see
out of everyone is Bong...

318
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,400
No.. The Bong!

319
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,560
Yes, did you call for me?

320
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,840
Yes, Your Highness.

321
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,200
-We did request your presence.
-Oh, be quiet.

322
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,800
We're just happy you're back, Bong.

323
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,040
It's so nice to have this place be full
of people again.

324
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,840
I feel like I'm alive again now that
I'm back.

325
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,680
Maybe it's because it was closed
for a bit...

326
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,160
There's so much to clean.
The floor is really dirty too.

327
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,880
Why is it so loud? Move over.

328
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,240
Here, use this.

329
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,640
-Here.
-What's this?

330
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,840
You know my friend sells vacuum cleaners.
I bought one.

331
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,440
You don't need to wash the mop
and it's automatic so it's easier.

332
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,280
Use this instead of that from now on.
Okay?

333
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,480
-No need to overwork yourself.
-Yes, Chef.

334
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,040
They're so disgusting.
I can't look anymore.

335
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:41,560
There was a time when our Chef looked
at me with his eyes full of passion.

336
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,960
There wasn't. Not even once.

337
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,600
There wasn't? You're saying there wasn't?
For real?

338
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,760
I can give you everything.

339
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,800
-Hey, hey!
-What is this?

340
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,760
-You're so dirty! Punk!
-Goodness!

341
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,960
-Gosh, seriously.
-Gosh.

342
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,160
How exciting!

343
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,040
Darn, it would've been really nice
if Eun-hee was here too.

344
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,880
I know, right?

345
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,640
Okay, table three, one Shrek,
two seafood noodle soups.

346
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
Table four, one scallop appetizer,
two escargots.

347
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,800
Table seven, one Shrek,
two bulgogi eggplant pasta.

348
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,200
Hey, Min-soo, you do Shrek.

349
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,800
-Dong-chul, you take noodles.
-Yes, Chef.

350
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,880
-I'll take escargots. Jun, you help me.
-Yes, Chef.

351
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,800
-Ji-woong, prepare eggplants.
-Yes, Chef.

352
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,160
-And Bong!
-Yes!

353
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,120
You try taking on bulgogi eggplant pasta.
It was tasty last time.

354
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,160
Huh?

355
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,880
Yes, Chef. Copy that!

356
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,040
Copy that!

357
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,760
-Fire!
-Fire!

358
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,400
I'll be serving the eggplant pasta.

359
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,160
Okay, let's see here.

360
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,680
She's got good sense.

361
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,680
Bong, Bong, Bong! Wait, wait, wait.

362
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Like that.

363
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,960
Here, Bong. Here, here.

364
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,040
Okay.

365
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,560
Here's Shrek pasta.
And here's bulgogi eggplant pasta for you.

366
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,160
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

367
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,440
Oh, it's good. Try it.

368
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,920
Is it good?

369
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,360
-Really. It's good.
-Right?

370
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,920
-Hey, let's switch.
-It's so good.

371
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,360
Yes, Director.

372
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,760
Great job, really.

373
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,880
Bong Bong Bong Bong.

374
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,920
(Cooking competition?)

375
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,720
You know I don't judge competitions.

376
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,080
More experienced and influential chefs
should do it.

377
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,000
Yes, I'm occasionally humble too.

378
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,760
Yes, see you later.

379
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,120
Oh, Director.

380
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,160
Is the registration for that cooking
competition still open?

381
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,280
I told you if you cut it all the way,
the meat texture degrades.

382
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,480
Oh, okay.

383
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,040
Loosen your wrist.

384
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,800
That's right.

385
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Like that.

386
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,240
Why? Is it too hard?

387
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,480
No, I'm okay. Aren't you tired, Chef?

388
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,880
Don't mind me.

389
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,360
The competition is coming up soon.
No time to be tired.

390
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,960
Let's take a short break
and this time let's do the sauce.

391
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,480
Competition?

392
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,880
I didn't tell you? You're competing
at a cooking competition.

393
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,440
What... Cooking competition?

394
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,400
-Proper Food competition.
-What?

395
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,040
It's a small competition organized
by the Agricultural Food Association.

396
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,080
I registered you so you
can get experience.

397
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,240
I don't expect you to win,
so don't feel pressured.

398
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,800
I mean, Chef...
You didn't even talk to me about it.

399
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,280
Like you would've said 'yes'
if I talked to you.

400
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,000
I bet you would've said you're not ready.

401
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,320
-Competition...
-And once in a while,

402
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,360
it's better to act impulsively
than cautiously.

403
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,320
And sometimes you'll gain something.

404
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,160
I guess that's true, but still.

405
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,360
No point in talking about it.

406
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,440
What is this?
What competition all of a sudden?

407
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,120
Here.

408
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,880
What is this?

409
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,400
Gosh, don't ask and just open it.

410
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,400
You'll get the answer when you open it.

411
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,840
Chef...

412
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,680
Gosh, you're falling for me again.
Gosh, really.

413
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:40,360
What now? Do I have to start locking
my door again?

414
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,200
Thank you, Chef. I'll work hard, really.

415
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,560
Obviously.
Of course, you should work hard.

416
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,240
You never know.

417
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,400
Maybe this knife will cast some spell
and you might win the competition.

418
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,360
-Try holding it properly.
-Yes.

419
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
There you go.

420
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,440
-Wow, your wrist wraps it nicely.
-Yes.

421
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,600
-Chef Na Bong-sun!
-Yes, I like this.

422
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
I think it's nice.

423
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,560
-It is nice, but...
-This heart. Did you do it?

424
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,920
-Of course I did it. Who else.
-Wow, I'm so touched.

425
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,000
Yes, I already know you're touched.

426
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,320
Either way, do your best since
I prepared things for you.

427
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,520
-Yes, Chef.
-This, this here is the case.

428
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,720
Bong Bo Roo Bong!

429
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,880
What is this? Are you scared?
Are you nervous?

430
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,280
Hey, hey, Ji-woong! She's totally relaxed.

431
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,840
Hey, Bong Bong, look at me.
Don't be scared. Okay?

432
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,600
-Right.
-It's no different from our kitchen.

433
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,960
Hey, Bong! If you go and say
'sorry' and 'sorry' like an idiot...

434
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,720
Then you're Kang Sun-woo's pupil.

435
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,280
But, if you do well and
you win the award...

436
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,080
Then you're Heo Min-soo's pupil. Got it?

437
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
Yes, I'll do my best.

438
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,600
-Hey, Bong.
-Yes?

439
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,160
-Here.
-Oh, these are...

440
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,880
Eat them before you start.

441
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,200
-You'll be less nervous.
-Okay.

442
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,200
Give one to the person waiting in the car.

443
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,640
-He's been restless since the morning.
-Okay.

444
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll get going now, Seniors.

445
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
-Yes, fighting!
-Bong!

446
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,800
Hurry. We'll be late.

447
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,240
-What is this?
-So we won't be nervous.

448
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,320
-You have just one?
-No, two. Here.

449
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,320
Okay, then I'll eat this one.
Hurry, let's go.

450
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,760
Stop it. Stop it.

451
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,320
(It's okay. Everything will be fine.)

452
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,920
(You have gorgeous older brothers.)

453
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,320
(It's okay. Everything will be fine.)

454
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,400
(We believe in you. There's no doubt.)

455
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
-Come on.
-Bye!

456
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,840
Fighting! Bong Bong fighting!

457
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,240
PROPER FOOD COMPETITION

458
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
It's quite big.

459
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,640
Wow, it's big.

460
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,080
-Bong-sun, go to your station.
-Okay.

461
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,280
Oh, Ho-geun.

462
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,400
-Hey, what brings you here?
-Have you been well?

463
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,760
-Hello.
-You know him right?

464
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,680
Chef Kang Sun-woo. He's famous.

465
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,200
One of our kitchen staff members
entered the competition so...

466
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,280
-Someone from your restaurant is here?
-Yes.

467
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,560
-Na Bong.
-Yes?

468
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,080
Don't be nervous.
Just do as you always do.

469
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,200
Yes, Chef.

470
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,080
-Did you take the medicine?
-Yes.

471
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,960
Gosh I had the medicine Jun gave us,
but why am I still so nervous? So crazy.

472
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm all right, Chef.

473
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,080
If I don't do well this time,
I can do well next time.

474
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,720
Good or bad, you've entered me into
this competition so I can experience it.

475
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,840
That's the point.

476
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,600
-So no pressure, okay?
-Okay.

477
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,840
You understood my point.

478
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,400
-And look. I'll be sitting over there.
-Okay.

479
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,120
So if your heart's palpitating and
you're seeing white, then look at me.

480
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Yes, Chef.

481
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,800
-Where did I say I'd be?
-Over there.

482
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,240
-Okay.
-Yes.

483
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,600
-Knife?
-Here.

484
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,760
Inner peace. Fighting!

485
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,560
-Oh, fighting.
-You should go now.

486
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,960
I need to do stuff here.

487
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,880
Oh my. You're really distracting.

488
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,800
Go over there now. I'll look at you.

489
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,040
-Okay, okay.
-Okay.

490
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,080
Gosh, the teacher is more nervous
than the student.

491
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,400
This is driving me crazy.

492
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
Hello.

493
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,240
PROPER FOOD COMPETITION
INDIVIDUAL DIVISION

494
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,760
A little. A little. A little.

495
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,840
A little more salt.

496
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,480
She's doing well.

497
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,960
Is this cold bean noodle?

498
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,240
-What ingredients?
-Oh, I used overripe cucumbers.

499
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,480
This is chilled overripe cucumber
cream pasta.

500
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,360
Oh, overripe cucumber.

501
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,320
-Chilled overripe cucumber cream pasta.
-Yes.

502
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,800
Since I was little, my grandma often made
me overripe cucumber dishes.

503
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,760
We used to eat them with cold
bean noodles too.

504
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,840
You know there are people who can't
eat wheat flour.

505
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,520
This pasta can be eaten by those
people as well.

506
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,719
That's unique.

507
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,960
Thank you.

508
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,000
Okay, that's all the winners of
honorable mentions.

509
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:55,080
Now, we're left with the third,
second and first prize winners.

510
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,680
These winners will be awarded prize money
as well as other select prizes.

511
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,480
First, I'll announce the third place
winner.

512
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
The third place goes to...

513
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:10,440
Contestant number seven Na Bong-sun for
her chilled overripe cucumber cream pasta.

514
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
What? What?

515
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,160
-Did he just say Na Bong-sun?
-Yes.

516
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,400
Na Bong-sun, please come forward.

517
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,960
Please come forward. Congratulations.

518
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,360
Okay.

519
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,840
Thank you!

520
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,160
Thank you!

521
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Chef!

522
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,840
You did good.

523
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,320
Hey, Bong.

524
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,280
-Yes, Chef.
-Good job. You did well.

525
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,040
You did good. You little pea-sized...

526
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,360
I got this as a keepsake.

527
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,960
Oh, okay. Chef, was I really third place?

528
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,520
You didn't rig the competition?

529
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,240
What rig? What are you saying...

530
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,400
Well, if I wanted to, I could use my
connections to rig it.

531
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,280
But, I'm not the type to do those
things because of a girl.

532
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,160
-How can you think that?
-No,

533
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,000
it's because I can't believe I won.

534
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:05,720
Believe it. You won third place.
Third in the Proper Food Competition.

535
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Yes, Chef.

536
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,240
-I asked the judge.
-Yes.

537
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,880
He said creativity and the taste
were impressive.

538
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,960
But, more than anything, your story that
was captured in that dish was amazing.

539
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,240
-Wow, really?
-You are my student after all.

540
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,200
-Yes, thank you, Chef.
-Wow, I'm just so proud of you. Really.

541
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,040
-Oh Chef...
-Good job, good job.

542
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,200
What's that?

543
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Goodness.

544
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,040
They've put in quite the effort.

545
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,240
It's pretty.

546
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,080
Congratulations Na Bong.

547
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,600
-Congratulations.
-Yes.

548
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,920
OUR KITCHEN ROOKIE NA BONG-SUN
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE COMPETITION

549
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,360
-Thank you!
-Na Bong, congratulations!

550
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,080
Cake...

551
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,640
Gosh, you punk.
I said not to do these things.

552
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,680
-His nose...
-On a happy day like today.

553
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,280
You whine just because I got cream on you.

554
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,680
-Na Bong!
-Yes?

555
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,320
We're so proud of you.
Yes, it was worth raising you.

556
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,560
What? You raised her?

557
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,000
He did? More like I did.

558
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:15,160
Well, Bong was raised by Bong's grandma.

559
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,120
What's with the sudden dispute over
who the father is?

560
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,920
-I know, right?
-Congrats, Bong!

561
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,640
Oh, thank you, Senior.

562
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,120
-Hey! Hey!
-Come here.

563
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,840
Did Bong save our country or something?

564
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,280
Why so much touching?

565
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,680
Oh, our Chef is seriously a
jealous monster.

566
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,000
In any case, how much was the prize money?
1 million? 2 million?

567
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:37,920
The prize money is not important.
I hear they pay for you to a study abroad?

568
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,160
-What?
-That...

569
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,280
Isn't that awarded to the
top three winners?

570
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,200
-Study abroad?
-What?

571
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,600
Tissues... Can someone get me some?

572
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,760
Why didn't you tell me?

573
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,920
Tell you what?

574
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,240
That the top three winners get
a scholarship to study abroad.

575
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,960
Why? Because you didn't think I'd win?

576
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,320
Of course.

577
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,400
Who would've thought you'd win third place
in your very first competition?

578
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,840
You really are an icon of plot twists.

579
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,920
I asked you to avoid embarrassing
your teacher. But third place?

580
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm confused. I don't know if
you're complimenting me or not.

581
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,240
Obviously...

582
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,720
It's a compliment.

583
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,440
You really did well, Na Bong-sun.

584
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,680
Chef.

585
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,120
So, what will you do?

586
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,560
I'll follow your decision.

587
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,880
Studying abroad isn't a necessity
in cooking.

588
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:46,800
If you want to gain experience in an
actual kitchen, then I'll help.

589
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,760
If you want to go elsewhere to learn,
then I'll be cool and let you go.

590
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,480
Chef.

591
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,680
Is it...

592
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,960
Okay if I go and come back?

593
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,840
You want to go?

594
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,240
Not because I want to improve my resume,
but I want to experience it.

595
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,080
Studying and working part-time in
a bigger world.

596
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,960
From the beginning, step by step,
all by myself.

597
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,880
Are you confident you won't get the
roving eye? People there are quite open.

598
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,080
I won't look at anyone else.

599
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,760
I... I... I don't know about me.

600
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,680
I'm not confident.
Since girls hit on me all the time.

601
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,760
That's the thing.
I'm actually worried about that the most.

602
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,320
Oh Chef...

603
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,160
I should've said I wasn't going.

604
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,840
What should I do?

605
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Chef.

606
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,720
Is he upset?

607
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,480
-Oh this.
-I should put this on you at least.

608
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,200
You know European men like
Korean women a lot, right?

609
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,320
If you go along with guys who hit on you,
you'll get in trouble by this necklace.

610
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,200
I'll stand up so that there's less
height difference.

611
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,440
-Hey, sit.
-Oh my.

612
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,680
Come here.

613
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,880
There.

614
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,000
What do I do...

615
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,680
Even though you're in my arms,
I'm already starting to miss you.

616
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,280
I know, Chef. I'm worried about that too.

617
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:01,920
Chef, are you crying?

618
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,920
No, I'm not crying. I'm just emotional.

619
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,280
What should we do?

620
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,280
2 YEARS LATER

621
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,800
Customer 313. Your fortune is ready.

622
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,880
Your daughter has men overflowing.

623
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,520
-What?
-She's meant to have a thousand men.

624
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,040
A thousand?

625
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,320
Then will my daughter be able to marry
this year?

626
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,320
What the heck are you saying?

627
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,400
She has to meet a thousand men.

628
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,120
-Understand?
-Huh?

629
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,560
This year, if she's to meet one man...
She has to meet 999 more men.

630
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,800
Basically, there's an old spinster ghost
stuck to your daughter.

631
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,480
A spinster ghost?

632
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,440
Oh... Then what should I do?

633
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,760
What else can you do? You need a talisman.

634
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,640
You give one big bill,
it'll last you the year.

635
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,920
If you give me two,
I'll give you one that lasts longer.

636
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,120
If you don't get one...

637
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,960
She'll spend her life meeting men and
then continue even in the afterlife.

638
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,080
Okay, I will get one.

639
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,800
I'll give you two bills.

640
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,800
Okay. Then, deposit that amount
into my account.

641
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,720
Once I verify that it's in my account,
I'll write that talisman for you.

642
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,720
You can pick that up from my secretary.

643
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,680
You can get it delivered, as well.

644
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,360
As long as you don't live in the
Jeju Island region, we can cover shipping.

645
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,440
All right, you can go now.

646
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,200
It's time for me to monitor my TV
appearances.

647
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,920
Seobinggo, Seobinggo, Seobinggo...

648
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,040
Keep it on Seobinggo's channel!

649
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,200
(Hello. I'm Seobinggo, expert on
evil spirits.)

650
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,880
Be quiet. I need to see this.

651
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,040
Oh, I heard you were very spiritual.

652
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,880
I didn't know you were on TV too.

653
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,920
Well, my job title is Star Bodhisattva
after all.

654
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,520
Honestly, there is probably no one better
than me at killing evil spirits.

655
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,400
Now that I think about it...

656
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,880
Maybe an exorcism might be better
than a talisman.

657
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:25,760
An exorcism?

658
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,880
Then, let's do the exorcism.

659
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,960
Make sure that spinster wench dies.

660
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,280
For sure.

661
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,640
You know Bingo Bingo Seobinggo
exorcism is more expensive, right?

662
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,040
Oh, money isn't important.

663
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,280
I will punish the evil spirits!
Bingo, Bingo... Seobinggo!

664
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,080
Seobinggo!

665
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,440
Seobinggo!

666
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,120
Bingo, Bingo, Seobinggo!

667
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,560
Let's get going and hurry up.

668
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,000
Hey, hey! Ji-woong, Ji-woong!

669
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:04,240
Sauces should be stirred in one direction
like this, okay?

670
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,680
How can you be the same now
and two years ago?

671
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,520
Are you a 386 processor?

672
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:12,480
That's why your girlfriend ran away.

673
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,960
Who is?

674
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,720
Who ran away?

675
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,920
She hasn't run off yet.
You're really good at ruining...

676
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,960
-You're so rude.
-I'm just envious, that's all.

677
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,720
-Hey, seriously!
-I'm just envious.

678
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,200
Hey, you Cordon punk.

679
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,960
Why is your meat getting thicker and
thicker?

680
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,400
Is your mom and dad here or something?

681
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,920
Are you going to pay for the cost of
the meat?

682
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,440
Don't you know that the taste isn't right
if the steak is too thin?

683
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:37,840
I don't know, I don't know.

684
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,040
-I should just...
-How many times do I have to say it?

685
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,720
Goodness, Dong-chul.

686
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,720
What is it now?

687
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,880
You're doing so well! So well!
You really look like a chef now.

688
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,360
Where is that new sous chef that's
supposed to be here? It's his first day.

689
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,960
I hear he studied abroad like Jun.

690
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:00,880
I don't know anything about whether he
studied abroad or whatever.

691
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,280
You know what I think?

692
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:08,120
Even when I worked for that crappy
Kang Sun-woo, I was never late once.

693
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,560
How can the sous chef put his apron on
after the chef?

694
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,920
It's totally crazy.

695
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,360
All right, once that punk gets here

696
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,600
I'll make him pee his pants
just by hearing my name.

697
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,560
He's here. He's here.

698
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,760
Excuse me, I'm the new sous chef.

699
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,160
Who are you?

700
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,200
Nice to meet you.

701
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,040
-I'm Edward Seo.
-Oh, okay, okay...

702
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,200
I'm the chef of this restaurant,
Heo Min-soo.

703
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,440
This place is rather small.

704
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,640
I expected it to be larger in scale.

705
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,120
I guess if you see it that way,
you might think that.

706
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,560
But, I don't think it's all that small.

707
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,200
You're not an owner-chef, are you?

708
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,160
From what I know,
Chef Kang Sun-woo is the owner.

709
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,760
Then,

710
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,840
are you a chef on salary?

711
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,760
Yes... That's right.

712
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
But, come over here.

713
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,400
The fact that Chef Kang Sun-woo left
this place in my care...

714
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,560
I think you can take that to mean
that he trusts me a great deal.

715
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,680
Nonetheless, you are a salary chef?

716
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,360
Yes, I do earn a salary, so I am.

717
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,240
-Pay me on time.
-I will.

718
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,400
Hey...

719
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,880
-Hello.
-Hello.

720
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,560
How old?

721
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,720
-23 years old.
-Oh, 23...

722
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,640
-What are you doing later?
-The sous chef is doing weird things....

723
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,440
Why don't we go say hello to the
rest of the family? Come on.

724
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,120
All right now...

725
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,600
Hey!

726
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,520
We're not going to awkwardly introduce
ourselves and say...

727
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:02,520
'Let's work hard together.'
'Let's all work well together.' Right?

728
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,120
-That'll be lame.
-Yeah, that is lame.

729
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,920
If you saw their face, that's good enough.

730
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,360
-Right?
-Of course.

731
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,640
This isn't year 1988.
People don't do those things anymore.

732
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,320
He's so handsome.

733
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,680
So cool.

734
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:23,040
I think I'm going to fall for him
while watching him cook.

735
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:26,760
Does he cook for his image?
Look at him show off.

736
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,640
You see that, right? He's so annoying.

737
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,240
-He's so darn annoying.
-Yeah, he really is.

738
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,400
It's not just boasting though.

739
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,040
I tasted what he made just a while ago.
It was really delicious.

740
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,760
Yeah, he can cook well and
he can adapt well.

741
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,240
He's just a natural.

742
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,720
He's a king of worldly wisdom.

743
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:46,080
Chef Huh, it seems like there's an order
backed up here. Can you check that?

744
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,680
Once you're done,
can you do a squid pasta?

745
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:49,680
Okay.

746
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,160
Chef Huh's not playing around.
Why don't you take care of the pasta?

747
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,080
Is that right? Okay.

748
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,200
Hey, I like you. What's your name?

749
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:05,440
I'm not telling you.

750
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,760
The chopstick is burning.

751
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,680
-Don't you miss Chef Kang?
-Yeah!

752
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,840
-Should we go smoke a cigarette?
-Let's go, let's go.

753
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,440
Have you seen this before? Have you?

754
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,840
One bulgogi pasta and two steak rices
at table two.

755
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,440
Why don't you talk quietly?

756
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,680
The store is snot-sized.
Everyone can hear.

757
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,280
You're the one who's going to cook it,
so who are you yelling it to?

758
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,800
This is the proper protocol. Gosh...

759
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,480
You and your mouth.

760
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,400
Are you going to keep talking back to me?

761
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:36,480
You're learning without even paying
lesson fees.

762
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,720
You said you're going to learn here
and help your dad.

763
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,960
Yeah, I am.

764
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,760
I'm willing to endure through it.
I just don't think this is right.

765
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,400
Why leave your perfectly fine restaurant
and set up this little place?

766
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,960
Gosh, you still have a long way to go.
Go and cut up the vegetables.

767
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,040
It'll take forever to train him.

768
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,080
Sun-woo!

769
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,200
Oh, So-hyung!

770
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,600
It sure took you a long time.
It's been ages since I opened.

771
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,880
Sorry, I've been busy because of a
special I was doing.

772
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,440
What a pretty place. It's so cozy.

773
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,600
Right, it's great.

774
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,720
You sure are amazing, Kang Sun-woo.

775
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,080
The top chef specializing in noodles and
pasta opening up a fusion Korean?

776
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,960
I'm amazed by your ability to take risks.

777
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,640
-Here.
-Goodness!

778
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,520
I figured a plant would just become
bothersome.

779
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,400
Thanks for having so much good sense,
Lee So-hyung.

780
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,880
I'm actually here with someone.
He'll be in after he parks.

781
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,560
-Who?
-A man.

782
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,600
It's been over a month now.

783
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,200
Really?

784
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,800
Awesome!

785
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:38,920
Congratulations! What does he look like?
I'm really curious.

786
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,240
See for yourself.

787
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,720
-So-hyung.
-Yeah.

788
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:49,360
Oh... Hi... Nice to meet you.
My name is Kang Sun-woo.

789
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,320
I heard a lot about you from So-hyung.

790
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,760
My name is Yoon Chang-seob.

791
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,160
I see...

792
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,120
Why don't you sit there for now?

793
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,520
Let's go.

794
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,000
You're really shocked, aren't you?

795
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
I was really shocked when I first saw
him too.

796
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,200
I wondered for a long time if Chang-gyu
had a twin.

797
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,920
I am really shocked!
They look so much alike. It's amazing.

798
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,440
He has an amazing personality too,
just as much as Chang-gyu.

799
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,880
Oh right, what about Bong-sun?
You talk to her often, right?

800
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,840
Of course, every morning and night.
It's just too much.

801
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,960
Still, you should take all her
calls happily.

802
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,280
Think how lonely and hard it'd be for her
in a foreign country.

803
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,480
Oh, this is so pretty.

804
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,320
Is it one of Eun-hee's works?

805
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,560
Eun-hee, Eun-hee! I'm late, aren't I?

806
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,720
No, Mom. We're still okay for time.

807
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,560
Professor Park insisted on coming too
and I had to ditch him.

808
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,960
Why? I like Professor Park.

809
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,720
He seems good-natured and
he only has eyes for you.

810
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,880
He seems like the best out of
all the men you've dated.

811
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,400
Not me. I don't like guys who are
overly considerate like that.

812
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,840
If someone takes care of everything for
me, it can make me get tired of him.

813
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,320
You know, with Choi...

814
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,560
I've never seen this flower before.
Is it new?

815
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,040
Yes. It's called cockscomb.

816
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,040
Even though it's rough right here,
it's very soft on the inside.

817
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
Pretty, isn't it?

818
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,720
I'm not sure.

819
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,880
I don't really like anything that's
prettier than I am.

820
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,400
This flower means undying love.

821
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,000
Like eternal love.

822
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,560
What's eternal in this world?

823
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,120
We'll be late at this rate. Let's go, Mom.

824
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,800
Okay, let's get going.

825
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,360
-Please look after the store.
-Yes, we will.

826
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,960
Eun-hee, don't you think it'd be better
if I went with you?

827
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,600
No, today I want to go alone.

828
00:51:58,160 --> 00:51:59,760
Let's go together next time.

829
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,200
Okay, I understand.

830
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,520
-Be careful.
-The flowers...

831
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,640
Ah, the flowers.

832
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,920
Here you go.

833
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,000
-Are you good?
-Yes.

834
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,920
-Be careful.
-I'll be back.

835
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,640
Thank you.

836
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:31,360
Sung-jae.

837
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,000
Eun-hee.

838
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,680
How are you feeling?
You look better today.

839
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,480
Maybe it's because you were coming today.

840
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,760
I woke up early today,
and I ate a whole bowl of rice.

841
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,240
Oh yeah? That's nice to hear.

842
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,120
Be careful, be careful.

843
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,880
What's this?

844
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:55,720
Your gift for today.

845
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,680
Aren't these cockscomb?

846
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,640
You knew what cockscomb were?

847
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,200
They say that bright flowers help liven
up peoples' moods so I brought them.

848
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,760
-Do you like them?
-Of course, I do.

849
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,120
I like all the flowers that you give me.

850
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,720
Did I, by chance...

851
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,720
Did I like flowers in the past?

852
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,160
No, I don't think you had much interest.

853
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,360
Then it's not the flowers I like...

854
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:29,800
It must be you I like.

855
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,200
That's probably correct.

856
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,560
You were very...

857
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,120
Very good to me.

858
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:41,920
How long...

859
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:44,720
Did you say we lived together again?

860
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,520
Three years.

861
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,800
Three years...

862
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,760
Honestly, I don't remember it.

863
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,760
But, I'm sure I must've been happy.

864
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,560
I keep thinking that.

865
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,440
I wish I could hurry up and remember.

866
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,040
Don't you find me frustrating, Eun-hee?

867
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,600
No, I like you as you are now Sung-jae.

868
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,960
So, you don't have to try too hard
to remember.

869
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,160
Here.

870
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,200
Gosh, seriously...

871
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,600
Is Na Bong-sun seriously cheating on me
or what?

872
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,680
Isn't this going too far?

873
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,760
In the beginning, she sent pictures and
everything.

874
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:39,920
Now, there's no news at all.

875
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,720
You think she has a new guy, don't you?

876
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:46,280
No? Oh, that's not it?

877
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,240
No, that's not it.

878
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,160
Bong has always looked young for her age.

879
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,960
Foreigners will think
she looks like a kid.

880
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,360
How could they view her as a woman?
No, it could never be true.

881
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,440
How could a man not fall for her?

882
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,640
Are you saying people would not
fall for this girl here? Huh!

883
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,560
Look how pretty she is.

884
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:14,600
Look at how her face is glowing.

885
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,160
Gosh, I shouldn't have let her go.
I shouldn't have acted cool about it.

886
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,880
Seriously...

887
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,720
Contact me for goodness sake.

888
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,280
Contact me, would you?

889
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,040
(I miss you.)

890
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,440
I miss you, Na Bong.

891
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,280
For real...

892
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,640
I really miss you.

893
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,160
I should never have let her go!

894
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,200
I shouldn't have.
Guys are probably all over her.

895
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:51,120
She's not even contacting me.

896
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,080
Just contact me!

897
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,840
I'm about to cry, seriously.

898
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,960
Do you really like me?

899
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:05,960
You don't like me, only I do.

900
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,880
Okay, let's go!

901
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:10,640
Two Shreks and one chicken salad
at table seven.

902
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,480
Three papillotes and two of today's soups
at table three.

903
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,960
Three snow steaks and two salads
at table five. Let's go!

904
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,640
-Copy!
-Copy!

905
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,800
-Fire!
-Fire!

906
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,920
Fire!

907
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,760
Hey, hey! Where the heck is that Alfred
or whatever. It's really busy.

908
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,360
I'm not sure. I haven't seen him.

909
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:30,880
Alfred said he's still jet lagged,
so he's asleep.

910
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,920
He's choosing his own break times now.

911
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
That guy has no common sense.

912
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,960
What kind of a loser bum is he?

913
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:42,200
Does he think he's all that because
he studied abroad?

914
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:45,240
Just get a new one! Get a new sous chef!

915
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,880
There's a customer.
Why don't you head out?

916
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,520
-Watch this.
-Gosh.

917
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,040
-Welcome.
-Sous Chef.

918
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,320
Will it just be one person?

919
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,680
Alone...

920
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,360
-Bong!
-Senior.

921
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:03,960
Oh my goodness!

922
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,520
You guys, Bong-sun is here!

923
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,880
-Hey, Jun!
-Who is here?

924
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,040
Bong-sun! Na Bong is here! Na Bong!

925
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:13,160
-Hey.
-Bong!

926
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,320
-Bong!
-Hey, where have you been?

927
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,560
Why have you changed so much?
I can't recognize you!

928
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:24,560
You're a totally new Bong now.

929
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,520
What happened? Did you get here today?

930
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,640
-Did you finish your studies?
-Yes.

931
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,000
You still have your luggage with you.
Did you come straight here?

932
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,760
Oh, gosh, slowly, one at a time, please.

933
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,000
Bong, you, Bad Bong...

934
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,480
You see... This...

935
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,720
-Chef!
-Why didn't you keep in touch?

936
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:43,480
When I saw you again, I was going to...
Hug you like this.

937
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,640
Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong,
Bong, Bong, Bong, Bong.

938
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,360
Please come in.

939
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,840
Oh my.

940
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:06,720
Who is this?

941
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,160
-Aren't you Bong-sun?
-Yes,

942
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,240
how have you been, Mister?

943
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,880
Wow, I thought I'd have a delightful
visitor. I saw a magpie in my dream.

944
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,160
I'm really glad to see you.

945
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:19,840
When did you get back?

946
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,200
Today. Have you been well?
How's your health?

947
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,960
I'm old. I have all kinds of problems.

948
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,200
But, I mostly quit drinking these days.

949
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,760
Really? That's really great.
That's totally good of you.

950
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,840
Hold on. You're here after a long time,
I should serve you something.

951
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,040
No, Mister. I'm just dropping by.
I have a place to be at so I'll come back.

952
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,360
From now, even if you tell me not to come,
I'll be coming by often enough.

953
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,360
I don't know. You'll be busy.
How would you find the time?

954
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,640
You'll be busier now that
you finished your studies.

955
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,520
Here and there,
many places will ask for you.

956
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:57,360
Not at all. I'm still a newbie.

957
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,320
As for a place to work,
I'll take my time looking.

958
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,040
In the mean time, if you can hire me
as a part-time help, I'd be ecstatic.

959
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Oh, really?

960
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,040
Really, would that be okay?

961
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,240
Of course. But, you have to give
me a good hourly rate.

962
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:12,640
You can't pay me with yogurts, okay?

963
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:16,400
Okay, okay.
I'll give you really good hourly wage.

964
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,480
Okay.

965
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
What's this?

966
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,680
Hey, how many
kilograms of shrimps is this?

967
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,640
-10 kilograms.
-What? Why...

968
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,960
I said to order 1 kilogram that feels
like 10 kilograms.

969
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:34,680
I didn't say order 10 kilograms.

970
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:37,440
Why would you say it like that?
It's so confusing.

971
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,040
It's my fault. Damn...

972
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:41,920
What now? On a hot day like this,
what do we do with all these shrimps?

973
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,480
I don't know.

974
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,720
If you're that upset,
just take it out of my paycheck.

975
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,640
Not enough left in your paycheck,
you punk!

976
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,960
This isn't your first time.

977
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:50,960
Forget it.

978
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,160
What would I expect from someone
who bought a basket when I said clams?

979
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:56,120
-If I'm that bad, then hire someone else!
-Oh my.

980
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,200
-I'm quitting as of now.
-You are at it again.

981
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,120
Hey, you...

982
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,920
What time is it?

983
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:06,240
Oh, 3:30.
Why does he quit at 3:30 every single day?

984
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,200
What? You're not stopping me?

985
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,400
He wants to play hard to get now?
What is this?

986
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:17,960
Kang Sun-woo, you better come now.
I'm really quitting.

987
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,920
One, two, three.

988
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,920
Darn it. He's really not stopping me.
What do I do now?

989
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,760
Do I have to beg?

990
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,320
Gosh, whatever.

991
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,280
Na Bong-sun!

992
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,040
Shin Kyung-mo. How have you been?

993
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:48,680
How long has it been?

994
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:51,040
You didn't even keep in touch.
You bad girl.

995
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,280
Shin Kyung...

996
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,560
Oh, I have to go buy shrimps.

997
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:21,960
Here, this is our main menu.

998
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,960
Critique it if you want
or don't critique it.

999
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:28,680
If you studied hard, I'm sure you can
evaluate taste in a more detailed manner.

1000
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:32,880
How did you even decide
to make rice? I'm surprised.

1001
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,400
Hey, I'm more surprised.

1002
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:39,600
How could you just show up
without saying anything?

1003
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,320
I didn't hear from you for months.

1004
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,120
And what's with your look...

1005
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:46,320
-What?
-It doesn't suit you.

1006
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,800
Am I that different?
Do you feel awkward with me, Chef?

1007
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,800
No, not that you are different.
Just feels a bit unfamiliar.

1008
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,360
-What is?
-Go ahead and taste it.

1009
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,360
Okay.

1010
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:26,160
The meat is tender so it has
a nice texture.

1011
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,120
I don't think it was cooked consistently.

1012
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,800
There are medium and rare parts.

1013
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:35,440
And the sauce is good since it's not
too overpowering.

1014
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,120
But, I feel like perilla leaves and onions
alone are not quite enough.

1015
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,920
Perhaps add bean sprouts to make the
texture a bit crunchy?

1016
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,480
Well, I was thinking of adding
bean sprouts too...

1017
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,120
I guess you studied hard.

1018
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,080
-I acknowledge it.
-Of course, I was an honor student there.

1019
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,680
You were studying too hard,
so you couldn't contact me.

1020
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,960
You had no time, huh?

1021
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,960
Chef, are you upset with me?

1022
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:05,560
What? Upset? No, I was super busy too.

1023
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,400
Too busy to contact you.

1024
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,400
I was afraid I would want to come back.

1025
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:15,080
What?

1026
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,040
Because I wanted to meet you so much.

1027
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:19,480
Because I missed you too much.

1028
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:23,320
If I heard your voice,
I was afraid I'd want to run back to you.

1029
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,080
I didn't call on purpose.

1030
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,480
I held it in with all my strength.

1031
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,640
-Do you know how much I missed you?
-Chef.

1032
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,200
You did good. You did good. You did good.

1033
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,040
You did really good. Come here.

1034
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,760
-Chef!
-You did good. You did good.

1035
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,800
-I did good?
-Yes, you did. Come here.

1036
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,840
-Aren't you tired?
-No, not at all.

1037
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:08,080
-Shall we stay like this then?
-Of course.

1038
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,320
-Really?
-Yes.

1039
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,320
-Can I kiss you one more time?
-Of course. Of course.

1040
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,760
I missed you.

1041
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,400
So, what are your plans?

1042
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,960
If you don't have anything specific,

1043
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,600
you can try working with me.

1044
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,080
-Are you trying to scout me now?
-Yes.

1045
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,600
I'm supposed to work at this
place temporarily.

1046
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:43,840
-Really?
-Yeah.

1047
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:44,840
Where?

1048
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:47,320
There's this place. I'll tell you later.

1049
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,080
This place is just as it used to be.

1050
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,960
Stalker!

1051
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,320
Hey, long time no see! Have you been well?

1052
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,520
Wow, you became a father, huh?

1053
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,760
-Wow, baby!
-This is making me tear up.

1054
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,440
-Gosh.
-So cute.

1055
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:06,400
You seem to be more happy to see Stalker
than me.

1056
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:07,440
Stalker!

1057
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,920
-Gosh, seriously.
-Goodness, you and your jealousy.

1058
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,280
What? Jealous?

1059
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,840
Hey! I'm Kang Sun-woo
and you're Na Bong-sun.

1060
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,440
Two years won't change that.
I'm Kang Sun-woo. You're Na Bong-sun.

1061
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,280
How dare you say I'm being jealous.

1062
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,280
And you think I'd be jealous of a dog?

1063
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,280
Well, you are jealous.

1064
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,720
-Oh, my cute Chef.
-Hold on.

1065
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:33,120
If you're like this,
it makes me want to do it with you.

1066
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,400
What's with you?
Are you really Na Bong-sun?

1067
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,440
Are you by chance...

1068
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,640
No, I am Na Bong-sun.

1069
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,400
Are you serious?

1070
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,960
You learned only bad things abroad.
That's not good. We can't.

1071
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,920
We can't?
What is it that we can't do, Chef?

1072
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,600
-Huh? What?
-Seriously

1073
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,280
Really?

1074
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,520
Okay, this won't do. Hold on now...

1075
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,160
-Get off for a second.
-Come on.

1076
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,040
-All right! Goodness.
-Get up.

1077
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,880
Oh my!

1078
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,000
-Today is D-day.
-Chef!

1079
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,280
(Hey, hey, hey! Get over here.)

1080
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:11,640
(Oh... Why, why?)

1081
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,400
(Oh... Is this not it?
Is this not the right one?)

1082
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,560
(No... you got it.)

1083
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,640
(You better be ready. Get over here.)

1084
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,440
(Oh Chef! Why are you...)

1085
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:23,160
(-Oh my.
-Hey!)

1086
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,800
(Chef, would it be okay to turn off
the lights?)

1087
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,000
(Turning off the lights would be normal,
right?)

1088
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,440
(What do I do?)

1089
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:36,600
SUN RESTAURANT

1090
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:39,360
SUN RESTAURANT

1091
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:42,760
Three papillotes at table one.
Two potato soups at table four.

1092
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,560
Two carbonaras at table five.

1093
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,080
We copy that!

1094
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:47,520
Okay, fire!

1095
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,040
Fire!

1096
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:54,200
Welcome.

1097
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,360
-Cook.
-Yes?

1098
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,920
-Two more customers.
-Okay.

1099
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,040
-Could you take my order?
-Please sit over there.

1100
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,120
Please take our orders.

1101
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:05,160
Here are your burnt rice pollack soup
and fish.

1102
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,760
-Bon appetit.
-Thank you.

1103
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:11,920
I thought this household only had
one daughter. Was there another?

1104
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:14,920
Yes, this is my second daughter.

1105
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,240
She came back from studying abroad.
She's pretty, right?

1106
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,680
-Yes.
-Thank you.

1107
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,800
-Bon appetit, everyone!
-Bon appetit.

1108
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,280
The curry and the bulgogi rice are here.

1109
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,480
(As it always does, the seasons change.)

1110
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:31,440
(And the days are filled with routines.)

1111
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:33,280
(That summer...)

1112
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,360
(Because of that girl who came and went
like a summer night's dream.)

1113
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,240
(We got to know love.)

1114
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,560
(And realized how precious relationships
and people are.)

1115
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:44,640
(Just like she had advised me...)

1116
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,840
(I continue to love myself fully today.)

1117
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:49,960
(And...)

1118
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:52,800
(I love him, as well.)

1119
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,399
OH MY GHOST
