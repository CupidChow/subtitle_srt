1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,600
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,120
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,480
You better prepare yourself.

4
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
I'm coming. Come at me, come at me!

5
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,280
(You'll have many ghosts surrounding you.)

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,440
(This place will have lots of ghosts too.)

7
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,400
There are no such things as ghosts.

8
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,800
Gosh, that stalker dog.

9
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,320
Gosh.

10
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,040
Who's there?

11
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,800
Stop pointing that at me. I'll go blind.

12
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,560
Na Bong-sun?

13
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,320
What the heck are you doing?

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What?

15
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,040
Gosh...

16
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 4

17
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,960
So, you were going to break in here
and sleep?

18
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,640
The term 'breaking in' isn't quite right.

19
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,079
It was only for one night.

20
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,320
If I hadn't caught you, you would've
stayed two, three days or longer.

21
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,520
Well, the thing is...

22
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,520
I'm in a really difficult situation.

23
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,000
There's the whole money issue.

24
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,760
And I'm in no position to decide
on a place.

25
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,079
-Can't we work something out?
-No, we can't.

26
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
Why... Why not?

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,400
I'll sleep quietly and be gone
when people arrive.

28
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,960
Even so, you can't!

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,520
Would you like it if someone
slept on the table you ate off of?

30
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,600
And this is a restaurant, not a hotel.

31
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
That may be true...

32
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,160
But, that means the only place I can
go is the subway station.

33
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,640
-Sleep at a friend's place.
-I don't have any friends.

34
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,760
Then, sleep at a motel.

35
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
I should go there with a man.
Why would I go there alone?

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,440
Wow, you're really...

37
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:22,520
So what I'm saying is...
Just let me stay this once.

38
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,920
Consider it as you helping out
a homeless person. Huh?

39
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,440
Come on, Chef...

40
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,520
Gosh.

41
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,560
Just this once.

42
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,760
I can't? Can I?

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,200
Does he have to get so angry
just because I acted cute?

44
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Where am I supposed to go now?
I'm getting desperate.

45
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,800
When that happens...

46
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,360
Which way should I head off to?
Try and guess.

47
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,280
Ding dong Deng. Help me, Professor...

48
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,440
Oh, it's that way!

49
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,120
KOREAN FOOD

50
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,640
Dad's drinking again...

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,880
He won't be well if he keeps that up.

52
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,200
When it comes to fomenting,
elvan stones are the best.

53
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,600
Ah, looks so good.

54
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,159
Oh, he's totally my type.

55
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
You're here?

56
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,960
Sauna is a great place to be.

57
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,080
Honey!

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,920
Honey, let's go somewhere else.

59
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,200
Darn it, it was just getting good.

60
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,200
Gosh...

61
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,200
What's this?
This young lady ate these all by herself?

62
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,440
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

63
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,040
No way.

64
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,159
She's already had two trays.
She must be crazy.

65
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,200
-All that in that stomach of hers?
-How is she doing this?

66
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,080
Maybe her stomach burst?

67
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,840
-Wow
-Really?

68
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Miss, you should stop eating.

69
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,640
Why are you eating so much?

70
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,240
I can't believe it.

71
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,320
A person shouldn't eat this much.

72
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,680
Weren't you the one yelling at me
for possessing someone?

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
What about you!

74
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,960
Hey, do you think it's easy to get food
from ancestral rites these days?

75
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,080
The ghost population is increasing
while there are fewer ancestral rites.

76
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
Think how desperate I must've been.

77
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,520
To possess a skinny chick like her
to fill my tummy.

78
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:23,360
And you don't seem to be in a
better situation yourself.

79
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,720
Hey, don't even go there.

80
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,400
To tell you the truth, I'm trapped.

81
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,160
Trapped?

82
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,760
Oh my. Did you get caught in a body
with a matching frequency?

83
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,560
-Yeah...
-What are you going to do?

84
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
I heard that in the worst cases,
it could be forever.

85
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,880
I know!

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,880
That's why I'm stuck being
a kitchen helper now.

87
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,080
But, it's not all that bad.

88
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,080
Well, it's fun. Living like a human
after being a ghost for a while.

89
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
Actually I met my dad.

90
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,480
And I'm getting back most of my memories.

91
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,800
What if you end up wanting to stay
like this forever?

92
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,880
I doubt it. Why would I?

93
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,720
When I know after three years,
I'd turn into an evil spirit?

94
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,600
My point exactly. You shouldn't
think lightly of evil spirits.

95
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,120
The recent happenings in society...

96
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,520
Such as depravities, crimes,
abductions, and dismemberments...

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
All are the work of evil spirits.

98
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,600
They are the ones going around
possessing humans.

99
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,240
I know that too. That's why I'm worried.

100
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,280
Meeting my dad was nice and all.

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,880
But, I need to resolve my virginity grudge
and get rid of any regrets.

102
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,840
-So that I can ascend.
-Yeah.

103
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,559
And damn it, finding a man of vitality
is like asking for the moon.

104
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,880
Hey, have you ever seen a man of vitality?

105
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,600
She seems insane, right?
She's been at it for two hours.

106
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,240
Why are there so many crazies here anyway?

107
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,160
-Oh my, oh my.
-She must be a bit off.

108
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,520
-Isn't she hot in there?
-My goodness.

109
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,880
Gosh, so heavy.

110
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,600
I couldn't even get proper sleep thanks
to that couple next to me.

111
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,400
Shouldn't they just go
to a motel or something?

112
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,800
Kids these days have no decency.

113
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,400
Officer Choi...

114
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,120
-You're going to work early.
-Yes.

115
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,240
-What is that?
-What?

116
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
Oh, this...

117
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,960
You know those claw machines with prizes?

118
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,120
I won this...

119
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,600
I see. From a claw machine...

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,960
It's huge, right?

121
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,600
Oh, thank you.

122
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,640
-I'll carry these for you.
-Okay, but where are you going?

123
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,840
Thanks for being my ramen friend.
If it wasn't for you, I'd be eating alone.

124
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,480
Shouldn't you go home and have
rice instead?

125
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,160
After night shifts, I crave ramen.

126
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,480
But, Eun-hee doesn't like it when
I eat ramen.

127
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,400
So, sometimes I secretly eat
ramen before I go home.

128
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,840
You must really love her.

129
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,960
Who? Eun-hee?

130
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,720
Maybe...

131
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,280
Well, it seems like I do.

132
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,000
By the way, when did you get married?

133
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,760
You knew right away that she was the one?

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,640
And did Eun-hee like you first?
Or, did you go for her first?

135
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,840
Obviously, I went for her first.

136
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,760
You must've had a lot of interest
in my wife and me.

137
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,040
Just a bit.

138
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,520
As long as you're happy.

139
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,520
Uh...

140
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,040
-Do I have something?
-No, no.

141
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,920
Ah, thank you.

142
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,960
(Why is he so considerate?)

143
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,720
(This makes it difficult for me
to let go.)

144
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,360
-You don't want it?
-What?

145
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,280
No, no... I'm eating.

146
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,720
Wait! It's hot!

147
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
Yes, it's very hot.

148
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,560
-I'm sorry.
-A little bit at a time.

149
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,680
Yes.

150
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,520
Bong-sun, you're a little late today.

151
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,720
Oh, this? I got it from a claw machine
on my way here.

152
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,240
Why? Got something else you want to know?

153
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,920
Uh, no. Go on in and change.

154
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,800
What's wrong with ramen?

155
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,560
What?

156
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,720
I mean, ramen is also food.

157
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,840
It's not like you eat ramen every day.

158
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,840
And you're not going to live
thousands of years.

159
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,160
And it seems like people
who like organic foods

160
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,280
tend to get sick more often
and catch colds easily.

161
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,640
I'm just saying.

162
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
Man, maybe I overdid it last night.

163
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,640
My mouth tastes like a sewer.

164
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,920
Hey, guys, we're banning cream today.
Don't even mention the word cream.

165
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,080
Here, here. Here's a trash can. Trash can.

166
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,680
Okay, here, here.

167
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,080
Gosh, you okay?

168
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,960
You were too much last night.

169
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,640
Want some water?

170
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,640
Water will make me puke too.

171
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,440
If I ever mix drinks again,

172
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm seriously your younger brother, okay?

173
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
I'm sorry! I'm a little late!

174
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,800
A little? Huh?

175
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,320
You, so undisciplined. Are you the only
person who drank last night?

176
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,080
Come on, I wasn't even that late.
What's wrong, Min-soo?

177
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,280
Min-soo? Min-soo?
Why are you calling me that?

178
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,120
Did my mother give birth to you?
Why are you calling me that?

179
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,960
I mean, you told me to call you
Min-soo last night. Min-soo.

180
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,760
I told you to call me Min-soo? Yesterday?

181
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,720
-Yes.
-Total nonsense.

182
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,240
Hey, do you know how much I dislike you?

183
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,880
You're not supposed to remember
any drunk antics.

184
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
That's manners. Right?

185
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,400
Yes, yes, of course.

186
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,680
Good morning!

187
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,000
-You're here?
-Yes.

188
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,440
-Min-soo.
-Yes.

189
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,720
How much did you drink last night?

190
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
A little.

191
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
Damn.

192
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,480
I told you to control yourself
better, didn't I?

193
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,640
-Sauce... Hey, you take care of the sauce.
-Yes, Chef.

194
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,240
You can be in charge of ingredients.

195
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,360
I came too early.

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
What is it?

197
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,440
So pretty, right? My friend's baby.

198
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
The baby just turned one,
but is already running around.

199
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,760
-So pretty...
-Not that pretty.

200
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,920
I really dislike babies and animals.
You can't even communicate with them.

201
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,720
I'm sure you'll be the most loving one
to your niece or nephew.

202
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,200
-You want one?
-Huh?

203
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
Of course, I want a kid.

204
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,000
But lately, I've been
having thoughts like...

205
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,080
Maybe because I want it so bad,
they aren't letting me have one.

206
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,760
-You want some coffee?
-I'll get it. You stay.

207
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,480
-Yes, why?
(-You always answer your calls that way.)

208
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,480
('Yes, why?' is so deflating to hear.)

209
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Come on...

210
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,920
Why are you in attack mode this morning?

211
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,480
-You stayed up all night, huh?
(-You know me too well.)

212
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,680
(Can you come by for a bit today?)

213
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,400
To the studio? Why?

214
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,640
(I think we need a few more scenes
for the preview.)

215
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,320
(Oh, and bring Bong-sun too.)

216
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
Na Bong-sun?

217
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,560
Can't it just be me?

218
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,640
Me?

219
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,760
Wow, this car is really nice.

220
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,280
You know I slept in a public sauna
last night.

221
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,760
There were so many couples on dates.
I just couldn't deal.

222
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,920
I didn't ask.

223
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm just making conversation.

224
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,960
You know that nurungji rice pollack soup?

225
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,440
The timing was so close
on that one, right?

226
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,320
Everyone thinks that the menu was
your idea.

227
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,680
Don't spin your wheels.

228
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,400
It's been aired already and it wasn't
noticeable.

229
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,600
If you want to use that to sleep at
my restaurant, forget it. That's done.

230
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,920
Gosh, so petty, seriously.

231
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,760
(The shoot won't take too long.
It'll be done in an hour.)

232
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:30,120
Similar to the last shoot,
we'll take the image-based approach.

233
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,560
There isn't any dialogue so
you can just cook in comfort.

234
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,400
-You too, Bong-sun.
-Okay.

235
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,760
-Why?
-Oh, no... I got a paper cut.

236
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,320
Gosh! You should've been more careful!

237
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,960
Why are you so klutzy?

238
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,800
Hey, this is actually my finger.

239
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,320
People will think I stabbed you
or something.

240
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,760
I'm just saying... You should be more
careful in general.

241
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
PD Lee!

242
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,240
I heard you worked all night?

243
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,040
-Hello.
-Hello.

244
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,319
You should take it easy.
Get sleep when you can.

245
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:11,480
Didn't you say you're going on
a business trip today? China, was it?

246
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,920
Oh, that... That's tomorrow.

247
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,800
Do you need something?
I hate going to duty-free shops.

248
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,839
But, for you, if you want,
I'll gladly go buy you a present.

249
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,760
That's okay. Just get your wife something.

250
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,280
Wife?

251
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,960
I don't need to buy a present for my wife.
She gets my entire paycheck.

252
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,040
I'm serious. You can tell me.

253
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,280
I can buy you a luxury good...
Well, not really, but something similar.

254
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,000
Actually, do you want to just come
to China?

255
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,440
I can get a room and wait for you.
You should seriously consider...

256
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,160
Senior, seriously.

257
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,200
Don't you ever get tired of constantly
hitting on me?

258
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,520
With this much effort, you would've
had several affairs with other women.

259
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,440
My point exactly. There aren't any men
with devotion like me.

260
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,240
Uh, we were in the middle of
a conversation.

261
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,880
Some people have zero manners.

262
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm sorry. I was rude.

263
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,880
Gee, so scary.

264
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes, Director. I'm in a meeting room
next door. I'm on my way now.

265
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,360
Gosh...

266
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,640
Why is he so rude?

267
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,600
Just ignore him. He's always like that.

268
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,880
Good work, Chef. You too, Bong-sun.

269
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,760
Yes.

270
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,360
Anyway, Bong-sun must've been
born to be in front of the camera.

271
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,040
She keeps a straight face,
and she's so good.

272
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,480
I think someone else is better
at keeping a straight face.

273
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,920
-Who?
-What are you saying?

274
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,080
Never mind. It's just that.

275
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,360
-PD Lee.
-Yes, Senior.

276
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,920
Did you, by chance, see my car keys?

277
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,400
Car keys? Nope.

278
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,160
-Did you lose it?
-Ah, where did it go?

279
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,600
I remember parking my car and
putting the keys in my pocket.

280
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,760
Where could it be?

281
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,880
Today's my wife's birthday,
so we're supposed to get dinner.

282
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,680
And there's a bouquet in my car.

283
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,080
Hey, wait up.

284
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,040
Okay.

285
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,720
Let's get some chicken and beer. My treat.

286
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,880
-Bong-sun, you too.
-Okay.

287
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,560
You came before lunch,
so you must be hungry.

288
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,080
Chicken and beer... Sounds good.

289
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,720
What chicken and beer?
We need to get to the restaurant.

290
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Chef Kang,

291
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,360
sometimes the owner should
be absent so the workers can breathe.

292
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,200
Just eat and go. I'm hungry too.

293
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,480
Oh, you're hungry?

294
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,120
Yes. I didn't have lunch yet.

295
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,280
I need to drop by my office.
Want to wait at the bar across from here?

296
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Okay.

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
You like PD Lee, right?
She's not just a friend, right?

298
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,880
What?

299
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,160
I figured it all out before.

300
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,520
-You 'like' like her.
-What the heck are you doing?

301
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,120
We've been friends for how many years now?

302
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,480
If you're going to talk nonsense, go home.
No chicken for you.

303
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,160
Okay...

304
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,280
Based on what I saw...

305
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,480
-Oh, it's here.
-What the...

306
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,800
Then what is this? Huh? Huh?

307
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,000
I know this isn't yours. Then whose is it?

308
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,560
What are you doing? Give it back now.

309
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,720
I don't know if you have any right to ask
for it when you aren't the owner.

310
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Actually I saw everything.
I saw you taking this.

311
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
Okay, okay, just give it.

312
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,720
Why are you acting this way? So imprudent.

313
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,080
You taking this away from me won't
solve anything.

314
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,720
Before... When that Senior was hitting
on PD Lee, you were annoyed, right?

315
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,920
So, you stole it like this and this
on purpose right?

316
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,520
Why are you going on and on about
writing a novel? Give it to me now.

317
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,880
Why would you act this way?
You should know better.

318
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
What?

319
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,800
Negotiation. You let me crash in the hall.

320
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,960
Wow, you little...
Where did you learn to be so malicious?

321
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,880
I honestly don't think you're in
a position to be aggressive here.

322
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,120
If the fact that you stole this
gets revealed

323
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,240
imagine what PD Lee would think.

324
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,480
This is a criminal act. Theft.

325
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,560
What?

326
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,120
I had to talk to the assistant producer.

327
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,800
Why are you all standing around?
Did you order the chicken?

328
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,960
Yes, we ordered it.

329
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,840
Let's eat, let's eat. Oh, looks yummy...

330
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,240
The chicken here is pretty good.

331
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,920
It is, right? Looks yummy!

332
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,360
Why aren't you eating?
You keep drinking water.

333
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,080
-Are you dieting?
-No, what diet? Go on and eat.

334
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,560
Yum, chicken really is the truth.

335
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,400
By the way, did that senior of yours
find his car keys?

336
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,960
No, he ended up calling a locksmith in
the end.

337
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,560
He threw a fit saying what a waste of
money it was.

338
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,040
It's his fault for losing it.
Who can he blame?

339
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,080
If he weren't my senior,
I'd want to just do something to him.

340
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,600
He's a bit immature.

341
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,880
He seemed that way.

342
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,000
Yeah, but he must be really angry.
I heard it costs a lot of money.

343
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,680
But, do you think someone did it on
purpose?

344
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,560
Like someone with a grudge.

345
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,320
I don't think anyone would do it on
purpose. That seems so childish.

346
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,560
Yes, it would be childish.
You're right. It's very childish!

347
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,200
-Can I have some water here?
-Sure.

348
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,360
Oh!

349
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:37,160
I think there's something in my
pocket and it's so uncomfortable...

350
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,960
-Oh, what is this...
-Hey...

351
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,840
What could it be? Ah, it's a gum wrapper.

352
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,960
Oh, but there's something else in there.
Yeah, there's another thing.

353
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,360
It's really large and heavy.

354
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,440
-Hey!
-Huh?

355
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,960
Weren't you saying you needed to go to
the restroom before?

356
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,280
-The restroom?
-Yes, I have to go too.

357
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,720
Let's go.

358
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,400
-We'll be right back.
-Okay.

359
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,960
What is this? Oh my, oh my, oh my!

360
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,600
Hey,

361
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,920
-are you going to keep playing around?
-What did I do?

362
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,560
Wow, really?

363
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,880
Do you think this is a card you can play?

364
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,040
What if I say I found it somewhere?

365
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,000
Even if you found it somewhere,
it's strange to keep it until now.

366
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,440
It's not like we didn't see him running
around like crazy to find it.

367
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,640
This situation would look suspicious
to anyone.

368
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,160
If you're done talking, I'll be going.

369
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,440
Wait, wait, wait.

370
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,240
Well...

371
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,640
-You...
-Yes?

372
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
It's only until you can find a place.

373
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,600
Of course! If I say otherwise,
I'd be a bullshitter.

374
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,080
Even if you asked me to stay longer,
I can't stay.

375
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,200
Okay.

376
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,720
No... give me the key!

377
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,920
Oh, the key?

378
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,280
You're not going to take these
and back out, right?

379
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,560
Do you think I'm like you?

380
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
That worked out well for us.

381
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,560
That girl... That girl...

382
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,160
Well, when did it start?

383
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,680
Was it at first sight?

384
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Or did it happen gradually and
you didn't realize it?

385
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,800
Why don't you just confess your feelings?
I heard that PD Lee is single.

386
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,680
If you're sure of your feelings,

387
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,760
having been married once isn't a flaw.

388
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,480
Just be resolute and go for it.

389
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,560
Why hold in your feelings?
If you do, they'll just turn to crap.

390
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:45,320
If you hesitate like this,
then some weird guy would just...

391
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,440
DAILY SALES RECORD

392
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,320
Shut your mouth or you're dead.

393
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,560
Oh... How charismatic.

394
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,480
Find a place quickly.
I can't let you stay here long.

395
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,560
What a temper.

396
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,320
I guess he really does like her.

397
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,840
Gosh. Of all people, why Na Bong-sun?

398
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,720
What the heck is this? How embarrassing.

399
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
Gosh, really...

400
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,280
My goodness.

401
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,840
What's that now?

402
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,120
How great is this to not
have to sneak around?

403
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,120
Whether you're a human or a ghost,

404
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,160
you have to make use of
your opportunities.

405
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,640
Are you making something?

406
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,560
Oh, Chef! I'm making stir-fry rice.

407
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,280
Because I only had chicken,
I was craving rice.

408
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:46,160
There was some rice lying around.
Chef, do you want some?

409
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,720
Wow, the smell is to die for!
It really is.

410
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,040
You can eat it all.

411
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,960
Are you sure you don't want some?
Even ghosts with a full stomach look good.

412
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,880
Just turn down the music.
The volume's too loud.

413
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,240
It's going to be really good.

414
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,640
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
Get out.

415
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,880
How can I eat this by myself when the
smell is everywhere?

416
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,480
Just taste it.

417
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,520
So, this is what your room looks like,
Chef.

418
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,960
It's not as clean as I thought it'd be.

419
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,360
Chef, you have a dog?

420
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,520
-That's so unexpected.
-Be quiet.

421
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,080
Don't you know I don't eat rice? Get out.

422
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,560
Yeah, but why not?
Why would a Korean not eat rice?

423
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,680
Did you eat rice and get really bad
indigestion in the past?

424
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,160
It's none of your business.

425
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,960
I'm tired. Just leave already.

426
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,840
Since I brought it,
eat it if you change your mind.

427
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,560
So stubborn...

428
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,360
Sleep well. Goodnight! Bye.

429
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,400
That girl really isn't normal,
that's for sure.

430
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,960
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

431
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,760
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

432
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,000
She couldn't even look me in the
eye before.

433
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,600
If someone has good intentions,
can't you just accept that?

434
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,920
-Did you just speak informally?
-Can't you just accept that, sir?

435
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,640
-Hey.
-Oh...this is nice.

436
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,680
Gosh.

437
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,600
Negotiation. You let me crash in the hall.

438
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,920
How could a person change that much?

439
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,400
There's nothing similar about her.

440
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,640
Is it good?

441
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,360
You're eating it like crazy... Like crazy.

442
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,280
It's still only rice.

443
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,320
She's really going all out!
What's with her style of music?

444
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,560
Where did she find music like that...

445
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,360
Gosh...

446
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,560
Maybe it was too cold when I slept.

447
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,760
I should turn off my air conditioner.

448
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,440
Today has been a really long day.

449
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,680
Really long, really long...

450
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,960
-Wake up.
-Ah, seriously...

451
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,280
Hey, hey!

452
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,240
-Hey, Na Bong!
-Yes?

453
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,240
Are you working out in your dream
or something?

454
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,440
-Huh?
-Get up already!

455
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,400
-People will come soon.
-Oh, okay.

456
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,080
-Get ready quickly.
-Okay.

457
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,640
People will get the wrong idea.

458
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,680
Now that my memories are back,
I'm having bad dreams.

459
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,520
Hey, Bong.

460
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,520
What's with you?
You came in early to clean up?

461
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,680
I just happened to wake up early today.

462
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,000
-Hey, Bong Bong Roo Bong.
-Yes?

463
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,320
-Why do you look like that?
-What?

464
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,560
Did you sleep outside somewhere?

465
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,320
-No, I didn't.
-Oh, Bong.

466
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,240
-You didn't go home last night, right?
-What?

467
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,000
-You're wearing the same clothes.
-No, I'm not.

468
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,160
The box of abalones is in.
What are you doing chatting out here?

469
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,280
Did you go to the morning market?
You're so diligent, Chef.

470
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,400
It's too early in the morning to be
sucking up to me.

471
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,640
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

472
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,240
Be careful, would you?

473
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,160
Okay, it's a secret right?

474
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,600
Our little secret.

475
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,280
Careful... Careful...

476
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Careful, Careful... Don't get caught.

477
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,680
Oh, I'm so stressed out.

478
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,920
I'm even getting a headache.

479
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,120
I must be getting a bad cold.
Even dogs don't get colds in the summer.

480
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,880
Allez...

481
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,880
Lunge, lunge.

482
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,960
Lunge... Lunge.

483
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,880
Our Sous Chef's form is excellent.

484
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,040
I thought we were in
Taeneung Training Center or something.

485
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Look at this. Look at his body muscles.

486
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,920
You're not, by chance...
From the Shaolin Temple?

487
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,720
Why don't you try shouting out...

488
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,680
It's Bruce Lee, you guys! It's Bruce Lee!

489
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,040
Hey, hey. Look at this, look.

490
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,240
Check out this muscle here. This is
only possible from the actual battle.

491
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,480
This is different from those weak muscles
that people make at gyms.

492
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,640
Sous Chef, we don't have any leeks.

493
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,400
Leeks?

494
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,960
Oh, right. Chef told me to buy some.

495
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,880
Today's special is basil pasta.
We have to add leeks on top.

496
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,480
Should I go to the market and buy some?

497
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,280
Hey, Cordon. You need to get some
lessons on adaptability.

498
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,880
Are leeks the main menu?

499
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,520
It's not. Does basil pasta need leeks?

500
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,720
Why not use the scallions over there?

501
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,520
Wow, you're really clever.

502
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,200
You're smart.

503
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,360
Should I prepare the scallions, Sous Chef?

504
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,080
This is what they call
'thinking as you go.'

505
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,960
This is why experience is important.

506
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,120
Yes, Sous Chef.

507
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,960
-Ji-woong.
-Yes?

508
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,360
Why the scallions?

509
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,560
-Oh...
-Chef.

510
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,960
What do you think of putting scallions
on top of the basil pasta?

511
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,160
I think a change would be good.

512
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,440
You didn't buy the leeks, did you?

513
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,240
-No, I didn't.
-Good going.

514
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,120
If the color is similar,
you think it's okay to use?

515
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,240
Why not just use a weed?

516
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,720
-Where is she anyway?
-Me?

517
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,520
Why?

518
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,560
Do you have something to say to me?
Like a secret?

519
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,640
Tell her to buy some leeks.

520
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,080
Be quiet and buy some leeks.

521
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,120
Leeks? Yeah.

522
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,040
-Hurry!
-I'm going!

523
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:36,640
Where is the store for the leeks?

524
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,640
Leeks... Leeks.

525
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,360
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

526
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,280
-I need to make bean sprout soup.
-Okay.

527
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,560
-Give me 2,000 won worth.
-Okay.

528
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,960
Looks nice and plump.

529
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,920
No, not these!
The short ones here with the long roots.

530
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,880
These are good for soups.

531
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,120
Young lady, it's been a long time.

532
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,800
The long ones are good for things
like steamed fish.

533
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,880
Oh, is that right?

534
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,160
I guess you have a better eye since
you are a famous chef.

535
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
-Thank you.
-It's nothing really.

536
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,840
I don't know if I'm just burdening you
by poking my nose into your business.

537
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,720
Oh no! It's not a burden at all.

538
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,400
You must be out to buy groceries too.

539
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,680
Well, I'm not here for fun.

540
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,600
-Looks like you bought a lot.
-Yes, this and that.

541
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,600
-I'll give you a hand.
-Oh no...

542
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,320
You'll find this burdensome too, right?

543
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,520
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

544
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,520
-Here's the 2,000 won.
-Thank you.

545
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,560
-Bye.
-Bye!

546
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,360
Please, come in.

547
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,120
Okay, thank you!

548
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,960
Wait a moment.

549
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,840
Here, have one.

550
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,760
Since you're offering, I'll drink it.

551
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,240
I'm not one to find things like this
burdensome or anything.

552
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,679
Okay, I got it. You can stop now.

553
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,199
I was wrong.

554
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,080
What? About what?

555
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:18,600
You were hurt by what I said, right?

556
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,520
You hold quite the grudge,
just like someone else I know.

557
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,960
Who's that?

558
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,880
My daughter.

559
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,600
She was very easy going,

560
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,719
but when she's pissed off,
it lasted a while.

561
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,920
One time she wanted a perm, but I told
her to go later since we were busy.

562
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,400
She was quite upset.

563
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,000
What was the big deal?.

564
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,280
I should've let her do
what she wanted when she wanted

565
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,080
Oh, my.

566
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,920
Strangely, I keep talking about my
daughter whenever I see you. I'm sorry.

567
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
To be honest,

568
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,320
I was worried that
you wouldn't be coming by again.

569
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,240
I was very concerned.

570
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,160
Why would I not visit?
I would've come for the food, at least.

571
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,960
Here, let me throw that away.

572
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,040
Do you drink a lot these days?

573
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,400
Oh, just to kill time when I'm alone.

574
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,600
That's not okay.
From now on, you should drink with me.

575
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,800
-Don't drink alone.
-What?

576
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,560
Even if you feel this is burdensome
or whatnot, there's no other way.

577
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,680
When it comes to soju,
you'll only drink with me. Okay?

578
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,480
-Promise.
-But...

579
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,840
Here.

580
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,640
I'm not sure if that's possible,

581
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,360
but okay for now.

582
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,520
You promised so you have to keep
your promise.

583
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,560
We are now drinking buddies.

584
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,400
Okay, I got it.

585
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
-You should get going, right?
-Leeks.

586
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,520
-I'm going now.
-Okay, be safe.

587
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,640
I will.

588
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,320
You came again?
What charity did you give this time?

589
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,160
If you hate charity that much,
why don't you go help your father?

590
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,160
Fine, just tell me.

591
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,560
What is it? Does my dad look rich
or something?

592
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,480
You think the old man's
got some money, huh?

593
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,040
Not true. You're completely off.

594
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,520
We rent that place.
And we barely make rent.

595
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,880
You little...

596
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,880
Your head must be full of crap
if that's all you can think of. Shush!

597
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,040
Shush?

598
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,880
You! And don't drop honorifics,
unless you want to die.

599
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,280
Gosh, you punk.

600
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,880
I mean why does she keep
hovering around us?

601
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,280
Maybe it's me?

602
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,040
Yes, it was about me. Me.

603
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
No wonder.

604
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,600
Gee, I really don't like breaking
a girl's heart.

605
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,120
Looks like I'll make another one cry.

606
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,520
Hey...

607
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,480
Two specials and one vongole pasta
for table 6, right?

608
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
Yes, Chef.

609
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,520
Min-soo, you take care of the specials.

610
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,160
Dong-chul, you take on the vongole.

611
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,360
-Me?
-Yes.

612
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,400
Why? Are you feeling that sickly?

613
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,440
How did you manage to catch a cold in
summer? Even dogs don't get them.

614
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,840
Just go rest. We'll manage here.

615
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,840
-Look at you. You look so pale.
-When you finish...

616
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,200
When you finish these, clean up.
And start prepping for dinner.

617
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,680
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

618
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,520
And get these out and put them away
in the fridge.

619
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,760
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

620
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,440
Oh, and let's try to adjust the water
amount for the dough.

621
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,200
It's summer.
We have to consider the temperature.

622
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,560
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

623
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,600
Oh, and that salt...

624
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,720
Go in and rest.
We'll take care of everything.

625
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,680
Hey, open the back door.
Let the virus out.

626
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,280
Brother, you seem to have a fever.
Maybe you should go to the hospital?

627
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,240
It's okay. I have cold medicine.
I'll be better after I get some sleep.

628
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,400
Then, just take the whole day off.
Leave the kitchen to Min-soo.

629
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,960
I'll see.

630
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,960
Take care of the hall for me.

631
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,120
And close out the POS system at
the end of the day.

632
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,560
Yes, why?

633
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,560
(Again, 'Yes, why'...
I'm going to hang up.)

634
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,080
Alright, I'm sorry. What is it?

635
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,800
(Do you have a cold?
Your voice is all stuffy.)

636
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,240
Yeah, a little bit.

637
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,120
You were fine yesterday.

638
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,240
(Did you have medicine?
Should I bring you some porridge?)

639
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,360
-Can you even come?
(-No.)

640
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,080
(I have so much editing to do.)

641
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,840
(The Chief saw the episode and suddenly
he threw a fit saying the set's too dark.)

642
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,840
(What does he expect us to do now?)

643
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,560
(So, we're changing the set next week and
pushing the shoot time back two hours.)

644
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,520
(Are you very sick?)

645
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,440
No, no... Thanks for letting me know then.

646
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,400
Okay, bye.

647
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,760
I guess the evil house spirit went
somewhere else.

648
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,960
That's a relief.

649
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,880
I do feel most at home when I'm here.

650
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,720
I wonder if Chef is feeling really sick.

651
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,080
It's not good to take medication on
an empty stomach.

652
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,600
Should I take up some rice porridge?

653
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,640
Forget it, why bother.

654
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,000
Being nosy is an illness too.
I'm so tired.

655
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,680
Chef...

656
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,320
Are you very sick?

657
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,880
Chef!

658
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,880
He must be really sick.

659
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,040
Chef?

660
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,040
Hey, Chef...

661
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,880
Chef!

662
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,480
You really ought to have some
rice porridge or something.

663
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,040
If you have an empty stomach,
you won't get better.

664
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
Chef!

665
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,960
Wow, look at that sweat.

666
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,280
He must have a fever too.

667
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,840
What should I do?

668
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,200
Chef, have some rice porridge.

669
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,080
Chef...

670
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,160
Oh, you're awake.

671
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,120
Chef, I brought you some porridge.

672
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,520
Have some of this and eat your medicine.

673
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:43,200
I'll leave it here,
so make sure to eat it.

674
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,160
And if there's anything wrong,
make sure to call for me, okay?

675
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
What is it?

676
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,760
Does your head hurt?

677
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Should I bring a wet cloth?

678
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,160
Oh my, what!

679
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
What?

680
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,560
-What is this?
-What do you mean, what?

681
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,000
What are you doing in here?
How did you get inside?

682
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:53,760
So, I came in here to bring you some
rice porridge and...

683
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,880
You did this to me suddenly, Chef.

684
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,560
Don't you remember?

685
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,200
-Get out.
-Excuse me?

686
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,480
I said, get out.

687
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,240
But...

688
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,880
But, I was just worried about you
eating medicine on an empty stomach...

689
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,040
-Just hurry and go.
-No.

690
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,640
-Hurry, stand up.
-Oh my, what is this suddenly...

691
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,160
-Hurry up. Leave.
-Oh my. What is this!

692
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,320
Wait, my shoes!

693
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,720
-Here, your shoes.
-I'm just so confused...

694
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,440
-Hurry, just go. Just go.
-This doesn't make sense.

695
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,960
Oh my, oh my, oh my!

696
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,840
Why's he getting mad?
He's the one who did it!

697
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,360
Wait a minute.

698
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,680
We did it properly, right?

699
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,080
Then, why is he totally fine?

700
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,960
How could I, with her?

701
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,480
Kang Sun-woo, you crazy idiot.

702
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,680
-What is it?
-Are you okay?

703
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,320
What?

704
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,640
Is your heart beating really fast
or pulse racing?

705
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,400
Or is your temperature dropping and
do you feel chilly?

706
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,960
-Are you feeling okay?
-I'm fine.

707
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,040
Just leave! Please leave!

708
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,640
-Are you okay?
-Please just leave!

709
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,720
Are you really feeling okay?

710
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,840
You're totally fine?
There's nothing wrong with your body?

711
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,720
Wow, really?

712
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,760
Open the door, would you?

713
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,840
(I just need ten minutes, Ma'am.
I'm looking for someone. Ten minutes...)

714
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,160
I'm right, aren't I?

715
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,760
-I think you are.
-I am, right?

716
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,040
I found him! Man of vitality!

717
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,640
I can finally shed myself of this
dreadful virgin ghost status.

718
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,120
-I can finally leave this place.
-My goodness!

719
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,960
Yay!

720
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,040
Is she okay?

721
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,960
-Hey, Bong.
-Yes?

722
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,360
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

723
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,960
Are you going to clean me away too?

724
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,520
Oh, sorry.

725
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,240
It's fine. I like having it cleaned.

726
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,440
Sorry about that.

727
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,160
Is Chef still sleeping?

728
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,160
Shouldn't someone go check on him?
He wasn't feeling well yesterday.

729
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,160
-I'll go upstairs.
-No, I will!

730
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,440
I'll go up. Yes.

731
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,520
Chef, you went to the market?

732
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,000
You should've skipped it today.
You're not well. I'll take it.

733
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:33,360
Forget this. The meat delivery's here.
Go get that.

734
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,040
Chef, are you feeling better?

735
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:37,280
Yeah, a bit.

736
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,480
It doesn't seem like a bit.
You look totally great.

737
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,920
You looked like you were half-dead
just yesterday.

738
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,120
Something good must've happened
last night.

739
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,960
What do you mean something good!

740
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,800
Go outside and get the meat.

741
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,880
What... What is it?

742
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,240
Yes, what?

743
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,000
Okay, I admit it.

744
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,720
It was my mistake. I'm sorry. I was wrong.

745
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:35,520
For what?

746
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,920
For what happened yesterday...

747
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:44,800
I had taken the medication
and I had a fever...

748
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,960
Regardless, it was my fault
so I apologize.

749
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,400
I don't like it being uncomfortable,
so don't put too much meaning behind it.

750
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,760
Nothing will change between you and me.
Got it?

751
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,640
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hold on.

752
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,000
-What is it?
-Hold on.

753
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:23,400
-Wait.
-Why are you doing this?

754
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,840
-Don't put that on.
-Why, why?

755
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,040
-Hold on.
-Hey, are you crazy?

756
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,640
-Wait a second.
-Let go of me.

757
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,800
-Hey, hey!
-Oh my, ouch!

758
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,680
-Wait, wait.
-Hey!

759
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,440
Are you really crazy?

760
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,240
Yes, yes. Just assume that I'm crazy.
It'll be easier for you that way.

761
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,840
Okay then, I have a favor to ask.
Can you do me one favor?

762
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,760
I'd really like it if you did
this favor for me.

763
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,080
-A favor?
-Yes.

764
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,440
What is it?

765
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,480
Just once...

766
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,400
Can you do it with me?

767
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,440
-Hurry it up. It's raining!
-Gosh.

768
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:11,920
-What did you say?
-Yes,

769
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,440
it's what you're thinking right now.

770
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,680
What am I thinking right now?

771
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,640
Why do you keep asking?
It's not like you don't know!

772
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,040
You're really...

773
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,600
Wait! You're an adult and she's...

774
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,240
I mean, I'm an adult.

775
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,000
And yesterday,
wasn't that like a sneak preview?

776
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,520
So, let's negotiate.

777
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:34,520
Anyway, it's not like it's a big deal.

778
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,600
Shut up! I think you're truly crazy.
Go to the hospital.

779
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,680
-No...
-Hospital, okay. Go.

780
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,240
-Get off, seriously!
-I'm not done talking yet.

781
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:43,560
Just once.

782
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,120
Chef! Chef, just one time.

783
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,120
I'm asking because of
certain circumstances.

784
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,040
I don't even need you to do it twice.

785
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,680
-Just once, exactly once.
-Seriously!

786
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,080
Seriously, what's up with you?

787
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:58,360
-Just once...
-Do you think this makes any sense?

788
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,880
What kind of girl has no pride like this?
You want to do what?

789
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:04,360
Yes, I don't need pride or any of that.

790
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,560
So, just close your eyes and do it once.

791
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,360
It's not like your body will change
by doing it the one time. Right?

792
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,880
Wow, listen to you...

793
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,680
-Who are you, exactly?
-Just once...

794
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,920
Is this the real you?
Are you a con artist?

795
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,120
-No, I'm not.
-Are you planning something on me?

796
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,160
No, that's not it at all!

797
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,640
Look, I know you have feelings for
someone else. I know that.

798
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,360
Person-to-person,
just do this for me once.

799
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,480
Can't you think of it as giving a gift?

800
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,960
Just once.

801
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,800
Hey, clean the dishes properly!

802
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,280
-Hurry up, Na Bong.
-No...

803
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:40,280
Chef, please just once. I'm asking you.

804
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:42,440
-Do the dishes...
-Just once.

805
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,920
Just once...

806
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,760
What's she asking Chef for 'just once'?

807
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,160
Is she asking for an advance?

808
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,200
Maybe some time off.

809
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,400
Chef's facial expression looks disturbed.

810
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:56,800
-Slice it thinly.
-Please...

811
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,880
Yes, Chef.

812
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,840
Just once.

813
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,880
Just one time.

814
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,000
Just once!

815
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,240
I brought some fried pancakes for you.

816
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,400
I brought it for you to eat.

817
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:23,040
Oh wow, the mattress is really good.

818
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,920
The chair down there is really hard.

819
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,480
Oh, it's so nice here.

820
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:32,840
Wait... Wait now!

821
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,600
I wanted to eat the fried pancakes
with you.

822
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,600
Wait. Hold on a second!

823
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,480
Hey, shush.

824
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,880
Quiet!

825
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,080
Just once.

826
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,480
One time.

827
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:30,440
-Oh, you startled me.
-Just once.

828
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,240
-When did you come in here?
-A while ago.

829
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,480
-Oh yeah?
-Yes.

830
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,280
You sleep here.

831
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,560
I'll go sleep somewhere else.

832
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,800
Chef, Chef, Chef!

833
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:42,880
I...

834
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,280
He's getting further away.

835
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,240
Who is that?

836
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,640
Sun-woo, is that you?

837
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,840
-What are you doing here?
-The door, please.

838
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,960
Yeah, okay.

839
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,760
What's he doing here?

840
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,840
If you'd told me you were coming,

841
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:22,040
I would've washed the sheets and cleaned.

842
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,600
You always sleep at the restaurant and
never come home.

843
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,440
Oh, this won't do.

844
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,480
Mom!

845
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,640
We need some fresh air.

846
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,640
I'm just here to sleep.
Don't bother yourself with me.

847
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,440
What about food? Are you hungry?
Should I make something for you?

848
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,240
-Oh, I can't really cook.
-Yeah.

849
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,920
Go to sleep then.
Call me if you need something.

850
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,280
-Alright.
-Okay.

851
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,840
-What now, Mom?
-Wash up and sleep. Wash up.

852
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,400
-Wash up.
-No, Mom. No...

853
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,720
I just want to sleep.

854
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,040
-Yeah? Okay.
-Just sleep.

855
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,480
-Is Sun-woo here?
-Yes.

856
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,800
What's he doing here?

857
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,560
He stops by, but he never sleeps here.

858
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,720
That's what I'm saying.
You think it's odd too?

859
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:15,400
No matter what I do,
he doesn't care and sleeps at the store.

860
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,680
How's the restaurant these days?

861
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,600
Well, he's not feeling well,
but nothing else is going on...

862
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,880
Mom, it's really late.

863
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:34,000
Hey, it's me, Cho Hye-young.

864
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,800
Oh, I'm sorry. Can you wake up?

865
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,760
I'm calling because my son is suddenly
acting out of character and I'm nervous...

866
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:46,200
Is that so?

867
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,040
He doesn't need to be there for
the ancestral rite, right?

868
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:53,200
Okay, I got it. I'll be there tomorrow.

869
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,640
Is that Seobinggo?

870
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,480
I think we need to prepare an
ancestral rite or something.

871
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,280
It's been bothering me that he has
ghosts surrounding him.

872
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,960
He's already got a strong vitality,
as it is.

873
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,200
You should come with me tomorrow.

874
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,560
-Me?
-Yeah.

875
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:12,400
We'll go and ask about things.
It'll be good.

876
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,560
Tell your brother that you're going
to the hospital with me.

877
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,200
Gosh...

878
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,480
It's a ghost.

879
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,120
Okay, then you go and take care of
your business. Don't worry.

880
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,600
Yeah, okay.

881
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,360
Eun-hee must be coming in late.

882
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,320
Where did you sleep yesterday?

883
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,800
Why do you care where I sleep?

884
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,400
I don't really care,
but I'm just a little curious.

885
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,480
We do have a close enough relationship
for me to curious.

886
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,640
Be quiet!

887
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,200
I'm going to sew your mouth shut.

888
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:01,040
He really isn't easy, that one.
I need to come up with a plan quickly.

889
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,600
-Bong.
-Yes?

890
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,360
You need to clean the break room.
The floor's a mess.

891
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,600
I will.

892
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,440
-Bong Bong Roo Bong?
-Yes?

893
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,520
-Why's your face so flushed red?
-Is it?

894
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,720
Did you drink?

895
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,760
-Of course not.
-Are you sure you don't have a fever?

896
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,800
You have a fever.
Na Bong-sun, you have a cold.

897
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,120
A cold? Me?

898
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,680
I doubt it...

899
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,760
Ah, crap!

900
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,320
-Crap?
-Crap?

901
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,320
You're right. He did give it to me.

902
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,840
From who?

903
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:43,200
There's a guy... Man of vitality.

904
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,880
He didn't even do it and gives me a cold.

905
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,240
He has no manners.

906
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,560
-Who is this man of vitality?
-Who knows?

907
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,480
Does she have a relative with
the last name Yang?

908
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,040
She doesn't have relatives.
What do you think he didn't do for her?

909
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,280
I'm not sure.

910
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,920
So, this man of vitality didn't do what
Bong asked him to do.

911
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,400
He just gave her a cold instead.

912
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,800
Wow, he really has poor manners.

913
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,840
I don't know who it is,
but he is a shameless punk!

914
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,560
-Hey, Bong.
-Yes?

915
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,720
What's with your face?
Have you been drinking?

916
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,960
No, I caught a cold.
I got infected from a certain somebody.

917
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,760
Do you need money, by the way?

918
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
Huh?

919
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,480
It seemed like you were asking the
Chef for an advance.

920
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,240
Ask me if it doesn't work out.

921
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,640
I can lend you 1 million won.

922
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,080
Ah, that Cordon. He is really tempting.

923
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,640
What should I do?

924
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,800
Should I give him another go?

925
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:46,440
SHAMAN HOUSE

926
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,840
Hold on.

927
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,800
You can perform an ancestral rite
for sure?

928
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,320
Didn't you say you're not in good shape?

929
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,080
Oh, that's not affected.

930
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,400
I just need to put in my best effort.

931
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:05,600
And it's the spirit that provides.
So don't worry.

932
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,680
Fine. Then, I'm trusting you.

933
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,360
You should trust me.

934
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,400
Why'd you bring mixed bills.
You should put all 50,000 won bills.

935
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,080
-I'm sure it's correct.
-It's correct.

936
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,200
Okay,

937
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,280
then let's pick the date again.

938
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,720
Give me your husband's horoscope.

939
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,960
-You've been married for three years?
-Yes.

940
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:29,920
Let's see.

941
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,120
They said it was possible at the hospital,
but it's strangely not happening.

942
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,240
I've even fed her all the herbal
medicines.

943
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:40,440
Oh dear, this is... Too cold.

944
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,800
It's cold? Turn off the air conditioner.

945
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,200
Not me! Her husband.

946
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,600
He's an island that sits alone further
than 2.5 km away from the land.

947
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:53,080
His home is atop a high mountain,
so no one would ever see him.

948
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,840
On a gloomy day, it rains and all the
flower petals fall.

949
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,320
Ah, it's a mystery.

950
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,360
What is?

951
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,280
No matter how much I look at it, he should
be alone forever. How's he married?

952
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,920
He's tender but has no luck with
parents, wife, or children.

953
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,280
His life is so lonely and tiring.

954
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:16,240
Where and how did you meet such an
acquisition?

955
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,960
So are you saying she'll get
pregnant or not?

956
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,640
Why are you so skinny? Eat plenty of rice!

957
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,600
Stay alert and endure by eating rice.

958
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,640
Why are you bringing up rice suddenly?

959
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,720
I'm hungry. Let's eat.
How about fish stew?

960
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:59,840
Yes, we'll be in after we deal with this
public grievance.

961
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,680
Oh, that dog. You didn't get bit, right?

962
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,040
Yes, I'm fine.

963
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:08,640
If you get hurt, Chef Kang will kill me.

964
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,440
He just loves his brother-in-law.

965
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:13,080
JUNK SHOP

966
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,000
I'm out of breath because of those dogs.
Let's go.

967
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,360
RESOURCE

968
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,000
It's locked?

969
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,280
You think I didn't expect this?

970
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:44,360
I came prepared for this.

971
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,280
Oh, I'm sweating.

972
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,880
I need to get into the tiger's den.

973
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:51,120
I need to get inside in order to get
eat or be eaten.

974
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,320
Something has to happen.

975
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,560
Why isn't this opening?

976
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,240
In the movies, this opens so easily.

977
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,880
-A bobby pin would work better.
-I don't have one right now...

978
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,040
Ow... Wait!

979
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,680
Wait, that's not it...

980
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,520
-My arm, my arm.
-Get down.

981
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,520
Hey, seriously now!

982
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,840
You're really being too much!

983
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,080
I heard guys can do it even if they
don't like the girl.

984
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,640
Why are you playing hard-to-get?

985
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,200
I told you. I have an issue and that's
why I'm asking you.

986
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,160
Okay, then tell me.
What exactly is this issue?

987
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:35,640
Okay, for real...
It's not the time to tell you.

988
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:40,160
When the time comes,
I'll tell you for sure. Promise.

989
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,520
Promise, yeah right.

990
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,760
You're just unable to make up a story
on the spot, right?

991
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,960
-No, that's not it.
-I'm warning you...

992
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,160
If you keep this up,
you won't be able to work here.

993
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,320
I don't like scandals where I work.
I'm going.

994
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,960
Is this because of PD Lee?
It is, isn't it?

995
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,480
Then, I'll keep it a secret.

996
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,120
I even got a cold because of you.

997
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,720
-Look, it's real. Feel it.
-Forget it.

998
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:04,160
Just try coming into my room once more.
Try it, I'll kick you out.

999
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,440
Just feel it. I'm not kidding...

1000
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:08,960
Ow... I'm dying. I'm in pain.

1001
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:13,400
I really am sick. Oh, I'm hot. So hot.

1002
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,680
How could he be so cold?

1003
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,040
I need the freezer.

1004
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,520
(Sun-woo, how are you feeling?
Call me if you're better.)

1005
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,640
What is this? What's going on?

1006
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,840
Why isn't this coming out?

1007
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,920
Wow, I'm getting so feverish.

1008
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,160
How long has it been since I've felt
a fever?

1009
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,880
This is so tiring.

1010
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:10,400
This won't do.

1011
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,480
Oh, my head.

1012
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,840
Gosh.

1013
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,920
Did this get crooked? What's wrong?

1014
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,560
Darn it.

1015
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,680
SO-HYUNG

1016
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,600
Why do I feel so bothered?

1017
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,680
Is she really sick?

1018
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,400
What's going on?

1019
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,200
Did I get out?

1020
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,760
Oh my... I'm really out.

1021
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,560
Ah... Look at what timing.

1022
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,840
Hey, Na Bong-sun.

1023
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,080
Hey,

1024
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,160
are you really... Hey!

1025
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,120
Hey, hey... Bong-sun!

1026
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,800
Hey, hey. Wake up! Are you really sick?

1027
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,200
Hey! Wake up!

1028
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,640
Hey, Na Bong...

1029
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:08,880
Na Bong-sun!

1030
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:11,880
Hey, hey, hey... Na Bong-sun!

1031
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:14,720
Wake up! Hey, Na Bong!

1032
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:16,600
Hey!

1033
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,760
OH MY GHOST

1034
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,480
(I don't look like myself.)

1035
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:47,120
(I don't remember anything,
but people say I did things.)

1036
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,400
She had nowhere to go. Where is she?

1037
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,120
I took her to the hospital, paid the bill.
How good was I to her?

1038
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,000
(What good is it if a man of vitality is
in front of me? I can't touch him.)

1039
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,720
In order to protect the citizen,
I escorted her and then brought her back.

1040
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,200
(She may have talked more unlike her
usual self or have sexual curiosity.)

1041
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,680
That's right. Sexual curiosity.

1042
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,960
Na Bong-sun!

1043
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,960
Don't show up in front of me, okay?

1044
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,720
(Please leave me alone!)
