1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,360
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,000
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,040
You're dead if you abandon me.

4
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm sorry.

5
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,360
Wait.

6
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,520
Gosh...

7
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,400
What should I do?

8
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,520
It's so hot.

9
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:49,200
What do I do? I'm going crazy.

10
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,760
Why today?

11
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Gosh...

12
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,720
-What is it? What?
-Huh?

13
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,960
Didn't you come out on purpose?
To talk to me?

14
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,720
No, no. Suddenly... Heat...

15
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,960
Well, actually...

16
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,880
I did come out on purpose to talk to you.

17
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,240
It's pretty cool out now that it's night.

18
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
Should we go on the swings?

19
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,880
Yeah.

20
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,440
Nothing else happened?

21
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,760
Huh? No, not yet.

22
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,960
I'm okay with it...

23
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,480
Since it seems like Chef
and I have become closer.

24
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,360
Anyway, what about you?

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,920
Didn't you say you don't have
much time left?

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
You are worried about me now?

27
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,040
What? Oh, I know, right?
It's not my place to be concerned.

28
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
Before...

29
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I just feared and hated seeing ghosts.

30
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,320
I guess I changed a lot too.

31
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
Honestly,

32
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,200
talking candidly like this to someone...

33
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,760
It's very rare for me.

34
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,120
I was afraid of others knowing
what I was going through.

35
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
So, I would hide by myself...

36
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
And shrink back. That's how I lived.

37
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,800
Like a dummy.

38
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,480
You're no longer alone.

39
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,360
Even when I'm gone,
Chef will be next to you.

40
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,040
I'm not sure.

41
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,960
Even if things turn out as we thought...

42
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,400
Will Chef continue to be next to me?

43
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,920
Right now I'm feeling happy.

44
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,760
But, at the same time I feel uneasy.

45
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,440
(Na Bong-sun, I'm sorry.)

46
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,320
Still, I like the present much better
than the past.

47
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,800
It feels like I'm getting along
with the people around me.

48
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,320
And I don't see other ghosts.

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,160
(Just a little longer.)

50
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,280
(Even if it's just for a few days...
I'll stay next to Chef and then leave.)

51
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
(Sorry for lying to you.)

52
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,240
This is nice.

53
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
Going on the swings. It's been a while...

54
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:40,240
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 11

55
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,960
This is embarrassing. Seriously.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,960
Gosh, this really is humiliating.

57
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,520
Who was the one that was so desperate
to get laid?

58
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,280
Was I too abrupt?

59
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Was she caught off guard?

60
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,560
Na Bong-sun!

61
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,920
Oh, Che... Chef.

62
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,560
-Yes.
-You...

63
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,320
I mean... Before... You can talk freely.

64
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,800
-I'm just curious...
-I was about to throw up.

65
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,120
What?

66
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
What... Throw up?

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
What I did... Made you want to throw up?

68
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,920
Oh, no, no, no. That's not what I meant.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,040
I think I may have eaten too fast.
I felt a bit of indigestion.

70
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
I suddenly had an upset stomach so...

71
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,880
Oh, so that was it?

72
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,120
Of course!
If that's not it, what else could it be?

73
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,920
I wouldn't have refused otherwise.

74
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,840
Gosh, I was really shocked.

75
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,080
I had millions of thoughts running
through my head.

76
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,960
'Did I do something wrong? Do I smell?'

77
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
'Did her illness come back?'

78
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,640
No, not at all. None of that is true.

79
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,280
It's because I had an upset stomach.

80
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,120
Then, it's all good.

81
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,080
Let's go back up.

82
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,960
-Let's go up.
-Yeah.

83
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,120
We should sleep now. It's late.

84
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,600
Goodness, that was a shock.

85
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,320
Let's go on a proper trip next time.

86
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,680
This will have to do for today.

87
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,240
Yes, let's do that, Chef.

88
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,720
Are you sure you're okay?

89
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Actually, you don't look so bad though.

90
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,360
No, no. Aw.

91
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,320
I'm still feeling sickly.

92
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,080
But, it's gotten much better.
After getting some air.

93
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,840
I feel bad for some reason.

94
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,960
Since you got sick after eating my food.

95
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,400
No, no. It's not because of your food.

96
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
It's because I gulped it down.

97
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,440
Your food was really tasty. Really.

98
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,360
-Perfect.
-Well that's a given.

99
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,400
Let's finish cleaning this up and
go inside to sleep.

100
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
Yes, Chef.

101
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,960
That was awkward.

102
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
Why did the timing have to be so...

103
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,480
Well.

104
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,160
Today isn't the only day.

105
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,320
I'm really going to take her by surprise.

106
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Really.
Na Bong-sun, you're in big trouble.

107
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,720
Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.
Seven. Eight. Nine.

108
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,840
I know, Chef. I know this is greedy of me.

109
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,520
(Fourteen. Fifteen.)

110
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,919
-But,
(-Sixteen. Seventeen. Eighteen.)

111
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,120
I will stay with you just for
a short while.

112
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,240
-For a very short while.
(-No more. Enough.)

113
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,280
You're here, Son-in-law!

114
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,360
-You're home?
-You're still awake, Mother.

115
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,640
I can't sleep when you aren't home yet.
That would be mean.

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,080
You must have a lot of work these days?

117
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,600
Yes, we didn't get enough new hires,
so there's a lot of work.

118
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,960
That's why your eyes look blurry,
and you look really tired.

119
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,320
Do you want a glass of wine?
It's good for sleep.

120
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,720
I'm sorry, Mother-in-law.
I'll be your drinking buddy next time.

121
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,400
You should go wash up now.
You have work early tomorrow, right?

122
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,760
Yeah.

123
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
-Good night.
-Okay.

124
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,880
Good night to you too.

125
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,680
When he smiles like that he seems
like a kid. He looks so innocent.

126
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:42,240
But, it's also not good to be
too mild-mannered.

127
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,800
It's a big problem. He's too nice.

128
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,560
Why is that a problem?
I married him because I liked that.

129
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,960
That's a good thing.
We have different taste in men.

130
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,520
I find bad boys attractive.

131
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm not surprised.

132
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
Who, exactly, are you, Na Bong-sun?

133
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,480
Oh, oh, hurry, hurry.

134
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,120
Sous Chef is hungry to death.
Hurry. Hurry.

135
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,920
Just wait please.

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,320
Although it's just for us,
it's a historic day

137
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,160
since it's Bong's first time
holding a pan.

138
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,680
If you keep whining,
it'll become dog food.

139
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:10,200
How can this become dog food?
It looks really good.

140
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,320
Bong Bong, I think it'll be tasty.

141
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,720
It's all done.

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,720
-Get me a bowl please.
-Okay.

143
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,880
What's the big deal...

144
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:22,680
-Let's see here.
-It's all ready.

145
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,160
I'll plate it for you, Sous Chef. Hold on.

146
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,800
Bong Bong! You have a sense!

147
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,760
-It's really good.
-Really?

148
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,560
How good could it be if an
assistant cook made it?

149
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,080
-It's hot. Be careful.
-Hot, hot, hot.

150
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,640
Considering how long you've been
working as an assistant cook

151
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,800
this is the least you should be able
to do. It's edible.

152
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,440
It's very good. Seasoned perfectly too.

153
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,880
You're pretty good, Na Bong-sun.

154
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,920
-What, what, what?
-Oh, Chef.

155
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,160
There was some leftover meat so Bong Bong

156
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,760
made some bulgogi pasta.
Try some. It's so good.

157
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,920
Oh yeah?

158
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
It is good.

159
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,800
And the noodles are cooked al dente.

160
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,600
I have to be out today because
I'm doing an interview with some magazine.

161
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,160
Min-soo, you're in charge of dinner.

162
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,680
I'm sorry.
I try not to be away for things like this.

163
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,720
But, I know the editor there so...

164
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,080
Yes, then don't worry about it.
I'll take care of everything.

165
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,520
During the interview,
if you can talk about me a little bit...

166
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,160
It'd be our family's honor.

167
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
No, no. I really don't want to.

168
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,400
-Na Bong-sun.
-Yes.

169
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,240
-You come with me.
-Me?

170
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,920
They want the assistant from the chef
versus chef program.

171
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,360
-Thanks, everyone.
-Yes, Chef.

172
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
-I'll be back, everyone.
-Bye, Bong.

173
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,640
Hey, come on!

174
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,760
Give that back!

175
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,400
Chef, what do I have to do there?

176
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,680
-It was a lie.
-What?

177
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:09,240
It would be too boring to go by myself.
You can be my make-up assistant.

178
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,040
Gosh, you totally fooled me.

179
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,800
I was really scared because
I thought I had to do an interview.

180
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,080
Why would they interview you?
You're still a long way off from that.

181
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,240
But, that pasta you just made was
pretty decent.

182
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
You've improved a lot. I admit it.

183
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
I was so surprised because it tasted
so good.

184
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,720
Starting tomorrow, why don't you put your
skills to work in real life?

185
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,720
Starting with the appetizers.
I'll give you a chance.

186
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,960
Appetizers? I'm totally in.
That should be easy for me.

187
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,560
Hey, hey, hey. Don't joke around now.

188
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,360
Nothing is easy with food.

189
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,360
Even when you're cutting a piece of bread

190
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,160
it can taste different depending
on how you cut it.

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,840
Of course, of course.
Humility again and again.

192
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,880
Hey, don't you have anything else to wear?

193
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,600
You should wear something else when
we're heading out. This is your uniform.

194
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,760
What are we doing here?
Are you going to buy me clothes?

195
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,760
Well, we're not here to window shop.
You're too embarrassing to take anywhere.

196
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, I'm happy. I'm so happy.

197
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,600
Tada.

198
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,600
-This is a no?
-Yeah.

199
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,920
Isn't this to die for?

200
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,520
How is this?

201
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Okay.

202
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,800
Tada.

203
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,040
You like this?

204
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,320
Are you happy?

205
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,920
Yes! So very much!

206
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,840
-Wear them well.
-I will.

207
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,840
-Hurry up.
-Gosh.

208
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,000
Wow, there are so many styles.

209
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

210
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,920
Oh my goodness. There's so much here!

211
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,120
Give me all these sale items here.
What size would you like?

212
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,880
Size... Size?

213
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,760
-Hey, where are you?
-Yes?

214
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,400
Oh, that person there. What's your size?

215
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,680
It looked pretty good on the mannequin.

216
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,200
This is not long or short.
I'm not too sure about it.

217
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,040
So why buy things without even
trying it on?

218
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,160
Forget that. We have no time.
Trying things on?

219
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,200
I hate shopping like that.

220
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,360
Besides, it's much better than
your Sun Restaurant t-shirt.

221
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,920
-Let's go, Bong.
-Okay.

222
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,320
Okay.

223
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,440
That looks good. Yes.

224
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,480
Chef's so handsome.

225
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
-Can you touch up your make-up?
-Okay.

226
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,600
-You look very handsome.
-You look pretty.

227
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,520
Should we try a different pose?

228
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,040
Gosh...

229
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,800
Yes.

230
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,960
Okay, this is the last question.

231
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,520
You're a popular star chef with many
female fans.

232
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,360
What is your ideal type of woman,
Chef Kang Sun-woo?

233
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,120
Oh, my ideal type?

234
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,400
Let's see...

235
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
First, I'd like someone that I can
cook with.

236
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,840
And...

237
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,520
Someone who knows how to respect elders.

238
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,160
Also,

239
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,480
someone who's small and cute.

240
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,400
Someone who looks like a little puppy.

241
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,440
It'd be good if they can be a
bit provocative.

242
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,880
As the popular saying goes...
Lose at day, win at night.

243
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,359
That kind of style.

244
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,560
I like eyes that are half-moon shaped.

245
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,119
So, would that be someone like your
assistant that came with you?

246
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,440
I don't know...

247
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,400
Aren't her eyes more weaselly?

248
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,200
Yes... She's more the sexy type.

249
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,880
There is something strange there.

250
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,480
What! You got rejected?

251
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,600
Yes, pretty much.

252
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,480
Sun-woo says I'm nothing more than
a friend.

253
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,520
Oh my, he must be crazy.

254
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,080
What could he find wrong in you?

255
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,760
If I were him, I'd find it harder to see
you as just a friend.

256
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,840
Does he have some sort of issue
or something?

257
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,440
Right? He has really bad taste in women.

258
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,440
So, there's no chance of that changing?

259
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,080
Never.

260
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,160
Professor,

261
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,880
I'm grateful that you see me
in such a favorable way.

262
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,680
But, I don't want things to get any more
awkward between Sun-woo and me.

263
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,040
I just want to remain a good and
comfortable friend.

264
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,400
Where is he going to meet another
woman as cool as you? Huh?

265
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,400
Did Sun-woo mention anything else to you?

266
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,960
Like another woman...

267
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,320
Pardon?

268
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,360
It's nothing. I'm just saying nonsense.

269
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,280
Chef, you really aren't good at
keeping secrets.

270
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,120
What if the journalist noticed?
How can you bring up half-moon eyes?

271
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,160
It's so obvious that my eyes
are half-moon shaped.

272
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,640
It's up to me.
She can notice if she wants to.

273
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,200
Okay. I'm sure it'll be fine.

274
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,800
-Go on in.
-Okay.

275
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Thanks for being my make-up assistant
today.

276
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,160
Yeah. You worked hard too, Chef.
Thank you for the new outfit.

277
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,400
-Go on in.
-Okay.

278
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,120
Ah, I can't go in unless you let
go of my hand.

279
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,080
Oh... This hand. I was holding it.

280
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,200
I have to let it go in order
for you to go in, right?

281
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,520
Oh, I'll let go. Go in.

282
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,040
-Gosh, good night Chef.
-Yeah, you too.

283
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,200
Sleep well.

284
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,320
-That dress looks pretty.
-Oh, that's cold!

285
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,800
What is it? What's wrong?

286
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,480
-What? What is it?
-Is this from the rain?

287
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,680
-The rain must've leaked through.
-What the heck!

288
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,840
The floor is totally flooded.

289
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,200
Gosh...

290
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,680
The blanket is all wet too.

291
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,320
What do I do? What should I do?

292
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,640
I'll have to call someone to fix it.
I should've had it fixed earlier.

293
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,120
It's completely wet.

294
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,160
Gosh.

295
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,920
There's no other choice.
You'll have to sleep in my room tonight.

296
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What? Your room, Chef?

297
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,960
What will you do then?
Swim here and sleep?

298
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,360
Do you have any clothes to wear?

299
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,960
What?

300
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,960
Oh, that's the best one.

301
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,920
Kind of looks like a big bag on you.
But, it's not so bad.

302
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,520
Think of it as your pajamas.

303
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,960
Chef... Maybe I should just sleep
in the hall downstairs.

304
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,480
-I think I might snore.
-It's okay.

305
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,080
How can I sleep knowing you're
on that hard chair?

306
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,280
-No, I...
-You can sleep here.

307
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,240
-Gosh...
-I'll just sleep on the floor...

308
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,240
If you're expecting anything tonight,
dream on. I'm really tired today.

309
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,800
Who says I'm expecting anything
from you, Chef?

310
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,480
(The mood in here is getting strange.)

311
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,280
(Why are we suddenly sharing a room?)

312
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,080
(I can't ascend yet.)

313
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,480
(I want to stay with Chef longer.)

314
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,480
-Should we go to bed now?
-I'd say so.

315
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,320
-We do have work tomorrow.
-Yes.

316
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,240
Should we... Turn this off?

317
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,520
Turn this thing off...

318
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,320
I better wash up.

319
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
Sleep... let's sleep.

320
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,680
Aren't you going to wash up?

321
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,600
Yes, Chef. I don't usually wash up.
Good night.

322
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,400
Okay, good night.

323
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,120
Are you... Are you all right?
Hold on a moment! Oh, dear.

324
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,960
Are you okay? Oh my!

325
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,640
I think I'm okay.

326
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,720
I'm sorry, Chef. It was dark.

327
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,640
And something suddenly came at me and
I was so startled.

328
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm so sorry. What can I do?

329
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,560
What's up with you?

330
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,480
Ah, really?

331
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,000
Before, you were all over me so much
to an absurd degree.

332
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,120
Yes, I'm sure you find this absurd.

333
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,520
I totally understand how you feel a
hundred, no a thousand times.

334
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,960
I've changed my mind.

335
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,400
Remember what you said before?
That you want to take things slowly.

336
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,080
I thought about it and you were a hundred
times correct.

337
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,200
It's not right to skip steps when it comes
to people's relationships, right?

338
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,720
There's a process... You said.

339
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,760
Yeah, that's what I said that day.

340
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,800
Yes...

341
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,000
I said that before. That's what I meant.

342
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,960
-Yes.
-You just got it now?

343
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,200
It's just that the situation turned out
this way.

344
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,560
I thought you might have some expectations
and I wanted to meet them.

345
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm not in a rush at all.

346
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm sorry for getting so startled.

347
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,200
-So, that's what it was about?
-Yes.

348
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,280
Gosh, you really grew up Na Bong-sun.

349
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,600
Goodness, that's what it was.

350
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,800
Okay, go to bed.

351
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,800
I was wondering what it was.

352
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,960
-Thank you, Chef.
-Go to bed then.

353
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,440
-Yes, good night.
-Okay.

354
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
She was acting as if she'd kill me if
we didn't do it right then and there.

355
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,040
Now, she wants to take things slow?

356
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,680
Is she playing me or what?

357
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,360
Is this a push-pull thing? Huh?

358
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Gosh, I'm getting more annoyed the
more I think about it.

359
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,200
Oh, hi.

360
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,760
Hello, good looking young man.

361
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,440
What was your name again?

362
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,760
-Jin?
-No, it's Jun.

363
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,720
That's right, Jun.

364
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,040
Your face is the type that young people
these days would like.

365
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,840
-Like a Cocker Spaniel.
-Excuse me?

366
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:53,040
I'm not saying that you look like a dog.

367
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,120
I'm saying that it's a shame,
if only I were a few years younger.

368
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,160
Mom, what are you doing here at this hour?

369
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,320
Oh, I was in the neighborhood.
Is Bong-sook here right now?

370
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,200
Mom, I told you it's not Bong-sook.
Her name is Bong-sun.

371
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,520
Whatever the case...

372
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,920
Hello there.

373
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,960
It's been a while.

374
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,360
If you have some time,
can we talk for a moment?

375
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,840
Pardon? Me?

376
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,920
Oh, what can I help you with?

377
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,120
-Here?
-Oh?

378
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,120
What is this, Mother?

379
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,480
Mother? What do you mean, Mother?

380
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,320
That's a bit strange for me to hear.

381
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,200
-Just accept it.
-Excuse me?

382
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,960
I put a lot of effort into it,
so you won't be dissatisfied.

383
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,000
Chef's Mother, I think you must be
mistaken about something.

384
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,960
I'm not that kind of person.
I can't accept this.

385
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,640
-Just open it first.
-What?

386
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,760
Well, if you insist.

387
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,480
You really shouldn't have.

388
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,080
Oh my, what is this?

389
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,880
He's an assistant professor in my
department and he's 32 years old.

390
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,400
He's a great catch, good personality,
and smart.

391
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,960
Both of his parents have passed away.

392
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,640
If there's any small fault,
it'd be that he has four sisters.

393
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,280
But, what's the big deal?
It's not like they are parents.

394
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,240
What do you think?
Do you want to meet him?

395
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,880
-Me?
-Yes.

396
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,800
He's really smart and decent.
I can guarantee that.

397
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,840
Yes, but...

398
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,840
Four sisters-in-law are better than a
mother-in-law like me.

399
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,960
I'm young and I've taken a lot of
herbal medication.

400
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,360
So, I won't be dying too easily.
I'm really quite immature, as well.

401
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,120
Can you handle an immature mother-in-law
who will live a long time?

402
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
-What... Uh...
-Mom, what are you doing?

403
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:50,960
-Chef!
-Sun-woo.

404
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,080
This is, well...

405
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,600
Oh my.

406
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,400
-No...
-Just go inside.

407
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,960
-Goodbye.
-Come here, Mom.

408
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,120
Bong-sook, Bong-sook.
Contact me if you're interested.

409
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
-I'll set it up right away.
-Hurry up.

410
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,600
Hey, that hurts! It hurts!

411
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:12,440
Why are you doing these useless things?
Don't come if you're going to do this.

412
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,960
Listen to you talk.

413
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,160
Why do you think I'm doing this?

414
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,840
Bong-sook's horoscope is
of a dead person's.

415
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,600
She's going to have a short life, okay?

416
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,760
It's Sun okay?
Not Bong-sook, but Bong-sun.

417
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,040
-Sook or Sun doesn't matter.
-I'll take care of it.

418
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,160
-Goodbye, Professor.
-Gosh...

419
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,720
-Gosh, seriously.
-Gosh.

420
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,400
Wow, that rude jerk.

421
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,040
Do I have to find a younger guy for her?

422
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,880
Where do I find someone better than
my son?

423
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,880
-Coming through.
-Hello. I'm the chef.

424
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,920
What are you doing!

425
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Dong-chul, I'll do that.

426
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,800
Take care of the potatoes for tonight's
dinner side dish.

427
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,400
-Yes, Chef.
-Gosh...

428
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,640
Ji-woong better eat it. Yum.

429
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,440
Is it tasty, Ji-woong?

430
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,120
Chef, the garlic! It's burning!

431
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,840
Are you okay?

432
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,880
Yeah, I'm fine.

433
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,480
I'm sorry. I didn't see you there.

434
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,840
You didn't even turn the oven off here.

435
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,200
Oh my! You're burned?

436
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,640
No.

437
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,360
You are! Let me take a look.

438
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,200
Oh dear, you do have a burn.

439
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,480
It's from that bump with the Chef, right?

440
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,400
What should we do?

441
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,720
I'm fine.
It'll be okay once I cool it down.

442
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,080
Looks like it'll sting to me.

443
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,040
You should've said something before,
so that you could go to the hospital.

444
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,160
It doesn't matter. It's no big deal.

445
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,960
It's okay.

446
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,880
Here, give it to me.

447
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
Gosh...

448
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,360
That looks like it hurts.

449
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,120
-Dong-chul, skim the foam off the top.
-Yes, Chef.

450
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,640
What?

451
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,760
-Put in more salt.
-Yes, Chef.

452
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
Yes, of course, it hurts.

453
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,720
Do you just endure things well or
are you just foolish?

454
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,800
I'm neither.

455
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,600
I'm smart.

456
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,200
Okay.

457
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:44,320
Make sure you go to the hospital tomorrow.
Don't suffer through the summer.

458
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,520
I'll take care of it.

459
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,200
Don't you dare tell the chef.
He'll feel very bad.

460
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,520
Gosh.

461
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,880
I think you must be a huge fan of Chef.

462
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,520
Why do you like Chef so much?

463
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
He has guts.

464
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,080
He's different from the other chefs that
just go abroad and study.

465
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,600
You don't know this, do you?

466
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,520
Chef backpacked around the world.

467
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,120
And gained real-life experience by even
eating food from out of the garbage.

468
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,640
Chef even paid tuition and didn't attend.

469
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,400
Isn't that pretty cool?

470
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,120
Is it? Is that cool?

471
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,320
Of course.

472
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,800
By the way, is your friend doing well
with her boyfriend?

473
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,480
Friend? Who?

474
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,640
That friend you told me about at the
chicken place.

475
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,240
Oh! Yeah, pretty well.

476
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,440
But, now she's having issues because
the guy wants to do it more.

477
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,440
Yeah? That's amusing.

478
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,960
Wait, wait. I'll put some more on this
side here.

479
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,520
-Gosh...
-You'll get a scar if you don't.

480
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,040
You can stop now.

481
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,680
-Just this spot here.
-You used half the tube.

482
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,280
Gosh, just this little spot here.

483
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,720
-Does it sting?
-Ow, yeah.

484
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,560
Do it gently, gently.

485
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,600
I didn't expect someone who looked
like you to whine so much.

486
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,160
(I'm going easy on you!)

487
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,960
(Hey! Ow... That's enough. Stop.)

488
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,360
(Wait, just this part here.)

489
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,480
What are you two doing?

490
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,720
I had something to talk about
with Na Bong.

491
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,720
-Talk about what?
-Just some personal issues.

492
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,560
-Personal issues?
-Yes.

493
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,480
-I'll head out first then.
-Okay.

494
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,280
Wait.

495
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,000
Since when were you so close to him
that you discuss personal issues?

496
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,240
Maybe it was last week or last, last week?

497
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,880
-Yeah, I'll head out first.
-Hey, I'm not done talking...

498
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,280
Man, I'm so flabbergasted!

499
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,520
With me, she drew such a clear line yet...

500
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,480
What is she doing, seriously?

501
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,680
Who discusses personal issues by saying,
'Uh' like that?

502
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,080
'Uh'! Like that?

503
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,600
Hey, you guys.
Get a Popsicle from the freezer.

504
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,560
It's been so hot all day.
You have to eat one of these.

505
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,200
I can't deal with this heat.

506
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,720
Popsicle! Gosh, move really!

507
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,080
-Looks good!
-There's only one in here.

508
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,720
-What?
-What are you saying?

509
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:13,080
I bought exactly the right amount.

510
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,400
What is this?

511
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Sous Chef, that's your second one right?

512
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,160
I don't remember.

513
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,840
It is your second. You were eating
watermelon before!

514
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,800
What! What!

515
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:31,640
A sous chef should be allowed to eat two.
It's not like I had three or four.

516
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,640
Why are you rubbing that all over me?

517
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,560
-I'm fine. You eat it.
-No, it's okay. I'm fine.

518
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,800
I'm really fine.
I don't really like cold things.

519
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,800
-Hey, look at these two.
-It's so yummy.

520
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,320
What's up here?

521
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,240
What's this romantic mood between
the two of you?

522
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,560
Seo Jun, did you change your concept to
a romantic or what?

523
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,400
Were you always like that or
is it only to our Bong-sun?

524
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,800
Now that you mention it,
Jun and Bong make a good match.

525
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,840
-Gosh.
-Do we really?

526
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,240
Are you all here to play?

527
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,440
Are you here to play?

528
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,639
Aren't you going to clean the grease
off the counter here?

529
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,239
Did you do an inventory of the
live seafood?

530
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,400
You all have to receive a scolding
in order to do your work? Get moving.

531
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,080
Yes, Chef.

532
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
You don't even get me ice cream...

533
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,320
-No one gave him ice cream?
-I guess not.

534
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,760
Table three, one escargot, two specials.

535
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,719
Table seven, one mixed salad, two Shreks.

536
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,080
Table nine, one steak,
two seafood noodle soups.

537
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,639
Okay, got it.

538
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,880
Dong-chul, you take the salads and
help Min-soo.

539
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,159
I'll take the escargots.
Ji-woong, noodles after you serve.

540
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,320
Yes, Chef

541
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,400
Jun, is this all the oil we have?

542
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,520
Yes, I'll get some more.

543
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:55,159
No, I'll get it. Do what you were doing.

544
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,560
Chef.

545
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
What?

546
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
Come on.
Why don't you look at me and talk? Hm?

547
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,240
-Are you mad at me about something?
-No.

548
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:22,560
It doesn't look like a 'no'.

549
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,000
Why? Huh?

550
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,560
Is it maybe because of yesterday...
That thing?

551
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,920
Yes, I'm mad. Why?

552
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,920
I am angry.

553
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,120
What's with you?

554
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,400
Since we're talking about this,
what is wrong with you?

555
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,640
-Are you playing hard to get?
-No.

556
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,880
Am I a fish that you're done reeling in?

557
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
Seriously.

558
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,560
You tell me you want to take things slow

559
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,320
but you're having a grand ol' time
with Jun.

560
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
-What?
-You want to start two-timing?

561
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,360
Jun's not a bad catch.

562
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,480
He's good-looking and competent.

563
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,000
Chef, you're not jealous now, are you?

564
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,440
As if I'm jealous.

565
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,280
Hey, I'm Kang Sun-woo.

566
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,480
You're Na Bong-sun, and I'm Kang Sun-woo.
Kang Sun-woo.

567
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,480
I've been too nice.
You think you can act however, huh?

568
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,040
Chef, I think you seriously misunderstood
the situation.

569
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,520
What misunderstanding? Tell me.

570
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,800
Well, but then...
I can't say because I made a promise.

571
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,760
A promise? Now you're blatantly...

572
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,120
Forget it. I'm getting annoyed.

573
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,240
I don't have time to argue,
even this is a waste.

574
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,440
Just end it if it's going to be like this.

575
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,360
Why are you acting this way over nothing?

576
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,360
-Get to work, Na Bong-sun, Assistant Cook.
-Wait, wait.

577
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,120
Chef, chef, chef. Oh my. Chef.

578
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,520
What is this? Really?

579
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,040
This is a new one. What's next?

580
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,000
I mean what's with the jealousy? Huh?

581
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,880
I can't exactly say anything since
I promised Jun.

582
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm really at a loss here.

583
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,440
Wow, she just walked away.

584
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,840
Just walked away.

585
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,320
Sous Chef, have a glass of water
since it's so hot.

586
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
Huh? Okay.

587
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,720
Oh my!

588
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,880
Hey, hey! Who cleaned these clams?

589
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,080
-I did.
-Did you clean them with your feet?

590
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,240
-Huh?
-Don't you see the sand?

591
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,400
Where?

592
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,240
You don't see the sand between
the shells here?

593
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,880
No, I can't really see them.

594
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,840
-Isn't this good enough?
-Good enough?

595
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,480
Why do you get to make that call? Huh?

596
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,880
What if a guest loses a tooth while
eating this with the sand?

597
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,400
Will you pay for their implant?

598
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,720
Seriously...

599
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,640
Do you think I'm giving you a
hard time for no reason? Nope.

600
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,080
This is why you're an assistant.

601
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,680
The most important thing during the
summer is cleaning the ingredients.

602
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,640
What have you learned to this date?

603
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,080
Hey, we can't use these clams.
Switch our dinner special to shrimp pasta.

604
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,400
-Min-soo,
-Yes.

605
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,040
tell Na Bong to go buy 5 kg of shrimps.

606
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,120
Chef says that you should go buy
5 kg of shrimps at the market.

607
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,160
Yes, yes, I'm going. I heard it too.

608
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,880
She says, 'Yes, yes, I heard it too'.

609
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,960
They seem clean.

610
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,320
Gosh, if he's pissed,
he should just be pissed.

611
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,240
Why is he picking on me?

612
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,720
Anyway, regardless of their social status
or personality, men are just childish.

613
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,960
Although, there is some cuteness about it.

614
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,720
-Mister!
(-The person you are trying to reach...)

615
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,760
-Oh, yes, come in.
(-...to the voice mailbox.)

616
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,640
No, no. You can stay on the call.
I'm just dropping by for a bit.

617
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,440
No, it's okay.

618
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,880
It's not a call that can get connected.

619
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,720
Pardon?

620
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,120
My daughter who passed away.

621
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,520
I sometimes try calling her when
she comes to mind.

622
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,440
It probably sounds crazy to you.

623
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,680
But, I think one day she might just
come out of nowhere

624
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,880
and answer the call saying 'Dad, it's me.'

625
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:20,640
I guess you haven't canceled
your daughter's phone plan yet?

626
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,320
I just couldn't.

627
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,680
Although, the phone itself is missing.

628
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,600
Her phone is missing?

629
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,400
Was it, by chance, an accident?

630
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,360
No.

631
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,320
I wonder what was so difficult for her
to want to die.

632
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,400
She just...

633
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,360
She just left this world on her own.

634
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,200
You're saying it's suicide?

635
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,760
Oh dear, what's wrong with me?

636
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,360
I should get you some juice.

637
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,720
Oh, I'm just out of juice.

638
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,960
I'll go buy some now.
Just wait here a bit.

639
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,240
No Mister, that's okay.

640
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,360
I want to get some for myself too.

641
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,800
Sit here. I'll be right back.

642
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,360
Suicide...

643
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,160
Me?

644
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,520
Why in the world would I?

645
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,600
Dad, what should we do next Sunday?
It's your birthday.

646
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,600
It's just a birthday.

647
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,960
Is there anyone in the world without
a birthday?

648
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,880
Still, it's your 60th birthday.
You should do something special.

649
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,320
-Won't you feel disappointed?
-Oh, don't worry about it.

650
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,840
Don't think about wasting money on it.

651
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,280
I suppose going out to eat would
cost money.

652
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,400
And inviting your friends over for
a big feast would cost even more money.

653
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,920
Everything costs money.

654
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,920
I guess we'll just buy a cake and
blow out the candle.

655
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,520
I don't need that either, kid.

656
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,280
We'll just make seaweed soup in
the morning.

657
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,600
Yes, this is Starlight Tour Company right?

658
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,160
I'm calling to confirm the Guam vacation
package that I booked.

659
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,440
Yes, it's for three people. Shin Myung-ho,
Shin Soon-ae, and Shin Kyung-mo.

660
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,880
That's right.

661
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,280
I secretly booked a vacation to Guam
because it was his 60th birthday.

662
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,600
But, I committed suicide a week earlier?

663
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,040
-You're here, Na Bong-sun?
-I'll be heading out now, Mister.

664
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,000
Why? You should have some juice first.

665
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:48,000
Something urgent came up.
I'll drop by again, Mister.

666
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,880
Okay, see you.

667
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,720
What's with her?
Why is she leaving as soon as I show up?

668
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:59,560
Kyung-mo...
In my opinion, I don't think you're it.

669
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,080
Right? You don't think so either.

670
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,640
She was really into me before.

671
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,200
I'm sure it's because of that chef.

672
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,160
He intercepted.

673
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,560
Who? The owner of that restaurant?

674
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:17,320
-You think so?
-Can't you just tell by looking?

675
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,760
Didn't you see the way he looked at her
when he was here putting in that hose?

676
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:23,200
It's him, for sure.

677
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,840
I'm sure he won her over with money,
that horrible jerk.

678
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,600
Hello, this is Na Bong-sun.

679
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,720
Yes, where are you right now?

680
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
I had some questions to ask you.

681
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,440
-Here you go.
-Yes, thank you.

682
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,840
So...

683
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,280
Please speak.
What was it you wanted to say?

684
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,160
Yes, well...

685
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,800
Here.

686
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,920
What is this?

687
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,120
You know who Shin Soon-ae is, don't you?

688
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,120
Yes, she's from that small restaurant.

689
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:32,120
Yes, the daughter that passed away.
This is Shin Soon-ae's diary.

690
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,400
But why do you have this Bong-sun?

691
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,120
I knew her a long time ago.

692
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,240
We attended cooking classes together.

693
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,960
We were very close back then.

694
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,320
But, I hadn't heard about her suicide.

695
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,480
I didn't even know we were living in the
same neighborhood.

696
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,960
I recently found out that she was

697
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:56,280
that restaurant owner's daughter
and found this.

698
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,120
Can you take a look at this?

699
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,880
Over here.

700
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:04,400
These are tickets to Guam dated in
September.

701
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,880
And if you look in this diary,
it was her father's birthday in September.

702
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,320
How can a person preparing for a family
vacation commit suicide?

703
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,400
Doesn't that seem off?

704
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,120
Are you sure that it's suicide?

705
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,880
Is there any chance that it was
an accident or murder?

706
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:20,160
No.

707
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:26,800
From what I recall,
she texted her last words to her father.

708
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,920
The circumstances and the story
pointed to suicide.

709
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,520
It seemed certain that it was suicide.

710
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,240
I see.

711
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,440
Why would she have done it?

712
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,240
I don't think she had a reason to do it.

713
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:48,280
I'm not sure.

714
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,960
With depression, it's not always easy
for people to tell.

715
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,160
I'll look through the files again.

716
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,040
To see if there are any suspicious
circumstances.

717
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:07,240
Okay, thank you for doing me this favor.

718
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,920
-I'll hold onto this.
-Excuse me?

719
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,880
To see if there's anything I should
refer to.

720
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:15,440
Okay. Then, you do that.

721
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,000
You never know,
so can you look at this too?

722
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,200
Sure.

723
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:25,240
(When did you get this burn?
It looks pretty fresh.)

724
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,400
(Is this from bumping into the chef
earlier today?)

725
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,960
(-Oh, it is!
-That must've hurt a lot.)

726
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,680
(I'm fine. I put on ointment.)

727
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,560
(What do you mean? This is pretty bad.)

728
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:40,160
(Our chef is always going on about how the
kitchen is like a gunpowder storage room.)

729
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,200
(He's always going on about how we should
be careful of knives and fire.)

730
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,280
(Instead of giving us a bonus,
he gives us injuries?)

731
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,840
(Gosh...)

732
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,160
Hey, Jun.

733
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:51,880
Yes, Chef.

734
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:54,040
-Is your back okay?
-Pardon?

735
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,120
Is your back okay?

736
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,440
Yes, it's okay. It's not too bad.

737
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:00,560
Let me see.

738
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,640
Hey, it's pretty bad.

739
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,160
If you got hurt, you should say so.
Shouldn't you go to the hospital?

740
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,840
No, I'll be fine with ointment.

741
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,400
Anyway, I'm sorry.

742
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,000
Do you have something else to say?

743
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,840
You know in the storage room before...

744
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,760
When you were with Bong-sun earlier,
was she putting ointment on it for you?

745
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,400
Ah, that's right.

746
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,960
I told her not to tell you because I
didn't want you to worry.

747
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:40,960
Well, then...

748
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,160
What's he smiling about?

749
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,880
Gosh, why was I so petty?

750
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,480
Chef, here's the shrimp.

751
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,320
Why are you so late?
Did you make the shrimp or something?

752
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:03,960
Yes, some.

753
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,600
She's pissed off. She's really pissed off.

754
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,720
Why was I so rash?

755
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,840
How do I resolve this? I'm going nuts.

756
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,800
I just don't understand this.

757
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,560
Why would I?

758
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:33,080
Nevermind...

759
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,560
-Na Bong-sun, I have to go somewhere.
-Where?

760
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,280
I need to find out something.

761
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,560
I washed the plates and
put them away. I'll be back.

762
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:45,640
Wait!

763
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,440
Organize the storage room when
you have the time!

764
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,640
Yes, Chef.

765
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,560
It's so dirty.

766
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,200
Dong-chul, do the vegetables
ahead of time.

767
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,200
Yes, Chef.

768
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,520
-Peel the shrimps well.
-Yes, Chef.

769
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,240
We're going to make some bread.

770
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,640
Check on the dough once more and
get some rosemary.

771
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,800
-Yes, Chef.
-Hey, Min-soo...

772
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:14,000
When you have time,
you should tell the kids to do it.

773
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:16,280
And clean up the fridge. It's a huge mess.

774
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,880
Would you leave it like that
if this was your home?

775
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,040
No, Chef.

776
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,800
(Are you sure that it's suicide?)

777
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,440
(Is there any chance that it was
an accident or murder?)

778
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,600
Let's see, let's see.

779
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,040
The husband is suspicious.

780
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,960
Does he have another wife somewhere,
maybe a third.

781
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,560
Do you see something?

782
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,800
I'm right, aren't I? He has another woman.

783
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,200
Oh my, that was out of nowhere.

784
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:57,080
She hasn't left, this wench.

785
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,520
What is it? Who's this wench?

786
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,840
My goodness!

787
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:02,160
What happened to you?

788
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:05,120
-What are you doing here?
-Us... Us?

789
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,840
I'm not talking to you, ladies.

790
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,080
I need to speak to you.
I have something to ask.

791
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,400
Ask me later.

792
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,640
I haven't had customers in ages.

793
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,720
It's urgent.

794
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:19,400
Excuse me. We'll just come back
another time.

795
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,440
-I've received your fortune. Ladies!
-Please sit.

796
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,960
You have great timing, don't you?

797
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:30,640
Why are you still here, anyway?
What happened to the overnight trip?

798
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,960
That's not what's important right now.

799
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,560
Apparently, I took my own life.

800
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,120
What? You really did?

801
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,840
But no matter how much I think about it,
there's no way I'd do that.

802
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,240
Sis, do people who commit suicide
exist in this other realm?

803
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,800
I don't think I've ever seen that.

804
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:50,080
They do exist.
There just aren't many of them.

805
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,160
Even if they take their own lives

806
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,640
they may have a deep grudge
or unfinished business.

807
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,960
Do you still not remember your own death?

808
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,600
No.

809
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,600
But, it's really strange.

810
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,000
Why would I? Why would I do such a thing?

811
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,200
I'm sure you had your reasons.

812
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,120
Why don't you just think about
ascending to heaven already?

813
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:15,400
If you keep hanging around here and
the three-year mark passes...

814
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,640
You'll become that psycho, evil spirit
that latches onto criminals.

815
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,720
I know, I know. I'm going up.

816
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,880
Gosh...

817
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,920
What do you know?
I'm just more confused now.

818
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,000
(There's no class today.
Clean up and come upstairs.)

819
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,960
Oh... Why not?

820
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,760
I was looking forward to class with
Chef since it's been a while.

821
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:17,760
I'm disappointed.

822
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,680
-I forgive you, Na Bong-sun.
-Chef.

823
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,440
-I forgive you.
-What?

824
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,480
Honestly, I did get angry because of you.

825
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,200
But, we developed an affection for each
other while arguing.

826
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,640
And since you can't live without me,
I will be the big person and forgive you.

827
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,200
-Um...
-I really don't like flowers.

828
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,760
It's not like you can eat them.

829
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,680
Gosh, I'm doing these things because
of you. Here you go.

830
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,400
Okay.

831
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,040
Since you've accepted them,
I'll assume we're no longer fighting.

832
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,120
Okay, next.

833
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:56,680
-This...
-I don't usually do these things either.

834
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,960
I really don't like 'couple' anything.

835
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,720
But, this one is mine.

836
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,160
And for you...
The kids might get surprised if they see.

837
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,440
So, I got you a necklace. Here you go.

838
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,320
There you go.

839
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,840
It looks pretty. I have a good eye.

840
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,520
Look at you being happy.
You must be a girl, after all.

841
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,360
Oh, Chef.

842
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,120
How did I get this way? Seriously.

843
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,800
You really are driving me crazy,
Na Bong-sun.

844
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,600
I don't know what's going on.
Since I can't remember anything.

845
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,200
I should hurry up and
go see Chef so I feel better.

846
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,800
-Na Bong-sun.
-Yes, Chef.

847
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,880
I'll never have a misunderstanding again.

848
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:25,000
More so than I thought...
I think I really do like you a lot.

849
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,680
Me too, Chef.

850
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,720
Hey, Bong-sun. Are you okay?

851
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,680
What's wrong?

852
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,880
-I... Just...
-What, what?

853
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,040
I asked if you're okay?

854
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Yes, that... That is...

855
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,360
No. it's just...

856
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,880
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yes, my legs gave out.

857
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,080
You shocked me. Let's get up.

858
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,240
You just fell suddenly.
I was so shocked. Let me see.

859
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,200
Goodness.

860
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,600
I must've gone crazy. I...

861
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,280
What did I do?

862
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,880
No, no, no...

863
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,600
(But, evil spirits are different.)

864
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:53,760
(They're on a whole different dimension
than ghosts like you who possess humans.)

865
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,400
(They will never be able to die.)

866
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,360
(They will latch onto shady people and
go around committing evil acts.)

867
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,000
(Na Bong-sun.)

868
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,480
(Thank you for everything.)

869
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:14,640
(I'm sorry that I'm leaving without
even saying good-bye to you.)

870
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,440
(But, I can no longer stay in your body.)

871
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,920
(I'm afraid that my feelings will
continue to grow)

872
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,960
(and I would want to stay next to him.)

873
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,800
(And I'm afraid that I may not
be able to keep my promise to you.)

874
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:32,520
(Even without me,
things will work out between you and him.)

875
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,200
(I sincerely want you to be happy.)

876
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,240
(One last thing I want to say
to you is that...)

877
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,120
(You should do your best to love
while you're still alive.)

878
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,800
(Not just others, but yourself as well.)

879
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,200
(She started liking Chef?)

880
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,040
Gosh, why did I have such a weird dream?

881
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,200
Scary...

882
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,200
What now?

883
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,920
Why is that stalker barking so much?

884
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
What's this?

885
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:55,240
Hey, Bong.

886
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:59,000
Where did she go? At this hour?

887
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:03,960
What the heck?

888
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:08,720
Oh no. What am I supposed to do now?

889
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,600
-Yes, Chef.
(-Where are you?)

890
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:22,880
(Where did you go after leaving
your door open?)

891
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,400
Oh, I had something to do... Nearby.

892
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,640
(You're seriously nuts.
Do you know what time it is?)

893
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:36,360
(Hey, you! Walking with your head down
like that in the dark... What if you fall?)

894
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,400
What? Can you see me?

895
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:03,440
(Right.
I can't take a step back from here.)

896
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:07,240
(Chef is calling for me.
Waiting for me because he's concerned.)

897
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,680
(I've liked him so much all this time.)

898
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,160
(And how hard was it to earn his heart?)

899
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:18,120
(I'm only going to think about me.
Just this once.)

900
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,960
(I'm going to keep it.
I'll do whatever it takes...)

901
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:23,800
(To keep Chef's heart.)

902
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,720
-Chef!
-Where were you...

903
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,240
Chef.

904
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,760
Why... Why are you like this?

905
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,160
Because of you, I lost all my sleep...

906
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,720
Oh goodness. This is trouble.

907
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,440
You've fallen for me so hard. Oh my.

908
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,160
Well it is hard to fall out
once you've fallen for me.

909
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,920
Sort of like a swamp.
I get it so you can let go of me now.

910
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,800
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to be apart from you.

911
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,040
Well, what is this in the middle of
the road?

912
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:55,880
Are you manic again?

913
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,600
Before, you wouldn't even
let me touch you.

914
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:05,080
Back and forth is your hobby.

915
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,840
OH MY GHOST

916
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,960
You're mine now.
You should value your body more.

917
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,200
Yes, Chef. I will keep that in mind.

918
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,960
See you later.

919
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,920
(I'll do it. A ritual for the dead.)

920
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,160
-I'm not ready yet and...
-You have talent.

921
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,520
(Na Bong-sun, you can do it, right?)

922
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,040
-Clean it up.
-Yes, Chef.

923
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,320
-And open that box up.
-Gosh...

924
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,800
-I'm okay...
-I said stay seated.

925
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,040
I'm dating her.

926
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,360
(The mood is a little strange today.)

927
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,120
I said I was okay.
Why are you making a big deal?

928
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,560
(He's not the man I know.
He's trying to kill Na Bong-sun.)
