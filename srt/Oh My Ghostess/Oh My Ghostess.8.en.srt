1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,440
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,000
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,760
What the... It's Na Bong-sun!

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,200
Where have you been?
I was looking all over for you.

5
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,760
Me? You've been looking for me?

6
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,080
You... I've been looking for you
for a while.

7
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,200
I mean why?

8
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,000
Didn't you shoot fire at me
and tell me to go away the other day?

9
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,519
I wonder why you came to see me,
Na Bong-sun, most conservative one ever?

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll allow you to take over my body.

11
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,520
Huh?

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,400
You can possess me. Make Chef Kang mine.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,080
Okay, so...

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,480
I can possess your body and
you give me permission?

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Is that what you're saying?

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,479
You little wench!

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,759
Seriously!

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,759
Good call!
You made the right decision, Na Bong-sun.

19
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,039
You're so pretty.

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,759
You pretty thing.

21
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,120
Let's be friends now, okay?

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
Consider me your sister from now on.

23
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,560
That's my family's restaurant.

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,880
Oh, it was really close to our restaurant.

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,560
Yeah, it was.

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,960
That's my dad over there.

27
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,039
KOREAN FOOD

28
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,440
He's a very good person with a kind heart

29
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,200
who suffers losses all the time like
a dummy.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,280
It may not look it now, but
it was quite popular back in the day.

31
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,560
At lunchtime, taxis would line up
just to have our food.

32
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,320
I would get up early at dawn to prepare,
sell meals, and make deliveries.

33
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
I lived a very busy life.

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,280
If I knew I'd die this early...

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,840
I would've tried to have more fun
like everyone else and date.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,079
I should've lived like that.

37
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,640
How did you die anyway?
Is it okay if I ask?

38
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
I don't know.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,040
I don't have any memories of my death.

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
Maybe it's because I died too suddenly
or something.

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,200
Anyway, why did you suddenly change
your mind?

42
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,280
In the past, I was happy
just to look at him from afar.

43
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,880
But, now I'm greedy for him now.

44
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,120
Good... You did well.

45
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:14,000
You should have some greed.
And be loud when needed.

46
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,320
Live like a human being, Na Bong-sun.

47
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,280
-Let's do this.
-Let's do this.

48
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,800
Now, we're no different than being
one body.

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,800
Until we resolve my grudge and
you win over your one-sided love...

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,079
We are a hermaphrodite, united as one!

51
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,800
I don't think hermaphrodite is right...

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,200
Then take that one out.
Anyway, we can do this!

53
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,800
You need to revamp your personality too.

54
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,000
Stand up straight.

55
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,400
-Fighting!
-Fighting.

56
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,560
With more force, fighting!

57
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,840
Fighting!

58
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,840
Oh, that felt good.

59
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,320
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 8

60
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,040
-Did you sleep well, Chef?
-Yeah.

61
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Oh my, oh my.

62
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,880
You must not have slept well.

63
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,600
You look like you've aged ten years
in one day.

64
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,320
What ten years?
It's because I haven't washed my face.

65
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,440
Goodness.

66
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,800
-Hey.
-Yes?

67
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
Are you manic right now?

68
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,080
Perhaps.

69
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,520
Man, this is really confusing.
I can't figure out the cycle at all.

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,159
Why bother with it at all? Just let it go.

71
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,160
Oh, yeah. Chef.
There's something I'm curious about.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,880
I read about this in a magazine long ago.

73
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,600
They say that men are most aroused
between 10 to 11 a.m Is that true?

74
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,280
Gosh, not this again.

75
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,200
Oh my, it must be true.

76
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,960
Hey, hurry up and take your medicine.

77
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,840
Gosh, he's cuter the more I see him.

78
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,840
Chef, Chef... Wait!

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,080
Chef, Chef!

80
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,280
He locked it again.

81
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,880
Chef!

82
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,880
What were you thinking, So-hyung?

83
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,000
SUN-WOO

84
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,280
SO-HYUNG

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,920
It's hot!

86
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,800
It's so hot. It really is.

87
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,080
You could cook pork belly on my back.

88
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,760
What's with this weather?
It'll murder someone.

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,840
You only need to hold on one more day.

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,440
Our vacation starts tomorrow.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,280
All of a sudden, I'm being infected
with a happy virus.

92
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,800
Cordon, why are you so good looking today?

93
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,159
Did it get on you?

94
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,920
What are you guys doing on your time off?
Have you made plans?

95
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,400
I'm going to go fishing in the sea
with my friends.

96
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,159
-What's that supposed to be?
-Fishing, fishing.

97
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,800
No, that's not fishing.
Ji-woong, what about you?

98
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,400
Oh yeah, I think I'll have to head home
first since it's been so long.

99
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,560
I'm going to this water festival in
Jangneung with my friends.

100
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:07,120
And I'll have to have some rice wine
with my friends.

101
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,280
I haven't seen my parents in a
long time either.

102
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,960
-Let's go together.
-What?

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,120
It's a joke! A joke.

104
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,800
I'm sick of seeing your face in this
cramped kitchen every day.

105
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,320
As if I'll go on a vacation with you.

106
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,520
-Of course not.
-Right.

107
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,040
Cordon, what are your plans?

108
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm going to go wakeboarding somewhere
nearby.

109
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,560
"I'm going to go wakeboarding somewhere
nearby."

110
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,720
Even the way this guy plays is annoying.
It's so typical of Cordon.

111
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,040
Doesn't suit me at all.

112
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,040
What vacation?
We're getting a vacation, Sous Chef?

113
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,760
Why are you tickling the back legs
of an elephant?

114
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,080
Chef said so the other day.
We get two days off starting tomorrow.

115
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,840
Oh right. Two days starting tomorrow.

116
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,159
Can you move?
Why are you blocking the path?

117
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,320
Sorry...

118
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,160
She... She's becoming weird again,
isn't she?

119
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,440
Yeah.

120
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,840
Slow down.
You can get indigestion on porridge too.

121
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,280
It must be because it's a special.
There's a lot of abalone in here.

122
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,400
You didn't have to bother visiting me.

123
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,080
I wasn't feeling that sick.

124
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,320
Still... How could I not come when
my friend is feeling ill?

125
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,559
It's a relief that you still have your
appetite even though you got the flu.

126
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,960
Seeing as how well you're eating.

127
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,920
I'm only eating to show my gratefulness
towards you.

128
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh no, there's no need!

129
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
-Don't force yourself to eat.
-No!

130
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
It's all right. I'll just eat it.

131
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
It's fine.

132
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,600
Are you sure? You're okay?

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,840
Of course.

134
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,720
Then eat it.

135
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,560
You have to eat and get better soon.

136
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
I'm so bored to death.

137
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,880
It's school vacation so there are
no lectures.

138
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,120
I have no one to eat with or drink with.

139
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,480
You have no friends to eat or drink with?
When you're a professor?

140
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,640
I was always good at dating since
I was young.

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,760
So I haven't had much opportunity to
make many girl friends.

142
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,400
And women don't really like me.

143
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,840
They say that I'm too friendly with men
or something.

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,960
Of course, that's all in the past.

145
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,680
Now, men are just gross.

146
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,000
That's true.

147
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
When you get older,
it's all about friends, not men.

148
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
But,

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,360
why aren't you looking me in the
eye today?

150
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Are you mad at me about something?

151
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,800
Why... Why wouldn't I look you in the eye?

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,280
Is anything going on with your son?

153
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,360
Anything like fainting from low
body temperature?

154
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,400
Why? Did you see something?

155
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,120
No, no! I was just curious,
so I asked how he was doing.

156
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,800
Gosh, I thought... My heart.

157
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,600
There's nothing much going on.
He's on vacation starting tomorrow.

158
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll tell him to be careful of water.

159
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,920
Oh yeah? Time off?

160
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,000
Is the saffron cream shrimp and
Shrek pasta ready for table 3?

161
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,640
Yes, they are ready, Chef!

162
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,720
Okay, no more orders from now on
and let's finish up in ten minutes.

163
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,000
Yes, Chef!

164
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,560
I'll clean the hall.

165
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,640
Hey, Hyung-jin, Hyung-jin.

166
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,880
What happened to your vacation time?

167
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
Oh, no, no, no. Don't say you can't.
Don't, don't.

168
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,800
I thought you were going to ask your boss.

169
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,080
Is it your fault that the restaurant isn't
doing well?

170
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
What, what? No, that can't be. No, no.

171
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,800
Hey, hey, hey, Hyung-jin. You go get lost.

172
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,680
Gosh.

173
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,480
That punk.
He made it seem like it was a go.

174
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,640
-Getting a bad vibe...
-He's not resourceful enough.

175
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,240
Let's just get through today.
Don't even look at him today.

176
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,360
Okay?

177
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,360
This is going to drive me nuts, really.

178
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Hey you guys...

179
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,440
Hey, where are the crushed tomatoes?

180
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,640
Gosh what's wrong with my tummy?
I have such a bad stomach ache.

181
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,600
Hey, is wakeboarding fun?

182
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,920
I told you they're in the backyard.

183
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
Hey, Chef? Chef.

184
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,760
Do you have any plans for your days off?

185
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,200
No, not really. Why?

186
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:13,520
As a team-building event, I was
thinking we can go on a trip together...

187
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,520
I reserved this amazing lodge for us.

188
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,720
-A team-building trip?
-Yes.

189
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,520
I heard that recently Chef Marco's team
went to Jeju Island

190
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
for membership training.
(MT)

191
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,320
After they came back, their team was
totally in sync with each other.

192
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,520
The team no longer needs any lecturing
whatsoever.

193
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,160
Really?

194
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,720
What do you guys think?

195
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,920
Of course, we should go.

196
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,640
Yes, if Chef says so, we should go.

197
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,400
Great, since Chef is giving us time off
for our team building and unity...

198
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,200
Hey Cordon, what are your thoughts?

199
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,720
I'm supposed to wakeboard...

200
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,600
But, I'll try to cancel it.

201
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,640
Since everyone is supposed to go.

202
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,240
Of course. I'm in, totally in!

203
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,680
Let's go, okay?

204
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,440
Okay. Let's go then.

205
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,440
Min-soo, you take care of packing food.

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,480
Yes, Chef!

207
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Oh, how long has it been since my last MT?

208
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,800
Let's have fun!

209
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,720
-We'll have a lot of fun!
-Me too!

210
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,120
Hey, So-hyung.

211
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
(Are you busy?
You're about done for today, right?)

212
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,680
Yeah, we're closing up now.

213
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,880
(Then let's meet up for a bit.
I'll come to your neighborhood.)

214
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,200
Oh... All right.

215
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,280
-Did you notice me?
-Go, while I'm telling you nicely.

216
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,280
Where are you going? To meet PD Lee?

217
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,800
Why do you care? It's none of
your business. Go back now.

218
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,960
Actually, no.

219
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,160
I wasn't following you.
I'm just going my way.

220
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,760
To where?

221
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm just going down to that mister
I'm friends with, to his restaurant.

222
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,600
Okay, then go. You can go before me.

223
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
Okay.

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,280
-Gosh, so snippy!
-Seriously... You...

225
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,680
So mean.

226
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,120
That girl, seriously.
That bipolar disorder, bipolar.

227
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Gosh!

228
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,480
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

229
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,800
I figured you'd be here soon,
so I ordered two.

230
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,840
-Grapefruit juice is okay, right?
-Yup, it's good.

231
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,040
Gosh.

232
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,240
The AC here is on really high.

233
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,120
They should keep the indoor temperature
at 25 celsius as recommended.

234
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
Sun-woo.

235
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
-Yesterday...
-I know.

236
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,480
You blacked out last night, right?

237
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,680
You were so plastered. Do you even
remember me taking you home?

238
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Yeah.

239
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,640
Yeah, you seemed to sober up a
bit when we were near your place.

240
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,440
How much did you drink anyway?

241
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,920
I did drink quite a bit yesterday.

242
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,240
You should fix your drunk behavior.

243
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,520
If you blackout often,
you'll make a blunder one of these days.

244
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,600
Since I'm your friend it's okay
with me but

245
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,520
you could get slapped
if it was someone else.

246
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,360
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

247
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,680
Yeah, you're right.
I keep making mistakes these days.

248
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,920
Gosh, your work ruined you.

249
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,800
You used to have amazing skin.

250
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,160
Now all that drinking sucked out the
moisture from your skin.

251
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,160
Did it? I guess I should get some
skincare done.

252
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,920
Thank you for telling me.

253
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,360
Be more careful.

254
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Let's leave soon after finishing
this juice.

255
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,560
I'm going to an MT with our team tomorrow.

256
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,880
I have to go pack and stuff.

257
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,760
Oh, yeah? I'm also going for an offsite
location survey.

258
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,920
Okay, let's go after
we finish drinking this.

259
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,120
Okay.

260
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,480
Mister!

261
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,040
Oh, hello. Good to see you.

262
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,800
Why are you here?
Didn't you ignore us completely last time?

263
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,760
Why? You realized you couldn't handle
our push and pull?

264
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,920
So you raised the white flag?

265
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,880
Seriously, what the heck is he saying?

266
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,040
Mister, have this.

267
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,800
Your favorite, red bean popsicle.

268
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,480
Wow, thank you.

269
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
Here, eat that.

270
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,359
-Please sit.
-Thanks.

271
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,520
How did you know I like this popsicle?

272
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,240
Oh, you don't remember?
You told me before.

273
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,640
I did?

274
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,920
Anyway, you've been good about exercising?

275
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,560
Of course, I went to the mineral spring
this morning too.

276
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,160
When possible, I go in the evenings too.

277
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
That's great.

278
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:28,480
I'm really sorry. Things got complicated
so I couldn't keep my promise.

279
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,760
And tomorrow, I have to go to an MT with
my work people.

280
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,200
I think you'd have to exercise on
your own for a bit.

281
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,600
What? MT?

282
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,920
Hey, won't there be just a bunch of guys?

283
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,880
You're not sleeping in the same room
with them, right?

284
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,440
Don't wear anything too revealing.
And you can't wear tank tops either.

285
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,160
What is this? Who are you to say what
I can and can't wear?

286
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,520
Don't go all out and put on a ton of lipstick
just because you're going on a trip.

287
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
Instead make sure to put on
sunscreen lotion.

288
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,200
Your skin is so pale.
You might get sunburns.

289
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,680
What's with the lectures?
You're so absurd.

290
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,640
And make sure to call before
you go to sleep.

291
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,040
-I'll be worried.
-Oh, my, my.

292
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,600
He's a strange one.
Mister, what's with him?

293
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,000
He's always been like that.
Getting in other people's business.

294
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,000
You don't say.

295
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,320
-Brother-in-law!
-Oh, hi.

296
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,640
-Mister, can we get another glass?
-Yup.

297
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

298
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,240
Did you come even though you need
to get to bed?

299
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,600
No, not at all.
A drink will help me fall asleep faster.

300
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,240
Now that I think about it,
it's been a while since we drank together.

301
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
You're right.

302
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,320
But, brother-in-law...

303
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,440
Is there something going on?

304
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,720
-You don't look so good.
-Nothing much.

305
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,280
You know,
sometimes you feel like drinking.

306
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,360
And since I don't have work tomorrow...

307
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,680
Oh, I heard from Eun-hee
you are going to an MT.

308
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,320
Yeah, for team building and all.

309
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,720
It would've been good to take
Eun-hee as well.

310
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,160
But, she feels uncomfortable
so I couldn't keep asking.

311
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,120
Don't worry.

312
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,400
She's meeting her school friends.
I told her I'd go with her.

313
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,920
Oh, really? That's good.

314
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,600
It's upsetting.

315
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,520
She used to like going on trips a lot.

316
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
It's out of our hands, right?
Catching the hit and run offender.

317
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,440
Yeah, since...

318
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,520
It's been a long time.

319
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,640
How can there be no witnesses?

320
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,360
And the CCTV was broken.

321
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,040
If that was repaired,
there may have been some evidence.

322
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,080
You should forget that incident.

323
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,040
Eun-hee has me.

324
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes, that's why I like you so much.
And buy you drinks like this.

325
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,280
We're going to an MT? One night, two days?

326
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,040
That's right. This is a chance
given to us by the heavens.

327
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,920
Why? Because when people go on a trip,
they get excited.

328
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,960
And end up losing wariness.

329
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
And?

330
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,400
And?
Obviously, we should just attack Chef.

331
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,720
-Attack!
-Oh.

332
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,920
Attack him?

333
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,400
Are you saying we shouldn't?

334
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,040
You've got to look at the night sky
to catch the stars.

335
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,120
I mean, still... That's...

336
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,360
You have no time to be embarrassed
or anything like that.

337
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,920
PD Lee called Chef Kang
so he's out with her now.

338
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,320
He's still not back.

339
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
I'm quite worried right now.

340
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,600
Although I don't think Chef Kang
will make that much progress all at once.

341
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,480
We have to attack first
and finish the job.

342
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,680
Got any good ideas?

343
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,200
Then first, shouldn't we make sure
Chef gets his own room?

344
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
Huh?

345
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,200
If there are others around,
then it'll be awkward. To seduce him...

346
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:03,800
Also, I don't think we should let him
to drink too much.

347
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,600
He should at least be able
to walk straight.

348
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,600
If we are going to have
something with him.

349
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:12,240
You're surprisingly smart, huh?

350
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,040
You have a good grasp of the
basic principles.

351
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,320
Not really...

352
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,040
Oh, then, should I get new pajamas?

353
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,520
Like a slip.

354
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,800
Awesome.

355
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,760
-Gosh...
-Gosh.

356
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,240
A slip?

357
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,480
We are here!

358
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,800
-It's nice!
-Wow, it's cool here.

359
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,480
-Hello.
-Hello.

360
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,920
You must be tired from driving.
There must've been a lot of traffic.

361
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,360
No, not really. There was less traffic
than expected, so it wasn't bad.

362
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,640
Wow, the scenery here is amazing.

363
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,200
-Much better than the website.
-Thank you.

364
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,520
This is a snack produced by
our neighborhood.

365
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,480
It's environmentally friendly.

366
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,760
It's slightly frozen,
so thaw first before you eat.

367
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,920
Wow, thank you so much.

368
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,320
You guys will use the BBQ grill, right?

369
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,760
Should I get some coals?

370
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,440
We are chefs,
so you don't have to worry about us.

371
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,560
-Ah, I see.
-Yes.

372
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,560
But, why is another girl inside that girl?

373
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,680
Me?

374
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,040
What do you mean? Well, I am...

375
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,760
I have no idea what you're saying.

376
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,240
Honey.

377
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,560
Chae-hee, why are you out here?

378
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,160
-No, but...
-Hurry, let's go!

379
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,560
The rooms are this way.
I got you the largest rooms we have.

380
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,640
-Wow, thank you.
-Yup.

381
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,840
Let's get our stuff first.

382
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, Chef.

383
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,720
I'll get it.

384
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,240
Wait, wait. Stop, stop. There's more.

385
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Wait.

386
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,320
-It's heavy already.
-There's more. Wait.

387
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,800
-Hold on a moment.
-Oh my, oh my, oh my!

388
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:13,360
Why don't you carry the rest, Sous Chef?
Instead of letting a woman do it?

389
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,720
What woman? Bong? She's not a woman.

390
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,360
-Then is she a man?
-Well, not a man...

391
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,640
Cordon punk, you keep talking back to me.

392
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,160
Are you Bong's boyfriend or something?
What's it to you?

393
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,720
Only her boyfriend can say something?

394
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
I'll be her boyfriend then.

395
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,120
Oh my! What a great response.

396
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
Wait for me, boyfriend!

397
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,080
Gosh, that punk.
Since when were those two so close?

398
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,080
That kid!

399
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,240
Boyfriend, I'll hold this for you.

400
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,880
Hold on, boyfriend.
It's our first day as a couple today.

401
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,960
Chef, we are running out of food.

402
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,880
-There's not much left.
-We finished them all.

403
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,360
-I'll do it, I'll do it.
-No, no.

404
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,280
On trips like this, it's the senior's job.

405
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,480
-Okay.
-Just eat.

406
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,960
I want to eat quickly. It's so good.

407
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,760
If you're bored, you can make some
appetizers with the beef.

408
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:16,840
Appetizers?

409
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,280
Should we do a competition?

410
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,640
What kind of competition?

411
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,560
First place gets their dish on the menu
next month and a day off next month.

412
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,840
I'm in a good mood. An extra day off!

413
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm feeling really competitive today!

414
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,200
Let's go for it.

415
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,360
Why come out here and
do a competition, Chef?

416
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
Starting now!

417
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,280
-Move!
-Gosh!

418
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,320
-Hey!
-Goodness...

419
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,520
Oh Na Bong-sun, have you been practicing
your knife skills?

420
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,560
Your knife skills are looking very good.

421
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,480
I've met an excellent teacher, you see.

422
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,200
Delicious food.

423
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
Here we go.

424
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,440
The two finalists are...

425
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,160
Min-soo's bulgogi papillote and
Jun's torch bulgogi.

426
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,560
Too bad.

427
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:50,360
They both show creativity and taste good.

428
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,840
We can't end it with this.

429
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,080
Today, we have with us Choi Ji-woong
who has spent 30 years tasting food.

430
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,400
-Me... Me?
-Taste it.

431
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,680
Yes, well I do like beef bulgogi quite
a lot.

432
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,960
-I will give them both a taste.
-Yes, sir.

433
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
First, Jun's dish.

434
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,240
Wow, the meat quality is excellent.

435
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,800
The wine and the rosemary make it
taste so good.

436
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,200
Chef, this will be a hit if you put it
on our restaurant menu.

437
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,520
Hey, Cordon.

438
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,200
-This is so delicious.
-Next dish.

439
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,520
What is this now?

440
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,680
The meat is very good, sweet,
and something familiar.

441
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,840
This is something I've had many times.

442
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,760
This tastes the same as one of the
menu items from our restaurant.

443
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,480
-I see.
-Oh...

444
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,160
That's pork belly and this is
beef bulgogi. It's very different.

445
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,520
Chef, please announce the winner.
I'm getting so restless.

446
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,200
-I've made up my mind.
-Okay, the chef has now decided.

447
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,680
So, the winner of their dish on the
special menu and extra vacation days

448
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,080
from the Sun Restaurant summer MT is...

449
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,640
Seo Jun, fighting!

450
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,800
Seo Jun, Seo Jun, Seo Jun, Seo Jun!

451
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,120
Seo Jun, Seo Jun, Seo Jun!

452
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,600
-Seo Jun...
-Heo Min-soo's Bulgogi papillote.

453
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
Papillote!

454
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,120
Well, the thing is...

455
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:30,200
Jun's Torch Bulgogi was very creative
and good too.

456
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,760
Min-soo's was more fundamentally sound
and safe.

457
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,320
You guys may not understand.

458
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,400
I have my own life experience so...

459
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,360
It was good.

460
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,280
What are you all doing? We should eat now.

461
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,160
-Let's eat.
-Yes, Chef!

462
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,560
Let's eat, let's eat!

463
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,320
You should try eating it again.

464
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,280
Bring some drinks.

465
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,040
This tastes much better.

466
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,080
-Shut up.
-Gosh, seriously.

467
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,120
Chef, let's do cheers.

468
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,760
-Why don't you say something?
-That's so tacky.

469
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,800
Everyone,

470
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,600
I know your free time is
very valuable to you.

471
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,080
But, you've all gathered for the sake
of teamwork at Sun Restaurant.

472
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,440
So, I want to sincerely thank you all.

473
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,960
Let's keep going down this path together!

474
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,960
Let's go! Let's go!

475
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,320
Ah, the drinks are just going down
so well today.

476
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,320
It must be the good air.

477
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,600
We bought a lot, but we're out already.

478
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,320
-We're already almost all out.
-Really?

479
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,440
Go buy more.

480
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,960
Does Dong-Woong couple want to go?
Or does Cordon want to go?

481
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,680
-We'll just drink what we have.
-Sous Chef should go.

482
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,880
I'll go buy it.

483
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Oh no! Why not let the employees do it?

484
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,280
I told you that seniors are supposed to
do these things when we come here.

485
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
And you know I try to be
a non-authoritative owner

486
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,360
who's like an older brother.

487
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,480
I'll be back.

488
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,280
Thank you. Have a nice trip.

489
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,960
He sure showboats over a few bottles
of alcohol.

490
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,200
He's dead if he buys cheap stuff.

491
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,960
Okay, music.

492
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
(Piece of loser.)

493
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,120
(Wounded thug.)

494
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,920
(Garbage, jackass, in the mirror...)

495
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,880
You're not talking to me, are you?

496
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,160
-It's a song, a song.
-It's just a song, right?

497
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,440
Listen again.

498
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Wow, Ji-woong.

499
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,680
(Piece of loser.)

500
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
Let's try something else.

501
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
Ah, nice.

502
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,560
(You piece of loser.)

503
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,400
-I like it.
(-Wounded thug.)

504
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,800
(Garbage...)

505
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Chef!

506
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,480
Chef, let's go together!

507
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
What?

508
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,200
-Wait for me.
-Why did you come?

509
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,640
The sun will go down soon.

510
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,640
It's dangerous, especially
places like this.

511
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,360
There are ghosts all over the place,
especially virgin ghosts.

512
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,000
I'll protect you, Chef.

513
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,880
You'll protect me?
You're the most dangerous person.

514
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,640
Don't you worry. I won't touch you.

515
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,520
Oh my, isn't this a bike?
Let's ride this there.

516
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,240
Forget it. Let's just go.

517
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,480
I'd rather run there
than take you on this.

518
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,600
Why not? We could put the alcohol
right here.

519
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,840
It will be heavy.

520
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,160
-Let's go!
-Wait...

521
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,960
You didn't even get the
owner's permission.

522
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,880
Gosh, she really is stubborn.

523
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,120
Chef, would you hurry it up?

524
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,400
Hey, how many kilograms do you weigh?

525
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,680
You're really heavy
for such a small thing.

526
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,600
It's not that I'm heavy.

527
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,880
Your lower body is in very poor shape,
Chef.

528
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,280
Hey, my lower body is no joke okay?

529
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,720
-You'd be shocked.
-Yeah, yeah. You're all talk.

530
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,040
Ah! You're so slow, it's driving me nuts.

531
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,080
-Get off, okay?
-What's going on?

532
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,840
-Just stop!
-How did you get off?

533
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,720
Go to the back seat. I'll drive.

534
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,920
-I thought you couldn't ride.
-Gosh...

535
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
I'm going now!

536
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,320
-Trust me!
-Go slowly.

537
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,200
-Okay, this is it.
-Slowly now.

538
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,600
-Slowly!
-We're going!

539
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,200
Slowly!

540
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,880
-Go slower. Not so fast!
-We're going!

541
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,800
This is fun!

542
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
-Gosh, really?
-I told you to slow down!

543
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,000
Yay, firecrackers.

544
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,160
Why did you buy that for?
It's so childish.

545
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Why not? It's really fun.
It explodes and stuff.

546
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,160
-Do you want to see one?
-Be quiet.

547
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,600
-Do it by yourself later.
-Okay.

548
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,960
Just don't come to me later
begging me for one.

549
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,560
The air is so sweet. It really is so nice.

550
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,240
The air really is nice.

551
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,160
Ever since I was young,
I had a goal once I turned 40.

552
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,480
I wanted to return to a farm like this and
have a little farm of my own.

553
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,200
And I wanted to run a little restaurant.
That was my dream.

554
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,080
You can do that if you want.
It's not like rural land is expensive.

555
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,720
It's your cooking skills
that are the issue.

556
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,400
I want to, but it's already too late.

557
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,600
What do you mean, too late?

558
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,480
Are you opening a restaurant in Paris
or something?

559
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,960
-It is still possible.
-No, it isn't. It's ruined for me.

560
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:48,240
What you know isn't everything.

561
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,320
Don't try to know any more than you do.
You'll pass out if you know more.

562
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,120
Okay, do what you want.
It's your dream, not mine.

563
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,520
Chef, your shoelace is untied.

564
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,040
One moment.

565
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,120
-It's okay.
-Just stay put.

566
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,840
I have a method I use to keep laces
from getting untied.

567
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:12,560
I don't usually reveal this secret to
just anyone.

568
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,600
It's only because it's today.

569
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,560
I was even going to apply for a patent.

570
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,040
I lost out on my timing and
I didn't get to do it.

571
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,400
Tada!

572
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,960
What do you think?
It doesn't look like it'll untie, right?

573
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,600
What do you think?

574
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
-Yeah, it looks good.
-Right?

575
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,320
Tada! Now, we're a couple!

576
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,120
What do you mean, couple? Let go of me.

577
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,480
I happen to know your hand is tied
to this bike.

578
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,480
So, why would I listen to you?

579
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,960
Are you going to keep this up?
I'm going to get angry.

580
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,600
Should I keep going up? How? Like this?

581
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,080
-What are you doing?
-Should I go up?

582
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,400
-Get down.
-I'm climbing up.

583
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,360
Sun-woo!

584
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,200
Oh, So-hyung!

585
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,640
Hey, get down.

586
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,880
What are you doing here?

587
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,160
The offsite was nearby.

588
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,920
I was finished and about to leave,
but remembered your MT.

589
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,159
I brought you some drinks.

590
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,520
You didn't have to.

591
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,560
-You must've come out to buy something.
-Yes.

592
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,840
-Hi, Bong-sun.
-Hi to you too.

593
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,040
Though, I am surprised to see you.

594
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,120
Companies these days must just pay
anyone a salary these days.

595
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,040
People are just so not busy.
They have so much freedom.

596
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,400
Why isn't there any alcohol?

597
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,440
Bring some drinks! Jun wants to drink.

598
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,719
Drink, drink, drink!

599
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,560
Who gave him so much to drink?

600
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,320
Gosh, he's such a lightweight.

601
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,639
He was drinking as if he lost his country.

602
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,920
Leave him alone.
He finally seems like a human.

603
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,040
Gosh.

604
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,040
-Gosh!
-Why...

605
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm seeing all sorts of different sides
of him.

606
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,720
Gosh...

607
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,480
Is Chef making the alcohol or what?

608
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,320
What's taking him so long?
I've lost all my buzz.

609
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,520
-Hey, what do I do?
-Why?

610
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,840
I think I see my goddess.
Isn't that PD Lee... PD Lee?

611
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,400
What kind of nonsense is that?

612
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,080
PD Lee!

613
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,680
-What are you doing here?
-Here.

614
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,480
Take this. Help me with this.

615
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,720
Hello, I was nearby for work
so I dropped by.

616
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,200
-I'm not unwelcome, am I?
-Oh no!

617
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,040
The mood wasn't good because it was
all men. Now, it's shining.

618
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,720
-It's shining.
-Woo-hoo!

619
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,000
What do you mean all men? What about me?

620
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,120
-You're just family.
-That's right.

621
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,200
Quiet down.
PD Lee bought two bottles of wine.

622
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,120
PD Lee, PD Lee...

623
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,920
Milky white skin PD Lee.

624
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,200
Shut up! I told you guys to shut up!

625
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,200
Shut up!

626
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,240
-Put Jun away.
-Put him away.

627
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,080
Let's go.

628
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
-Time for bed.
-Let's put you away.

629
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,240
Get his legs. His legs...

630
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
I'm going to go home then!

631
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,120
-Come here.
-That's it.

632
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Have fun, Eun-hee! I'm so excited for you.

633
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,560
It's been so long since
you've met your friends.

634
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,760
Yes, I know.

635
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,880
Will you be okay alone? Do you have plans?

636
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Of course, I do.

637
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
My friend is coming over,
so don't you worry.

638
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,800
Take good care of her, son-in-law.

639
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,160
Don't worry, Mother.

640
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,200
She must be here. She's here!

641
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,440
All right!

642
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,080
Oh, you're here! Come in, come in!

643
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Why not just meet outside?

644
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,280
-Why did you insist on inviting me here?
-Oh, you know...

645
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,520
-I'll put these on.
-Okay.

646
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,080
-Hello. You're here?
-Yes, hello.

647
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,160
You've met my daughter. It's the
first time you've met my son-in-law.

648
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,080
Say hello. This is my friend, Seobinggo.

649
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
Hello.

650
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,440
I've heard a lot about you.

651
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,240
What are you doing? You should go.
You'll be late.

652
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,640
-Ah, yes.
-Have fun.

653
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,120
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

654
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,760
-We'll be back.
-Bye.

655
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,520
Have lots of yummy food, Eun-hee.

656
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,360
-Yes, Mom.
-He's, strangely, very strong.

657
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,880
-Be careful.
-Yes.

658
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,720
I usually never feel weaker than
anyone when it comes to qi.

659
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,920
Bye.

660
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,240
Is it because I'm lacking in spirituality
these days?

661
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,360
This really hurts my pride.

662
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,440
Hey, Eun-hee!

663
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,280
-Oh, you're here!
-Hey!

664
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,680
How long has it been?
You really need to keep in touch.

665
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,920
Or else I'd forget your face.

666
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,160
I was a bit lazy, wasn't I? I'm sorry.

667
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,120
I heard Hae-joo, you got the role
of Giselle.

668
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,440
That's so great. Congratulations.

669
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes, congratulations!

670
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,480
But, I'm already really worried.

671
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,320
-Why?
-I think it's really intense and hard.

672
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,600
Eun-hee was always the best at Giselle
out of all of us.

673
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,120
-That's true.
-It is.

674
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,840
Even Professor said so.

675
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
That Eun-hee would probably get the
role later on.

676
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
Right, she did say that.

677
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,280
If only it weren't for that hit-and-run...

678
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,200
You still haven't caught the person who
did it, right?

679
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,800
No.

680
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,160
Though we don't know who it is, the
heavens will punish that person, right?

681
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,960
-Yes.
-How could he hit someone and leave?

682
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,960
Evil people like that need to be torn
apart and laid out to dry.

683
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,480
Oh hey! You are scary.

684
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,400
-That's scary.
-What?

685
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,040
Honey... I'll wait outside.

686
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,360
-Why?
-Call me later.

687
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,240
-Why? Just stay with us.
-No, I'll wait outside.

688
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,960
Stay awhile.

689
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,440
-Have fun talking.
-I'll call you.

690
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,200
Goodbye.

691
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,080
-Did we leave him out too much?
-No, no. It's okay.

692
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,040
How is he? Is he good to you?

693
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,800
Oh, Eun-hee.

694
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,080
Hello.

695
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,000
(Drinks are going down)

696
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,720
(Down, down, down, down)

697
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,480
(For how long will you make me do
This shoulder dance?)

698
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,280
(Look at my shoulders
They are dancing)

699
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,080
(There's no time for rest
There's no time for rest)

700
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,240
(Either way I look, I don't know)

701
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,160
-One!
-What's that?

702
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,320
Two!

703
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,440
-Three!
-Three!

704
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,840
You're both caught.

705
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,080
Both of you, one shot.
No, don't do one shot.

706
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,600
Black knight, black knight, black night!

707
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,880
-Sun-woo.
-Chef.

708
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,280
Wow! Chef got a double black knight
request.

709
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,280
-You can only pick one out of the two.
-Of course.

710
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,360
I'll just drink both.

711
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,160
-That's no fun.
-Gosh.

712
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,080
Drink it and make a wish.

713
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,800
Wish, wish, wish.

714
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,280
I don't have a wish.
It's two already. Let's go to bed.

715
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,840
Let's sleep. Let's just go in and sleep.

716
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,480
-We can go in and drink more.
-Okay.

717
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,040
Then, PD Lee and Bong can share a room.

718
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,840
The passed-out drunkard and Chef
can share a room.

719
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,160
Three us in one room.

720
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,760
No, no! Chef is Chef.
He should get his own room.

721
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,080
No, I don't really care.

722
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,120
Oh no! There is a hierarchy here.
That's not right.

723
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,280
Chef gets his own room, end of the story.

724
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,800
Wow, gosh.

725
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
-Do whatever you want.
-Whatever you want.

726
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,320
Then, let's clean up a bit.

727
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,800
-Let's do it.
-Should we go?

728
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,560
-Sun-woo?
-Yeah.

729
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,920
Should we take a walk to get the alcohol
out of our system?

730
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,480
Chef, didn't you say you were tired
before? Look at those dark circles.

731
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,200
-Come on, come on, come on. Let's go.
-What, huh...

732
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,400
-Okay, I got it.
-Please, be careful.

733
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,800
Okay, I will.

734
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,160
Oh, it's cold. Hurry go to bed.

735
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,480
(Gosh, tonight was crucial.
Why is she here? Darn it.)

736
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,640
(I have to finish my talk with Sun-woo
today.)

737
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,760
I hope you're not uncomfortable because
of me, Bong-sun.

738
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,320
I'm sorry.

739
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,320
I wonder why a person that's sorry
insisted on joining another group's MT.

740
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:39,800
I don't understand why you absolutely
insist on sleeping in that storage room.

741
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,160
Do you really have nowhere else to stay?

742
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,520
Chef told me to stay there.
I didn't ask him for it.

743
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,120
Even if someone offers you something,
you should think of them and refuse.

744
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,040
Hasn't it occurred to you that it might be
uncomfortable with the other employees?

745
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,080
No.

746
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,440
-Don't you have any friends?
-No, I don't.

747
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,240
You can come to my house then.

748
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,120
Why are you so interested in where
I sleep, PD Lee?

749
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,400
And why does it bother you that I'm here,
Bong-sun?

750
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,720
-Where are you off to?
-The lights.

751
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,200
-I need to turn off the lights.
-Oh, it's over there.

752
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,120
-I can't sleep with the lights on.
-Okay.

753
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,680
-Where are you going?
-The bathroom.

754
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,840
Why bother going out?
There's one in the room.

755
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,440
Right over there.

756
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,760
Oh, that's a bathroom...

757
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,640
Yes.

758
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,920
It went right back inside.

759
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,560
I won.

760
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,600
Oh, if things work out like this...

761
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:16,560
It's a natural arm pillow.

762
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,560
Oh, Chef.

763
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,440
What's this? What is this?

764
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,800
People will wake up. It's me, Na Bong-sun.

765
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,080
What's going on? Why are you here?

766
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,880
It's just that PD Lee keeps snoring.

767
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,120
I'm so tired. I just can't sleep at all.

768
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,480
How bad do you think it was that
I came into your room like this?

769
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,160
What?

770
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:48,360
Why are you looking at me like that?
Making me all excited.

771
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:49,640
Have you taken your medicine?

772
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,840
Can you stop asking me if I took
my medicine?

773
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,880
How can I stop asking?

774
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,640
What kind of girl acts this way?

775
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,640
-I'm going to go nuts.
-This is so nice.

776
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,600
-Let me get my arm out.
-No.

777
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
Get out.

778
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,960
I'm telling you, PD Lee snores.

779
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,520
Ah, I don't want to.

780
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,080
-Wait a minute.
-Just come out.

781
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,240
Gosh!

782
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,840
What am I to do with you?

783
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
Chef!

784
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,400
Do you have this much prejudice when
it comes to sleeping with someone?

785
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,600
If I went this far, you should close
your eyes and just...

786
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,840
Gosh, really just...

787
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,840
Why are you acting like this today?

788
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,640
Maybe I need to take you to the hospital
again. I think it's getting worse.

789
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,440
Sit down.

790
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,400
(-Chae-hee.
-Chae-hee!)

791
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:55,880
Hey, Chae-hee!

792
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,720
Chae-hee.

793
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,680
Yoon Chae-hee!

794
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,800
-Why, is something wrong?
-Yes.

795
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,120
My daughter is missing.

796
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,320
You mean that girl in the uniform
earlier today?

797
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,440
Our daughter isn't mentally normal.

798
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,920
She could be causing problems
if she's on her own.

799
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:15,880
Where could she be?

800
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,480
Chae-hee!

801
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,320
She's always liked to hide.

802
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Chae-hee!

803
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,240
I think she's hiding somewhere.

804
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,720
-Chae-hee!
-It's getting very late.

805
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,840
Hiding... Hiding?

806
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,360
Then, we'll look for her too.

807
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,720
Yes, yes.

808
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,880
-Her name is Chae-hee?
-Yes.

809
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,720
-Yoon Chae-hee.
-Okay.

810
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:36,600
Yoon Chae-hee!

811
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,480
Your mom and dad are worried.

812
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,240
Come out if you're hiding.

813
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,400
Yoon Chae-hee!

814
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,200
I don't think she's over here.

815
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,520
Chef, go over that way. I'll try this way.

816
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,960
-What?
-You go that way.

817
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,520
Be careful. Don't fool around and trip...

818
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,720
Gosh.

819
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,280
Yoon Chae-hee...

820
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,520
Chae-hee!

821
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,400
(Look for the kids.)

822
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:10,680
They were playing hide and seek with me.
But, they disappeared suddenly.

823
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,920
You didn't see where they went either?

824
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,360
Are you Chae-hee?

825
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:19,440
Oh, you were over here?

826
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,640
Oh, you're the two girls I saw before.

827
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,400
Hi there.

828
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,400
I see. I was wondering how you saw me.

829
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,640
You're sick.

830
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,520
Let's go, Chae-hee.
Your parents are worried.

831
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,520
I can't. I'm looking for the kids.

832
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
Kids?

833
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:35,320
Hey, kids!

834
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:39,160
Wait, Chae-hee! Wait!

835
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,320
Wait for me. Where are you going?

836
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,120
Chae-hee, stop for a moment.
Chae-hee, wait!

837
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,720
Wait! Chae-hee, listen to me!

838
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,160
Chae-hee, wait! Chae-hee...

839
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:55,760
That little thing sure runs fast.

840
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,480
What is this place? What's this storage...

841
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,120
Ouch,

842
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,800
gosh!

843
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,880
Goodness!

844
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,440
Chae-hee!

845
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,120
Oh, what is this? A refrigerated storage?

846
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,080
I'm in the right temperature for once.

847
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,920
Chae-hee, where are you?

848
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,560
Stop hiding and come out.

849
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,040
Let's go back to your mom, Chae-hee.

850
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:28,640
Chae-hee, where are you?

851
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,200
Oh! Hey, Chae-hee!
Hey, Chae-hee, Chae-hee!

852
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,760
How do I open this?

853
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,160
Chae-hee!

854
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,040
Hurry up and open this, Chae-hee!

855
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,440
-She's a ghost. I have to lock her up.
-Open up. I'll get angry.

856
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,440
I'm really scary when I get angry.

857
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,680
Chae-hee, you might have noticed by now.

858
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,440
But, I'm a ghost okay?

859
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,800
If you don't open up soon,
I'm going to come after you.

860
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,040
You're a good girl, aren't you?

861
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,840
Hey, Yoon Chae-hee!
Open up quickly. I'm serious!

862
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,560
I really am scary when I get mad!

863
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,280
Yoon Chae-hee! Hey, Yoon Chae-hee!

864
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,480
Seriously, Chae-hee.

865
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,800
Chae-hee...

866
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,360
Chae-hee!

867
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,640
-Yoon Chae-hee.
-Oh dear...

868
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:18,360
Where were you?
Do you know how worried we were?

869
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,560
I told you not to go out at night.

870
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,880
You have no fear. Where were you?

871
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,920
I was just out playing.

872
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,520
-You found Chae-hee.
-Yes.

873
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,960
Sorry. You should be sleeping and
all because of us...

874
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,960
No, don't say that.
It's a relief you found her.

875
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,160
-Thank you.
-Go on and take her in.

876
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,800
-Thank you. Go on in.
-Yes, I will.

877
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:44,880
What did I tell you?

878
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,880
Goodness...

879
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,320
How unfortunate for a pretty child.

880
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,200
How far did Na Bong-sun go anyway?

881
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,040
We found one person and another
one disappears. Gosh!

882
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
(Chae-hee.)

883
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,240
You're not gone, are you?

884
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,320
You didn't leave me here, did you?

885
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,600
What is this?
Did she really leave me here?

886
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,840
That little rascal.
How did she lose her mind?

887
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,800
How far did she go?
She's not even picking up her phone?

888
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,520
(Hello?)

889
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,920
-Hey, Na Bong-sun.
(-No, it's me So-hyung.)

890
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,800
(Is that you, Sun-woo?)

891
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,760
Yeah... Hold on.

892
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,320
Did Na Bong-sun leave her phone in
the room?

893
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,640
This is not the time to sit around.

894
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,760
I have to do something.

895
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:56,800
There's no choice.

896
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,880
-Na Bong-sun.
-What is this place?

897
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,640
It's a refrigerated storage.
We're trapped.

898
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,200
-Trap... Trapped?
-Explaining will take too long.

899
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,800
-Wait a little bit. I'll find a way out.
-Okay.

900
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,560
Bounce up and down if you need to.

901
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,960
Gosh, it's cold.

902
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,800
Let's see here.
I have to lift this thing up here.

903
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,880
I feel like...

904
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,600
I could do it.

905
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,560
Up.

906
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,440
Maybe it's just too heavy.

907
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,720
I'm going crazy here.

908
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,120
Did I drop this when I fell before?

909
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:54,040
Let's see now.
I think I can handle this one.

910
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,160
Oh yeah!

911
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,480
That's step one for now.

912
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,040
Chef!

913
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,680
I looked around everywhere over here,
but I can't find her.

914
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,040
Over this way too.

915
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,520
Gosh, Bong. Where the heck is she?

916
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,720
She causes problems at work and
now causes problems outside.

917
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,200
She just creates issues so that
no one can sleep.

918
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,560
Can you even sleep when someone
has gone missing?

919
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,400
When one of our family is missing?

920
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,680
It's just that I'm worried too.

921
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,640
She's been missing for over two hours.

922
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,080
This isn't even a familiar place.

923
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,960
Should we report it to the police?

924
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,600
Oh, that scared me.

925
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,440
Who's setting those off in the middle
of the night?

926
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:58,600
Na Bong-sun.

927
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,720
Chef, where are you going? Chef!

928
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,680
Chef!

929
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,160
Chef, Chef!

930
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,760
Oh, Chef, Chef! Over here!

931
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,280
What a relief. You found it.

932
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,160
The storage over here.

933
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,160
-Firecrackers...
-No, over this way!

934
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,560
-Over here?
-Where?

935
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,760
Is Bong-sun here?

936
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,560
The firecrackers are here,
but not Bong-sun.

937
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,240
(Chef, I'm in here. Open the door, Chef.)

938
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,360
(Chef, I'm in here. Let me out.)

939
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,120
-What's that?
(-Chef!)

940
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,640
-Chef, I...
-Hey, Na Bong...

941
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,280
Hey! Are you okay?

942
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,960
Yes... I'm okay so far.

943
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:47,120
Hey, Bong.

944
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,880
-It's so cold!
-Are you crazy?

945
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,440
Hey! Seriously!

946
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,560
Are you crazy?

947
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,080
Are you thinking at all or not?
Why did you come in here? For what?

948
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,240
I told you to be careful and
stop fooling around.

949
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,840
Why didn't you listen to me and
make me run here like this?

950
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:06,480
Well, I'm sorry for making you worry.

951
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,600
It's not like I got trapped in here
because I wanted to...

952
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:09,920
Be quiet! Stop talking.

953
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:12,120
You think you're okay right now,
don't you?

954
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,120
You were in a refrigerated storage for
two hours!

955
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,840
Stay put.

956
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,120
Why don't we get out of here, Chef?
I'll give her a piggy-back.

957
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,280
No, it's okay.

958
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,960
Your body's so cold.
How could you be okay?

959
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:41,720
Oh right.

960
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,200
Who lit the firecrackers?

961
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:45,760
Bong was locked in by herself.

962
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,880
It was probably caught somewhere and
went off by coincidence.

963
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,480
Why is Chef getting so angry anyhow?

964
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,920
He's going a bit overboard in my opinion.

965
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,120
It's obvious.

966
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,040
Who would pay if she had to be
admitted to the hospital?

967
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:04,040
Would I pay or you?
You know what... You pay.

968
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,160
You pay with your labor.

969
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:25,840
-Sun-woo?
-Yeah.

970
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,080
What are you all doing? Get up.

971
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,480
What? You drunk punk.

972
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,920
-Goodbye.
-Yes, goodbye.

973
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,400
Thank you!

974
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,400
-Goodbye!
-Bye!

975
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,720
-We had a lot of fun.
-Yes, thanks.

976
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:47,520
Sorry about my daughter last night.

977
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,680
-It's okay.
-Please come again.

978
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,760
Yes, I will. Bye.

979
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,440
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

980
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,120
Hey, you got out.

981
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,960
It'd be nice if that girl inside you
came out too.

982
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,400
Bye to both of you.

983
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,160
Okay, bye. Don't be a troublemaker.

984
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:07,680
Bye.

985
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:12,160
Sun-woo, you can drive me
to the station, right?

986
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,760
Oh, okay.

987
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,960
Officer Choi, Officer Choi!

988
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,400
When's your birthday?

989
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,760
-Birthday?
-Yeah.

990
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,400
It's in the winter. Why?

991
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,880
It's just that I have a present for you.

992
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,720
I'll let you know when I'm sure about it.

993
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,080
Oh, hold on.

994
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,560
Yes, yes, it's me.

995
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,680
Yes!

996
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,560
Ah, yes, I understand.

997
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,120
I'll come by after work today.

998
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,840
Okay, thank you.

999
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,200
I got good news, Officer Choi.

1000
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,840
You know the CCTV that recorded Eun-hee's
hit and run accident?

1001
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,160
I had requested for its recovery

1002
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,560
to a very skilled convict that just
got released.

1003
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,960
He says it's almost fixed.

1004
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,160
I'm going to go get it after work.
What do you think? Surprised? Impressed?

1005
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,960
Oh, really? That's really great.

1006
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:04,840
I'm sure there's some sort of
evidence on it.

1007
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:07,040
Wow, how many years has it been?

1008
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,080
Where there's a will, there's a way.

1009
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,320
That bastard, he's dead when we catch him.
I'll kick his...

1010
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,240
-Wait, let's tell Chef Kang about it.
-I'll tell him.

1011
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,040
Do you want to?

1012
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,920
Then I'll go confirm things first.

1013
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,920
Goodness, I'm nervous.

1014
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,280
Thank you!

1015
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,320
For being concerned
about the car accident.

1016
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,040
It's not because your wife was involved.

1017
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,520
It was my first case when I got here.

1018
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,040
How can I not be concerned about it?

1019
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,280
Let's do this step by step from now on.

1020
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,000
You should go now.

1021
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,560
Sun-woo.

1022
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,920
Aren't you curious?

1023
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:06,560
Why I even came to your MT location?

1024
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,320
-So-hyung.
-I know.

1025
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,960
It's not that you're not curious.
You're probably afraid to ask.

1026
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,480
Since you already know what I'll say,
right?

1027
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,640
Let me ask you one more question.

1028
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,920
The way you are setting boundaries
between us.

1029
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,720
Is it maybe about Bong-sun?

1030
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,760
Actually, no. Let's just pretend I didn't
ask this question.

1031
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:38,160
It makes me look too pathetic.
And makes me feel bad.

1032
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,240
Goodbye.

1033
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,480
(Soon enough I'll catch you)

1034
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,920
(You nasty CCTV)

1035
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,240
(You're dead you bastard)

1036
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,800
Alright, let's go.

1037
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:06,960
Hey,

1038
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,560
are you kidding me?

1039
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,000
Seriously, I need to get a new car
or something.

1040
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,360
This car always acts up like this!

1041
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:17,880
Junk.

1042
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:24,960
Let me see... Is the battery dead?

1043
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:30,480
As if I know how to fix anything.
What to do...

1044
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:57,200
Why isn't he coming back?
Making me feel so nervous.

1045
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,560
Maybe PD Lee is using her wiles on him?

1046
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,400
Darn, I should've done the deed at the MT.

1047
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,400
What a waste of a chance.

1048
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,520
Oh my.

1049
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,760
Chef, you're here.

1050
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,120
Here, give it to me. Yes.

1051
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,800
Do you feel okay?

1052
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:18,320
Of course. As I told you yesterday...

1053
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,800
I'm naturally tough against
cold temperatures.

1054
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,560
If you're okay, then put on your apron.

1055
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,880
We skipped yesterday.
Today, you'll learn how to use a wok.

1056
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,320
Okay. A lesson today?

1057
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,560
Okay.

1058
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,440
Ow. My wrist.

1059
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:39,040
Don't move it up, but pull it towards
you rhythmically.

1060
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:43,120
I don't want to do this anymore...

1061
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:47,840
It's too painful. I think I'll get sick.
This is too hard.

1062
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,840
-Okay, then stop.
-What?

1063
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,760
-Really?
-Yes, no more.

1064
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,280
-Just clean up the floor.
-Yes, Chef.

1065
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:02,040
By the way...
Chef, I'm curious about something.

1066
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:03,000
About what?

1067
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,400
Yesterday, in the refrigerated storage,
why did you get so angry?

1068
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:10,040
Why?

1069
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,880
I mean, you were just so angry
I was kind of speechless.

1070
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,160
Why were you?

1071
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,720
Should I compliment you when you're
causing trouble even at a lodge?

1072
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,560
Stop talking nonsense and clean up.

1073
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:26,640
Yes, Chef.

1074
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,400
Move over. I have to spray water here.

1075
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,680
My! So cold!

1076
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,200
-Gosh!
-Seriously!

1077
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:46,520
Chef!

1078
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,320
Why would you turn on the water
so suddenly like that?

1079
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,280
Oh no!

1080
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,440
It's so cold.

1081
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,960
Is this your first time holding the hose?

1082
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,840
No, I didn't know the water will come out
so suddenly with that much force.

1083
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,600
What do I do?

1084
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:09,640
It's all wet.

1085
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,240
Wow, the water's so cold.

1086
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:17,960
What now...

1087
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,240
Come over here.

1088
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,360
Okay.

1089
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,720
-Wipe it with this.
-It's so cold...

1090
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,800
I turned it on too high.

1091
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,760
-What should I do...
-Hold on.

1092
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,600
Oh, no. It's all wet. I feel so bad.
What should I do?

1093
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:42,080
Darn, I'm such a big klutz.

1094
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:46,160
I think...

1095
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,120
The water is... Turned off...

1096
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,200
now?
