1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,440
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,040
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,080
Seobinggo!

4
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,960
Hey, seriously...

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,520
-Today, I'm not letting you get away.
-Seobinggo!

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,760
Crap!

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,640
I just need today!

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,280
We'll be at this all night.

9
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,600
Taxi, taxi!

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,480
Stop, stop.

11
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,800
-Do you have a death wish?
-Pardon?

12
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,680
Do you know what time it is?

13
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,280
Would I make you wait like this?

14
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,640
I... I'm sorry, Chef.

15
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,080
You don't have a fever.
What's with you again?

16
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,080
Are you feeling depressed again?

17
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,320
You always say "I'm sorry" on repeat
when you're down.

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,520
No, it's not that...

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,200
Well yes, a little.

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,160
So, are you or aren't you?

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,880
Forget it.

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,960
Whatever the case, get in.

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,920
Whether it's a manic episode or
depression, we should eat something.

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,400
Okay.

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,079
By the way... Chef.

26
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,240
Yeah?

27
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,520
You know that show recording last time
and the thing with the flour?

28
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,320
-That worked out okay, right?
-Of course, it did.

29
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,320
Why? Did you want to gloat about it now?
That you're the one who fixed it?

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,920
No, that wasn't it at all.

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,080
Honestly, the bean powder was not bad
under the circumstances.

32
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
But if you put too much bean powder,
it can lose its moisture and fall apart.

33
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,280
That's where the saying
"bean powder household" comes from.

34
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,120
You should know that before you gloat.

35
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,440
Yes, I'll keep that in mind. Sorry, Chef.

36
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,320
-Okay, you keep that in mind.
-Yes, Chef.

37
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,000
Look up some directions on your
phone for me.

38
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,760
Search Hongjae-dong Buckwheat
Pancake House.

39
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:28,280
Yes, Chef.

40
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,040
Is she gone? She is, right?

41
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,240
Gosh, that Seobinggo is so good at
tracking people.

42
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,600
How the heck did she connect me
to Na Bong-sun?

43
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,240
I was nearly caught by her.

44
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
That gives me the chills. Whatever.

45
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,800
I caught you!

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
Seobinggo! Don't do this.

47
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't get started with the sister crap.

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,720
-I don't like this.
-Shut up.

49
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,280
I'm so angry because of you!

50
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,480
-You're done for now.
-Okay, okay.

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,720
-Okay, okay... Ouch, that hurts.
-Come with me.

52
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,959
Do you know how much I spent on taxi
cabs because of you?

53
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,640
Goodness.

54
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,560
It hurts.

55
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,240
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 7

56
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,560
Food is not merely...

57
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,120
-Please enjoy.
-Yes, ma'am.

58
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,520
Food is not merely for consumption.

59
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,760
Just as much as music and art,
one should be conscious of it.

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,280
Do you know who said that?

61
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,080
-Chef?
-Wrong.

62
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,320
-I suppose you could think that.
-I'll do that.

63
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,159
It wasn't me. It was Leonardo Da Vinci.

64
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,159
Oh.

65
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,360
It means that you should eat food
in the same way you take in music and art.

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,880
Think about what oil they used.
What they put in this dough.

67
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,280
What kind of seasoning they put in here.

68
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,680
Think about this and don't just eat it.

69
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,720
Yes, Chef.

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,040
Cooking is like being a conductor
of an orchestra in the kitchen, okay?

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes.

72
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,440
That conductor quote is something
I came up with. Surprising, right?

73
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,000
It gives you goosebumps, right?

74
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
It's very cool, Chef.

75
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,160
When have I not been cool? Eat.

76
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,760
How is it? Do you notice anything?

77
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,320
The texture is very crunchy.

78
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,520
Why do you think it's like that?

79
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,080
Is it corn starch?

80
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
If you use corn starch in this,
the dough would just get droopy.

81
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,960
The secret is... Onions.

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,680
Onions?

83
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,800
If you puree onions and mix it in,
it controls the moisture and it's crunchy.

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
You can think of onions acting as
the frying powder.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
I see.

86
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,760
With food ingredients alone
you can make...

87
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,760
All sorts of textures without
creating them artificially.

88
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,360
Suppose you want it to be chewy.
Then, you would add potato.

89
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,520
And if you want something soft,
you can add milk to the flour.

90
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,760
You let someone like her take over
the sauce?

91
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
If you want to liven up the flavor,
you would add sesame oil.

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,880
-Are you going to zone out?
-No.

93
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,240
Right now, you're receiving
lessons that you can't pay for.

94
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,040
Yes, I know Chef. Thank you.

95
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,920
What would you add liven up the flavor?

96
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,760
-Sesame oil?
-That's right.

97
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,480
-Please eat.
-Okay.

98
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,320
Ah, this is nice.

99
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,560
Everything about this place is good,
but the parking is no good.

100
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,800
Can't you even look where you're going
when you're walking?

101
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm sorry, Chef.

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
You need to work on your fitness.

103
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,280
You're always so weak.

104
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
The guys all call you "Bong, Bong"
and think they can get away with it.

105
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,720
-Why can't you say to them...
-Huh?

106
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
"I am not Bong. I am Na Bong-sun!"

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
Be confident.

108
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,880
Yes, Chef. I'll take note of that.

109
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
-Okay, let's go Bong.
-What... What?

110
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,040
I can do it, only me.

111
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,840
Yes, Chef.

112
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,640
That's so cool.

113
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,760
What's so great about that?
Don't you ever watch audition shows?

114
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,640
There are kids like that everywhere.

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,400
Hurry up. I'm tired.

116
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Okay.

117
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,600
-Bong-sun.
-Yes!

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,560
-Get in.
-Seobinggo...

119
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,120
You're such a pain.

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,800
Please untie this for me.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,120
It's only a matter of time until
I resolve my virgin grudge now.

122
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,040
What? You're kidding yourself.

123
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,520
It's not like blowing your nose.

124
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,480
It's not so easy for a ghost to
resolve their grudge.

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,640
That's not it. Just listen to me.

126
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,200
I've already prepared my meal.

127
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,400
It's game over once I dig my spoon
into it.

128
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:09,120
Goodness, what meal? How would you go
about finding a meal for yourself?

129
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,680
A meal...

130
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,280
You found a man of vitality?

131
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Yes, I have!

132
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,840
It wasn't a coincidence that I entered
Na Bong-sun's body.

133
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,680
They say it's darkest under the lamp.
He was right under my nose.

134
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:27,960
You're not talking about that chef
at the restaurant, are you?

135
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,680
You noticed too, didn't you?

136
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,920
He turned out to be a man of vitality!

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,640
Goodness, no! No, you can't!

138
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,720
Why not?

139
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
His mom is my regular client.

140
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,039
I've become friends with her.

141
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,680
What's that got to do with me?

142
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,240
What ghost cares about that stuff when
they're resolving their grudge?

143
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,400
Even if he were your son,
I'd lay him flat out.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,720
Son, what son? I'm a single woman!

145
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,600
And you can't touch her son.
You just can't!

146
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,360
Why not? It's not like he's your son.
Why are you protecting him?

147
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,840
That's not like you at all...

148
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
You must've taken a lot of money...
From his mother, huh?

149
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,040
How much did you get? How much?

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,960
What do you mean?
Just listen when I say that you can't.

151
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,360
Hey, I'll send you away,
so why don't you just leave?

152
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,040
It would be great if you could reach
a state of peace and go...

153
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,480
But, you can't do it on your own
so what can we do?

154
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,440
I prepared a nice table for your
memorial ritual for the dead.

155
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,160
A ritual for the dead?

156
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,280
No, I'm scared.

157
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,440
I heard it hurts and it's awful.

158
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,480
Everyone says it's very painful.

159
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,480
It's only for a moment.

160
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,880
You only need to endure it for
that moment.

161
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,280
No, I won't do it. I said I won't do it.

162
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,840
-Hey.
-I won't do it. I won't.

163
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,640
I refuse.

164
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,080
I ought to just cut you!

165
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,400
I don't usually eat late at night.
All this because of my employee.

166
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,480
I'm sorry, Chef.

167
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,920
You're sorry again?

168
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,960
I can't say anything around you.

169
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,280
Good night, Chef.

170
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,960
I don't know if I'll be
able to have a good night.

171
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,960
Who knows when you'll have a
manic episode and attack me.

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,440
-Sleep then.
-Yes, Chef.

173
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,920
Wait a minute...

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,040
Who hasn't played guitar back in the day?

175
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,520
I've played guitar a lot. I've played it
to the point where I'm sick of it.

176
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,800
Something like this.

177
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,160
Hey, Na Bong-sun. Hurry.

178
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,880
-Yes?
-Hurry up.

179
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,840
Wait, please.

180
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,440
Yes, Chef?

181
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,600
Look at the time.
Why do you sleep so much?

182
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,240
-I'm sorry.
-Chefs shouldn't sleep too much.

183
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,320
-You have to go to morning markets a lot.
-Okay.

184
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,240
-Hurry, let's work out.
-What, work out?

185
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,960
I told you yesterday.
You have fitness issues.

186
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,440
If you want to work in my kitchen,
you need to work on your fitness.

187
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,120
Look at me. Because I work out
all the time... See, my biceps.

188
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,640
That's really cool.

189
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,320
If you work hard, you'll get arm muscles
and be mentally healthy.

190
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,960
So, hurry up.

191
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,520
I don't really have exercise clothes...
Hold on a moment.

192
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,320
You can't ride a bike?

193
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,720
No, I can't.

194
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,800
What did you do when you were younger?

195
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,280
You didn't learn this?
Isn't this a fundamental thing?

196
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,960
I wanted to learn,
but I wasn't very athletic.

197
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,480
Well, what did you think I was renting
that extra bike for?

198
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,840
You should have said so
if you couldn't ride a bike.

199
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,880
It's not like you need a license or
anything like that.

200
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,600
Why can't you ride it?

201
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Why can't you do this?

202
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
You're so good.

203
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,120
You're not letting go, right?

204
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,000
-Yes, I am.
-I'm going now.

205
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,320
If you go right, turn left and
if you go left, turn right.

206
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,960
Are you understanding me right now?

207
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,920
No!

208
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,600
You keep going left! Go to the right!

209
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,880
-Are you going to go up the stairs?
-I'm sorry.

210
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,440
-You have to go this way.
-Okay.

211
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,200
Wait.

212
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Try again.

213
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm trying to do well,

214
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,200
-but it's just not working out.
-I got you.

215
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,960
-Should we keep going?
-Yes, go left.

216
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,320
-Left where?
-That's too far left!

217
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,880
-Straight?
-In the middle, yes that's good.

218
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,680
To the right, okay.

219
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,720
-Left, right, right...
-Is this right? Wait...

220
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,840
-Ow!
-Are you okay?

221
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,640
Oh, my arm.

222
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,560
Teaching you is harder than
a cross-country trek on a bike.

223
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,200
Sorry, Chef.

224
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,920
Wait, I'm short 200 won.

225
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,480
You think we won't be able to drink any?

226
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,960
-Yeah, should we go?
-No.

227
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,240
No, there is a way.

228
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,520
Wow.

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,040
This is a growing experience of life.

230
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,120
This is a life tip.
You sure are learning a lot from me.

231
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,880
We're still short 100 won.

232
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,200
-100 won?
-Yeah.

233
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,600
We can share one can.

234
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,520
Here, 100 won.

235
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,640
-Have you done this before?
-No.

236
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,880
-It's your first time?
-Yes.

237
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,520
-It's really your first time?
-Yes, it is.

238
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,480
Since the teacher is quick,
the student is quick too.

239
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm glad you are a quick learner.

240
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,040
-Here.
-Thank you.

241
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,080
Wow, looks good.

242
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,840
What is this? Where's my bike seat?

243
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Hey!

244
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,200
What are you doing? Hey!

245
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,080
Stop right there!

246
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,640
-Oh, wait...
-Stop thief!

247
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,960
-Chef!
-Hey you!

248
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,160
-Hey!
-Chef!

249
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
Stop! Stop right there!

250
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,040
Oh my!

251
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,240
Darn it, he's fast.

252
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,599
Hey you!

253
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,680
Mister!

254
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,800
-Mister, wait.
-Hey, move!

255
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,520
-No, I can't, I can't, I can't...
-Just let go!

256
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,240
-Mister, I'm sorry.
-Let go of me.

257
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,160
If you're sorry, then let go of me.

258
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,200
Mister, I'm really sorry about this.

259
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,480
What is this? What's going on?

260
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,280
You jerk.

261
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,680
-My goodness!
-What did you do?

262
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,720
-I bit him.
-Good job.

263
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,040
-Get over here. Hurry up.
-What do you want?

264
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,200
Hey, you punk!

265
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,240
You stole all those bike seats and
now you're finally caught.

266
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,800
-Why you!
-Oh, you startled me.

267
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,600
Everyone's been having butt problems
because of you.

268
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Get in there.

269
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,560
-Thanks, Chef.
-Oh no.

270
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,080
Hurry it up, punk.

271
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,040
How in the world did you catch him?
He's a chronic offender.

272
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,600
It wasn't me. It was Na Bong-sun.

273
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,040
What?

274
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,400
She couldn't overcome him with strength,
so she bit his leg. It was scary.

275
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,680
Oh no, Officer. I only bit lightly.

276
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Whatever the case,
you did catch him by biting him.

277
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,200
I guess I did.

278
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,160
Thank you. He was such a pain to us.

279
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,760
I'll buy you a meal sometime.

280
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,680
Oh no, there's no need.

281
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,920
What did I say?

282
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,240
Now that you're exercising with me,
you have better muscles and grip.

283
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
The two of you... Exercise together?

284
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Ah, well?

285
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,880
No, well...

286
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,720
She's not very fit,
so she's not good at holding fry pans.

287
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,480
-Ah...
-It's for training purposes.

288
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,240
-Hurry on in.
-Okay, bye, Sun-woo.

289
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,080
Goodbye.

290
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,680
-Bye, Bong-sun.
-Bye.

291
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,440
Have they left?

292
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,320
What's with the two of them?

293
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,920
Chef Kang is not the type to
exercise with his employees.

294
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,800
Yes, I know.

295
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,680
I know they're sometimes together
because of the TV show.

296
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,640
It's a bit unexpected.

297
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
A bit?

298
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,600
It's very unexpected.

299
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
It is, right?

300
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,080
I'll take one iced americano.

301
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,560
That's 4,300 won.

302
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,520
ROLL CAKE

303
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,760
Here.

304
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,840
Na Bong.

305
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,000
-Chef.
-Come eat this.

306
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,120
Oh no, I'm fine.

307
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,480
What do you mean?
You didn't eat breakfast.

308
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,080
Come grab a fork.

309
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,280
I really like this cake and
I don't usually share it with anyone.

310
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,840
I'm being generous today.

311
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,760
Okay.

312
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,280
How is it? Really good, isn't it?

313
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,520
Yes, it's tasty.

314
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,080
You're smiling a lot today.

315
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,960
-Excuse me?
-How nice is this, huh?

316
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,480
This is just right.

317
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,920
You're not going overboard or
shriveling up and saying sorry.

318
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,880
A person should have a neutral state
like this.

319
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,520
I really like you today, Na Bong-sun.

320
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,720
You even caught a thief today like, bam!

321
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,320
Look at you, you're so happy.

322
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Sun-woo!

323
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,200
Hello.

324
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,160
Oh, So-hyung. What brings you by?

325
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,440
What do you mean? I came to see you.

326
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,720
-You said you liked americanos?
-Yeah.

327
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,120
Latte.

328
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,040
So, Bong-sun is staying in that
storage room?

329
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,600
Yeah, just until she finds a place.

330
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,720
She's already so weak as it is and
not feeling well.

331
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,640
The dormitory kicked her out,
so I felt bad for her.

332
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,600
What's with you?

333
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,040
I hear that you always keep your private
and public lives separated.

334
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,200
She's a part of this family.

335
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,280
I feel a little embarrassed to even
call that a room.

336
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,240
She just lays out a blanket in the
storage room and sleeps.

337
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,520
Did I say anything?

338
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,880
Why do you keep trying to explain?
It's getting suspicious.

339
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,440
What do you mean 'it's suspicious'?

340
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,720
Why are you here this morning anyway?

341
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,280
Just because, I was buying coffee nearby
and saw that cake you like.

342
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,440
I should just take it back.

343
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,880
-You were already eating it.
-No, don't.

344
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
Leave it. I'm grateful for it.

345
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,960
I eat bread for all three meals.

346
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,800
-Hello.
-Hi.

347
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,320
We'll step out for ten minutes, Chef.

348
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,320
-Yes, enjoy your conversation.
-Why? Where?

349
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,160
Stop going overboard.

350
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,960
We can step outside and exercise.

351
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,520
Or play hopscotch.

352
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,800
-We're interrupting something nice here.
-Be quiet!

353
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,680
-Go on in and prepare for the opening.
-Should we?

354
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,880
Enjoy.

355
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,760
I should get going.
I have to get to the station.

356
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,080
Okay.

357
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
I'll enjoy the cake.

358
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,840
You really are the best. Thanks.

359
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,160
-Oh yeah. I'll be going.
-Okay. Bye.

360
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,320
Bye.

361
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,040
So, that's the PD Lee I've heard about?

362
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,600
Ah, is this your first time seeing PD Lee?

363
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,840
It has been a while since she's been here.

364
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,120
She's super modern and trendy.

365
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,800
Is it because she's a Seoul woman?

366
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,720
Imagine if she were standing there
saying...

367
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,640
"Shoot" and "cut"...
I would be so excited.

368
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,560
You'd be excited by that?

369
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,160
Women need to have things like...

370
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,960
"Oh, honey"... A cuteness like that.

371
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,800
No, you're wrong.
There're too many of those women around.

372
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,480
A woman should be cool and modern.

373
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,080
I find career women sexy.

374
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,280
I think they'd lead well in bed at night.

375
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,520
Oh, stop it! I'm having fantasies
first thing in the morning.

376
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,200
Fantasizing is good. Fantasizing and...

377
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,560
Hey,

378
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
-you know fantasies?
-Yeah?

379
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,640
-For guys...
-Yes?

380
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
It's something all single guys or
lonely men need.

381
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,600
-That's true, that's true.
-Do you know what my favorite fantasy is?

382
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,800
-What is it?
-What?

383
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,560
You go over there.

384
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,680
What is it?

385
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,400
-What is it? What?
-Here...

386
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,920
Stay there, stay. Just a moment.

387
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,520
-Gosh, seriously!
-What are you doing?

388
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,720
-You pervert.
-Pervert!

389
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,320
-Get over here.
-I'm scared!

390
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,760
I don't want to do it.
I said I don't like it.

391
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,240
This is all for your own good.

392
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,200
-You don't have to do it for my own good.
-Come!

393
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,680
Just let me go up my own way.

394
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,840
Goodness, seriously!

395
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,800
Didn't I leave you be this whole time?

396
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,960
Did you resolve your grudge?

397
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,960
You exposed men to severe chills.

398
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,320
So okay.
Say you did find a man of vitality.

399
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,880
Did he say okay and just agree
to do it with you?

400
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,640
You only have months left.
What will you do when that time passes?

401
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,600
You want to become an evil spirit and
fight with me? Is that it?

402
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,720
I'm going to succeed. I will succeed.

403
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,480
It was going well for me.

404
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,920
Don't kid yourself, you wench.

405
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,080
Things aren't that simple and easy.

406
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,800
The world may seem chaotic and lawless

407
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,520
but there are more reasonable
people than not.

408
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,600
Come!

409
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,320
Dear Spirit!

410
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,360
All living things are fated to perish.

411
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:14,280
All things that are born disappear
after death.

412
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,120
But this pitiful soul has lost her way.

413
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,320
I'm afraid. I don't want to do this.

414
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,600
-Please.
-Spirit.

415
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,080
Sis...

416
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,160
A peaceful passage to heaven.

417
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,920
Be granted to this lost soul.

418
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,440
Please take pity!

419
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,280
I don't want this! I don't!

420
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,040
You're so happy.

421
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,760
Hey, PD Lee So-hyung.

422
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,800
You look great from the back.

423
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,840
Why are you acting up first thing in
the morning? Are you frustrated?

424
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,360
No, it's just habit.

425
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,080
When I see sexy women,
I just can't stop talking.

426
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,080
-Isn't this a talent too?
-Be careful.

427
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,880
You'll be sued for sexual harassment.

428
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,240
Oh my my. You're a little harsh today.

429
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,160
You're more charming like that.

430
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,920
Don't be that way.
Meet some guys while you look good.

431
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,600
I have a junior who's a great catch
and he's interested in you.

432
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,360
He's a single guy.

433
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,840
It's okay. I'll decline.

434
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,520
You're at your peak. You should date.

435
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,520
It's not because of Kang Sun-woo, is it?

436
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,680
Is something going on between you two?

437
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,000
Nothing's going on with us.

438
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,960
The crew members were talking about it.

439
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,240
They said the way Kang Sun-woo looked
at you wasn't ordinary.

440
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,160
I heard you two didn't look like
just friends.

441
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,040
No, we are really just friends.

442
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Really?

443
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,960
Then, just do it.
My junior really is a good catch.

444
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,880
What do you think?
Should I go through with it?

445
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,760
I'll think about it.

446
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,920
Gosh, think about it?

447
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,280
Hey, hey, hey.

448
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,480
How about some crab stew and soju
after work today?

449
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,960
I found a great place today.

450
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I have an allergy to crab.

451
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,920
-So itchy, itchy.
-Then, you can sit out.

452
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,000
-How about you?
-My mom suddenly said she's coming.

453
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,880
Your mom? Stop it, stop it.

454
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,080
Didn't your mom come up the day before?

455
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,600
Does your mom go back and forth
or do you have multiple moms?

456
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,560
Did you just say crabs?

457
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,160
-I did say crabs.
-Oh, I have to eat crabs.

458
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,000
My mom probably hasn't left yet.

459
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,080
Wait.

460
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,360
Are you going to keep lying like this?

461
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,960
Why I ought to just...

462
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,840
My knife got damaged because of you!

463
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,040
Isn't that Chef's knife?

464
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,040
It's mine. What are you saying?

465
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,840
I'm ruined. I'm ruined.
He's going to throw a fit.

466
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:32,800
Why did you use Chef's knife?
He hates it when people do that.

467
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,640
I didn't know it was his.
I just grabbed anything.

468
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,640
What should we do?

469
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,360
Darn it...

470
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,240
Hey, Bong Bong Bong.

471
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,440
You keep a lookout to see if Chef's
coming or not.

472
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,120
He's not coming yet.

473
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,440
Just keep looking.

474
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,080
He's... He's coming.

475
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
-Are the crabs fresh?
-Yes, Chef.

476
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,040
Get the dirt off it.

477
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Yes.

478
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,240
What's my knife doing out here?

479
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Did someone use it?

480
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,960
I sharpened it when I was doing mine.

481
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,520
Why the heck would you sharpen my knife?

482
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,480
-It's a bit short.
-There's no way, Chef.

483
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,160
It's about two millimeters short.
Bring me yours to compare, Min-soo.

484
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
Yes, Chef. Can you give me my knife?

485
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,720
Yes.

486
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,040
Why would you do something I didn't
even tell you to do?

487
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,920
Yes, So-hyung?

488
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,760
Gosh, this is brand new.
Why does he have such good eyes?

489
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,640
What is it? Is something up?

490
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,960
We finished editing the last episode
we filmed.

491
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,000
The cut we took between the takes
because of Bong-sun...

492
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,080
I merged them so it's not noticeable.
So don't worry.

493
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,960
What worry...

494
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,760
You called me to report that?

495
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Yup.

496
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,560
And the talk regarding Bong-sun with
the Chief also went well.

497
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
(So don't be concerned.)

498
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,840
Okay, that's good.

499
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,400
Okay. Thank you.

500
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,520
-Talk to you later.
-Sun-woo!

501
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,600
Yeah?

502
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,640
You know that senior of mine you saw
at the studio last time?

503
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,680
He wants to set me up with one of his
juniors who's interested in me.

504
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,600
-Should I do it?
-He's setting you up?

505
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,120
Um, sure. Do it.

506
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,440
You've got nothing to lose by
meeting up with the guy.

507
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,560
-I should?
-Yes, you should.

508
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,800
You talk about it so easily.

509
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,640
You're saying I should, huh?

510
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay, got it. I will.

511
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,880
(I can't die from old age without
even dating.)

512
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,200
(Okay, I'm hanging up now.)

513
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,000
Are you okay?

514
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,080
Does it sting a lot?

515
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,680
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,040
I didn't mean that to happen...

517
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,400
I think I was out of it for a moment then.

518
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,720
I got worked up because
I hated it so much.

519
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,880
It was an evil spirit.

520
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,760
What?

521
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,360
The spirit in your eyes at that moment...
That was an evil spirit.

522
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,240
Evil spirit?

523
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,840
It's been three years since your death...
You only have a few months left, right?

524
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,880
An evil spirit is slowly starting to
manifest in you.

525
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,240
And when you got all worked up,
it came out without your knowledge.

526
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,080
I don't know what's what.

527
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,880
What should I do with you?

528
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,560
Darn...

529
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,600
You want me to taste all of this?

530
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,240
Yes, I put them there for you to taste.

531
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,640
You only used them for cooking.

532
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,920
You never thought about what each
of these taste like, right?

533
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,960
-Yes.
-For example, salt...

534
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,040
Look at the salt. I laid it out here.

535
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,160
The taste is different depending on
region and company.

536
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,800
You have to know this precisely.

537
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,760
So that you can cook to perfection.

538
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,440
Okay.

539
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,840
Ah, salty.

540
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,480
Don't just think it's salty, dummy.

541
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,960
Roll your tongue around slowly.

542
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:48,360
Taste the saltiness, sweetness, and
bitterness.

543
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,360
And even the spiciness.
Try to find them all.

544
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Salt has sweet taste?

545
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,400
Of course.

546
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,480
That's why we're doing this lesson.

547
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,600
-Go on and taste.
-Okay.

548
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,920
If you remember this taste precisely...

549
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:12,440
Then, you'll be able to know exactly
which salt to use while cooking.

550
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,680
Okay.

551
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,320
Olive oil is the same.

552
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,880
Try to figure out when the
oil was extracted.

553
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Okay.

554
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,240
If you perfect your understanding of
ingredients...

555
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,160
No matter when and where you are,

556
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,880
you can make whatever you want.

557
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Here.

558
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,200
What is this, Chef?

559
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,800
Ginger tea.

560
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,560
Drink this after tasting everything.

561
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,400
It'll make you feel better and refresh
your mouth, okay?

562
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,120
Yes.

563
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,960
-Okay.
-Yes, Chef.

564
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,639
I'll head in now.

565
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,600
-Taste it all.
-Okay.

566
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,920
I'm going to ask you about it tomorrow.

567
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,480
Good night, Chef.

568
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,239
-Bong-sun.
-Hello.

569
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,120
You're leaving now?

570
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,240
-Yes.
-It's late.

571
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,800
You must be patrolling.

572
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:03,200
I'm done. I'll head back and sign off now.

573
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
I see.

574
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,640
-Have you had dinner?
-No, not yet.

575
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,240
You must be hungry. Look at the time.

576
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,840
-I'll buy you a nighttime snack.
-What?

577
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,640
No, I'm fine.

578
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,960
Still, you should eat.

579
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,480
It's better than going home and
eating alone.

580
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,320
I just need to go back and
make a quick report.

581
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,720
You know that vendor at the intersection?

582
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,960
-Yes.
-You want to wait there?

583
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,880
See you soon.

584
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,680
Yes, okay...

585
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,120
Why isn't Na Bong-sun reading this?

586
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,800
How busy could she be?

587
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,840
She could be busy.

588
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,720
She's on TV and all that.

589
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,280
She's not even the main.

590
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,680
I thought she said
she'd exercise with you.

591
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,440
A person ought to keep their promises.

592
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,080
You don't play games with elders.

593
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,880
This won't do.

594
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,480
Gosh, she'll come when she comes.

595
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,640
You're the one who wants to see her, huh?

596
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,680
Why would I want to see her?
If she heard that, what would she think?

597
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,480
Hey!

598
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,920
Why aren't you picking up my calls?
Do you know how many times I called?

599
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,440
Me? I think you've got the wrong person.

600
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,160
What... What was that?

601
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
Dad, did she just totally ignore us?

602
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,520
What kind of person does that?

603
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,360
Wow, crazy. This is just crazy!

604
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,200
Wow, this is so wild, right Dad?

605
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,440
Is she crazy or something?
How could she...

606
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,400
Forget the phone thing.
Why did she pretend not to know us?

607
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,880
I suppose she could do that to me.
But, even to you?

608
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,200
It's a waste of electricity.
Turn off that light.

609
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,520
I'm sure she has her reasons.

610
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,240
What reasons could she possibly have?

611
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,000
Bullshit.

612
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,960
That's even too much
for playing hard-to-get.

613
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,280
Is she even doing that to her
future father-in-law?

614
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,520
Her acting was even spot on.
It was so natural.

615
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:13,720
You're right. The expression on her face
was as if she really didn't know us.

616
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
Right, you saw her facial expression?

617
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,280
Should we send her to Hollywood or what?

618
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,960
Gosh, I'm so annoyed!

619
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:25,040
Dad, should we have some soju?
Can you stay sober today?

620
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,760
Forget it, kid. Put it away.

621
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,560
Put it away?

622
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,520
You should order some more.
This seems too little for tent vendors.

623
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,120
Oh no, this is really more than
enough for me.

624
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,560
You really are strange, Bong-sun.

625
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,600
What? What is?

626
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,760
I felt this even before.

627
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,560
You seem like a different person
every time I see you.

628
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,960
You seem very introverted at times.

629
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,200
And at other times,
you seem like a tomboyish girl.

630
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,480
Is it a concept of yours?

631
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,840
No, no. It's nothing like that.

632
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,800
I often have mood swings like that.

633
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,600
And your memory comes and goes, as well?

634
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,840
Pardon?

635
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,160
Last time, you didn't remember
coming to the police station.

636
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,480
That's because I have a tendency to
easily forget things.

637
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,920
I'm sorry.

638
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,320
Sorry, you don't need to explain
yourself to me.

639
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,560
You must feel like you're being
interrogated by me.

640
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,160
No.

641
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,880
I'm just worried about you, Bong-sun.

642
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,520
When I met you early that morning,

643
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,920
you looked like you were in danger.

644
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,520
Like someone standing at the edge of
a cliff.

645
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,960
It didn't feel like it's
happening to a stranger.

646
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,440
I've had several moments like that
in my own life.

647
00:38:58,920 --> 00:38:59,960
Well...

648
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,680
Actually...

649
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,320
Never mind. It's nothing.

650
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,520
Yes. It is nothing.

651
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,520
If you say it's nothing,
then it must be nothing.

652
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,440
-Please eat.
-Okay.

653
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,280
-Bon appetit.
-Yes, you too.

654
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,120
Why is she so quiet?

655
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,840
Is she sleeping already?

656
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
What is it?

657
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,200
(It's been a while since your mom called
and that's how you talk to me?)

658
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,560
("What is it?")

659
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,720
It's because it's so sudden,
I'm just taken aback.

660
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,920
Why? Is something going on?

661
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,200
(Yes, there is.)

662
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,080
(I'm sick.)

663
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,640
You're sick? Where?

664
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,160
Mom, are you okay?

665
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,880
You're here, Son? Come in, come in!

666
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
You came right on time.

667
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,800
What is this? I thought you were in bed.

668
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,960
Yesterday night, I took some medicine.

669
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,880
And I had a good night of rest and
now I'm all better.

670
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,600
My body has such good absorbing power.

671
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,640
It takes in alcohol
and medicine very well.

672
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,240
You lied about being sick.

673
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,760
-You lost weight. Are you dieting?
-My goodness.

674
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,360
-Sun-woo, you're here.
-You're here.

675
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,840
Yeah, I was fooled by Mom.

676
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,800
Her acting has really gotten quite good.

677
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,400
Be quiet and eat.

678
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,760
I worked so hard because you said
you were coming.

679
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,440
Go on and eat.
I put my care and effort into it.

680
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,440
It's not like it's something great.

681
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:51,040
You actually burned this?
You're driving me crazy.

682
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,600
It's hard to get toast wrong.
You're amazing.

683
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,160
What? It's not that burnt!

684
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,600
This is your career, so it's easy for you.

685
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,600
Making bean sprouts is harder than
getting my Ph.D.

686
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,320
Well, now...

687
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Well, it's better than last time.

688
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,720
-Yeah, better than...
-Don't even bring up last time.

689
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,280
Sun-woo, when are you going on vacation
for your restaurant again?

690
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
I'm planning on next week. Why?

691
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,760
You know, this year...

692
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,360
You have to be careful of water too.

693
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:33,640
Oh right!

694
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,880
Do you wear that talisman underwear
that I got you early this year?

695
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:40,480
-You have to wear them. Let's see.
-Why would I? What are you doing?

696
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,520
Where do you think you're looking,
Professor Lee?

697
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,280
What's the big deal? I'm your mom.

698
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,960
-Gosh
-If it makes you feel better,

699
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,360
you can see mine.

700
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,480
-No, no! I don't want to.
-You can see them.

701
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,920
-Forget it! No.
-Now, let's see yours.

702
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,240
I'm not looking at yours. No!

703
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,760
-Something's very fishy here.
-I'm not going to look!

704
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,040
You're not wearing them, are you?

705
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,960
-What's wrong with you?
-You're not wearing them.

706
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,800
-Do you know how much they are?
-No, wait.

707
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,840
-Wait, hold on.
-They cost 200,000 won.

708
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,600
-Don't look.
-This is weird.

709
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,600
I don't even have food at home.
Where's all this food garbage coming from?

710
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
Seobinggo.

711
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,560
What?

712
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,040
Don't call my name. Just say it.

713
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm too tired to respond.

714
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,680
If I stay here like this...

715
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,320
Will I really become an evil spirit?

716
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,320
Yes, you will.

717
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,920
What could you do about it?

718
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,800
I'm scared.

719
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,600
I'm scared of the memorial rites and
don't like that either.

720
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,640
But, I'm more scared of becoming an
evil spirit.

721
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:52,920
I didn't realize three years would pass
so soon.

722
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,800
If you had just listened and passed on
when I told you to

723
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,560
things wouldn't be so twisted like they
are now.

724
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,200
No kids turn out well
if they don't listen to elders.

725
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,840
Gosh, it hurts.

726
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,880
Maybe I need to sterilize this again.

727
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,480
Are you in pain?

728
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,520
Do you have any soju left?
Soju is best for sterilizing.

729
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,400
I know that too. Stop showing off.

730
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,560
Goodness.

731
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,720
I know I put some back here somewhere.

732
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,760
I have some left.

733
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,600
Is it here?

734
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,760
I know it's here. Where is it?

735
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,040
Gosh, I just keep forgetting where I
put my stuff.

736
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,280
Am I doing the right thing here?

737
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,960
I guess I developed some affection
for her, while hating on her.

738
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:00,720
I just don't know anymore.

739
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,080
Who cares about whose son he is?

740
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:11,560
Please, resolve your grudge...
You poor thing.

741
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,560
What's this situation here?

742
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,400
Even just yesterday, wasn't she having
a nice time with Chef?

743
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,840
Yeah, that's what I thought.

744
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,480
It's probably not what we thought.

745
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:42,200
If it were, is she crazy?
Why would she bring a guy here?

746
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,360
We don't know. It could be to provoke
jealousy.

747
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,120
Anyway, the mood is strange.

748
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,000
It seems like Chef is trying control
his facial expression.

749
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:55,040
Why is PD Lee hanging out with a
guy like that?

750
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,840
Even in my eyes, he's tacky.

751
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,560
He's just not at the level of our goddess.

752
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,880
Who does their hair like that these days?

753
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:08,920
Gosh...

754
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,240
What do you mean, goddess?

755
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,400
You can find women like that like
all over Kyungri-dan.

756
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,760
What Kyungri-dan?

757
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:19,480
Kyungri-dan, the street.

758
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,120
-You mean that really trendy street?
-Yeah.

759
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,600
Aren't you guys going to work?

760
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,040
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef. Sorry.

761
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,280
-Should I cook all the food?
-Sorry, Chef.

762
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,560
-Hey, Min-soo.
-Yes, Chef.

763
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,000
Take over. I'm going to the restroom.

764
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,560
-Oh, he's in a bad mood. He is.
-Yeah, he is.

765
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,040
-Going to the restroom?
-No, I'm waiting for you.

766
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:53,480
Huh?

767
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,560
What do you think of him?

768
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,200
Well, I don't really know.
He looks okay, like an honest guy.

769
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,360
Is that all?

770
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,520
Since he was introduced to you,
he probably has a good background.

771
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,280
You should keep meeting him.
It might not be so bad.

772
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,960
I should meet him, continuously?

773
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,720
As long as you're okay with it.
You can't tell with one date.

774
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,400
You really don't care at all, do you?

775
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,400
I'm suddenly really annoyed.

776
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,960
I'm the only one who does care.

777
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,960
Forget it. I don't know why
I'm acting like this.

778
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:46,720
Let's give it a rest.

779
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,840
Where should we have coffee?

780
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,560
-I know a great place...
-The thing is...

781
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,040
I'm really sorry.

782
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,560
I think I have to head back in.

783
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:10,960
What?

784
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:13,320
Sorry. I have editing left to do.

785
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Thank you for today.
The meal was very good.

786
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,320
Then...

787
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,320
(You really don't care at all, do you?)

788
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,080
I'm suddenly really annoyed.

789
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,680
I'm the only one who does care.

790
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,080
I don't like the memorial ritual and
I hate becoming an evil spirit.

791
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,840
I'm going to resolve my grudge on my own
and then go up.

792
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,040
That's what I'll do.

793
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,960
-Hey, Na Bong-sun.
-Grandma!

794
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,200
Why are you so shocked?
Shouldn't you expect me by now?

795
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,360
This isn't what's important right now.
I have no time! I'm in a rush.

796
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,160
-What do you mean?
-I have no time for your permission.

797
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,840
-I'll go in now, okay.
-Are you crazy?

798
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,440
I have no more time.
I'm going to become an evil spirit.

799
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,720
Na Bong-sun!

800
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,320
-Hey!
-No!

801
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,920
Hey, you!

802
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,240
Will you take responsibility if I turn
into an evil spirit?

803
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,200
Why should I? I don't know anything
about evil spirits.

804
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,720
You can't say that.

805
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,760
You have a responsibility as a
resident of Seoul.

806
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,440
If you knew how awful some spirits were,
you wouldn't say that.

807
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,360
Wait now, I'm not technically a
Seoul resident.

808
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,720
I'm from Choongchun.

809
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,120
Yeah, we're all the same Koreans.

810
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,360
I don't know. I don't know.

811
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,000
Hey, Choongchun resident.
I don't know. I'm coming in.

812
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,200
No, you can't!

813
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,880
No!

814
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,880
Hey, stop!

815
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,800
Oh, stop running.

816
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,440
Get over here.

817
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:52,600
It's been a while since
I felt competitive.

818
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,640
I'm pretty athletic.

819
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:55,680
Grandma!

820
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,560
-Oh, is that Chef Kang?
-Don't look.

821
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,040
-What's he doing there?
-It's nothing.

822
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,000
Wait, you're not...

823
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,240
I'm not.

824
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,320
What's not?

825
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,320
Everything is not true.

826
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,480
Aw, you don't by chance...

827
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,080
I don't.

828
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:26,440
Really?

829
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,760
Since when?
Did you like him this whole time?

830
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,720
By yourself? One-sided?

831
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,480
You sure are something.

832
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,400
That's why you stuck around even
though you were picked on.

833
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,840
Yeah, I get it now.

834
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,560
Usually, I'm the expert in one-sided love.

835
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,760
Hey, Na Bong-sun.

836
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,760
This all works out.

837
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,480
Since things worked out this way,
let's mutually help each other.

838
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,920
Kang Sun-woo, that self-centered man...

839
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,120
I'll make him your man.

840
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,480
What do you mean by that?

841
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,320
With your personality,
you'll never be able to seduce Chef.

842
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,560
And I don't see Chef looking
your way first.

843
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,240
I'll get him for you, in your place.

844
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,600
-Why?
-What do you mean? I'm a virgin ghost.

845
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,560
In order to resolve my grudge,
I need a man of vitality.

846
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,120
Chef is that man of vitality.

847
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:34,440
So, I'll resolve my grudge and
leave this place.

848
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:38,240
You can be with Chef and
it'll be win-win for both of us.

849
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,920
Still, that's not...

850
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,720
What's wrong with that?
You're so frustrating!

851
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,560
Do you know who Chef Kang likes?

852
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,480
He likes PD Lee. Since very long ago.

853
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,240
PD Lee is single and it's only a matter
of time before they hook up.

854
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,720
One mistake, and Chef Kang can disappear.

855
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,880
No, we can't have that, no.

856
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,800
And I'm just saying this now...

857
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,840
But, isn't it because of me that
you're next to Chef Kang now?

858
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,680
You know what I'm like, don't you?
I'll stick to people, no matter what.

859
00:51:12,120 --> 00:51:14,520
If you try ten times,
every guy can be won over.

860
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,200
Also, Chef has been taking care of you
a lot lately.

861
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,400
Still...

862
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,680
Still, that's not right.

863
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,920
I don't want Chef like that.

864
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,080
Why not?

865
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,480
Do you dislike that I'm resolving
my grudge using your body?

866
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,160
This is no time for you to be picky.

867
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,160
You have to make Chef Kang your man.

868
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,720
No, it's not right. What's wrong is wrong.

869
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,200
Na Bong-sun. Hey, Na...

870
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,040
Na Bong-sun.

871
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,960
Oh, crap.

872
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:51,720
If it were me, I'd say, "Yes I like."
And agree right away.

873
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,960
She is so subtly conservative!

874
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,640
I'm so hungry, I can't even pray long.

875
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:07,480
Gosh...

876
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,160
There's three left.

877
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,880
I have to last the week with this.

878
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,880
I'll eat half.

879
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,000
Gosh, why is she calling again?

880
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:31,760
I can't see her for now since
I sent that ghost to her son.

881
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,600
Yeah, it's me.

882
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,920
Honey, what are you doing?

883
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:43,560
Oh, I'm just doing nothing. Why?

884
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,040
I wanted to have pork ribs and soju.

885
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,480
(But, I didn't want to eat alone.)

886
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,080
Pork ribs.

887
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:57,520
But, what can I do?
I'm coming down with a cold.

888
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,280
I think I need to rest today.

889
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,440
Oh yeah? That's too bad.

890
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,520
I wanted to see you today.

891
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,800
(Okay. Take good care of yourself.
I'll call again soon.)

892
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,400
(-Bye.)
-Bye. Okay.

893
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:20,480
I'm so hungry, but I can't get
a free meal. This is just terrible.

894
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,560
Out of so many men, why does Kang Sun-woo
have to be the man of vitality?

895
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,120
Gosh, that cursed wench.

896
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,520
Is she working on her virgin grudge
or what?

897
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,920
Goodness,

898
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,600
there are no stars in the sky tonight.

899
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,360
You're right. It's really dark.

900
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,960
It's dark in my heart too.

901
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,080
If three years pass and I become
an evil spirit

902
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,440
I won't be able to recognize you dad.
What should I do?

903
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,240
So hot.

904
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,040
Will the fall season ever come?

905
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,360
That fall season scares me, dad.

906
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,440
How did I come to roam around here
when others got to go to the heavens?

907
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,440
Not like virginity is a huge grudge.

908
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,400
Now, tomatoes.
Try cutting out the stem ends first.

909
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,760
Yes, Chef.

910
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:30,400
Stop! Stop.

911
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,640
Tomatoes are soft.

912
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,840
If you hold the knife like that,
it'll go through the tomato.

913
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,160
And where would it hurt?

914
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,120
-Your left hand, right?
-Yes.

915
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,400
Here. Hold the knife.

916
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,680
-Don't hold the end.
-Okay.

917
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:47,320
In cases like this,
you need to hold the spine.

918
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,240
-Like this.
-Okay.

919
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,000
Hold my hand as if you're holding
the knife.

920
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,200
Go ahead. Hold it.

921
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,920
That's it. Hold still.

922
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,520
And then use your left hand
to turn the tomato.

923
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,760
-Okay?
-Okay.

924
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,280
If you know how to use the knife well,
that's 50% of cooking skills.

925
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,120
Okay, that'll be all for today.

926
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,560
-Clean up.
-Yes, Chef.

927
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,440
Go on in.

928
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,480
What's this?

929
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,520
So-hyung?

930
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,720
It's Kang Sun-woo.

931
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,440
Oh, okay, okay.

932
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,960
Hey... Did you have a lot to drink?

933
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,280
You drank with that guy till now?

934
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,280
Nope, I drank alone.

935
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,520
I was upset,
so I just had drinks by myself.

936
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,480
I'm just not in a good mood today.
For various reasons.

937
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,240
Woah, hey...

938
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,280
-You're quite drunk. I'll take you home.
-No, no.

939
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
Wait.

940
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,680
I didn't come here to ask you
to take me home.

941
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,240
Since I already embarrassed myself,
let me ask you one more question.

942
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,320
Are you really okay with it?

943
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,880
Even when I'm with some other man?

944
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,960
As for me, when you worry about
that nobody, kitchen assistant...

945
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,560
Just watching you being concerned
about her... Makes me get all jealous.

946
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,400
You are not like that?

947
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,440
You don't get like that at all?

948
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,680
Why are you like this all of a sudden,
So-hyung?

949
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,640
You're right.

950
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,080
That's what makes me upset.

951
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,880
Why am I like this all of a sudden?

952
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,040
But, let's just forget about me,
for a second.

953
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,960
What about you?

954
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,360
You don't see me as just a friend, right?

955
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,920
Right?

956
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,360
So-hyung...

957
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,080
I don't know why living is so difficult.

958
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,200
When I was alive, it was difficult.
And now when I'm dead, it's difficult.

959
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,480
What kind of life is this?

960
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,320
What is so difficult?
You even found a man of vitality.

961
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,560
No progress whatsoever since the kiss?

962
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,600
Oh, hey, you don't have much time left.

963
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,800
You should skip some bases
and just go for it.

964
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:33,800
You know, when guys are coming down
the stairs, if a girl jumps up to them...

965
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,120
They really fall for that.

966
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:37,520
It's all useless.

967
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,040
I can't possess the girl that
the man of vitality likes.

968
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:46,720
And the one I can potentially possess
resists saying I can never use her body.

969
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,160
So, are you giving up?

970
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,040
I don't know.

971
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:56,640
Maybe I should.

972
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,560
I really wanted to do it once.

973
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,840
Something so easy for others...
Why is it so hard for me?

974
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,160
-Even after I died...
-Hey...

975
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:19,080
Even when you're alive, you can't control
your life. What do you expect?

976
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,560
If it's too much to bear,
just ask Suhbingo to send you off.

977
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:25,240
It's better than being an evil spirit.

978
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:27,680
Memorial rite for the dead...

979
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,400
It'll probably hurt like heck, right?

980
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,400
Maybe as painful as urolithiasis?

981
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:40,120
Not sure. I heard that giving birth
is less painful.

982
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,600
It's nice to meet you all.
I'm Na Bong-sun.

983
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,080
Do you know who Chef Kang likes?

984
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:34,960
(He likes PD Lee. Since very long ago.)

985
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:39,560
(One mistake, and Chef Kang can disappear.
No we can't have that, no.)

986
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,680
Hey, ghost! I have something to say.

987
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,880
Why isn't she here when I look for her?

988
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,000
Hey!

989
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,680
I really need to talk to you.

990
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,320
Where did she go? Hey!

991
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,200
Hey, ghost!

992
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,720
Darn it. I don't know what to do...

993
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,400
Ascend through the rite for the dead,
or become an evil spirit...

994
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,640
Something will happen. Gosh, darn it!

995
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,520
What the...

996
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,840
It's Na Bong-sun!

997
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,320
I went around looking for you.

998
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,160
Me? You've been looking for me?

999
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,600
You... I've been looking for you
for a while.

1000
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,480
I mean why? Didn't you shoot fires at me
and tell me to go away the other day?

1001
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,840
I wonder why you came to see me,
Na Bong-sun, the most conservative ever?

1002
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,680
I'll allow it. You taking over my body.

1003
01:01:58,240 --> 01:01:59,280
Huh?

1004
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,280
You can possess me.

1005
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,040
Make Chef Kang mine.

1006
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,280
OH MY GHOST

1007
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,240
I feel greed. For you, Chef.

1008
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,680
-Fighting!
-Fighting!

1009
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,920
As a team-building event, I was
thinking we can go on a trip together...

1010
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,280
Suddenly, attack!

1011
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,480
(I don't think he should be allowed
to drink too much.)

1012
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,120
If we are going to have something
between us.

1013
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,480
It's out of our hands, right?
Catching the hit and run offender.

1014
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:53,000
You should forget that incident.
I'm here for Eun-hee.

1015
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,200
Why is another girl inside that girl?

1016
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,160
What do you mean?
I have no idea what you're saying.

1017
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:01,840
(The way you are setting boundaries
between us.)

1018
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,600
(Is Bong-sun related?)
