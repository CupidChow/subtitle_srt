1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,440
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,960
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,960
-We're here.
-Yes.

4
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,240
Wait, wait.

5
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,080
Can't we just stay like this
for a little bit?

6
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,920
We can sit over here.

7
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
Okay.

8
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,240
Do you like this?

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes.

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,680
I do like this.

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,720
What did I say?
Even holding hands is so nice.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,480
I want to take things slowly
with you like this.

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,560
No matter how tasty a food is, you'll
get indigestion if you eat it too fast.

14
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,280
Getting indigestion of the heart
is much scarier

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,960
than indigestion of the body, okay?

16
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,600
But, the thing is...

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,280
Time...

18
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,479
What if I don't have much time?

19
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,280
Why wouldn't you have time?

20
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,080
It's not like you're going to die
tomorrow.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,920
You're just saying that because
you have nothing else to say.

22
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,600
What is it?
You want to scold me again, huh?

23
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,160
I do really want to scold you.

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,960
This won't do. Let's just go inside.

25
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,760
Wait, just five more minutes.

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,240
-No, not even five minutes.
-Then, one more minute.

27
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,440
One more minute...
I'll stay for one more minute.

28
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
Yeah.

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,360
No, I didn't drink at all.

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,720
I'm just bringing some cream buns
for your brother.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,760
These have always been his favorite.

32
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,079
I don't know.
Maybe he'll be annoyed I came.

33
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll be there after I drop these off.
Okay.

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,280
All right, All right!

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,240
Now, I'm all nervous.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,360
He's not even like a son.
It's as if he's a king.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Look at you smiling just because
we're holding hands.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,720
Do you like me that much?

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,520
Yes, I like you.

40
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,280
Chef, your hand is so warm.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,720
No, mine isn't that warm.
Yours is just cold.

42
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Why is your hand so cold anyway?
Is the blood not flowing properly?

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,160
Do I have to feed you goji berry tea
or something?

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,400
Oh my! Why is it so dark here?

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,720
Hand, hand...

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,640
-Sun-woo.
-Hello.

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,760
Oh, you were out here.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,160
What are you doing here, at this hour?

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,680
I was at Taesungran and I remembered
that you liked the cream buns there.

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,200
But, why is Bong-sook here so late?

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
Oh, I'm Bong-sun, not Bong-sook.

52
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,960
Is that right? Whatever the case...

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,720
What were you two doing at this late hour?

54
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,079
I sent you on an errand, right?

55
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,280
It's all good. You can go.

56
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,280
-What... What?
-You can go home now.

57
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Oh, yes! I'll be going now. Goodbye.

58
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,960
Goodness.

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,280
I sent her on an errand and
she'd been looking for it this whole time.

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,680
She's not very resourceful.

61
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,520
Why? What is it?

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,800
-Are you desperate these days?
-What?

63
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,200
Otherwise, I don't understand the level
that girl and the size...

64
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,120
Don't even try to lie
your way out of this.

65
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,120
I may not be able to figure out when
my students fake their attendance.

66
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,360
But, one thing I always know is who is
dating whom.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,400
I'm a black belt holder in that area.

68
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,960
You two have something going on, right?

69
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,760
What kind of something?
What are you talking about...

70
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,360
Wow, I haven't had these cream buns
in a long time.

71
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,159
Look at you changing the topic.

72
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,840
What's up with this dog?

73
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,760
You are using contraception, aren't you?

74
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,280
Son, you have to use contraception.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,680
-Mom!
-You're not?

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Gosh, seriously.

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,720
Oh gosh!

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,920
Oh my goodness.

79
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,240
It's not like I did anything wrong.
Why is my heart pounding so much?

80
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,960
Is it because of that lady or is it...

81
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,320
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 10

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,200
Do you know how scary young people
are nowadays?

83
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,720
If things go awry with an employee and
she gets vengeful with you...

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,480
there is no solution to that.

85
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
It's not like that, Mom. It's not.

86
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,840
Okay, if you say so, then fine.

87
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,200
It's not just because I say so.
It really isn't like that.

88
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,320
I said, okay.

89
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,120
Work is so difficult for you.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,480
I suppose a young man needs an
outlet of some sort.

91
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,880
It's not good if you abstain too much.

92
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,840
But, your fortune isn't good this year.

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,640
-So, make sure to use contraception.
-Mom, please!

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,720
Do you really want to talk about
these things with your son?

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
I don't see why we can't.

96
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,760
It's much better than an accident
occurring.

97
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,760
Just go, Mom. You're giving me a headache.

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,040
All right, I'm going.
I'll go even if you stop me.

99
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,640
Don't go assuming things on your own.

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,440
Okay, fine!

101
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,120
Both you and Eun-hee are nagging me
more and more lately.

102
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,280
When you were young,
you were both too quiet.

103
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,320
Good night, you rascal.

104
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,320
Bye.

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm going. I'm going now!

106
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,880
I'm going!

107
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
BONG-SUN

108
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,720
(Mom has left.)

109
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,680
(I'll be there as fast as a bullet.
Whoosh.)

110
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Whoosh?

111
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,480
When did she get so cute?

112
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Chef!

113
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,760
Oh, you scared me!

114
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,320
What about your mom?
Did she think the situation was odd?

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,040
Of course, she thought it was very odd.

116
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,320
You're always very odd.
And everyone can see it.

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
I talked to her. Don't worry too much.

118
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,240
That's a relief.

119
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,440
Let's go in and rest now.

120
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
You must be tired from partying with
those guys.

121
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,400
I slept at the motel so I'm fine.

122
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,320
Ah, suddenly I'm getting upset again.

123
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,720
From now on, don't even say 'mo'
in front of me again.

124
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,880
-Okay... Motel.
-Hey now!

125
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,600
Get up! I'll take you home.

126
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,240
Where do you live?

127
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
-Over there.
-Okay.

128
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,200
-You're taking me home?
-Yes.

129
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,800
Here.

130
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,520
We're here.

131
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,080
-Goodbye then.
-I'll take you home now.

132
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:55,480
No, guys are supposed to take girls home.

133
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,520
-No, I want to. I want to.
-Come on,

134
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,480
do you want to stay up all night?

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,800
Go back down.

136
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,040
Then let's count one, two, three and
go inside, okay?

137
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,440
-Okay.
-What is this?

138
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,320
One, two, three.

139
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,160
Hey, look at you.

140
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,000
Okay... One, two, three.

141
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,360
-Good night!
-All right.

142
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,640
She's cute.

143
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,120
Good night, Na Bong-sun.

144
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,920
-I'm home.
-You are back early.

145
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,280
Did Sun-woo tell you to leave?

146
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,520
Do you think he'd welcome me with
open arms?

147
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,640
-Gosh.
-Sun-woo does like you.

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,799
He's like that because he's not used to
being affectionate.

149
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,559
I know that. He is my son, after all.

150
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,320
-Oh, right. Eun-hee.
-Yes?

151
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,800
You know that girl who works as an
Assistant Cook at the restaurant...

152
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,480
Bong-sook or something?

153
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,880
-Bong-sun.
-Whatever her name is.

154
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,960
What is she like?

155
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,040
Does she date around a lot?

156
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,760
Oh no! She's not like that at all.

157
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,360
She's well-behaved,
unlike kids these days.

158
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,920
Well-behaved?

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,360
With any more of that well-behaving,
she'll get all men.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,160
You need to be a
better judge of character.

161
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,720
Don't always see the good in people.

162
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,880
I'm going to go wash up.

163
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,960
Why's everyone curious about Bong-sun
these days?

164
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,640
What am I thinking?
Liking him for real when I'm just a ghost.

165
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
I'm seriously insane.

166
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Well,

167
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
I'm just experiencing the feelings
that come with dating.

168
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,360
Can't I even do that?

169
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,800
What are you doing over there?

170
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,640
Oh, I was just bored.
I'm just visiting here and there.

171
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,760
Okay.

172
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
Why? You can't fall asleep?

173
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,040
No, I was just thirsty.

174
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,120
I don't see ghosts these days.

175
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,960
So, I think I get some sleep these days.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,280
-Oh yeah?
-Yes.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,040
It's thanks to you, Sis.

178
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,960
That makes me feel strange.
Hearing you call me Sis.

179
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,360
Right? I think so too.

180
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,080
I never thought I'd be calling a
ghost, Sis.

181
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,480
Why are you talking to yourself
in the middle of the night?

182
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,520
What?

183
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,360
It's nothing.

184
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,600
-You can't sleep?
-What?

185
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,960
-Because it's too hot?
-Huh? Yes.

186
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,280
I guess I got no choice. Wait.

187
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Come over here.

188
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,680
-Huh?
-Get in here.

189
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,600
-Okay, sit.
-Okay.

190
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,440
Okay. Good thing I didn't throw this away.
Now there's a use for it.

191
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,560
Goodness.

192
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,120
If you sleep with this on,
it'll be better.

193
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,440
Okay.

194
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,480
And make sure to leave the
door open when you sleep.

195
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,920
Otherwise, you might suffocate. Okay?

196
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,520
Yes, Chef.

197
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,600
Okay. All set.

198
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,600
-Should we turn it on?
-Yes.

199
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,400
The air doesn't feel cool.
What's wrong with this?

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,720
What the... Why is it acting up?

201
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Why?

202
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,400
I think this propeller is on backward.

203
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,560
I put it on backward... Did you know?

204
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,120
-And you didn't say anything?
-No, I...

205
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
I noticed it now. Sorry.

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,720
I'm not incompetent when it comes
to machinery.

207
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,080
But, I'm a bit out of it since I just
got up.

208
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,440
-Okay.
-It was backward.

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,560
There we go. It's done.

210
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,480
That feels cool.

211
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,200
You're sweating. Sweat... Here...

212
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
All done.

213
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,640
It's cool.

214
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,400
Yes.

215
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,160
Why is it already scorching hot?
It's driving me crazy.

216
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,520
Still, it's better to be in the hall.

217
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,880
Just thinking about us working in
the kitchen later...

218
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,200
Ugh, I really hate summer.

219
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,760
Wrestle with the heat and
wrestle with the fire.

220
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,280
We'll most likely almost die today.

221
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,760
It's hotter than 30 degrees Celsius.

222
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,840
Hey, hey, still, there are pros to summer.

223
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,040
While working in the kitchen,
when you look towards the hall...

224
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Girls with short skirts and
their milky white legs...

225
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,960
We need to award those
commendable sisters.

226
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,720
Of course, they provide healing to us.

227
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,760
Be careful. You might get arrested
for sexual harassment.

228
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,040
They're the ones who chose to wear
short skirts. Did we force them?

229
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,600
Hey! Do you guys clean with your mouth?

230
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,480
What a way to start the day. Hurry it up.

231
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,960
Yes, Chef!

232
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,760
Eat this.

233
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,600
-Isn't this fresh ginseng?
-Your fitness is lacking.

234
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,880
Today will be hell.
It's hot and we have so many reservations.

235
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,920
Before you get exhausted, eat this.
Think of it as vitamins.

236
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm not the only one who'll have a
hard time. Chef, let's eat it together.

237
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,760
No, no. I have a lot of body heat,
so I'm okay. You eat.

238
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,840
But honestly, more so than the ginseng,
this is like tonic medicine to me.

239
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,640
-This is so nice.
-Why is she being so cheesy?

240
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,920
I really like this.

241
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,800
-Hey, Na Bong-sun?
-Yes?

242
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,080
-How many bottles of olive oil... Two...
-You got a call.

243
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,560
Someone's asking for you.

244
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,320
Me? Who?

245
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,440
I wonder who.

246
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
We are not missing two, are we?

247
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,160
I guess that tally is right.

248
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,080
Six.

249
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,560
Oh, it's bitter.

250
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,160
-Yes, hello?
(-Bong-sook?)

251
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,120
(This is Cho Hye-young.)

252
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,960
(Don't say a single thing and
answer my question.)

253
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,800
(Tell me your birthday and time of birth.)

254
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,520
Who is this again?

255
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,560
I told you not to ask questions.
Answer me.

256
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
I was born on April 14, 1984 at 2 a.m.

257
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,920
But, who are you? Hello?

258
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,000
What the heck? Oh my...

259
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,840
I accidentally told her my birthday.

260
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,080
This person is dead.

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,440
What are you talking about?
She's alive and well.

262
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,120
I'm telling you she's not.

263
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,520
Her life ended when she was young.

264
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,240
Who is she anyway?

265
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,200
That's strange.

266
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,960
This is Bong-sook or something.

267
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,400
She's someone who works at my son's
restaurant.

268
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,920
This pen hasn't been working all day.

269
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,440
Where did I leave that other pen?
Why are you asking about her?

270
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,040
Actually, I bought some cream buns that my
son likes and went to visit him.

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,680
It was very late at night and
my son was there with that girl!

272
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,600
Really? And what were they doing?

273
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,760
What do you think?

274
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,520
-Perhaps...
-They were on the wooden bench...

275
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,520
-On the wooden bench?
-Stuck together...

276
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,040
They were conversing.

277
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,920
Oh, they were conversing.

278
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,280
But, as soon as he saw me,
he started saying gibberish.

279
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,640
So, how could I not be suspicious?

280
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm 100 percent accurate with my feeling
when it comes to that stuff.

281
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,640
No matter how much I think about it,
it's very suspicious.

282
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,360
Do you think she's the dead field
of flowers that I saw in my dream?

283
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,080
Look at one more for me.

284
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,840
How's this one?
I looked into this one long ago.

285
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,560
Look at this. How is she, huh?

286
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,280
Oh...

287
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,520
She's had a separation in the past.

288
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,119
But, she's very loyal and
works hard at life.

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,560
Once the dark clouds are gone,
she'll have rainbows in her life.

290
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,880
-Yeah?
-Yes,

291
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,480
she'll meet her destined match and
lead a good life after a misfortune.

292
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,240
Who is this anyway?

293
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,800
It's just someone my son insists
is just a friend.

294
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,920
You're busy, aren't you?

295
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,960
You're at that age when you're so pretty,
but you just work all the time.

296
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,520
When do you get time to date?

297
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,840
Shouldn't you get married?
Are you going to live alone forever?

298
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,440
You're right. I'm a little pitiful, right?

299
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,840
You're not dating anyone?

300
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,800
No, not yet.

301
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,560
All the men at the station must be blind.

302
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,280
Or maybe it's because
you're a bit stuck up

303
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,760
so men feel insecure around you?

304
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:19,360
Honestly, women need to be a bit of
an airhead to get men more easily.

305
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080
I know a thing or two about dating.

306
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,360
I should learn from you then, Professor.

307
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,480
You should.

308
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,520
What kind of guys do you like, PD Lee?

309
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,640
For example...

310
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,280
Is my Sun-woo not your type?

311
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,480
His personality is a bit picky,
but he's a very honest guy.

312
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
I know that.

313
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,320
But, Sun-woo doesn't view me as a woman.

314
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,320
What about you? Do you view him as a man?

315
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Of course. He's attractive.

316
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,960
Women are usually weak to guys like that.

317
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,160
That's what I'm saying.

318
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,400
So, you're saying you do have some
interest in Sun-woo?

319
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,600
It's my Sun-woo who's not taking charge

320
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,080
and revving up the engine
like a man, right?

321
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,240
Okay, so that's how it is.

322
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,200
-Hello!
-I'm here.

323
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,840
-Hello.
-Hi everyone!

324
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,600
You should get going. You'll be late.

325
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
Okay, but where's brother-in-law?

326
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,520
I should say hello.

327
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,640
Oh, you're here?

328
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,640
Officer Choi!

329
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,480
-Bong-sun.
-Hello.

330
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,440
Oh, hey.

331
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,640
-Hi, Brother-in-law.
-Do you want a cold drink?

332
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,040
No, I need to run.

333
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,880
You should stay for a drink.
Are you all right?

334
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,240
What?

335
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,960
Yes, I'm fine.

336
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,360
Your shoelaces are tied in a strange way.

337
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,520
Oh this? You know Bong-sun from
the restaurant?

338
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,960
She tied it for me.

339
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,240
PERSONAL INFORMATION

340
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,680
Hey Cordon, aren't you hungry?

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,560
Do you want some of this seafood stir-fry?

342
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,880
What?

343
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,120
I had some ingredients left so I made some
and it doesn't taste bad.

344
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,560
Bring your chopsticks over here.

345
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,680
You were fooled, weren't you?

346
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,520
You really thought it was
seafood stir-fry, right?

347
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,200
Oh, I'm dizzy.

348
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,360
Gosh, that dumb punk.

349
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,360
Don't they teach this at Le Cordon Bleu?

350
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,560
Should I make you spicy seafood stew
with the rest of this?

351
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,720
I'm being serious when I ask this.

352
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,960
Isn't he getting more immature?

353
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,840
He's not even elementary school level.
Maybe kindergarten.

354
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,080
Look how bright and innocent he is.

355
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,160
Oh, he's so pure. Look at happy he is.

356
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
I'm going to the market.
Who wants to come?

357
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,440
Cordon... Me.

358
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,560
-We can have a red bean shaved ice too.
-You have to check the ingredients.

359
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,280
Sous chef should be here.

360
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,080
-Then, I'll go...
-Don't you have to marinate the meat?

361
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,840
Today's special is the seasoning steak.

362
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,320
Chef, it's been a while since we...

363
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,720
You have to check on the reservations
and prepare the stock.

364
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,600
Gosh...

365
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
There's no other choice.
Jun has to prepare the noodles.

366
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll have to take the useless Na Bong-sun.
Come on Na Bong-sun.

367
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,840
Oh, that's right.

368
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm the most useless one here.

369
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,240
So, I should go.

370
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
You said not to make it obvious.

371
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
What did I do?

372
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,800
We're just going to the market,
as an official part of the business.

373
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Oh, okay.

374
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,720
Chef, can't you drive with just one hand?

375
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,840
It's really cool when guys do that.

376
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,520
What's so cool about that?

377
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,160
Oh, so this is what you wanted.

378
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,680
You scheme pretty well just to do this.

379
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,280
It's good that you're obsessed with
my hand now.

380
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,040
If you kept asking to do it like before,
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

381
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,360
What are you doing? Focus, would you?

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,920
I just like it.

383
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,480
I like it too.
Just pull yourself together.

384
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,760
As for the mango here...

385
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,880
Press the stem right here and if
it's tender, it means it's already ripe.

386
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,960
And if there's a sweet smell
from the stem, it's a good sign.

387
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
Tender and sweet like you, Chef?

388
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,600
Stop doing that out here.

389
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,880
Oh my, your wife is just full of cuteness.

390
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,840
Your husband has a
good facial physiognomy.

391
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,520
Right? Doesn't my husband have a lucky
looking face?

392
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,880
Of course, I know a lot about physiognomy
from working in this market for so long.

393
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,800
I can tell right away.
It's going to be a daughter.

394
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,320
You're going to have a pretty daughter.

395
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,600
Really? A daughter.

396
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,720
The marital harmony is good too, isn't it?

397
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,360
Oh my goodness!

398
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,160
-We haven't tried yet.
-This lady...

399
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,960
This lady has no limits.

400
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,160
-Mister! You're here to buy groceries?
-Yes.

401
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,720
-You too, Bong-sun?
-Yes, yes.

402
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,720
This is the small restaurant owner
I told you about. This is our chef.

403
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,160
Ah, I see. Oh, you're that famous person.

404
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,960
-It's nice to meet you.
-Oh, thank you.

405
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,120
I heard a lot about you from Bong...
I mean Bong-sun.

406
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,240
I see.

407
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,520
-Oh, give this to me.
-No, no. I'm fine.

408
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,880
-Just give it to me.
-Oh, gosh.

409
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
You're probably still in recovery.

410
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,960
You should've brought Kyung-mo.

411
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,400
No, he just causes more trouble for me.

412
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,200
He complains that it's heavy.

413
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,440
Oh, this won't do. It's too heavy.

414
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,280
-Come in the car with us.
-Oh no!

415
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,440
-I can take the bus.
-No, this is too heavy.

416
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,120
It's fine. We're all in the same area.
Please, get in the car.

417
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,600
-It's okay, right?
-Ah, wait...

418
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,240
Ah yes, well it's not her car.

419
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,200
It's my car, and I was going to
offer you a ride anyway.

420
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,200
-It's on the way, so I'll drive you.
-Oh dear...

421
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,720
-I feel so bad.
-Don't even mention it. Let's go.

422
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:43,320
RESTAURANT

423
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,440
-Here, I'll take it. Give it to me.
-No, I will.

424
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,080
-No, I will.
-No, no! I'll take them!

425
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,160
They're really heavy.

426
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,880
-Go in.
-Yes.

427
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,800
Oh dear.

428
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,160
You drove me all the way home,
but I don't have anything to offer you.

429
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,280
Hold on.

430
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,440
Here's a yogurt. Have this.

431
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,280
Okay, thank you.

432
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,600
Go on, have it.

433
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,680
Ah, yes.

434
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,960
The store is very squalid, isn't it?

435
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,920
I'm sure it doesn't compare to your
restaurant.

436
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,720
Oh no! It's cozy and just right.

437
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
In Seoul, it's all about the older, small
restaurants that are famous for its taste.

438
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,320
It did very well in the past.

439
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,960
After my daughter left,
it's been like this.

440
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,360
Many customers stopped coming.

441
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,840
And your daughter?

442
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,360
She left before us... Three years ago.

443
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,760
Mister!

444
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,040
-Yes.
-I put everything away inside.

445
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,520
-Oh my!
-Oh, be careful.

446
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,760
Oh, I meant to put this away.

447
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,960
Is this a water hose?

448
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,880
Yes, it's hard to clean the floor by
getting water with a bucket.

449
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,760
I was going to try and connect a hose.

450
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,920
It's not so easy though because the
faucet is all the way inside the kitchen.

451
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,840
I see. It would be so much easier to
clean if you did have a hose connected.

452
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,240
You really shouldn't bother.

453
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,240
It's too much work.
I can call someone later.

454
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,000
It should be simple.

455
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,800
Are you sure it's simple?

456
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,360
Sure, I can do this with my eyes closed.

457
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,880
Why don't we just call someone instead
of putting in all this work?

458
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,200
Why waste money on something like that?
I can get it done soon.

459
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,400
-Driver.
-Okay.

460
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,640
Um, I think it's the other way.

461
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,480
The driver was stuck.

462
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,840
It's working so well!

463
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,280
What did I say? I told you it's simple.

464
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,320
Gosh, I put you through so much trouble.
What should I do?

465
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,760
Look at all your sweat. I feel so bad.

466
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,600
I'm not sweating
because it was hard to do.

467
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,720
It's just that it's so hot outside.

468
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,040
I don't have much I can give you.

469
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
Please have a rice meal.
I'll prepare it quickly.

470
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,880
It's okay. I do need to go.

471
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,440
No, please.
It's because I'm so grateful and sorry.

472
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,320
No, Chef doesn't eat rice...

473
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,440
If you prepare it, I'll eat it.

474
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Okay, then. Wait just a bit.

475
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,680
Thank you.

476
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,880
Chef, you don't eat rice.

477
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,680
It's not like I can't eat it.
I just don't eat it.

478
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,840
What is it? Is it not to your taste?

479
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,880
No, that's not it at all.

480
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,320
I was just appreciating it as I ate it.
It's really very good.

481
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,960
Okay, please eat lots.
There's lots of rice.

482
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,440
-You too, Bong-sun.
-Okay.

483
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,760
Na Bong-sun!

484
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,400
Hey, kid. Were you at
the internet cafe again?

485
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,320
Say hello. This, here, is my son.

486
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,840
-We've met before.
-Yes.

487
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,280
What is a star chef like you doing here?

488
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,320
Don't even get me started.

489
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,080
He gave me a ride from the market and
connected the water hose for me.

490
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,040
Maybe it's because he's famous,
but he can do just about everything.

491
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,640
I would've done it anyway, Dad.

492
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,080
Whatever, Kid.

493
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,440
Why are you two together?

494
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
You don't seem like a person that should
be accompanying an assistant cook.

495
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:59,560
I'm not the type who cares about seniority
when it comes to grocery shopping.

496
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,120
You support flat structure
instead of hierarchy?

497
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,320
That's very cool of you. Bravo!

498
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,920
You little punk.

499
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,800
Please, sit over here.

500
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,480
Sun-woo, why were you so late?

501
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,640
-Car broke down.
-There was a car accident.

502
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,360
-There was an accident?
-Yes. Right out front.

503
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,640
-Yes, there was.
-Yes.

504
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,360
Yes, there was an accident.

505
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,640
And what happened?
The roads were backed up.

506
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,720
And right then, my car broke down.
What could I have done but fix it?

507
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,400
-That's what happened. I'll go in now.
-Me too.

508
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,560
Okay, four Shreks.

509
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,000
-And two escargots. Got it?
-Min-soo.

510
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,800
Why are you so late?
We already have guests in line.

511
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,600
-Read the orders from the beginning.
-Yes, Chef.

512
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,160
Noodles passing by.

513
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,880
Chef, are you feeling ill?

514
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,920
I just have an upset stomach.

515
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,120
I wonder if you have indigestion.
Your skin is really pale.

516
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,440
No, no, it's manageable.

517
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,760
-Bring more Shrek pasta.
-Okay.

518
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,400
Min-soo, do we still have
many orders left?

519
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:11,360
After table eight's Shrek and escargot,
I think we're about done.

520
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,200
-Are you still feeling sick?
-Yeah, a bit.

521
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,840
-You can finish up here, right?
-Yes, Chef.

522
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,720
Chef, why don't you try eating something?

523
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:24,760
No, no, my mother told me...
When food sits heavy on your stomach

524
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,560
you're supposed to keep eating
to push it down.

525
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,760
You, my uneducated friend. Push what down?

526
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,120
Chef, Chef, Chef. Try doing a handstand.

527
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,040
That worked wonders
when I had indigestion.

528
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,920
You ignorant punk. Go put those away.

529
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,640
Do this to let food go down. Like this.

530
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,680
Hey, you, rascal! Seriously.

531
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,640
Gosh, that hurt like hell.

532
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,840
I'll take care of it.
You guys finish up here.

533
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,720
Gosh, now it hurts in the front and back.

534
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,160
Take care, Chef.

535
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,880
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. It's fine.

536
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,280
Why would you have two bowls of rice?

537
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,240
Give me your hand.
You're supposed to do this here.

538
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
Hey, can't you do it properly?

539
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,800
I'm sorry, Chef.

540
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,240
-You should be.
-I'm sorry.

541
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,360
-Here...
-Wait, wait!

542
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,160
Gosh, you scared me.
I didn't even poke you yet.

543
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,560
You can... You can do this
properly, right?

544
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,320
You're not going to poke wherever, right?

545
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,960
Were you always lied to your entire life?

546
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,400
Of course, ever since high school,
any time my classmates got indigestion...

547
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,840
I made them stand in line during
the rest period and poked them.

548
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,520
I have to collect blood
all over again now.

549
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,800
I've never seen you do this properly,
so I don't know... Ow!

550
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,480
Oh my, let's see, let's see. Wow,
you must've had really bad indigestion.

551
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,200
Dark blood is... Wow...

552
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,960
Come here.

553
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,880
How is it? Do you feel better?

554
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,240
Yeah, it kind of feels like it.

555
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:41,000
So, why did you eat so much rice
when you don't even like rice?

556
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,040
Two bowls at that. And you gulped it down.

557
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,800
What could I have done
when he gave me another bowl?

558
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,160
It's because you were acting
as if it was tasty.

559
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,560
Were you being polite or
are you just stupid?

560
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,240
It's being polite!

561
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,720
When someone older than me is serving me,
do you expect me to say no?

562
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,800
And that...

563
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,120
Mister's life story was sad.

564
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,920
Maybe it's because he let his daughter go
first but his eyes were full of sadness.

565
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,679
When someone like him is happy that
I'm enjoying his food and giving me more

566
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,679
how can I say no?

567
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
What's with your stare?

568
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,040
You fell for me again just now,
didn't you?

569
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,320
Fall for you? Whatever.

570
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,120
Stay here. I'll go to the pharmacy.

571
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,800
-What? Now?
-Yes.

572
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,280
You can't. Let's go together.

573
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,320
Please! Patient,
you need to stay here. I'll go.

574
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,920
I really really will be fine.
It's not dangerous at all.

575
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,159
I'm coming with you.

576
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,560
What if a ghost comes out?

577
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,679
Ghost...

578
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,480
Ghost.

579
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,719
Wait for me.

580
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,920
How do you feel now? Do you feel better?

581
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,880
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's the medicine
or the needle poking.

582
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,120
But, it feels much better.

583
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,840
That's good.

584
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,160
If that is the case...

585
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,280
Oh goodness.

586
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,360
-What? This?
-Nope.

587
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,920
You couldn't even hold off for that long?

588
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,160
Chef, let's go play in the playground.

589
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,840
So you can fully digest. This is great!

590
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,000
What... Playground?

591
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,360
-Are we kids?
-Hurry up.

592
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,440
Chef, it'll help you digest.

593
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,480
No thanks.

594
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,800
-Come catch me.
-What the...

595
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
Play tag? So immature. Come over here.

596
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,560
-Why are you doing this?
-You couldn't touch me.

597
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,960
Hey, come here.

598
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,920
-Catch me if you can.
-You're dead.

599
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,640
-Come here now.
-Gosh!

600
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,440
You're not going to stop?

601
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,480
Seriously?

602
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,960
-Oh no! You're too fast!
-

603
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,000
Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?

604
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,280
-Ow that hurts!
-Are you okay?

605
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,360
-I'm okay.
-I told you. Try standing up.

606
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,360
Stop panicking and sit over here.

607
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,480
I told you we shouldn't. Didn't I?

608
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,440
-Acting like a child...
-I'm okay.

609
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,080
Okay. Let me see here.

610
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Here.

611
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,840
You gave me a scare.

612
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,840
Why?

613
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,560
I like this.

614
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,600
What?

615
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,640
I'm saying I really like you, Chef.

616
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,280
A lot.

617
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,080
Chef, did you know...

618
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
These days, I'm doing many things
I wasn't able to do before.

619
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,680
Like what?

620
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,920
Walking hand-in-hand with someone I like.

621
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,320
And bicycling together.

622
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,600
And talking with you in the playground
like this.

623
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,000
They are all things I never got to do.

624
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,120
I couldn't even dream of it.

625
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,080
I was too busy and the circumstances
didn't help either.

626
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,800
What other things have you
not experienced?

627
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,720
There are too many.

628
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,440
I've never been to a theme park.
I haven't been to Namsan either.

629
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,160
And oh, I've never been on a cruise.

630
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,760
And as for the trips...

631
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,120
I think our MT was my first trip
as a grown-up.

632
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,080
-Really?
-Yup.

633
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,960
What were you doing the whole time

634
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,680
if you didn't even get to do
all those things?

635
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,800
I was busy making ends meet.

636
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,560
Thank you, Chef.

637
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,320
For letting me experience things
I never got to do.

638
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,160
Okay, let's go on a trip.

639
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,720
What?

640
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,880
Let's go on a trip. An overnight trip.

641
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
You are the one who suggested it.

642
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,560
We can go after we close up the restaurant
and come back the next morning.

643
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,120
I'd like that very much.
An overnight trip.

644
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,280
But, what made you change your mind
so suddenly?

645
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,840
You were totally against the idea of
an overnight trip.

646
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,560
Because you thought I'd jump you.

647
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,120
-It's okay now.
-What?

648
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,240
Hm?

649
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:12,880
I now want to go with you.
On an overnight trip.

650
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,440
I won't hold it in anymore.

651
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,960
You better be ready, okay?

652
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,600
But, don't let your excitement hinder
your sleep.

653
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
That's tacky.

654
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,040
Am I supposed to make a reservation?

655
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,160
Or...

656
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,160
Are we supposed to act natural
and just walk in?

657
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,600
If I make a reservation,
is that being presumptuous?

658
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,680
I should calm down.

659
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,040
This place looks nice. Really nice.

660
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,560
This place looks good too.

661
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,160
The bed looks nice... This bed.

662
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,720
The bed looks nice.

663
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,800
Oh my.

664
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,840
It's me, Sis.

665
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,600
I startled you, didn't I?

666
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,240
What's wrong with you?

667
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,360
Not like anyone questions
your ghost status. Gosh.

668
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,560
Sitting next to my head in the middle
of the night and scaring me like that.

669
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,400
I came by because I wanted to talk to you,
but you were asleep so...

670
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,000
Why?

671
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,840
What is it about?

672
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,600
Chef...

673
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,840
Chef wants us to go on an overnight trip.

674
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,840
Overnight?

675
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,200
Hey, then it's a good opportunity.

676
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,680
When a man and a woman go on
an overnight trip

677
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,120
it's obvious what can happen.

678
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,560
That's why...

679
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,440
What do you mean "that's why"?

680
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,960
What are you trying to say?

681
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,040
Explain it to me so that I understand,
you wench.

682
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,720
I don't know why I'm feeling this way.

683
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,840
By tomorrow, I can resolve this grudge
I've been dying to do.

684
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,560
Yet, I'm not happy.

685
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,600
-What?
-Sis...

686
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,000
I think...

687
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,320
I like Chef a lot.

688
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,320
Everything he says to me and
the way he looks at me...

689
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,000
The way it feels when he's holding
my hand...

690
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,120
These are feelings I've never felt when
I was alive.

691
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,800
It's so warm and my heart feels like
it's getting all tender.

692
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,920
-You're not thinking...
-I know.

693
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,880
I know I'm not Na Bong-sun.

694
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,840
I've only temporarily borrowed her body.

695
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,920
But...

696
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,920
But, I'm just so upset.

697
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:37,200
Why didn't I get to experience any of
these things when I was alive?

698
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,560
Why... In my death?

699
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,400
-And with the man of vitality, at that?
-You have to...

700
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,800
You have to get it together.

701
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,720
Do you know what the most dangerous thing
for ghosts like you is?

702
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,520
It's feelings.

703
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,080
It's mistakenly thinking that you're human
and feeling pain, sadness, and joy.

704
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,440
Then, you'll start to get greedy.

705
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:00,040
Even if it's as an evil spirit,
you'll get greedy and want to remain here.

706
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,760
But, evil spirits are different.

707
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,640
They're on a whole different dimension
than ghosts like you who possess humans.

708
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,720
They will never be able to die.

709
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:16,520
They will latch onto shady people and
go around committing evil acts.

710
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,160
Just get it together and
resolve your grudge.

711
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,280
Hurry up and go to a better place.

712
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,200
If too much time passes,
you'll be the one who'll be hurt.

713
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,040
-Okay?
-Yeah.

714
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,920
-There are 16 reservations tomorrow.
-Yes, Chef.

715
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,240
-Check on that.
-Yes.

716
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,760
Hey, Na Bong!

717
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,840
Today,

718
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,960
I'm going finish things up
quickly so just know that, okay?

719
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,920
Why aren't you answering me?

720
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
Are you so happy that you're speechless?

721
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,080
I guess so.
I must be so happy that I'm speechless.

722
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,240
I'm going to head down the street.

723
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,320
Where?

724
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,480
To that mister's restaurant.
I'll be back soon.

725
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,760
What?

726
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,920
Is that place full of honey or something?

727
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,680
She has so much affection.

728
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,120
Chef!

729
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,760
What do you say to drinks after work?
It's been a while.

730
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,800
I did use your credit card.

731
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,040
If you pay for round one,
I'll pay for round two.

732
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,360
I can't. I have plans today.

733
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,080
It's probably just a meet-up with
other chefs, right?

734
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,160
Okay, fine. I'll pay for round one too.

735
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
I don't want to go for round one or two.
You guys can go.

736
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,920
Fine, fine.
I'll buy you cattle intestines.

737
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,840
I said, I'm not going!

738
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,640
You really don't get it, do you?

739
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,960
Even if the sky split,
I wouldn't want to go.

740
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,720
You guys can go without me.
Stop yapping and clean that up.

741
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,320
He even gets mad when I offer to
buy drinks.

742
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,120
-Are you really buying cattle intestines?
-He says he's not going!

743
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,760
Even if the sky split into two,
he doesn't want to go!

744
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,720
I won't eat it!

745
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,560
Is the intestine round two or three?

746
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,760
I'm not going!

747
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, you came?

748
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,320
Yes, I did.

749
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,400
It's much easier to clean now, isn't it?

750
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,560
Yes, it is.

751
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,400
If you do it like this and
an order comes in

752
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,680
it makes it much easier when you're busy.

753
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,560
Oh, it really does.

754
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,840
I didn't even know this and
I was always running around.

755
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,960
Thank you so much.

756
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,880
And you know these dishes?
Almost all customers ask for them.

757
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:08,680
So, I think it might be a good idea to
put them on all of the tables.

758
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,080
Well, you sure are acting strange today.

759
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,480
As if we might not see each other for
a very long time.

760
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,680
Are you... Are you leaving, Bong-sun?

761
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,240
What? No, that's not it.

762
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,160
I just thought I could be busy and
unable to come.

763
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,600
You have to take care of your health,
Mister.

764
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,440
You need to stop drinking and
exercise regularly.

765
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,640
You have to.

766
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,960
You're definitely acting odd today.

767
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,520
Okay, I will. I will.

768
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:40,080
I will do everything you tell me to do.

769
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,360
Okay.

770
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:43,760
(Dad.)

771
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,880
(I may not be able to see you again.)

772
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,440
(You should stop thinking of me.)

773
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,240
(And live happily with Kyung-mo, Dad.)

774
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,760
Please enjoy your food.

775
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,240
Did you get unexpected money
from somewhere?

776
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,840
You said you're having money issues
because you can't reach the spirits.

777
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,240
What's the occasion? Buying me beef?

778
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,680
Don't ask me. Just eat.

779
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,200
It's because I'm sorry to you.

780
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,080
-Sorry about what?
-I told you not to ask me.

781
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,920
If you know, we'll both be unhappy.

782
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,360
Okay, I'll just eat it.

783
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,240
Wait...

784
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,800
You're not going to pack everything up

785
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,840
and move away somewhere, are you?

786
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,040
You can't do that!

787
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:34,680
You're one of my only girlfriends.
I'll just cry if you do.

788
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,840
You like me?

789
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:40,440
Of course, I like you.

790
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:42,640
I told you already.

791
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,320
I'm sick and tired of men...

792
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,360
Here.

793
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,000
-Goodness.
-You're right!

794
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,680
I like you too!

795
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,040
It's not like it's going to erode away
just because he does it with her once.

796
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,280
It just feels uneasy
because she's a ghost.

797
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,360
He's experiencing something he'll never
get, even if he paid for it.

798
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,960
Just think of it as an offering.

799
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,960
Offering? What are you talking about?

800
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,240
Just something.

801
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,120
Let's finish eating.

802
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,040
All the orders have gone out, right?

803
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:17,600
-Yes.
-Let's stop accepting orders.

804
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,680
Already?

805
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,480
It's just past eight now.

806
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,360
It was really hot today.

807
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,480
If you stand in front of the heat long
on days like today, it'll wear you out.

808
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,880
You need short days like today in order
to feel motivated, right?

809
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,920
-Good work.
-Yes, Chef.

810
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,560
Seems dubious.

811
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,800
I'll be upstairs getting ready,
so you finish up and come up.

812
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,320
-Call me when you're ready.
-Chef.

813
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:48,720
-Are we really going on a trip today?
-Of course, we are.

814
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,160
Why?

815
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,600
Are you so excited that you're
going crazy?

816
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,680
Yes, I'm so excited.

817
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,480
I'm not sure if it's a dream or real life.

818
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,360
Yeah...

819
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:12,240
Yeah, I have to go. What else can I do?

820
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,920
Am I going to live here for 1000 or
10,000 years as an evil spirit?

821
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,720
You shouldn't even be having second
thoughts, Shin Soon-ae.

822
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:18,960
You have to go.

823
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,560
You're going to go and resolve your
three-year grudge.

824
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,600
This will be a day to go down in history.

825
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,240
Oh, how exciting!

826
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,800
Oh, what am I doing?

827
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,120
No, no... This isn't it.

828
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,720
What am I doing? Get your act together.

829
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,680
Shin Soon-ae, there's no other choice.
This is why I was here this whole time.

830
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,240
I have to go. Let's just go.

831
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,000
Okay, I've got to go.

832
00:49:55,840 --> 00:49:56,840
Chef.

833
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:03,400
I don't understand why you drank so
much this early in the evening.

834
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,600
Seriously, on a day like this...

835
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,280
Fine, just stay put and don't move.

836
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:16,520
It's my mom. She's totally drunk.
She's driving me nuts.

837
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,560
Do you have to go, Chef?

838
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,160
Yeah, I think I have to go.

839
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,400
-Okay.
-Let's do this.

840
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:29,800
I'll go really quick and take care of
my mom.

841
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,080
We'll meet at Yongsan Station at 9:30 p.m.

842
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,360
There's an ITX at 10:00 p.m.,
so we'll have plenty of time, okay?

843
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,400
Let's start like this.

844
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,520
And go slowly...

845
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,880
For a long, long time, Na Bong-sun.

846
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,480
Son, over here.

847
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,680
Weren't you drunk, Mom?

848
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,240
Did I say I was drunk?

849
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,640
I said I was drinking.
This is just my third drink.

850
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,640
Before you were slurring your speech
and in a drunken stupor.

851
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:45,560
Oh, over here! Here!

852
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,240
-Professor!
-Yes, you came.

853
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,320
I didn't realize Sun-woo was here.

854
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,760
Did you call So-hyung, Mom?

855
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,120
It's been so long since
I've seen PD Lee... Sit, sit, sit.

856
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,200
Yes, I'll sit.

857
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:03,360
I just remembered. I have to meet some
professors about a seminar.

858
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,800
I have to get going.
You two can drink together.

859
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,960
Oh and this...

860
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,600
This is a coupon for the couple spa
at Heal Hotel.

861
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,440
You two go together... The two of you.
I'll be going.

862
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,400
Excuse me, two new cups here!

863
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,520
-Mom...
-Bye now!

864
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,200
-Professor...
-Wait...

865
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,560
I'm going now!

866
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,920
Sorry about that.

867
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,960
She really is cute,
using such an obvious ploy.

868
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,800
I wanted to talk to you anyway.

869
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,360
Let's get out of here.

870
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,280
Okay.

871
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,800
I wanted to come back to this campus
with you.

872
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,360
To be honest,

873
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:59,160
I saw you before I ever met Chang-gyu.

874
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,680
Strangely, I kept noticing you.

875
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,680
But, you never seemed to notice me at all.

876
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,000
These days, I keep thinking...

877
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,720
Things got too familiar and
too comfortable.

878
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,840
So, I think I didn't recognize my
own feelings.

879
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,040
-Wait, So-hyung...
-Let me finish first.

880
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,520
I feel like if you go first,
I might not get a chance to speak.

881
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:27,920
No, let me speak first.

882
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:30,960
I've...

883
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,480
Found someone I like.

884
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,520
In the end, you're going to beat me to it.

885
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:42,840
You jerk.

886
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,120
Even if you don't tell me,
I think I know who it is.

887
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,440
I just got rejected by you, didn't I?

888
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,160
I think so.

889
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,240
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

890
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:01,640
So embarrassing.

891
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,360
How am I supposed to see you now, huh?

892
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:31,800
I'm sorry, Chef.

893
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,760
Still, today's not the day.

894
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:41,640
I can't leave like this.

895
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,520
I know I'm being greedy.

896
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,480
A little longer, okay?

897
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,240
Just a little longer, Chef.

898
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,120
Chef?

899
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,120
Chef, are you here?

900
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,080
Chef?

901
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:16,040
Is he still waiting at Yongsan Station?

902
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:20,160
Chef,

903
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,080
are you inside?

904
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:25,800
Chef.

905
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,040
Na Bong!

906
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,200
Chef!

907
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,680
Did you wait long?

908
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,080
-I'm sor...
-I'm so sorry!

909
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,520
I wronged you.

910
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,680
You waited so long, didn't you?

911
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,160
-What?
-You didn't take your phone, did you?

912
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,800
I kept calling, but you didn't pick up.
So, I couldn't tell you.

913
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,000
I was so frustrated.

914
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,120
Why aren't you saying anything?

915
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,960
Are you mad? Are you very angry?

916
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,320
Well no, it's not that I'm angry...

917
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,960
What, exactly, happened?
Why didn't you come?

918
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,240
It's a long story. Have you eaten?

919
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,840
A VVIP meal just for you.

920
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,720
Special meal, snowing steak.

921
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,640
It looks like snow. It's so pretty.

922
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,560
Next is the cocktail.

923
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,520
-You've never seen this, have you?
-No, I haven't.

924
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,760
This is my own special recipe.
I'll tell you what it is.

925
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,000
Yes, Chef.

926
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,880
Okay, shake it.

927
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,200
This is called Romantic Cocktail,
made just for couples.

928
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:53,600
Just as the light green grapes instantly
melt the cotton candy...

929
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,200
I, too, will instantly melt your heart.
That's what it means.

930
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,160
Oh, what a sexy cocktail.

931
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,720
Hey, you should know this is quite
an honor.

932
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,720
It's not often that I cook for a person
like this.

933
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,800
Yes, I will consider it an honor.

934
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,320
Here.

935
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:19,560
Yum, it's so good!
It's melting in my mouth.

936
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,120
Of course, it is. I am the one cooked it.

937
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,600
If there's anything you want to eat,
just tell me. I'll make it.

938
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,280
Really?

939
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,680
But, what I want to eat isn't your
specialty.

940
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,040
What is it?

941
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,560
Blood sausage stir-fry.

942
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,960
I just love that so much.

943
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,560
The food you want to eat
is just so like you.

944
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,840
You've never made it, have you?
You can't do it?

945
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,000
You think I can't?
There isn't anything I can't make.

946
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,160
I'll do it.

947
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,400
-You will?
-Yeah.

948
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,160
If I promise you that,

949
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:56,920
am I forgiven for today?

950
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:59,040
I suppose so.

951
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,160
I'm really sorry.
I know you were looking forward to it.

952
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,760
Instead,

953
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,520
I'll make it feel like you're on a trip.

954
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:16,680
-What?
-For real...

955
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,840
Okay, here you go.

956
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:33,240
Here is your americano.

957
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,040
I'm probably better than most baristas.

958
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,880
It's really good.

959
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,800
Do you have some sort of barista
certification?

960
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,160
No, I just followed the instructions.

961
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,880
What do you think?
It feels like we're on a trip, doesn't it?

962
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:58,400
A trip's no big deal.

963
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,640
If we pitch a tent and set the mood,
it's just like an actual trip.

964
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,080
You're right. It does feel that way.

965
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,480
Gosh, this is nice.

966
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:16,880
I saw So-hyung earlier today.
My mom had called her out.

967
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,400
And I told So-hyung that I have a person
that I like now.

968
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,960
What?

969
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:35,520
It was an attachment I had for a really
long time.

970
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,400
I felt relieved once I ended it.

971
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,720
So, what I'm saying is...

972
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,400
You have to take responsibility for me.

973
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,480
You're dead if you abandon me.
