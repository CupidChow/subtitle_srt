1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,400
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,960
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,920
It's so cold.

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,880
I'm all wet.

5
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,240
-What should I do...
-Hold on.

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,240
Oh, no. You're all wet.

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,120
I feel so bad. What should I do?

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
Oh, I'm such a klutz.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
I think...

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,480
The water is all gone...

11
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,640
Now?

12
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,120
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry!

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,240
Hey, Na Bong-sun.

14
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,360
Na Bong!

15
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,880
Na Bong!

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,160
It wasn't a mistake.

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
It wasn't a mistake this time.

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
Well, I...

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
I know...

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm...

21
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
Acting strange and
I feel like I'm going a little crazy.

22
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,360
But, I'm being sincere.

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,079
What?

24
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,480
Don't you get it?

25
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,600
Kang Sun-woo...

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,560
Likes you.

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,200
I don't know when it started.

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,240
Whether it's from the very beginning or

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,120
when you suddenly changed
and latched onto me.

30
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,440
Or it could be yesterday or today...
I really don't know.

31
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,320
The one thing I know for sure is...

32
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,360
I keep wanting to see you.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,280
And I feel nervous
if you're not next to me.

34
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,040
Gosh, I'm going to go nuts.
You're someone who's like my family.

35
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,280
So,

36
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
let's just go for it.

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,840
They're my feelings so who's to
say anything about it?

38
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,680
Well...

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,040
Well, say something.

40
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,840
Don't just stand there breathing.

41
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,480
If someone like me confesses to you,
shouldn't there be a reaction?

42
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,480
Ah, yeah.

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,560
Thank you, Chef.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,560
What?

45
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,240
No, I mean...

46
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,640
What I meant was...

47
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,120
You're saying okay, right?

48
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
You're saying...

49
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
That you like me too?

50
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,600
Yes, Chef.

51
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,360
Why are you feeling so restless,
for no reason?

52
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,360
Get your head on straight, girl.

53
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,080
You're a ghost, not Na Bong-sun.

54
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,960
Let's get your head on straight.

55
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,040
Head, head, head...

56
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Head...

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
Hey.

58
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,440
I'll do it.

59
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,880
-Don't move an inch and sit down.
-Okay.

60
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,280
I'll be done very soon.

61
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,960
Here we go...

62
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,960
That should do it.

63
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,360
Your hair is still wet.

64
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
Even though it's summer,
you can still catch a cold.

65
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,800
Here, face me.

66
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,600
-It's working, right?
-Yes.

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,080
I must be truly bewitched by you.

68
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,480
Seriously.

69
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
You're like a little chestnut.

70
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,080
You look like a puppy.

71
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,720
Look how happy you are. Gosh.

72
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
I am happy.

73
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,360
My goodness...

74
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,560
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 9

75
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,320
I wonder why he's calling?

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,160
Yes, Officer Yang.

77
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,120
Officer Han?

78
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes.

79
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,400
Okay, I'll be right there. Okay.

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,480
What's that about Officer Han?

81
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,120
He was in an accident of some sort.
He's in the hospital.

82
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,600
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

83
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,480
-Where are the car keys?
-Over there.

84
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,800
Oh my.

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Wasn't Officer Han the lead on

86
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,280
Eun-hee's case? Your partner?

87
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,680
Yes. I'll be back, Mother-in-law.

88
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,920
-Go to bed first.
-Okay.

89
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,480
Oh my. What could it be?

90
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,800
A car accident?

91
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,159
I'm not sure.

92
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,880
I feel out of breath and
my heart's beating fast.

93
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,000
It must be bringing back past memories.

94
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,840
Are you all right?
I'll bring you some cold water.

95
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,200
No, I'm fine.

96
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,760
It's just that I saw Officer Han briefly
yesterday after work.

97
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I hope it's nothing serious.

98
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,400
Officer Yang!

99
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,200
What's going on? Where's Officer Han?

100
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,280
He finished surgery and
they've put him in intensive care.

101
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,960
-He's not conscious yet.
-Is he seriously injured?

102
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
I don't know. The surgery went well.

103
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,440
But, he lost a lot of blood.
They need to watch him for a couple days.

104
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,680
What...

105
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Just what was this about?

106
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,800
I just don't know.

107
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,680
Someone found him passed out bleeding
in a parking lot and called it in.

108
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,600
It looked like a mugging because his
phone and wallet were missing.

109
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,560
This guy was really prepared.
All the CCTV was gone too.

110
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,799
You're very startled, aren't you?

111
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,200
My heart is still thumping too.

112
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,840
Have you called his mother?

113
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,440
No, I didn't want to worry her,
so I called his older sister.

114
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
She should be here soon.

115
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,560
You did well. You did well.

116
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,360
Na Bong-sun, are you sleeping?

117
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,240
No, I'm not.

118
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,600
Sleep well.

119
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Okay, you sleep well too, Chef.

120
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,560
Honestly, I don't know if I'll be able to.

121
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,320
Make sure to get a good night's rest
so that you're not tired tomorrow.

122
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Okay.

123
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,520
Make sure to pull that blanket over
you properly.

124
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,640
If you don't cover your stomach,
you'll get a stomach ache.

125
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:31,960
Okay.

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,320
Dream of me in your sleep.

127
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,200
That's not an order. It's a suggestion.

128
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,960
I will, Chef.

129
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,800
-What are you doing?
-Oh my!

130
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,280
Oh, nothing. Just...

131
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
You're wondering what Chef's up to
after confessing his feelings to you?

132
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,360
You saw the whole thing?

133
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
Of course, I did.

134
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,200
It was me who made that happen
by laying the groundwork.

135
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,240
He just suddenly came at you.
I got annoyed and came out.

136
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,520
What's it like?

137
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,240
Getting a confession from the guy
you've been in a one-sided love with?

138
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,320
Huh?

139
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,160
It's nice, isn't it?

140
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,040
Yes.

141
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,280
But, I just can't believe it.

142
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
I keep wondering if it's a dream.

143
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,400
And I worry that it's not a dream too.

144
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,880
At least if it's a dream,
I can wake up and won't get hurt.

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,880
Gosh, why do you overthink things so much?

146
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,760
The obstacle is right in front
of you, Na Bong-sun.

147
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,560
Now is the time to overcome it.

148
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,960
I will resolve my grudge and
you make Mr. Kang your man.

149
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,120
Win-win.

150
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,120
-Win-win...
-Yeah.

151
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,000
We each need to advance toward our
own goals, okay?

152
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,720
Okay.

153
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,200
Trust me and follow me. We can do it.

154
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,760
What an awesome morning it is.

155
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,360
Chef's heart is already mine.

156
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,680
The real game will start today.

157
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Should I start planning for the big event?

158
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,680
Oh, you're awake.

159
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,280
Yes, Chef. Did you sleep well?

160
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,040
Well, I...

161
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,240
Yeah, I slept very well.

162
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,360
Did you think I'd be all excited and
not be able to fall asleep?

163
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,360
You think I've been dating
for one or two days?

164
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,800
How tacky would that be?

165
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh dear.

166
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,200
Your eyes look puffy.

167
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:05,800
My eyes?

168
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,840
-Did you not sleep?
-No, no I did.

169
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,680
Why don't you believe me?

170
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,720
Why are you laughing? Am I funny?

171
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,880
No, it's because I'm happy.

172
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,600
Don't be so happy like that. Okay?

173
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,640
You could get hurt.

174
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
By the way...

175
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,800
And I'm saying this for your own good,

176
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,440
don't be so obvious
in front of the others.

177
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
Of course. I do have control.

178
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,480
See you later.

179
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,120
Bye.

180
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,840
Hey, hey. hey.

181
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,240
What's Bong up to again, huh?

182
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,200
She's been following Chef around all
morning like a dog who needs to poop.

183
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,360
I know.

184
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,440
She must need something from Chef again.

185
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,920
Is it about another advance?

186
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,160
She's going too far.
It's not like Chef's a bank.

187
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
-I told you not to be so obvious.
-When was I?

188
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,200
They've been looking at us all morning.

189
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,520
Oh really?

190
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,560
I was doing my best not to be obvious.

191
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,280
People are being too sensitive.

192
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,640
-Why are you doing...
-Chef!

193
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,840
-Huh?
-Yes?

194
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
How much papillote should we make?

195
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,120
Well, probably not too much.

196
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Let's just do ten.

197
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,800
-Yes, Chef.
-Ten...

198
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,080
CHEF KANG

199
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,720
CHEF, WHAT ARE OUR PLANS FOR TODAY?

200
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,960
-Ji-woong.
-Yes, Chef.

201
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,840
What was I going to say?

202
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,000
-You know the potatoes we ordered yesterday?
-Yes.

203
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,320
I prepped them all and
put them in the fridge.

204
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,160
For today's special, we'll use oven-baked
potatoes with sour cream...

205
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,560
And...

206
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,520
WHAT?

207
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,040
How many reservations do we have today?

208
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,080
We have 15 groups in total.

209
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,080
One group called in to cancel.

210
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,840
Jun, can you see how many
live seafood we have?

211
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,640
-Yes, Chef.
-Let's get ready.

212
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,680
Oh, Chef! I'm here.

213
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,760
What is it? Do we have to have a
secret conversation?

214
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,840
Really?

215
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,560
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

216
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,880
To watch me suffer.

217
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,480
No, it's just that today's our first day.

218
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,520
So, of course I'm curious about what our
plans are tonight.

219
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,800
I suppose we can go out to eat dinner
as part of our lesson.

220
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,080
That's it?

221
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,080
What do you mean, "that's it"?

222
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,960
Hey, do you know how many people in
Itaewon want cooking lessons from me?

223
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,320
You're making money. You're very lucky.

224
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
Still, this isn't right.

225
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,080
It's our only first day.
We should do something special.

226
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,280
For example... I'll give you an example...

227
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,600
Maybe an overnight trip.

228
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,040
You know those romantic trips.

229
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,840
Go on a train, see the ocean, eat some
delicious food...

230
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,480
-And then...
-And then what?

231
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,280
And then after doing this and that,
if there's nothing left to do...

232
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,880
We can go into a motel and take a nap.

233
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm sure you'll really take a nap.

234
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,360
You think I don't know about your dark
thoughts.

235
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,760
Overnight trip? You're so ridiculous.

236
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,760
What's wrong with an overnight trip?

237
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,120
Na Bong-sun, listen carefully.

238
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,800
Regardless of your issues,
I can't be so liberal

239
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,240
when it comes to relations between
men and women.

240
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,320
I'm very, how do I put this...

241
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,880
Careful and thoughtful about this.

242
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,840
What use is any of that when it comes
to relationships between men and women?

243
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,480
Whatever the case, if you want to date me,
you have to match my tempo.

244
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,640
Here.

245
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,840
-What is this?
-Wait five minutes and come down.

246
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,240
Don't be so obvious and follow me
right away.

247
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,760
Ah, seriously!

248
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,480
A man of vitality shouldn't have
any issues.

249
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,880
I just don't have the time for this!

250
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,440
What is this? What am I supposed to do?

251
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,960
Gosh, darn it!

252
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,520
He's the man of vitality.

253
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,720
Hey, hey! Don't run!

254
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,600
-I didn't come to catch you.
-You didn't?

255
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,520
I was curious to see how it was going.

256
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:57,960
Oh, really?

257
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,720
-Look.
-You didn't bring this, did you?

258
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,840
No.

259
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,440
Goodness...

260
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,720
-Slow down and eat.
-Okay.

261
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,160
-Oh, my! Oh!
-Gosh, darn it!

262
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,079
Gosh, seriously.

263
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,040
Who told you to go at it like an elephant
that's been starving for months?

264
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,880
The triangle kimbap must be peeled
slowly and carefully.

265
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,119
You're too hasty.

266
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,240
Once it's in the stomach,
it all gets mixed together anyhow.

267
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,480
Goodness!

268
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,880
You must've been really hungry.

269
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,320
Have you run out of rice at home?

270
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,120
Why that mouth of yours!

271
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,000
This is all your fault, you know.

272
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,520
By the way, are you getting further with
that guy or what?

273
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,480
-The man of vitality?
-You're curious, huh?

274
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
What happened is...

275
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Oh my, oh my...

276
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,760
That tickles. How dare you, to your elder.

277
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,080
What are you doing? What's with you!

278
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,040
Don't whisper like that.
Just tell me from over there.

279
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,120
Oh, how strange.

280
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,480
That man of vitality and I
have decided to date now.

281
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,240
We even kissed yesterday.

282
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,720
-Really?
-Yeah.

283
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,640
You wench. You've got some skills.

284
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,600
You've even touched lips now.
It's almost done now.

285
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,400
That's what I think.

286
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,320
My grudge will be resolved very soon.

287
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,480
Hey, when you ran away last time...

288
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,600
Did you know that I was pretending
not to know?

289
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,200
I thought maybe that was the case.

290
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,600
So, you have to resolve your grudge
and quickly leave.

291
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:39,160
If the Spirit finds out, I may never get
my powers back at all because of you.

292
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,160
Don't you worry!

293
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,360
I'm going to use this opportunity to
ascend to heaven.

294
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,320
Please, I'd like to rely on you.

295
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,960
What? This woman again?
Why does she keep calling me?

296
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,520
Yes, hello?

297
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,480
Actually, I had a dream last night.

298
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,440
Dream? What dream?

299
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,800
You know my Sun-woo?

300
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,120
There was a field of dead flowers.

301
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,840
He was walking through the field and
I called him, but he didn't answer me.

302
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,040
-Dead field of flowers?
-Yes.

303
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,680
What could that mean?
Can you tell me the meaning?

304
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,720
It's not a bad dream.

305
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:26,080
A lively field of flowers represents
something wicked.

306
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,480
For example, something like a
female con-artist.

307
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,880
But, if it's a dead flower field...
He's avoiding that bad thing.

308
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
Yeah? Is that it?

309
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,280
That's a relief.
I was worried for no reason.

310
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,640
I'm glad I saw you today.

311
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,600
Do you want to eat something else?

312
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,560
-No, no.
-Should we drink?

313
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,360
-Ma'am, please bring us some drinks.
-Okay.

314
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,360
Oh, Officer Choi! You came.

315
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,040
I was just in the restroom.

316
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,200
You must be very tired.

317
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,960
Oh, I'm not too bad.

318
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,600
They say his surgery went fine.

319
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,760
But, he's just not waking up.

320
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,360
I'm just dying of worry.

321
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,880
I can't bear to tell our mother.

322
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, Jin-goo.

323
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Jin-goo, are you awake?

324
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,680
I'm going to go find the doctor.

325
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,840
Officer Han.

326
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,360
Officer Choi.

327
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,200
Are you okay? This is the hospital.

328
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,960
Yes.

329
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,920
About that day...

330
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,880
Do you remember anything?

331
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,640
No.

332
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,800
I remember heading out there.

333
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,440
But, I don't remember anything after that.

334
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,680
It's a huge relief that you're okay.

335
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,400
Your sister went to find the doctor.

336
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Goodness, look at this sweat.

337
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,560
-Good job today.
-Yes.

338
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,800
Hey, you guys...

339
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,960
Oh right, I'm meeting some band guys
from my elementary school. I forgot.

340
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,760
-What's wrong with me?
-Why?

341
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,800
It's been acting up all day.
Is it enteritis or what?

342
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,080
What are you going to do?

343
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,560
Then, we better get going.

344
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,920
We should all rest for tomorrow.

345
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,440
Tomorrow? Is something happening tomorrow?

346
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
I didn't say that. I'm just saying,
let's go home today.

347
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
Go, go, go. I'll be going.

348
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,520
-Dress up nice tomorrow.
-Okay.

349
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,800
I'll be going.

350
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,280
Goodbye!

351
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,680
What's with him?

352
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,840
What's going on tomorrow?

353
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,480
I don't know.

354
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,000
But, I suddenly don't want to come
into work tomorrow.

355
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,960
Let's worry about tomorrow when
the time comes. Bye.

356
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,120
-Bye.
-We have to go too.

357
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,960
I'll be going too.

358
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,880
-Okay.
-Bye.

359
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
CHEF KANG

360
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,080
(Get ready. I'll see you in 20 minutes.)

361
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
(Okay! I'll see you later!)

362
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,240
What's with the heart?

363
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,440
So immature, Na Bong.

364
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,440
Yeah, I don't need an overnight trip
to do it with him.

365
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,560
I'll just look for an opportunity and
make my move.

366
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,520
Okay, then...

367
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,640
Should I get myself ready?

368
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,800
A girl is all about mascara.

369
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,160
This is good. I'll make myself up today.

370
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,440
So, you're the last step.

371
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,760
He won't know, he won't.
He didn't know last time either.

372
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,640
About the air freshener.

373
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,360
Why isn't she coming out?

374
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,360
Na Bong, are you ready?

375
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Coming.

376
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,520
Tada!

377
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,080
How do I look?

378
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,840
I tried to make myself look nice
for our first date.

379
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,640
Why did you go so overboard?
How tacky of you.

380
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,960
Oh, it's tacky of me?

381
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,000
Then, did you think you'd look trendy?
Let's go. I'm hungry.

382
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,960
What are we going to eat?
Is it something tasty?

383
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,560
Would we eat something yucky?

384
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,800
Isn't the skirt... Kind of short?

385
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,720
Short? This? No, it's not short at all.

386
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,840
It is short.

387
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,440
Let's just go.

388
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,560
He sure is complaining a lot.

389
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,120
Wow, what's the occasion?
Bringing me to a place like this.

390
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,280
You always took me to some
hole-in-the-wall kind of places.

391
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,640
It's quite popular among young people.

392
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,000
So, are we like checking out your rival's
business right now?

393
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,920
Why don't you lower your voice?
No need to advertise that we're spying.

394
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,960
Your food is ready.

395
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,680
-Oh my, wow!
-Thank you.

396
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,520
That's Hanwoo steak with ginseng sauce.

397
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,120
It's a healthy dish that uses all
natural ingredients.

398
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,360
-Yes, we know.
-Thank you.

399
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,520
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

400
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,520
Here, eat.

401
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,560
Just like there are trends in fashion,
there are trends in food, as well.

402
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Being able to follow that
is a skill for a chef too.

403
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,920
How is it?

404
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,520
It's very good.

405
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,320
-It's good?
-Yes.

406
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,320
It really is. You try some too.

407
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,720
-More than my cooking?
-Come on now.

408
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,840
I didn't say that now.

409
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,520
What's with your foot?

410
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,360
It must be because my legs are so long.
It keeps touching you, Chef.

411
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,480
My legs are so long.

412
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,560
Let's just focus on eating and
not on anything else.

413
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,440
When was I thinking about anything else?

414
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,120
I suppose you must think that I'm thinking
about that 24 hours a day.

415
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,440
Chef, you must think that.

416
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,400
-It isn't true.
-Go over there.

417
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,280
Okay.

418
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,960
Gosh.

419
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,840
I'm just putting your belt on for you.

420
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,800
We have to drive safely.

421
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,440
What? It's not like I don't have hands.
There's no need.

422
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,720
Let's go!

423
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,680
Okay, let's go.

424
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,120
-Oh, you got something on you.
-What are you doing?

425
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,480
I think there's a stain here.

426
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,880
-What the!
-Right there, there.

427
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,960
-Where are you going?
-What do you think you're touching?

428
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:41,160
Where are you going?

429
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,240
What did I do?
I was just trying to get dirt off you.

430
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,160
I mean I'm driving and your hand
is on me suddenly. It's dangerous!

431
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,280
-If you keep this up...
-I'll get in trouble?

432
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,800
I truly want to experience being
in trouble.

433
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,840
My goodness...

434
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,440
You know if I put my mind to it,
you'll be shocked.

435
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,760
That's what I'm saying.
Why don't you let me get shocked?

436
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,280
Where are you going anyways?

437
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
We should go home.
We have to work tomorrow.

438
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,240
No! No way.

439
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Today is our first day. We can't do that.

440
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,400
Uh, Chef, do you want to go for
some red bean shaved ice?

441
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,040
I know this place well. Didn't you say
you like red bean shaved ice?

442
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,320
Shaved ice?

443
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,640
What is this? Where is this place?

444
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,080
We're almost there. It's close.

445
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,320
There's a red bean shaved ice place in a
remote area like this? Maybe we're lost?

446
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,840
We're not. It is this way.

447
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,960
All you have to do is follow me, Chef.

448
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,080
-This is right.
-How odd.

449
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,520
How can there be a shaved ice place
around here?

450
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,160
Gosh, seriously.

451
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,680
I thought there was one near here.

452
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,720
Where?

453
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,360
Na Bong-sun, you.

454
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,720
Yes? What about me? What did I do?

455
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,040
I guess motels sell shaved ice these days?

456
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,320
Oh yeah, this really is a motel.

457
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,040
I wonder what happened.

458
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,800
But, this works out well.
My legs were starting to hurt.

459
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:19,560
Chef, maybe we can go in and rest a bit?

460
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,480
-A bit?
-Yes, just for a bit.

461
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,800
Just one hour.

462
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
-Can we? Chef?
-You really are too much.

463
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,960
Why? Oh, I know.

464
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,960
I'll just hold your hand and
lie next to you. Hm?

465
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,680
-Chef... My legs hurt.
-Let's go somewhere and talk.

466
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,840
Yes, talk, talk. In there.

467
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,960
-Come with me now.
-Can we talk in there?

468
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,160
-My legs hurt.
-Hurry. Come with me.

469
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
-Wait, wait. Hold on a minute.
-Sit.

470
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,440
-Sit down.
-Gosh, what?

471
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,360
My goodness...

472
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,440
I just wanted to rest a little.

473
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:58,160
What are you doing over there?
If you're going to sit, sit here?

474
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,280
Why do you like me?

475
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,880
-What are you talking about now?
-Do you like me or my body?

476
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,440
-What?
-Am I really talking about this?

477
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,280
Why am I saying these words? Gosh.

478
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,680
-Huh?
-Don't the girls usually say these things?

479
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,880
Usually girls do say those things,
but I'm not a typical girl.

480
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,800
What?

481
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,040
Why are you thinking so much?

482
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,480
I like you and I like your body.

483
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,080
And since I like you, I want to do it.

484
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,400
Is it that weird for a healthy man
and woman to do it?

485
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,280
-Is it?
-That's not the point I'm trying to make.

486
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,320
Then what?

487
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,760
-I am...
-Yes?

488
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,360
-At least when it comes to relationships,
-Yes.

489
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
I'm conservative.

490
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
And I think that's the right way to be.

491
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,960
Conservative?

492
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,960
I mean, for the relationship to
make progress

493
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
shouldn't we share our feelings
and go through the stages?

494
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:50,920
This is...

495
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,800
Is it right to meet someone and
immediately go all the way?

496
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,560
-Oh my.
-Like as if you were that liberal.

497
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
It's not about being liberal.
It's because I like you, Chef.

498
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,560
If you like me, then shouldn't
you be more prudent?

499
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:03,880
Am I some instant food?

500
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,840
I'm saying...

501
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,000
You should control your feelings better.

502
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,000
-And can we not do this?
-So frustrating.

503
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,720
For a woman, you have some bad habits.

504
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,400
What about being a woman? What?

505
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,520
A woman can't be like this?
Is there a law against it?

506
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,440
You're so ridiculous.
Your way of thinking is so outdated.

507
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,200
And if a woman tries this much, you
could at least try to go along with it.

508
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,600
I'm acting like this for a reason.

509
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,400
-Reason? What reason?
-Forget it!

510
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,680
-Never mind. Forget everything.
-Seriously.

511
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,680
You're the one who got all turned on
and kissed me in the kitchen!

512
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,440
You need to go through the stages?

513
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,440
Oh, okay, you need to go through
the stages? What should we do?

514
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,160
Should I be this far from you?
Is this enough?

515
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,640
-Is it acceptable?
-That's not what I mean.

516
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,840
-Why?
-Are you trying to be difficult?

517
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
No way. I'm just being obedient.

518
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,760
Why? Being obedient is a
problem for you now?

519
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,160
Then what do you want me to do?

520
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,560
Are you saying I should go or stay?
What are you telling me to do?

521
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,400
If you need time, every minute...
No, every ten minutes?

522
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
I can take a step like this?
Just tell me. A step every ten minutes?

523
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,760
Excuse me, Chef.
Did you just cover your ears?

524
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,000
Am I too loud for you?

525
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,480
-I guess mother-in-law is late.
-Yeah, she's at a meeting.

526
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,560
So Officer Han is okay?
We don't need to worry anymore?

527
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Yes, I talked to him before.
He started eating.

528
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,000
He'll get discharged soon.

529
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,680
That's a relief.

530
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,720
What about the culprit? Any evidence?

531
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,520
Well, there are too many of these
crimes and culprits.

532
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,040
The world is a scary place.

533
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,560
I guess they are not even afraid.

534
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,560
The heavens will punish them
one of these days.

535
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,480
Oh my. Did you hurt yourself?

536
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,240
Oh, sorry.

537
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,080
I got annoyed for a moment.

538
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,880
It must have stung a lot.
Should I put some cream on it?

539
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,800
No, no, it's okay.

540
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:03,320
Let's finish drinking wine and
go for a walk. It's nice out.

541
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,000
It was nice to meet my school friends
before.

542
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,520
It reminded me of my college days.

543
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,640
Oh yeah? You were reminiscing, huh?

544
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,920
Yeah.

545
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,400
I didn't realize it then,
but I think those days were good times.

546
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,000
I didn't really have any worries.

547
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,040
Anyways, I noticed you don't really talk
about yourself much.

548
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,880
Your college days or your childhood days.

549
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,720
How was the orphanage?

550
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,160
I think there are many cases of kids
getting adopted.

551
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,000
Not me.

552
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Not even once.

553
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,400
I'm back.

554
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,960
Mother, I need your signature stamp
on my report card.

555
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,040
Just do it yourself.

556
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,440
Oh, he's smiling. Oh my God.
He must recognize us.

557
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,880
Of course he knows.
We are his mom and dad. Right?

558
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh my.

559
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:20,800
Where were you all this time?
Making us feel worried.

560
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,520
What do you think you're doing?

561
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,440
You evil punk.
You little punk. Go. Get out.

562
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,320
Get out! Get out of here!

563
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,480
Three years ago...

564
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,840
If I hadn't met you...

565
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,040
And I lost the will to live again...

566
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,040
What would've happened?

567
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,920
I probably wouldn't be here now, right?

568
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,480
Probably.

569
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,320
Please let me go.

570
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,159
Just let me die.

571
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,080
You told me then.

572
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,360
It's not up to us to decide whether
we live or die.

573
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,080
What did you mean by that?

574
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,480
Did you say it to provoke me?

575
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,240
Did I? I don't remember.

576
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,320
In any case, it was refreshing.

577
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,400
Since that day, I kept thinking about you.

578
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,520
I see...

579
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,880
Will this distance satisfy your
requirements?

580
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,880
Come on.

581
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,360
I assume this will do.
I shall now depart, sire.

582
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,560
Conservative and prudent, Chef Kang.

583
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,880
Please take good care of your body,
Your Majesty.

584
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,360
And I bid you a good night.

585
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,920
I shall now leave you, sir .

586
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,120
-Good night.
-Hey.

587
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,600
Why is she going so overboard?

588
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,080
Do you know my true feelings?

589
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,200
I can do it.

590
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,080
Kang Sun-woo, you can do it.

591
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,320
You can endure it, you can.

592
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,760
Is his 'thing' a national treasure or
something? I don't have time for this.

593
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,520
He sure doesn't look that way?
Why is he so old fashioned?

594
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,320
If you make eye contact,
you just go for it.

595
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,720
This isn't the Joseon era, right?

596
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,120
But, he's not wrong you know.
What Chef's saying...

597
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,120
Do you really want to take his side,
at a time like this?

598
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
Even if you like the man?

599
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,000
But, that's one of his attractions.

600
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:58,280
At first, he seems like a light person,
but he isn't at all.

601
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,280
He's very serious and
he takes a lot of responsibility.

602
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,480
You think that's attractive?
You're wearing rose-tinted glasses.

603
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,280
You don't find Chef attractive?

604
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:15,760
Well, it's not that he's not attractive...

605
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,560
I just don't think it's polite to play
hard-to-get too much.

606
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,480
That's all I'm saying.

607
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
Especially to a woman he likes.

608
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,040
Gosh, we're almost all the way there.

609
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,760
We're stuck right there at that spot.

610
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,160
(Is it good, stalker?)

611
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
It's Chef!

612
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,960
He must've felt bad about it,
seeing as how he's out and about.

613
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,480
Hey, don't go out there.

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,840
-Huh?
-You need to hold back with him.

615
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
If you keep going like this,
it's going to take too long.

616
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,800
Endure it, even if you want to see him.

617
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,360
I'll just open the door a crack.

618
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,480
-I'll just take a peek at his face.
-No, no. Don't do it.

619
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,480
You're eating well.

620
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,160
Is it good?

621
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,600
Oh my gosh,

622
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,080
-What the heck? You guys.
-What is it? Something online?

623
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,560
-It's Min-soo's birthday today.
-Min-soo?

624
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,240
Sous Chef, Sous Chef!

625
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,280
Look, I got a message.
It's Huh Min-soo's birthday today.

626
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,160
-Oh my God!
-Oh no!

627
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,720
No wonder! That's why he was going
on and on yesterday about today.

628
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,440
-Gosh...
-What should we do?

629
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,040
Do we have to throw him a birthday party?

630
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,760
That won't be enough for him.

631
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,520
He'll totally be expecting a present.
An expensive one, at that!

632
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,920
Hey.

633
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,120
-Let's pretend we don't know.
-What?

634
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,040
Okay, okay. Sounds good.
We'll all pretend we don't know.

635
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,520
This is for the best.
We won't be able to handle him.

636
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,120
He's here.

637
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,760
Hi, Sous Chef.

638
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,680
-Hi, Sous Chef.
-Hello!

639
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,520
Good morning!

640
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,400
Hey, hey.

641
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,400
It's so hot outside.

642
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,400
People who give birth in hot weather
like this are pretty amazing.

643
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,840
As well as post-natal care, right?

644
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,480
Hey, is there any seaweed left?

645
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,200
Let's have seaweed soup for lunch.
I feel like having that today.

646
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:46,600
If I gave them these many hints,
they should know.

647
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,960
Maybe they're already preparing something.

648
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,200
What is this?

649
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,520
Oh, how lame. Don't tell me
it's a surprise party.

650
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
What's going on? What's happening?

651
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,040
Hey, hey! I already figured it all out.
Stop it already.

652
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,120
Stop it and turn on the lights!
Turn on the lights.

653
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,480
-The electricity went out.
-Tada!

654
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,720
-What's this?
-What will we do if the electricity

655
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,840
goes out suddenly like that?

656
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,120
-Right.
-Shouldn't we look into it?

657
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,640
It's probably because it's summertime.

658
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,080
I think it goes out like that when the
system overloads.

659
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,560
It'll be a problem for us if it goes out
for a long time.

660
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,040
-What would we do with our fridge?
-Yeah.

661
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,520
Right, our fridge.

662
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,320
So, this was an electricity outage?

663
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,440
-Yes.
-I see.

664
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,560
Hey, you guys. Are you going to stand
around all morning? Huh!

665
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,960
Did you come to play?
You're not going to work?

666
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,080
We're not late yet.

667
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,480
You are late.

668
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
You know what...
All of you, meeting outside.

669
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,080
Meeting!

670
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,760
Put up your hands... Right up...

671
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,800
Why did you put your hands up like
that by yourself?

672
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,000
-Are you going to raise it like that?
-No.

673
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,040
Dong-chul, aren't you going to clean
your nails? Huh?

674
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,240
Have you been farming somewhere?

675
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,560
Look at all that dirt.

676
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,120
This isn't dirt. This is cleaner
I got on my hands.

677
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,640
You better shut that mouth of yours. Okay?

678
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,680
And you, when are you cutting your hair?

679
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,200
Are you 'Old Boy' or something?

680
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,960
Are you a hedgehog?

681
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,480
And you...

682
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,280
You... Yeah, you...

683
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,880
Yes, you punk!

684
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,480
You're a chef, not a model!
Make yourself shorter right now!

685
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,080
Go and get a bad haircut or
get plastic surgery to get ugly.

686
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
Lower your eyes!

687
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,240
Just looking at you annoys me, Bong!

688
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,400
We can't last the day, right?

689
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,960
I don't think I can.

690
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:14,000
He's like a rabid dog, totally crazy.

691
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,160
This is a pain. Can't we just toss him
something and say it's a gift?

692
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,520
Yeah, I suppose.

693
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,600
I ordered a pair of jeans online and
they came this morning.

694
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,240
They gave me a free belt
as a special gift.

695
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,120
Can't we just give him that?

696
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,920
-Look what we have.
-Wow, look.

697
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,800
You guys didn't have to.

698
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,280
Thank you.

699
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,440
Birthday beats.

700
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,160
Here you go.

701
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,480
Hey, it's not like I'm the only one
with a birthday.

702
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,360
We put our thought into it.

703
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:04,960
Oh, I just hate doing stuff like this
at work.

704
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,520
But, since you guys put so much thought
into it...

705
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,960
I should, at least, look at the present.

706
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,640
-Oh, it looks expensive.
-It smells like leather.

707
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,120
It looks really nice.

708
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,960
Is this an expensive brand?

709
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,480
This...

710
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,680
Is this fake?

711
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,360
What?

712
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,560
Just kidding!

713
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,480
-Gosh.
-Hey, this...

714
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,840
It's obviously leather!

715
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,680
-What's this made out of?
-Gosh...

716
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,000
It's cowhide.

717
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,400
Isn't this really expensive?
Maybe you guys spent too much.

718
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,200
Sous Chef, don't be like that.

719
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,240
You've been so good to us all this time.

720
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,600
-If you say that, we'll be upset.
-That's right.

721
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,480
We'll get really mad. We will.

722
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,360
Sorry. I'm sorry about before.

723
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,800
Okay, then...

724
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,520
Drinks on me after work, everyone.

725
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,520
-Okay, okay.
-I'm in!

726
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,600
What is it?

727
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:08,160
It's your birthday, Min-soo?

728
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,200
Yes, I'm embarrassed, but it is.

729
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,560
In this hot weather...
your mother must have suffered a lot.

730
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,480
Oh, then here. I don't have anything else.

731
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,400
-Treat everyone with this today...
-Oh no, Chef!

732
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,760
Well, how much?

733
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,680
Who asks that? Just use however much
you see fit.

734
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,120
-300,000 won?
-We have to go for second round too.

735
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,200
400,000 won?

736
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,720
Sure, go ahead.

737
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,560
I'm in! Yeah!

738
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,800
Can't you do the grocery shopping all
at once, Dad?

739
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,520
Why do you do little by little?
It's such a pain.

740
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,240
You have to do it daily
so that it's fresh.

741
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,440
You're a young man.
How hard could it be to hold that?

742
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,040
That's not the problem, Dad.

743
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,480
I have an image to uphold in society too.

744
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,840
If I walk around carrying green onions,
what would neighborhood people think?

745
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,920
This is why Na Bong-sun looks down
on me too.

746
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,440
Be quiet, kid.

747
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,520
Your sister went walking daily

748
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,200
to buy groceries
in the morning and evening.

749
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,560
She was the type to create work for
herself.

750
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:16,720
Wait for me, Dad.

751
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,280
I'm here.

752
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,680
Here's an apple that you like.

753
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,080
Eat lots.

754
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,040
How can a dead person eat?

755
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:41,840
What a waste.

756
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,680
That bad man.

757
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,840
Why did you do it?

758
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,560
You bad man.

759
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,520
Mister!

760
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,040
-Oh, Officer Choi.
-Hello.

761
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,040
What are you doing here?

762
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,840
I'm on my way home after buying groceries.

763
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,040
I'll drive you back. Please, get in.

764
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,640
Oh no, I can just walk back.

765
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:20,160
I'm headed there myself and you have bags.

766
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,520
Kyung-mo, the car's over there.

767
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,080
Let's go with him, Dad.
It's rude to refuse too much.

768
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,720
Thank you, Officer Choi.

769
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,200
-Goodness.
-Here, give it to me.

770
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,360
-I feel bad.
-It's no problem at all.

771
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,600
-Get in the car.
-Okay.

772
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,280
What is it?

773
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,360
You tie your shoelaces in a unique manner.

774
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
I tie my shoelaces like this.

775
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,400
If you tie it like this,
it doesn't come undone.

776
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,480
Mister, your shoelaces are tied
in a strange way.

777
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,560
Oh, this? You know Bong-sun from
the restaurant?

778
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,040
She tied it for me.

779
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,760
-Bong-sun?
-Yeah.

780
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,840
She said I could get hurt if it came
undone and tied it so tight.

781
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,280
She's a very bright young lady.

782
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,440
Ah, I see.

783
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,400
-Are you going to the party?
-Yes.

784
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,400
It would be nice if you came, Eun-hee.

785
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,560
It would nice to have a pretty woman
there.

786
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,280
All we have there is...

787
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,200
You're not my type either, Sous Chef.

788
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,080
(Thank goodness for that)

789
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,480
Please go and have fun for me,
on my behalf.

790
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,480
-Yes.
-Yes.

791
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,400
-You're headed out now?
-Yes, Chef.

792
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,080
Chef, you're not going?

793
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,280
If you don't have plans,
you should come too.

794
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:31,880
Me?

795
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,920
I'm sure he wouldn't come.

796
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,240
Our chef is a very conservative person.

797
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:38,840
We should just go on our own and have fun.

798
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:40,720
Yeah, you guys should just go.

799
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,040
That way, once the food runs out,
you can badmouth me.

800
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,600
Hey, what are you talking about Chef?

801
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,360
We'll be going now.

802
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,280
Chef, we're going now.

803
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,800
-Have fun.
-Thank you.

804
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,720
Okay,

805
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,840
in celebration of the birth
of our sous chef!

806
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,080
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

807
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,320
This chicken is so good.
I'm going to eat a lot today.

808
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,040
Eat as much as you want.
It's on Kang Sun-woo's card.

809
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,720
What's the worry?
We'll never get to use his card again.

810
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,680
I'll use this card to make donations too.

811
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,520
Donate to me first. Order one more
chicken for each of us.

812
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:32,520
That's so cheap of you.
One chicken per person?

813
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,600
Ten chickens per person!

814
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,960
Ten chickens, it is!

815
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,280
Ma'am, more chicken please!

816
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,960
And beer please!

817
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,840
You know, I...

818
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,640
A mystic wet fog was formed.

819
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,040
-Another beer please!
-Aren't you listening to me?

820
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,360
Gosh...

821
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,960
-Okay, a mystic wet fog...
-You need to listen to this guy.

822
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,320
-Listen to me.
-I am listening.

823
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,880
A mystic wet fog was formed, okay?

824
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,480
There was a crane, a crane there
holding its leg up.

825
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,600
That was my mom's dream when she
was pregnant with me. A crane...

826
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,920
Crane, crane, crane.

827
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,960
Oh, it's a crane. A crane has appeared.

828
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:23,080
Here, crane. Eat this.
You can eat this too.

829
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,640
This is why he abuses people all the time.
(homonym for 'crane')

830
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,160
Hey now, Sous Chef was talking about
his cranes now.

831
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,120
Sous Chef,

832
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,360
this is his bad habit every
time he gets drunk.

833
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:40,760
Where's Bong-sun? Bong-sun's gone.

834
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,080
-Bong-sun?
-Crane, Bong-sun's gone.

835
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:47,400
Hello?

836
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,080
Do you not hear me?

837
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Turn on the light.

838
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:55,640
Bong, what are you doing here?

839
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,120
Oh, Jun. Hi.

840
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:04,240
-Are you drunk?
-Why are you wearing that?

841
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,360
Oh, this... This thing?

842
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,720
My head was hurting, but this squeezed it.

843
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,320
It made it feel better. I like this thing.

844
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,040
This is so like you.

845
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,240
-Come here. Sit down.
-What?

846
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,280
-Oh, there was a chair.
-Sit here.

847
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:25,160
Jun, you're a guy

848
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,600
so you must know how men think and feel.

849
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,840
I suppose, why?

850
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,200
The thing is, listen carefully...
I have this friend, right?

851
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,800
My friend has this boyfriend, right?

852
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:45,480
My friend is a very liberal person,
so she just attacked him.

853
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:49,120
But, this boyfriend of hers is
totally rejecting her.

854
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,880
And he refuses to do it, that punk.

855
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,680
So, the thing that I'm curious about...

856
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:58,120
Do guys usually dislike it

857
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,080
when girls
suddenly come on too strong like that?

858
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,320
Do they?

859
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,360
Let's see... is your friend not so pretty?

860
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,960
It's not that she's not pretty.

861
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,480
But, she's not so pretty either,
in my opinion.

862
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,840
It's one of two things.

863
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:15,760
He doesn't want to because she's
not pretty.

864
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,160
Or he likes her so much that he's waiting

865
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:21,560
until there's more trust
in the relationship.

866
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:26,800
If it's the former,
he's just an ordinary guy.

867
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,120
If it's the latter,
he's a pretty good guy.

868
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:38,160
I just don't know.
This is really confusing!

869
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,680
Is it the former or the latter?

870
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,440
I don't know for certain.

871
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,320
I think it's the latter.

872
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,680
-You're sort of pretty.
-Gosh...

873
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,920
It's not about me. It's my friend...

874
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,760
It's my close friend.

875
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,280
Then, tell that friend to smarten up.

876
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,240
She'll regret it if she loses him.

877
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,040
By the way, you don't hold my hand
these days at all.

878
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,040
You must be cured of your
"lack of affection".

879
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,200
Oh, I'm not all cured yet.

880
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,880
Not yet... Gosh, I'm so confused!

881
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,320
HOW TO MAKE CABBAGE PORRIDGE

882
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,200
I wonder if she's busy.
There are no updates.

883
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,040
This is the only blog worth reading.

884
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,280
What's with everyone anyways?

885
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,520
They should keep things under control.
Aren't they coming into work tomorrow?

886
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,040
Gosh, they sure had a lot to drink.
They're going all out, aren't they?

887
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:46,560
-Let's go!
-Go, Dong-chul!

888
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,960
What are you two doing?

889
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,720
Stop!

890
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,320
Stop!

891
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,680
Gosh, now.

892
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,000
This is enough, isn't it?
She should be home.

893
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,080
What's she doing with a bunch of guys?

894
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,280
Pal Pal Karaoke Room.

895
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,560
Now, they're digesting their food.

896
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,320
What's with her?

897
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:44,040
Does she want to be out with those guys
without me?

898
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,040
Huh?

899
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,680
Does she even think at all or what?

900
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,080
She's crazy. She really is.

901
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,720
It's two in the morning already.
What are they doing?

902
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,640
She's not doing this on purpose, is she?
To get revenge on me.

903
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:28,920
If she is, well...
Well, that is truly childish.

904
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,600
YONGSAN MOTEL

905
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,720
Motel?

906
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:40,760
Wait, Na Bong-sun? She really is crazy!

907
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,120
She's lost her mind!

908
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:47,720
Hey, Na Bong. Why are you doing this?
Have you gone nuts?

909
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:50,640
You're not picking up? You're not?

910
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,160
Min-soo, pick up. Pick up, you punk!

911
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,720
(-Hello, who is this?)
-Hey, Min-soo.

912
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:58,520
Where are you?

913
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,920
(I think it's a motel. Everyone's drunk.)

914
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,480
Is Na Bong-sun there too? Na Bong-sun?

915
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,240
(-Bong-sun?)
-Yeah.

916
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,600
(I think she's washing up.)

917
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,000
What? Washing up? Okay...

918
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,800
What's the room number?

919
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,560
Oh, gosh.

920
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,960
They even left the door unlocked.

921
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,960
Hey.

922
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,360
What's the problem?

923
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,920
Hey, Bong. Wake up.

924
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,200
-Oh, who's this?
-Wake up.

925
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,160
Chef, where have you been?

926
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:02,760
Be quiet.

927
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,880
Be quiet.

928
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,440
-My goodness.
-It stinks.

929
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,560
Chef.

930
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:15,760
Be quiet.

931
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:17,960
Quiet.

932
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,640
This won't do.

933
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,280
Where are we going?

934
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,280
-Be very quiet.
-Okay.

935
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,880
He's so dirty.

936
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,520
Why doesn't he take his pants off
if he's sleeping?

937
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,920
Kang Sun-woo!

938
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,160
Gosh, he startled me.

939
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,600
-Ouch.
-Chef.

940
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,360
Not today!

941
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,000
Let's go home.

942
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,280
-Chef, one shot! Let's go.
-Pull yourself together.

943
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,160
Chef! Oh, Chef is here!

944
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,880
Chef, let's go for another drink.

945
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,080
-One shot!
-What do you mean, one shot?

946
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,240
-Stand up straight.
-Yes, straight!

947
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,240
-This isn't working.
-Uh, how strange...

948
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,080
The sky is spinning, Chef.

949
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,040
Drink more.

950
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,560
More, more.

951
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,960
-More.
-I'm so full.

952
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,120
-I can't anymore.
-You need to sober up.

953
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:36,600
Look at me now.

954
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,720
-Are you a bit sober now?
-Yes, it seems that way.

955
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,680
Gosh, really.

956
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,560
What were you thinking?

957
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,240
What kind of girl would fearlessly go into
a motel room with a bunch of guys?

958
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:52,920
Oh yes.

959
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,360
Unlike you, conservative Chef...

960
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,800
To a wild girl like me,
motels are like my home.

961
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,840
-Stop twisting things around.
-What's wrong with a motel?

962
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:07,080
It's just a room that's good for resting.

963
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,240
And if you were that worried,
you should've come along back then.

964
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:12,720
You're the one who told me not to.

965
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,840
You said something about being a
"conservative chef"...

966
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,040
This is the problem with me.

967
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,080
Do you think that really means I don't
want you to come?

968
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:24,040
If you're so smart,
why can't you figure out the meaning?

969
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,400
And why are you overreacting so much?
Those guys don't even see me as a woman.

970
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,760
Why aren't you a woman?

971
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,680
You're so much a woman,
it worries me to death.

972
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:33,280
Oh my.

973
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,320
You just don't know what men are
really like.

974
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,880
Men can change in an instant.

975
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,080
If you're careless, you can be in trouble.
Do you understand?

976
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,880
I would like for that trouble to happen.

977
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,440
Why you...

978
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,080
You know what? This won't do.

979
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,640
From now on, you stay right by my side.
Don't leave even for a moment.

980
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,600
I'm so nervous. I'm going to stick you
to me like a piece of gum.

981
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,160
When was it that you were telling me to
stay away from you?

982
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,640
Why do you keep going back and forth
like that?

983
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:06,920
I take back what I said earlier.

984
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,200
From now on,
you stick to me no matter what.

985
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:09,760
Okay.

986
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,160
I'm sticking to you.

987
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,080
Stick on you like this? Like gum?

988
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:20,240
I like this.

989
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,680
You told me to stay stuck on you, okay?

990
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,240
Come stick closer. More.

991
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,560
Yes, Chef.

992
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,720
-Chef, I'm curious about something...
-What?

993
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:40,280
Is it that you don't want to do it,
or are you just holding it in?

994
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:43,880
No comment.

995
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:47,520
Why no comment? I'm really curious.

996
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:48,800
Hm? Hm?

997
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,320
Well, what do you think...

998
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,640
Am I not a man?
What kind of question is that?

999
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,840
Why? Why aren't you walking?

1000
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,640
Let's start like this.

1001
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,840
And go slowly...

1002
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,640
For a long, long time, Na Bong-sun.

1003
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,200
OH MY GHOST

1004
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:21,080
(I like Chef. A lot.)

1005
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:23,440
(I think it's all thanks to you.)

1006
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,040
This makes me feel strange.

1007
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,960
(Do you know what is the most dangerous
to a ghost like you?)

1008
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,240
Because I'm happy.

1009
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:32,280
It's feelings.
That's what makes you get greedy.

1010
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,080
Hey, can't you do it properly?

1011
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,600
I'm sorry, Chef.

1012
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,240
Of course, I can do it
with my eyes closed.

1013
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,480
Why don't you hire someone?
Instead of suffering through it.

1014
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,520
(Why are so many people curious about
Bong-sun these days?)

1015
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,120
(Let's go on a trip.)

1016
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:46,760
(I now want to go with you.
On an overnight trip.)
