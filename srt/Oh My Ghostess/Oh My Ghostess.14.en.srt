1
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,400
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,040
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,480
Hey, Kang Sun-woo. You're a total jerk.

4
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,560
-Oh, you...
-Yeah, it's me, you punk.

5
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,640
Wow, you look just fine.

6
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,360
You play around with an innocent girl
and kick her out.

7
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,280
You must be in great condition after that.

8
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:15,160
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,880
You want to know?

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,560
You really don't know what I'm talking
about, you awful punk!

11
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
Why did you do that to Na Bong-sun?

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,280
Why did you hurt that weak girl?

13
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,360
I...

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,479
I have never met anyone so bright and
positive besides my sister.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,200
What did you do to her that she shriveled
up like that overnight?

16
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,039
She won't even eat one spoonful of rice!

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
Are you even a human being?

18
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,560
How do you know that she isn't eating?

19
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,160
Because she's at our house, you jerk!

20
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,560
Be happy.

21
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
Yeah, Grandma.

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
What?

23
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
No, nothing's going on.

24
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm doing well.

25
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,680
What?

26
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
Who dropped by?

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,640
-Who?
-Na Bong-sun!

28
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
-Gosh...
-Chef...

29
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,400
So, you've been alive,

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,079
have you?

31
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,960
You only got this far when you ran off?

32
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,920
You purposely stayed here
so I'd come get you, didn't you?

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,040
-No, that's not it...
-I'm right.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,840
Don't be mistaken, Na Bong.

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,600
I didn't run over here because
I've forgiven you for lying to me.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
I was just so worried.

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,920
I'm holding you because my heart
told me to.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,840
So, I'll just hold you a bit for now...
I'll stay like this for a moment.

39
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,960
I missed you.

40
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,960
Don't talk like a mosquito.
I can't hear you at all.

41
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,800
I said, I missed you a lot.
I missed you so much, Chef.

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,720
I thought about it and I'm sure of
one thing.

43
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,440
Even before, I...

44
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,240
Long before you were ever possessed...

45
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,760
I watched over you, thought about you,
and worried about you.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,320
So, don't disappear from my sight again.

47
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm going to go crazy with worry.

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,480
Chef.

49
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,680
You got that?

50
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,440
Yes.

51
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,920
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 14

52
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,800
Your face has gotten so pale in the
past few days.

53
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,320
You should've eaten something.

54
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,840
What's with 'You are my Sunshine'?

55
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,320
How did you know about my blog?

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,159
I have my ways.

57
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,280
No matter how much you run,
you're in the palm of my hand.

58
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
Who is that son of the restaurant owner
to you? He got so worked up.

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,840
He just came at me and punched me.

60
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,560
What? Are you okay, Chef?

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,960
Thankfully, he was a lightweight.

62
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,720
Still, I got something out of being hit.

63
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,560
He told me where you were staying.

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,200
He and I have nothing going on.

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,960
When I was possessed, I think he was
just drawn to me without realizing why.

66
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,160
Because of his older sister.

67
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,280
You sure made fools out of many guys.

68
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,760
So who was it that I was drawn to?

69
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,760
No wonder...

70
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,800
There's no way a person can change
overnight like that.

71
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,960
What manic disorder?

72
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,240
I'm only asking because it came up.

73
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,240
Was it not you

74
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
who was on the swings
with me here at that time?

75
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,200
Swings?

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,280
Probably not...

77
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,840
Who was the one who got drunk at the
motel that I carried out?

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,760
The ghost.

79
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,600
What about at the MT when you got
trapped in the fridge

80
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,280
and I was going out of my mind? Even her?

81
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,120
Yes, that was the ghost.

82
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
What about catching the bike seat thief?

83
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
Oh, that was me! I did that!
That was me, Chef.

84
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,680
You must be proud, yeah.

85
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,320
You did well.

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,080
So what you're saying is...

87
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,160
The one who kept asking to do it,
the manic one...

88
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,160
That one wasn't you,
but it was the ghost, right?

89
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,000
Yes.

90
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,480
I'm going nuts.

91
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,080
I haven't even done anything wrong,
but I feel like a bad guy.

92
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,320
It's not like I cheated.

93
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,280
I had a love triangle with a ghost.

94
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
Still, if I think about it now...

95
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,800
You had no confidence before and
you were so introverted.

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,360
Then, you became such a bright person.

97
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,880
I think it was just the fact that you
changed that I liked.

98
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,160
In the beginning, I didn't like it because
you reminded me too much of my past self.

99
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,160
So, I pushed you harder.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,080
I admit I fell for the ghost.
She has a lot of charms.

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,640
She's quite cute.

102
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,960
If it weren't for my patience,
who knows...

103
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,480
You know that ghost?

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,160
She liked you... For real.

105
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,440
I guess that ghost has good taste in men.

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,520
Oh, that scared me.

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
What?

108
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,200
A ghost just happened to walk by.

109
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,680
What? A ghost?

110
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,360
Where? Hey, do you have to...

111
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Can't you just look on your own?
Why do you have to tell me?

112
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,080
You just want to scare me, don't you?

113
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,680
-No...
-I don't get startled easily.

114
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,760
-What's that?
-It's just me.

115
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm never going to let this hand go now.

116
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,000
It's not because I'm scared or anything.

117
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,600
Yes, Chef.

118
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,200
There's nothing there.

119
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
It was moving.

120
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,040
-Are you scared?
-No.

121
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:34,760
(In my opinion, I think he's trying to
cover up for the criminal.)

122
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,960
There must be some backdoor deal.

123
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,760
You're not coming back to Sun?

124
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,920
How can I go back after leaving like that?
How can I face them again?

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,400
All right.

126
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,960
Then stay here for now.
I'll look for some places for you.

127
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,960
I'm sure we'll be able to find a place
if we look.

128
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,800
-Okay.
-Go on in.

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,640
Be careful not to wake up the owner.

130
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,520
Okay.

131
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,480
Make sure to turn on your cell phone.

132
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,000
At least, let me know where you are, okay?

133
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,760
Yes, Chef. You should head back first.

134
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,800
No, I'm going to watch you go in first.

135
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,360
Okay. Get home safely.

136
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,760
-Hey.
-Oh my!

137
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,280
Why are you startled? Where have you been?

138
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,200
Oh, I just had some business to take
care of.

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,040
I told you not to go out,
but you sure don't listen.

140
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,040
Sit down.

141
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,120
I guess.

142
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,640
I found out something new.

143
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
What?

144
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Officer Choi could be involved in
Eun-hee's hit-and-run incident.

145
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,080
What!

146
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,920
What's that all about now?

147
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,600
I heard it from Officer Han.

148
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,720
Officer Han obtained evidence
of Officer Choi

149
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,600
covering up for the culprit.

150
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,600
He must've gotten his hands on something.

151
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,000
How did you hear that?

152
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,400
I saw a weak-looking female officer
at the police station so I possessed her.

153
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,600
You're still my favorite body to possess,
so don't get too jealous.

154
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
We shouldn't tell Chef yet, right?

155
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,600
No, not yet.

156
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,640
Wait until we have proof.

157
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,640
You're very worried about Chef,
aren't you?

158
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,640
Yes, I'm worried about Eun-hee too.

159
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,280
How about you? Are you okay?

160
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,120
About Chef...

161
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,920
Hey, I can't be worried about love
right now.

162
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,360
There might be a big secret related to
my death.

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,680
Goodness sakes...

164
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,920
(Shin Soon-ae has become a ghost and
is somewhere in the vicinity.)

165
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,200
(It seems she's no longer in
Na Bong-sun's body.)

166
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,720
(Where are you, Shin Soon-ae?)

167
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,640
-Officer Yang?
-Yes?

168
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,120
Yes...

169
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,920
Do you know if...

170
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,120
Someone has touched my desk?

171
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,800
I don't really know.
Why? Is something missing?

172
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,680
No, it's fine. Go back to sleep.

173
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
Okay.

174
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,640
RESUME

175
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Sunshine.

176
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,360
Then,

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,000
am I the sun?

178
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,480
NA BONG-SUN

179
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,280
Yes, Chef?

180
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,240
I was just checking to see if your
phone was on or not.

181
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,960
I just turned it on.

182
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,960
Okay, make sure to keep it charged too.

183
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,880
Don't keep it on vibrate and
miss calls either.

184
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,680
I haven't forgiven you a hundred percent.

185
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,120
So, you better keep being sorry to me
and being good to me, okay?

186
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,240
Yes, Chef. I will.

187
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,240
(Okay.)

188
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,600
-Oh, Chef...
-What?

189
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,720
What is it?

190
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,880
You rely on Officer Choi a lot, don't you?

191
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,560
And Eun-hee does, as well?

192
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,560
Of course. He is family. Why?

193
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,720
What's this? Why are you interested in
a married man, huh?

194
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,680
Are you possessed again?
Are you not Na Bong-sun?

195
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,080
No, that's not it.

196
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,200
Is Stalker doing well?

197
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,360
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

198
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,320
Gosh, what a lame way to change the topic.

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,640
You must be Na Bong-sun.

200
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,600
If you're not going to talk,
at least let me hear you breathe.

201
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,080
I thought you hung up.

202
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,040
-Okay.
-Yeah, now I hear you.

203
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,680
Now that I hear you breathe,
I feel strangely at peace.

204
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,280
Say something now, would you?

205
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,200
Na Bong...

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,320
You're not... Are you sleeping?

207
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,120
You're sleeping?

208
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,280
Hello? Are you sleeping?

209
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,480
She's sleeping... She is.

210
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,200
Gosh.

211
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Gosh...

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,440
BLACK BEAN PASTA

213
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,640
-Where's your apron?
-I'll put it on after.

214
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,360
Your face is so darn puffy.

215
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,520
You all know the special is
black bean pasta, right?

216
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,440
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

217
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,280
Cook the beans well so that it doesn't
have a bad aroma.

218
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,480
The pasta will have green tea powder.
Make the dough well.

219
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

220
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,120
Who has anything to add to that?

221
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,240
Me, Chef.

222
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,600
-Min-soo.
-Okay.

223
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,520
Due to your increasing popularity and
reputation, Chef...

224
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,040
We are experiencing a continued increase
in sales.

225
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,560
At this moment, accumulated fatigue due to
the shortage of manpower...

226
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes.

227
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Accumulated fatigue and...

228
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,240
I find the fact that we can't serve
high-quality dishes truly regrettable.

229
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,880
-Keep it short. Your point?
-I think we need to hire a rookie.

230
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
I did make some calls already, Chef.

231
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,880
I guess we can't keep the spot vacant
forever.

232
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,360
-Do it. Start interviewing.
-Already?

233
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,920
I think it's still too early.
Bong could still come back.

234
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,320
If Bong Bo Roo Bong comes back,
we can all work together.

235
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,280
That's right.

236
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,680
Besides, Chef always said we needed one
more Assistant Cook anyways.

237
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,360
If she comes back,
she can work with us too.

238
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,040
Yeah, you guys can do the interviews.
Hire someone if there's someone good.

239
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,640
However, choose based on attitude and
character.

240
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,800
All those degrees on the resume
are useless.

241
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,400
Hire the one with the right attitude.

242
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,200
Of course, Cordon and so on are
not important. Trust me.

243
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,520
Don't you think Chef seems different
than yesterday?

244
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,040
He looks like he's in great condition.

245
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,520
I'm sure it's because we took him out
and told him 'fighting.'

246
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Fighting!

247
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,720
Hey bro, it's me. When can I interview
those assistant cooks?

248
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,160
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

249
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,840
(Darn it. Where is it now?)

250
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,760
Officer Kang.

251
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,720
-Did you eat lunch?
-Yes, of course.

252
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,360
Look at the time.

253
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,440
Where's Officer Han?
I haven't seen him all day.

254
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,560
What? I'm not sure. I just got here.

255
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,480
Oh, my stomach. I have bad constipation.

256
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,359
Where could he be?

257
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,319
Hello, this is Officer Han Jin-goo from
Yongsan-gu branch office. Yes.

258
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:22,119
I was wondering if the results for the
fingerprint ID came out yet.

259
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
Oh, this afternoon?

260
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,040
Okay, please contact me when you have it.

261
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,960
Yes, thank you.

262
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,120
What's taking so long?
They're making me so anxious.

263
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,480
Oh my gosh, you shocked me.

264
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,360
Officer Choi, announce your presence.
You gave me such a scare.

265
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,920
How would I do that?

266
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,840
Should I make a cat sound? 'Meow.'

267
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,880
'Meow?' I suppose you don't need to.

268
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,880
What is it? What?

269
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,480
This is the break area.
I just came to rest.

270
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,800
Oh, break area. All right, take a break.

271
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,400
-Meow.
-See you.

272
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,440
-Your age?
-I'm 24.

273
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,720
Oh my! That's nice, that's nice.
Do you have a boyfriend?

274
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,360
I don't have one.

275
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,800
-She doesn't have one.
-No.

276
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,240
I don't have a boyfriend...

277
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,040
But I married early,
so I have a husband and baby son.

278
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,760
Thanks for coming.

279
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
You eat a lot, don't you?

280
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,240
Please, feel free to ask us questions.

281
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
When is lunch time and dinner time?

282
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,320
There's no set time.
It's just when Chef tells us to eat.

283
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,760
Then, when customers leave...

284
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,000
No, we cannot eat customers' leftovers.

285
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,200
You do not meet our qualifications.
Thank you for coming by.

286
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,960
-Next person, please.
-Yes.

287
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,080
Next!

288
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Gosh, seriously...

289
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,880
I'm so sick of this.

290
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,720
-You have the job!
-Job is yours!

291
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,800
Yes!

292
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,160
Please come in.

293
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,560
Nice to meet you. My name is Cho Hye-jin.

294
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,400
Welcome!

295
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,040
You're much better looking in real life
than on TV.

296
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,560
-Amazing.
-That's just a given.

297
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,520
Let's just work hard and learn lots.

298
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,040
-Yes, Sun-woo.
-Sun-woo?

299
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,440
You can't call him like that. He's Chef.

300
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,080
This is her first time in a kitchen,
so she's very fresh, Chef.

301
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,080
Okay.

302
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,320
You all know it's very busy for dinner.
Everyone needs to focus, okay?

303
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,720
Yes, Chef!

304
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,680
He's so charismatic. You're so cool!

305
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,440
Hey you... Um...

306
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,120
Isn't your outfit a little too tight?

307
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,920
It looks like it's too fitted.

308
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,760
The girl who worked here before
must've been kind of small and weak.

309
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Do you have anything else?

310
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,040
We'll have to order another one.
Let's just wear it for now.

311
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,160
This thing is a bit long too.

312
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,960
This thing right here...
Should I cut it in half?

313
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,560
Cut it? Cut it?
You sure are an excessive girl.

314
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,840
What should I do first?

315
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,080
Before that, we should get to know
each other first.

316
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,960
Do you know my name?

317
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,200
I'm the Sous Chef, also Heo Min-soo.

318
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,200
-I'm Dong-chul.
-You just go back to work.

319
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,800
Now, wait a minute Cho Hye-jin...
How long have you been so pretty?

320
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,080
Hey you, why don't you go over there and
get the snails over there?

321
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
-Sure.
-Yes.

322
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,360
Sure.

323
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,840
-Fry the bacon up well.
-Yes, Chef.

324
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Excuse me. This is kind of gross.

325
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,800
Can you take it for me?

326
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,760
Move it. Go wash the frying pan.

327
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,960
Oh, hey.

328
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,640
I'm washing a frying pan.

329
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,000
What? Oh no, what do I do?

330
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,360
-My gosh... My phone...
-Gosh... Hey.

331
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,000
Hey, how can you use a phone while
you're working?

332
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,040
-It's just...
-Chef.

333
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,000
I'll talk to her one on one about
this issue, Chef.

334
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,320
What do you think you're doing?

335
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,760
What the heck are you doing?

336
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm just speechless right now.

337
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,560
Why are you even here?
Is cooking a joke to you?

338
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,040
You have no understanding of ingredients.
You have no basic manners?

339
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,200
You say you want to cook?

340
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,640
Hey! I don't know anything.
That's why I'm here to learn.

341
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,280
Otherwise, who would do chores like this?

342
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,920
Now that I hear your side,
it sounds like we made a mistake.

343
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Get out.

344
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,240
-What?
-I said get out!

345
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,280
You don't fit well with us.

346
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,680
If you're not gone by the count of three,
I'll be cursing you out.

347
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,760
One, two...

348
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,040
Hey, let's just go change for now.

349
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,040
-Should we go?
-Yeah.

350
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,520
That crazy...

351
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,760
Move... Move, move!

352
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,640
Gosh, that bastard.
So annoying. You dare to fire me?

353
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,040
-What's wrong with me?
-Wow, she's attractive.

354
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,800
You did an awesome job hiring.
Totally character-based.

355
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
I thought she'd have good character
as she was intelligent and cultured.

356
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,960
Except for one tiny flaw of her being
unable to touch snails.

357
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,200
I ought to just...

358
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,040
Don't do interviews anymore.
I'm going to pick, got it?

359
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,960
Na Bong, can't you come back?

360
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,120
It's so hard to pick a new person,
it's hurting the business.

361
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
How are you going to take responsibility?

362
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,560
(I am sorry...)

363
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,880
If you're sorry, then why not reconsider?

364
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,120
You'll be embarrassed to the guys once.
What's the big deal?

365
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,600
Hey, I have a call. I'll call back.
Don't turn off your phone.

366
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,920
Oh my, who is this?

367
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,760
Officer Han, what's going on?

368
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,080
(Chef Kang,
I need to see you. It's urgent.)

369
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,240
What?

370
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
About what?

371
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,360
(Let's just meet up and talk.
It's regarding Eun-hee's accident.)

372
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,080
(Do not tell Officer Choi that
we're meeting.)

373
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,480
(Don't ever tell him.)

374
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Yes... Okay.

375
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,960
Where should I meet you?

376
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,320
(The fingerprint found on the broken
external hard drive piece)

377
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,480
(is a 99.9 percent match with
Choi Sung-jae's fingerprint.)

378
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,680
That bastard.

379
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,040
(Officer Han, where are you?)

380
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,040
Officer Choi, I'm out right now.
What is it?

381
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,200
(Ah, is that so?)

382
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,400
(I didn't see you around,
that's all. Okay.)

383
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,040
You're surprised, aren't you?

384
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,880
I was right next to you.

385
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,440
What brings you here?

386
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,160
Why not?

387
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,560
I could have some business in the area.

388
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,120
I suppose you could.

389
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,200
Hey...

390
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,960
What's this?

391
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
Is it something fun?

392
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,240
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE,
REPUBLIC OF KOREA

393
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,360
LATE HAN JIN-GOO

394
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,960
Officer Yang.

395
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,200
-Brother-in-law.
-Brother-in-law, you're here.

396
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,640
What happened? How?

397
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,920
I don't know either.
I'm not sure what's going on.

398
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,240
They say it's an accident caused
by speeding.

399
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,040
I just don't understand it,
even the location he was found in.

400
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,960
-Just before...
(-It's regarding Eun-hee's accident.)

401
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,720
(Do not tell Officer Choi that
we're meeting.)

402
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,160
(Don't ever tell him.)

403
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,640
What is it?

404
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,280
Nothing...

405
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,240
I just uttered nonsense words
out of shock.

406
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
Goodness.

407
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,320
-You should go offer condolences.
-Oh. Yes.

408
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,560
After you're done,
you should leave without me.

409
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:42,720
I have to talk to the hospital regarding
the funeral procedures.

410
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,800
His wife is a bit overwhelmed.

411
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,800
-Okay, I will.
-Yes.

412
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,920
Gosh, this woman.

413
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,240
I wanted to meet her another time
since my mind is so disturbed.

414
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,440
She forced me to come,
yet why isn't she here?

415
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,240
-Didn't she say she'd come in 5 minutes?
-Oh my. Hey...

416
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm really late, aren't I? I'm sorry.

417
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,480
I already ordered some shaved ice.
You can pay.

418
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,200
Wait, shaved ice isn't important.

419
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,360
My hands were trembling so much,
I couldn't drive.

420
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,960
I barely made it here by getting a cab.

421
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,080
Why? Did you day drink again?

422
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,320
Oh no, no, that's not it.

423
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,640
There's this Officer Han,
who is my son-in-law's partner.

424
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,480
I just heard that he died in an accident.

425
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,160
He was the cop that helped us a lot
when Eun-hee was in an accident.

426
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,160
He's... Dead? Your son-in-law's partner?

427
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,040
People say death can come at any time.
Life feels so futile.

428
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,400
You know, I'm going to do many
good deeds in my life.

429
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,960
That way I can go to heaven.

430
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,920
No, maybe if I do good with such a motive,
I end up in hell?

431
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,960
No, I don't know. It's too complicated.

432
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,760
Wow.

433
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,120
They cooked their red bean
so dramatically.

434
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,640
I wonder if they used Suntouch cookware.

435
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,520
What happened?

436
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,680
Officer Han too?

437
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,720
I think so.

438
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,640
Looking at the circumstantial evidence,
it's almost definitely Officer Choi.

439
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,640
This is all so ridiculous. It's appalling.

440
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,400
It makes me shudder too.

441
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,000
The Officer Choi I liked was such a
kind person with a good heart.

442
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,200
Although, at times, there was a
sadness behind his smiles.

443
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:17,400
Shouldn't we tell Chef now too?

444
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,920
We should, right?

445
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,560
Chef needs to look into something too.

446
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Huh?

447
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,080
How did the accident happen?

448
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,720
I heard it was caused by
sudden acceleration. Is it true?

449
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,600
I think so.

450
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,960
I can't believe it.

451
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,520
It hasn't even been long
since he was discharged from the hospital.

452
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,240
Officer Han was a good person.
I'm sure he's in a better place.

453
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,480
Let's believe that he is.

454
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,920
Still...

455
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,480
I keep feeling anxious. I feel something
bad might happen to Sung-jae.

456
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,600
Eun-hee.

457
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,080
Your brother is here.
What's there to be anxious about?

458
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,320
You're a strong kid.

459
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,440
I am not. I just pretend to be one.

460
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,600
-I do it for you, Mom and him.
-I know.

461
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,960
You have to be strong
in order to pretend too.

462
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,400
I believe in you.

463
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
Hold on.

464
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes.

465
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,400
(It's me, Chef.
I think I need to see you.)

466
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,800
Where are you?

467
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,200
-Chef.
-Yes. You came.

468
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,080
Yes, the thing is... We came together.

469
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,800
-Who?
-The ghost.

470
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,120
Really? She came too?

471
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,160
Yes, because she said she has
something important to tell you.

472
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Okay, then, let's sit first.

473
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,680
Sis.

474
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,640
-Sit.
-Okay.

475
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,400
Well...

476
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Take a seat.

477
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,920
-Over here.
-Let's sit. You too, Ghost.

478
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,320
All right. Please go ahead and talk.

479
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,360
You tell him first.

480
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,040
Oh...

481
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,120
About Eun-hee's...

482
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,560
Hit-and-run case...

483
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,040
She says Officer Choi could be involved.

484
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,040
What do you mean?

485
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,320
Brother-in-law involved in Eun-hee's case?
Why?

486
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,520
Officer Han's accident may not even
be an accident.

487
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,320
There's evidence of Officer Choi
covering up for

488
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,280
the culprit responsible for
Eun-hee's accident.

489
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,320
It was obtained by Officer Han
and he's been investigating it.

490
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,800
While he was...

491
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,440
(It's regarding Eun-hee's hit-and-run
accident.)

492
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,080
(Do not tell Officer Choi that
we're meeting.)

493
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,760
(Don't ever tell him.)

494
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,240
That's absurd. How...

495
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,720
On top of that, Sis here thinks Officer
Choi is also connected to her death.

496
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,160
Wait, wait, wait.

497
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,120
Let me think about this more.
I just can't comprehend...

498
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,280
What is this...

499
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,120
Why would my brother-in-law...

500
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,160
We have to figure that out now.

501
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,800
To that end,

502
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,440
there's something Chef needs to do.

503
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,960
-What is it?
-Diary.

504
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,760
The diary that was in
Officer Choi's desk drawer is gone.

505
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,360
I think there's something in there
he's trying to conceal.

506
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,960
That needs to be found.

507
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,800
Diary?

508
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,199
She says the diary needs to be found.

509
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,880
There's an important clue in it.

510
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,960
Diary? What diary?

511
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,000
Chef, are you okay?

512
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,360
No, I'm not okay.

513
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,280
What I heard just now...

514
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,760
I really... Really don't want to
believe it.

515
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,239
But, I actually received a call from
Officer Han before he died.

516
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,199
He wanted to meet without my
brother-in-law's knowledge.

517
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,360
Eun-hee...

518
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,800
Regarding Eun-hee's hit-and-run case.

519
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,199
I need to think about this more.

520
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,240
I want to see you home, but I'm sorry.

521
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,080
No, it's okay.

522
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Sorry.

523
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,080
This is absurd.

524
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,040
Brother-in-law has meant so much
to our family...

525
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,720
Let go of me, please.

526
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,760
Just let me die.

527
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,040
Choosing to live or die when we want to...

528
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,120
Humans don't have that kind of right.

529
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,640
Live even if you want to die.

530
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,960
Since you're not dead,

531
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
you should live your life.

532
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,480
Eun-hee!

533
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,520
Kang Eun-hee!

534
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,920
Hey... You.

535
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,280
Sun-woo...

536
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,800
It's all right. It's okay.

537
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,280
I'm busy here. What? Why?

538
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Sun-woo, we are getting married!

539
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
What a surprise.

540
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,120
He finally proposed to me. Look at this.

541
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,760
Really, Officer Choi?

542
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,840
Yes.

543
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:35,480
Well, that is, if you give me
permission to, Chef Kang.

544
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,400
Why wouldn't I?

545
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,720
Look how happy Eun-hee is?

546
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,840
Thanks, Officer Choi.

547
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,880
I'm not one who should say thank you
for allowing me to marry such a beauty.

548
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,040
Are you happy?

549
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,280
Gosh...

550
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:06,520
-Thank you for coming.
-You're working hard.

551
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,120
-Thanks.
-You can leave this way.

552
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,120
Brother-in-law!

553
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
You came back?

554
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,160
Yeah, just because...

555
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:33,400
I was feeling a bit down,
so I had a drink by myself.

556
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,840
I ended up here without realizing it.

557
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,080
Oh, I see.

558
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,720
I think I'll have to spend the night here.

559
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,320
I'll have to take on the role as
principal mourner.

560
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,400
You're taking on quite a lot.

561
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,960
You should head home, Brother-in-law.

562
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Brother-in-law.

563
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,280
Yes?

564
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,000
You know...

565
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,680
I depend on you a lot. Eun-hee too.

566
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,200
Of course, I know.
I depend on you a lot too.

567
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,000
You're my only family.

568
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,520
Okay, that's a relief then.

569
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,720
Okay, you should head back in.
I'll be going now.

570
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,960
Okay, bye.

571
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,360
Chef.

572
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:04,240
-Na Bong-sun.
-What a relief.

573
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,760
I thought I might have to wait all night.

574
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,440
What are you doing here?

575
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,320
Were you waiting out here the whole time?

576
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,640
I was just worried.

577
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,200
I wanted to make sure you got home safely.

578
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,960
I thought you might have a difficult time
if you were too drunk.

579
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,200
Would you have given me a piggy-back
if I were drunk?

580
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,480
Yes.

581
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,160
You're just pea-sized.

582
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,960
I'd rather get on Stalker's back.

583
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm a bit better than Stalker.

584
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:38,240
Are you happy to see me?
Yeah, I'm happy to see you too.

585
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,360
Chef, are you all right?

586
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,520
Should I bring you some honey water?

587
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,400
It's okay.

588
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,560
I had a drink to try and get drunk,
but I'm perfectly alert.

589
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,800
It's hard, isn't it Chef?

590
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,480
Yeah, it is.

591
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,960
My heart was uneasy for days because
of a pea-sized girl.

592
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,200
I thought I'd get some relief now.

593
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,320
Why does one thing keep happening
after another? Can't pull myself together.

594
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,800
You're probably suffering more than
I can even imagine.

595
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,280
He's been part of your family
for three years.

596
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,320
And I know what kind of sister Eun-hee
is to you.

597
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,880
Be strong, Chef...

598
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,040
Inner peace.

599
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,040
-What?
-Inner peace.

600
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,840
Even when you suffer,
it's an internal peace that takes over.

601
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Inner peace.

602
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,680
-This is from Kung Fu Panda.
-What is that?

603
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,920
You know how I went through a lot of
hardships when I was younger?

604
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,800
Every time I did, I would close my eyes.

605
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,800
Inner peace...

606
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,760
If you say that out loud,
my heart feels more calmer.

607
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,560
You have a crazy side to you too,
you know.

608
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,360
Anyways, it will all pass Chef.

609
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,320
Whether it's good things or sad things...

610
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,360
Yeah, you are right. I'm sure it'll pass.

611
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,760
But, you know... It's a relief you're
next to me in times like these.

612
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,400
-Should I give you a hug, Chef?
-Look at you.

613
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,560
Your personality has had a subtle change.

614
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
Are you sure you're Na Bong-sun?

615
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,040
Are you certain you're not possessed by
that ghost again?

616
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,960
No, it's me Na Bong-sun.

617
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,840
It's okay, Chef.

618
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,800
(She says the diary needs to be found.)

619
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,480
(There's an important clue in it.)

620
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,720
Sun-woo, what are you doing here at
this hour?

621
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,160
-Did you exercise?
-Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

622
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,200
Your husband's not home, right?

623
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,400
I think he's going to work

624
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,160
-directly from the hospital.
-Oh...

625
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,120
Where's Mom?

626
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,920
-Oh my! Sun-woo!
-Yes.

627
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,880
What are you doing here, Son?

628
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,440
Aren't you coming too often lately?

629
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,200
You're losing your mysteriousness
that way.

630
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,040
Mom, I'm so hungry right now.
Make me some toast.

631
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,680
-You're hungry?
-Yes, make it with Eun-hee.

632
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,880
Eun-hee, coach Mom before she burns it.

633
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,040
Okay, okay. Today, I'll get it right.

634
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,560
Don't worry.

635
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,840
-Do we even have bread?
-Yes, Mom. We should have some.

636
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,120
SKY ORPHANAGE

637
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,240
You came home?
I thought you were going straight to work.

638
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,520
I just wanted to get changed.

639
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,200
Are you okay?

640
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,000
Yeah, I'm feeling better.
I was just so shocked yesterday.

641
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,920
Can you come in and open a jam lid?
Mom's having trouble with it.

642
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,360
Oh sure.

643
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,000
Let's go!

644
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,400
Brother-in-law!

645
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,200
When did you get here?

646
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,280
A little while ago.
I had to pick up something in my room.

647
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,160
You must be tired from staying up
all night. You here to wash up?

648
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,800
Yes, I just felt a bit icky.

649
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,760
Okay, then wash up. I'll be going.

650
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,440
You're leaving?

651
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,560
Why? You said you want breakfast.

652
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,440
I'll have it next time.
I remembered I have to go to the market.

653
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,880
Then, what about that toast? Sun-woo!

654
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,840
That rotten kid. Who is he trying to fool?

655
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,360
What is it? Did Sun-woo leave?

656
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,040
He left!

657
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:01,160
Hey, the toast is burning.
The toast is burning again!

658
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,760
Oh, I can do this alone.
Why don't you rest?

659
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,360
No.

660
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,200
I'm a lot better now thanks to you.

661
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,080
I shouldn't continue burdening you,
but I have something to take care of.

662
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,640
No, don't worry.

663
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,360
Lately, I've been feeling restless.

664
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,680
And a bit low-spirited.

665
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,240
But having you around has been
quite comforting.

666
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,600
I haven't been bored at all.

667
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,640
It's as if you're my daughter.

668
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,280
Just think of me as your daughter.

669
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:43,320
My parents passed away when I was young.

670
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
So, I don't have memories of my father.

671
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,960
I hope that he was someone like you.

672
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,840
Goodness, thank you.

673
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,960
What a nice thing to hear.

674
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,800
But...

675
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:02,320
Why did your daughter...

676
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,800
It's just that in her picture,
she looked so happy.

677
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,880
She didn't look like the type to
do something like that to herself.

678
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,880
I know...

679
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,160
I still... Don't understand it.

680
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,880
I sometimes suppose

681
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,360
she must've had
something difficult to deal with.

682
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,240
Gosh...

683
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,840
If only I had picked up the phone
that day.

684
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,560
The phone?

685
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:38,560
She had called me that night,
but I couldn't pick up.

686
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,880
My batteries were dead.

687
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,200
Later, there was a voicemail and
I listened to it.

688
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,360
There was no one talking...
Just some strange sounds.

689
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,920
After that, I received a text from her.

690
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,960
Saying that she was sorry for leaving.

691
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,440
I can't get over the regret of not
picking up the phone.

692
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,760
So, I still haven't erased that message.

693
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:05,000
And I never turn off my phone now.

694
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,120
-Mr. Shin, can I see you for a moment?
-Sure, coming.

695
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,480
-Hold on.
-Okay.

696
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,880
Yes, Chef.

697
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,160
Young man who doesn't believe in ghosts,
here's a drink for you.

698
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,720
And here, young lady who sees ghosts.

699
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,360
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you.

700
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,800
This is your first time in a place
like this, right?

701
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,240
I'm sorry for the mess.

702
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,320
Oh no. It's quite fascinating.

703
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,640
All of that stuff in there isn't real,
right?

704
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,720
You're perceptive like a ghost.

705
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,440
Chef.

706
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,800
Ah, also please don't tell my mother
that I was here.

707
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,840
Don't worry, I won't.
I do have some common sense.

708
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,280
I'm in no position to tell her either.

709
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,720
I'd like to see the diary first.

710
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:09,800
Chef, she'd like to see the diary first.

711
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,160
Oh, also, I brought this with me.

712
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:28,440
My dad's cell phone?

713
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,680
Yeah. On the day that you died,

714
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,840
you left him a voicemail on this phone.

715
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,760
I thought it could be a clue.

716
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,280
Why don't you include me instead of
just talking among yourselves?

717
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,760
That would be irritatingly slow.
Telling you everything would take forever.

718
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,520
Hey, ghost...

719
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,160
-What?
-Possess my body.

720
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,560
I've never been in anyone
who looked like you.

721
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,800
You complain even when I offer.

722
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,880
Is this any time for you to picky,
you wench?

723
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
All right, I'll give it a go.

724
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,960
We can talk together now, Chef.

725
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,960
What clue could be in here?

726
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,520
-Wait!
-Huh?

727
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,480
That last page.

728
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,920
2368?

729
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,080
What is that? A pin number?

730
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,520
No, I don't recall a number like that.

731
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,400
Seeing as how it's the last thing I wrote

732
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,560
there's a good chance that it's something
I jotted down before I died.

733
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,760
Take a listen to this, as well.

734
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,440
It's a voicemail that you left.

735
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,880
I left this for my dad?

736
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,120
Yes. On August 15 at 11:10 p.m.,

737
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,280
you left this voicemail.

738
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,640
On that same night at 11:55 p.m.,

739
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:28,360
you sent an apology text that
seemed like a suicide note.

740
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,840
These sound like cell phone keypad tones.

741
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,680
-Keypad tones?
-Really?

742
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,680
I think I saw this on TV once.
They use it to catch criminals.

743
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,160
The tone is different for each button.

744
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,960
Then these button sounds...

745
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:46,560
Could be an attempt to send a number
of some sort?

746
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,440
SEOBINGGO-DONG SHAMAN HOUSE

747
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,440
535... 2368....

748
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,560
'535-2368.' These...

749
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,280
I'm sure these numbers are
connected somehow.

750
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:09,600
Could it be a phone number?

751
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,320
535-2368.

752
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,960
-I think it's a number in Gangnam.
-Gangnam?

753
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,240
(The number you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.)

754
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,560
The phone's not in service.

755
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,640
Crap. Then what could it be?

756
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:27,640
What could these seven digits mean?

757
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,840
Gosh, how can I not remember anything?

758
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,520
They're all probably my messages.

759
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,960
Don't strain too much.

760
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,240
Ma'am.

761
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,040
It's not like you're choosing to
not remember.

762
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,280
Maybe,

763
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,760
if this 5 is not a number,
but a letter 'OH'...

764
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:52,040
It could be read as 53'OH' dash 2368.

765
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,680
It could be a license plate number
of a car.

766
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,160
That's true! You're right!

767
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,760
-I think that's it!
-Good job, Na Bong-sun.

768
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,960
Then I'll go possess that cop now
and look up that plate number.

769
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,880
Since it'll be hard for a civilian.

770
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,360
What if the license plate belongs
to my brother-in-law?

771
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:16,600
What happens then?

772
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,640
Shouldn't we submit an official request
for investigation?

773
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,840
That is if Eun-hee's accident
and Soon-ae 's death are connected.

774
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,960
I really hope none of this is true.
I hope we are all wrong.

775
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,080
I hope so too.

776
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,760
I feel uneasy so I'd like you to
come with me.

777
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,240
If you don't like the storage room,
you can stay with me in my room.

778
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,120
I should still go say bye to Mister.

779
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,160
Okay.

780
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,920
-Call me.
-Okay.

781
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,480
Bye, Chef.

782
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,240
-Go in.
-Okay.

783
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:15,880
Hey, Sun-woo.

784
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,680
So-hyung, what's up?

785
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,240
I came to eat, but I thought I'd
see you before leaving.

786
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,200
I heard from Eun-hee.
I heard a lot happened.

787
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,760
You two should talk alone.

788
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,720
Still, it's a relief.
I'm sure you're feeling very disturbed.

789
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,720
It looks like we won't have to record for
a week because of Korean Thanksgiving.

790
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,440
We record the week after next.

791
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,320
So-hyung. I think...

792
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:47,960
I need to quit Chef vs. Chef.

793
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,120
Why? Is it because of Bong-sun?

794
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,960
Is it serious?
You're not in touch with her?

795
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,160
That's not it.

796
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,560
When I straighten everything out,
I'll tell you everything.

797
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:01,840
I'm very sorry. I hope you understand.

798
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,080
Okay.

799
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:07,280
Well, I know you wouldn't do this
for no reason.

800
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,280
I'll just do a written apology.

801
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,240
Or a... Resignation.

802
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,120
Thanks.

803
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,360
I'm sorry.
I'm sure you must be sadder than I am.

804
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:35,960
I don't know why, but I keep crying.

805
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,560
How could something like this happen? How?

806
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,160
To someone so kind like Officer Han...

807
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,720
Gosh, the heavens are so cold.

808
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,160
Officer Han!

809
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,840
Why is she stuck to him like a
piece of gum?

810
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,120
Get away, get away. Just come outside.

811
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,480
Oh... I'm sorry.

812
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:05,880
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

813
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:10,040
Officer Han!

814
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:16,880
Okay now...

815
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,240
Gosh, she has so many tears.

816
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:27,400
He'll think I'm weird if I go in now,
right?

817
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:29,480
Okay, wait.

818
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,480
That's good enough. Let's go.

819
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,640
Have you calmed down?

820
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,200
ENTER THE PASSWORD

821
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:59,160
(What the heck is her password?)

822
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,760
(Born in 1986, July 17.)

823
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:17,400
(0717.)

824
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,640
(That's not it.)

825
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,920
(What is it? Darn it.)

826
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:31,640
(I'm going nuts here. What is it?)

827
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,680
Gosh.

828
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,760
VEHICLE REGISTRANT PROFILE

829
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,200
-Na Bong-sun.
(-Yeah?)

830
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:01,360
I found out.

831
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,560
'535-2368.'

832
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,480
It was related to a car plate,
like we thought.

833
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:07,440
Officer Choi's car.

834
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,080
(Really?)

835
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,520
I was trying to tell people through my
diary and phone before I died.

836
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,280
Go and tell Chef, Na Bong-sun.

837
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,600
I'll go see you later. Okay.

838
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,080
I didn't know you had that much interest
in me, Officer Kang.

839
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,960
What was that about my car?

840
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,840
What are you so curious about?

841
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,200
I'm not curious... Goodbye.

842
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,080
You...

843
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,200
Who, exactly, are you?

844
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,560
You finally made an appearance...

845
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
Shin Soon-ae.
