1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,440
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,960
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,680
(Right.
I can't take a step back from here.)

4
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:51,520
(Chef is calling for me.
Waiting for me because he's concerned.)

5
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,960
(I've liked him so much all this time.)

6
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,320
(And how hard was it to earn his heart?)

7
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,680
(I'm only going to think about me.)

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,400
(Just this once.)

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,320
(I'm going to keep it.
I'll do whatever it takes...)

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,160
(To keep Chef's heart.)

11
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,039
-Chef!
-Where were you...

12
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,120
Why... Why are you like this?

13
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,440
Because of you, I lost all my sleep...

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,039
Oh goodness. This is trouble.

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,680
You've fallen for me so hard. Oh my.

16
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
Well it is hard to fall out
once you've fallen for me.

17
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,200
Sort of like a swamp.
I get it, so you can let go of me now.

18
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,880
No, I don't want to.
I don't want to be apart from you.

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,360
Well, what is this in the middle of
the road?

20
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,200
Are you manic again?

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,680
Before, you wouldn't even
let me touch you.

22
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,400
Going back and forth is your hobby.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,320
(What should we do?
Continue staying like this?)

24
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,280
(Yes.)

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,440
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 12

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,880
HOSPITAL

27
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,079
-Officer Han!
-Officer Choi.

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,560
Congratulations on your discharge.

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,240
What's with the tofu?

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,400
It's not like I was in prison.

31
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,560
They say cops should eat this when
they come out of the hospital.

32
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,320
I especially prepared organic tofu.

33
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,440
Organic?

34
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,880
I'll take your bag.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,200
The more I think about,
the more embarrassed I am.

36
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,079
How dare he rob a policeman?

37
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,880
I was too careless.

38
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,600
Once this guy gets caught,
I'll really get him good.

39
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,000
He put a smear on my career, as a cop.

40
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
I'll just kill him.

41
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,960
Aren't you hungry?

42
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,600
You must've suffered eating
hospital food all this time.

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,280
-Hangover soup.
-I'm in.

44
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,040
-Let's go eat that.
-Let's eat it.

45
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,600
The hospital wasn't my kind of place.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,120
Here's your blood sausage stew.

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,560
-Thank you.
-We'll enjoy it.

48
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,120
I was worried when I heard you were
in the hospital.

49
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,240
I'm very glad to see you like this,
Officer Han.

50
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,560
I'm glad to see you too, Mister.
Thank you.

51
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,240
-Yes, please eat a lot.
-Yes, we will.

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,920
Eat slowly, would you?

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,480
You were just discharged.
How is your appetite this good?

54
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,360
Hey, have you ever tried hospital food?
It's really bad.

55
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,480
The food here is really good.
I'm actually touched.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,400
Here, have some of mine.

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,840
You should give me meat.

58
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,600
I'm giving you meat. Here, here.

59
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,800
The more I think about it,
I feel so sorry to Eun-hee.

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,120
You know because of that CCTV...

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,600
There were no witnesses and
that was the last clue we had.

62
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,760
And I got robbed of it.

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,520
Does that make any sense to you? Does it?

64
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,920
No, you did everything that you could.

65
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
That's why I didn't even bring it up
to Eun-hee and my brother-in-law.

66
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,280
Don't worry too much about it.

67
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,360
How can I not?

68
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,760
-Eat, eat.
-Yes, you too.

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,800
-Hey, come on now!
-Huh?

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,360
Why are you carrying this?
You should get the others to do it.

71
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,880
You could hurt your back.

72
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,080
-I'm fine.
-You're mine now.

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,440
What?

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,600
You should value your body more.

75
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes, Chef. I'll do that.

76
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,680
-Let's go to the market together later.
-Yes.

77
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,840
But if we keep going together,
people might think it's odd.

78
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,680
So once I give you a sign,
say you're sick and going to the hospital.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,400
Okay, but where should
I say that I'm sick?

80
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,560
Should I say that I sprained my ankle?

81
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,320
Or since it's summer,
vomiting and diarrhea?

82
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,320
Pick whatever you want.

83
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,360
Okay, I'll pick.

84
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,360
-You feel a little different today.
-What?

85
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,560
This isn't a manic episode for sure.

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,320
Maybe a little spunky.

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,880
You are always prettiest when you're
in your neutral state. See you later.

88
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Yes, Chef.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,200
What the heck.

90
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,680
-What is it?
-Are you all here? You're all here?

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,480
They're doing what?

92
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,960
-They're doing what? What?
-Just be quiet.

93
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,320
I think Chef and Bong...

94
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,520
Are dating.

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,640
What the...

96
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,680
Why I ought to just...
You're saying nonsense this morning.

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,280
That makes absolutely no sense.

98
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Is Chef on drugs? Why would he date Bong?

99
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Ji-woong, I really do like you.

100
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,440
But, that doesn't sound right.

101
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,520
I know I'm right.

102
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,760
I saw it with my own eyes.

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,080
They were in front of the restrooms
and Chef says...

104
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,840
'Bong, you're spunky.'

105
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,800
-'See you later.'
-Move your head.

106
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,720
-Move your head.
-Okay, okay.

107
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,080
That could've happened because they
just bumped their heads together.

108
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,320
Who shows affection by doing this?

109
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,560
Is this an Andre Kim fashion show or what?

110
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,600
Min-soo, you're so frustrating.

111
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,720
The mood was, you know...
There was something romantic about it.

112
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
Just shut your mouth.

113
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,920
Just become a writer.

114
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,560
If you're going to make up fiction,
you should try something that's possible.

115
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,120
Hey, come here.

116
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,680
Do you really not know

117
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,840
who Chef's having a thing with these days?

118
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
Who's that?

119
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,600
They say it's the most suspicious right
under the lamp.

120
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,760
What are you going to do now, Ji-woong?
You'll have to let go of your goddess.

121
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Goddess... PD Lee?

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,840
Ding dong deng... Dong!

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,080
I got a feeling right here about
those two.

124
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,920
When it went to them...

125
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,360
I see they're finally getting together.

126
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,160
That's why I brought Bong back in
the car with me at that time.

127
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,840
-Ah...
-Really?

128
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,240
Isn't that just your imagination?
You're not certain.

129
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
I'm very certain.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,960
I've never been wrong before.

131
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,040
But what? Chef and Bong?

132
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,360
If Chef and Bong are really
in that kind of relationship...

133
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,159
Then I will... I...

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,680
I will live out my life as Eunuch Heo.

135
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,680
What the heck.

136
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,040
I'll go now and prepare for
beauty treatment.

137
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,520
I really want to castrate you.

138
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,560
Hey, get up. Let's eat this.

139
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
I went to a funeral and brought back
some funeral food.

140
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,200
Hey, stop being so foolish!

141
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,840
Even if you pine away like this,
it's not like the man of vitality knows.

142
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,800
Gosh...

143
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,640
You should've known your place.

144
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,200
Why did you bother sticking yourself into
a situation you don't belong in?

145
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,600
You're just a ghost.

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,679
I don't think you can resolve your
virgin grudge now.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,840
Let's just do the ritual for the dead.

148
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,120
I'll do my very best to make it painless
and easy. Okay?

149
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,040
Hey, is your mouth glued shut?

150
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,000
You used to talk all the time and
never keep your mouth shut.

151
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,480
You should respond when someone's
talking to you.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,400
Gosh, I don't know. Do what you want.

153
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,440
You can lie there and become a fossil
if you want.

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,080
Gosh, really.

155
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
NA BONG-SUN

156
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,400
CHEF KANG

157
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,320
DON'T EAT TOO MUCH.

158
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,760
OKAY.

159
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,920
It's tasty.

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,840
What is it? What is it?

161
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,200
-Who is it? Who is it?
-It's nothing.

162
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,040
Why would a full-grown man hide things
like that?

163
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,680
You got something good going on,
don't you?

164
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,440
-What do you mean? I said no.
-It's written all over your face.

165
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,520
Look! It says 'Currently Dating' here.

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,520
-Is it that good?
-I told you it's not true.

167
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,320
Why don't you believe me?

168
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,080
I'm done eating.

169
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm going to the market,
so you guys prepare.

170
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,360
Yes, Chef.

171
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,920
What? What is it?

172
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,840
I sprained my ankle before.

173
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,200
It's quite severe and
I think I should go to the hospital.

174
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,680
-Oh no! That's not good.
-Ouch!

175
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,240
We have so much to do after eating,
you darn Bong!

176
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Run there and come back quickly.

177
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,040
Yes, Sous Chef. I'm very sorry.

178
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
-Ouch! It hurts so much.
-What should we do?

179
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
-What do I do?
-What should we do?

180
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,600
It hurts so much.

181
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,160
Gosh, she is causing me such a headache!

182
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,000
-Wow, I just got goosebumps.
-What?

183
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,160
Did you see that foot acting?

184
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,000
When she was here,
she was grabbing her left leg.

185
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,880
But when she was leaving,
she was grabbing her right leg.

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,200
Sous Chef, I'm telling you she's
doing that to follow Chef.

187
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,920
You're wrong, you tenacious punk.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,880
You got it wrong! All wrong!

189
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,720
How do you plan on surviving
with so little sense?

190
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm telling you I really did see!

191
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,120
I said you're wrong! You old boy punk!

192
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,920
Is it too much?

193
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,800
That's good.

194
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,640
-Chef, I'll take that.
-It's fine. I'm strong.

195
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,920
Look at this muscle.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,240
Touch it, touch it.

197
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,200
-It's no joke, you know...
-Where?

198
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,080
What do you mean, where? Right here...
Oh, they are kind of hidden today.

199
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,240
It's usually no joke.

200
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,280
Oh, I just felt it again and
I think the muscles are here. So muscular.

201
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,480
-Right?
-Yes.

202
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,960
You should leave your hair down
when we're out.

203
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,200
-Yeah?
-You look pretty like that.

204
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,360
Oh, do I? Okay.

205
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,720
There you go. So pretty.

206
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,360
-Hey, Sun-woo!
-Oh, hey.

207
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,040
Buying ingredients?

208
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,960
-Aren't you being too much?
-Why?

209
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,680
You don't come by anymore.
Your affection for me must be gone.

210
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,480
I was busy, man.
Let's all get together someday.

211
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,040
But, why are you carrying all the bags?
Isn't it heavy?

212
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,000
If you brought your help,
you should make her work.

213
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,280
Chef, give it to me.

214
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,200
I had a cramp in my arm,
but I'm better now.

215
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,280
Why don't you tell her to go and
we can get some shaved ice?

216
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,160
Don't you have a restaurant to run?

217
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,680
It hasn't even been that long
since you've opened.

218
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,080
You should be thinking about selling
one more plate.

219
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,040
-Hurry up and go!
-I was just glad to see you, that's all.

220
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,480
I'll see you another time. Just go.

221
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,040
Nice of you to crap on us
after a long time.

222
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,080
Crap?

223
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,320
-Chef, I'm really okay.
-Forget it. Let's go.

224
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,360
Chef, let's not hold hands.

225
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,520
There are too many people here and
many of them seem to recognize you.

226
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
Who cares? Did we commit a crime?

227
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,880
What?

228
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,240
-And you like holding hands.
-What?

229
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,200
-Anyways, Chef, where are we going?
-Some place. You'll be quite impressed.

230
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
What?

231
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,840
Wait, what are we doing here?

232
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm not here to sell you
at a blood sausage place.

233
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,800
-We came to eat, of course.
-I can't really eat blood sausage stew.

234
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,920
What are you talking about? You said
your favorite dish is blood sausage stew.

235
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,040
-I said that?
-Yeah.

236
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,320
The food is here.

237
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,080
Bon appetit.

238
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,600
-Ma'am, it's best to eat this now, right?
-Yes, you should eat now.

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,080
-Eat.
-Yes, Chef.

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,960
It smells really good.

241
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,080
This is it right here... This taste.
It's really good.

242
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
-Go on and eat.
-Okay.

243
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,680
If you like it so much,
why aren't you eating?

244
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
I will.

245
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, you...

246
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,000
Here.

247
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
Oh...

248
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,920
Hey, don't you see my hand blushing?
Hurry up and eat.

249
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,720
Yes, Chef.

250
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
How is it? Amazing, right?

251
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,440
Yes, it's really good.

252
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,040
The aroma of the leeks and bean paste
is key.

253
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,720
You should eat more, Chef.

254
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
Here.

255
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,920
Wait, no, no.

256
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,960
I had a lot of noodles earlier. You eat.

257
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,560
-Okay.
-Eat lots.

258
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Yes, Chef.

259
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
It looks good.

260
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,400
Chef, can I use the restroom real quick?

261
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,720
-Sure, go ahead.
-Okay.

262
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,280
It's fine. I can handle this much.

263
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,840
If I can overcome blood sausage stew,
it'll be good for me too.

264
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,680
Since I have a weak stomach for it.

265
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,200
It's okay, Na Bong-sun. You're doing fine.

266
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,760
Fighting.

267
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
What took you so long? Hurry. Eat.

268
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,920
Oh Chef, you ate quite a bit.

269
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,240
I thought we might not have enough
so I ordered another serving.

270
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,800
-What?
-I did good, right?

271
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,880
Yes.

272
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,360
Oh, hey, So-hyung.

273
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,480
(Yeah, Friend. Unless I call you,
you never call me anymore.)

274
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,960
(Are you really going to be this way?)

275
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,960
No, I'm sorry. I've been busy.

276
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,760
(I'm just joking. Don't be scared.)

277
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,880
(Nothing important. We just have some
extra scenes we need to shoot.)

278
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,840
(The idea of going to your restaurant
to shoot was brought up.)

279
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
(What do you think? Will that work?)

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,280
If it's needed, then we should do it.

281
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
-When?
-Ma'am, get me scissors please.

282
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,480
I think tomorrow evening should be okay.

283
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,120
Okay then. Give me a call.

284
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,880
Yes.

285
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,800
Thank you.

286
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,240
Thanks for your hard work
on a hot day like today.

287
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,120
Oh, tomorrow, the Chef versus Chef team
will be here for a shoot.

288
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,360
So, be aware of that.

289
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,120
-Are we going to be on TV?
-Of course, we should be.

290
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,920
Look at you going overboard. So tacky.

291
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,600
Is being on TV a big deal?

292
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,160
A chef shouldn't like being on TV so much.

293
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,440
You'll become like Chef Marco,
the TV disease.

294
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,960
Even a doctor can't treat that.

295
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,160
Yes, Chef.

296
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,400
Tomorrow's appetizer will be
eggplant with tomato sauce.

297
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,839
-Na Bong.
-Yes?

298
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,720
Why don't you give it a try?

299
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,440
What?

300
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,400
-Me... Me?
-Why are you surprised?

301
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,800
How long do you
plan on holding onto the dishes?

302
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,240
-But, still... Me?
-Wait, I mean, Chef.

303
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
I don't think Bong is quite there yet.

304
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
That's why I'm saying give it a shot.
That's why.

305
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,000
Did I say this was permanent?

306
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,640
You need actual field experience
to improve your skills.

307
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,520
It's her first day as a chef,
so Jun, you help her out.

308
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,960
-Yes, Chef.
-Okay, dismissed.

309
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,560
Yes...

310
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,920
Bong Bo Roo.

311
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,920
-But...
-It'll be okay.

312
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,400
-I'll be watching.
-You can do it.

313
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,960
-I'll be watching you.
-Gosh...

314
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,040
What do you mean you can't?

315
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
I'm not ready yet.

316
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,920
And if I mess up,
I think it can really hurt the restaurant.

317
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,000
You said you can do a good job.

318
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,280
-What?
-Didn't you say it's a piece of cake?

319
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,280
Where did your sky-high confidence go?

320
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,320
Did your back and forth start again?

321
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,200
That... That's not what's going on.
Chef...

322
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,320
Na Bong-sun. You have talent.

323
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,920
More than enough to handle
the eggplant dish.

324
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,040
Burnt rice pollack soup and buckwheat
pancake. They were your dishes.

325
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,920
That... That's...

326
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,440
And do you think I can't differentiate
between personal and business?

327
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,120
You think I'd give out unfair chances
because of personal feelings?

328
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,400
Not at all. It's because I think you
deserve a chance.

329
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,920
-That's...
-Okay?

330
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,520
Okay? Why aren't you saying anything?

331
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,080
Na Bong-sun, you can do it, right?

332
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,160
Yes?

333
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,840
I'll do my best.

334
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,000
-Okay.
-Yes.

335
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,560
You're more than capable.

336
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,880
Are things going well?

337
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,280
Oh, Chef. Yes, I'm hard at work.

338
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,720
Working hard isn't enough.
It's got to taste good.

339
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,480
Make sure you don't use oil for that.
Otherwise, it'll absorb all the oil.

340
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,440
Oh, okay.

341
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,880
-Quite difficult, right?
-Yes.

342
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,520
You need to find it difficult for it
to be good.

343
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,040
-What about the sauce?
-I'm cooking it now.

344
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,160
Okay.

345
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,560
You don't need to dice the tomatoes
so small.

346
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,600
-It's better to keep a chunkier texture.
-Okay.

347
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,760
It's seasoned pretty well.
Let's add a bit more pepper.

348
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
-Make it spicy.
-Yes, Chef.

349
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,200
You should be all set with a little
more care.

350
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,720
Thank you.

351
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,520
My, this is tasty.

352
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,200
How did they broil it so well that it
doesn't have a bad meat smell?

353
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,240
Hey, do you want to have a piece?

354
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,760
You love broiled tender beef.

355
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,480
If you don't eat now,
I'm going to finish them all.

356
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,880
Hey, you're really not going to eat?

357
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,840
Aren't you hungry?

358
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Gosh,

359
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,280
I guess you really are deeply hurt.

360
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,200
You normally go crazy for food,
but now you aren't even interested.

361
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Who is it?

362
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,120
I'm not expecting anyone at this hour.

363
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,880
-Who is it?
-Hey, I came!

364
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,360
What brings you by at this hour?

365
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,520
I was on my way home,
but then I thought of you so.

366
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,320
I brought both beer and soju. Good, right?

367
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,360
Oh.

368
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,960
Oh my. You were drinking by yourself?

369
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,040
Rice cake and pancakes.
You had an ancestral rite today, right?

370
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,840
You didn't even call before coming by.
What's up?

371
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,160
You know I do need
such a thing as privacy.

372
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,920
I already know you don't have a boyfriend.
What privacy?

373
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
Be my drinking friend today.

374
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,840
I'm just feeling restless because
of Sun-woo.

375
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,120
Let's try to avoid talking about your son.

376
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,720
I'm sure he has something going on with
Bong-sook or whatever.

377
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,520
But what you said before...
The dead person fortune.

378
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,800
That just bothers me.

379
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,800
-Will something bad happen to Sun-woo?
-Hey.

380
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,360
Let's go out and eat.

381
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
-Why?
-I think that'll be better.

382
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,120
It's comfortable and we have lots to
munch on here.

383
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,120
The owner of the street vendor across
from here is good looking.

384
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,240
He looks like Jang Dong-gun.

385
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,920
-Jang Dong... Really?
-Yes, let's go, hurry.

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,560
-Leave this behind?
-Yes, leave it. Hurry.

387
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,480
-How old is he?
-What?

388
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,920
I miss you, Chef.

389
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,920
This isn't right.

390
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,120
Hey, I'm busy.

391
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:06,280
I really don't have time right now.

392
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,920
Eggplant... Oh, that's hot!

393
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,920
Oh, it's hot.

394
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,960
Ah... Hot.

395
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,840
Seriously,

396
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,760
I'm going crazy.

397
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,040
No, Na Bong-sun. I have to be stronger.

398
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,880
This is nothing... Crap.

399
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,280
Crap?

400
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,200
Crap... Seriously!

401
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,000
Who's going to call me Bong!

402
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,520
I'm Na Bong-sun!

403
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,200
Oh, that made me feel good.

404
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,920
Okay, let's just work a little harder
Na Bong-sun.

405
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,360
You're doing well.

406
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,240
Be a little stronger.

407
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,720
Please.

408
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,120
Be yummy.

409
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,120
I think it's all right.

410
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,200
Oh, you're home. You're late.

411
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Yeah.

412
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,160
There were many public grievances today.

413
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,400
You didn't go to bed.

414
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,520
How can I sleep when you're not home yet?

415
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,680
Oh dear, what happened to your hand?
Did you hurt yourself?

416
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,240
Yeah, a little bit.
I was trying to stop a fight.

417
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,160
Oh no, you should've been careful.
Let me take a look.

418
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,640
It's fine. It's nothing.

419
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,720
Let me see.
Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

420
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,040
It's okay.

421
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,160
I said it's okay.
Why are you making a fuss?

422
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,920
Sung-jae.

423
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,240
I'm sorry.

424
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,320
I'm too sensitive these days.

425
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,520
I'm really sorry.

426
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,600
Don't worry too much and sleep.
I'll wash up first.

427
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,640
Sung-jae.

428
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,680
You can show frustration to me
every now and then.

429
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,600
How can a person always be an angel?

430
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,240
But, don't get hurt.
I don't like it when you get hurt.

431
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,280
Okay,

432
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,440
I got it. Go to bed.

433
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,520
It's going to be so good.

434
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,080
TODAY'S SPECIAL
PASTA

435
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,600
One special and one eggplant!

436
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,080
It's on its way out.

437
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,960
One eggplant in tomato sauce
and one special.

438
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,920
-One Shrek and one eggplant.
-Okay.

439
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,960
-Dong-chul, hold this.
-Okay.

440
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,000
One Shrek pasta and one eggplant
in tomato sauce.

441
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,480
I think the eggplant is a success.

442
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,840
Yeah, the response is good and there are
many orders.

443
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,080
I tried some a little while ago.
It was really good.

444
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,600
Hey, Bong-sun. You really improved.

445
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,160
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

446
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,680
Hey, this is all because she learned by
looking over our shoulders.

447
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,800
Would this have been possible without
the great chef and sous chef?

448
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,920
Hey, Bong. These are not names of foods
here on this fan.

449
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,440
This is your face.

450
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,280
Yes, Sous Chef.

451
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,480
Stop talking so much.
Is the Shrek out for table three?

452
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,360
-Yes, Chef.
-Then, check it off!

453
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,480
Yes!

454
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,200
It's still lunch time. Keep your focus.

455
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
Yes, Chef.

456
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Give it to me.

457
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,360
It's okay.

458
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,080
I told you it would work out.

459
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,040
Yes, I did it Chef.

460
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,600
After cleaning dirty dishes,
how is it to serve your food on a plate?

461
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,600
-It feels exciting, doesn't it?
-Yes.

462
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,760
I still can't forget the first time
I did it.

463
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,400
You did well for the first step.

464
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,840
I'm proud of you, Na Bong-sun.

465
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,640
Thank you.

466
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,720
You have to keep up that confidence.

467
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,680
Let's have a congratulatory party after
the shoot.

468
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,040
-Yes, Chef.
-Okay.

469
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,800
It's just a restaurant shoot.
Why does the ENG need to be here?

470
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,800
Let's go.

471
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,920
You can just do this without me.
Why do you do things the hard way?

472
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,320
The shot looks better when you shoot it,
Director.

473
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,560
It's just a restaurant.
Who cares about the shot?

474
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,720
After it's done,
I'll buy you soybean noodles.

475
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,680
-Forget it. I don't want any.
-Then, buckwheat?

476
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,520
-Forget it.
-Then, cold noodles?

477
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,840
-I'll think about that.
-Okay, cold noodles.

478
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,720
Hoon, let's hurry it up!

479
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,560
-Hello, welcome.
-Hello.

480
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,880
-Oh, hello.
-Hello.

481
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,480
Hello, welcome.

482
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
-Hello.
-Welcome.

483
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,840
-It's so hot.
-Welcome.

484
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,040
-Hello.
-Oh, Chef Kang.

485
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,040
-Hello, thank you for working today.
-Oh, what's there for me to do.

486
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,400
Hurry up and move the boxes!
It's hot in here!

487
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,080
-Have you been well, Eun-hee?
-So-hyung, you're so awesome.

488
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,640
You really seem like a PD now.

489
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,640
Did I seem like a fake one all this time?

490
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,800
Oh, come on.

491
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,920
I should've invited you
to a shoot earlier.

492
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,480
-PD Lee, hello.
-Hello.

493
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,800
You've gotten prettier over
just a few days.

494
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,160
If you put on a wedding dress
at this point, it would just be game over.

495
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,000
I know it's empty words,
but thank you Min-soo.

496
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,120
-Thank you for shooting today.
-Of course, please ask me to do anything.

497
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,600
I will dedicate myself and help you
in any way that I can.

498
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,160
Hold on one moment.

499
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,480
You had some beauty stuck here.

500
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,320
-Your jewelry is so pretty.
-Thank you.

501
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,320
Thanks for having us today.

502
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,720
Bong-sun, have you been well?

503
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,720
Oh, hello.

504
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,720
-Thanks for having us.
-Yes.

505
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,160
What are you all doing? Get ready.

506
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,680
Yes, Chef!

507
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,640
-
-That little punk...

508
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,040
For the hall,
I think we can just follow naturally.

509
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,800
As for the kitchen,
can you get a full shot later on?

510
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,880
And I think we can use the 6mm for
the tight, cooking shots.

511
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,640
Yeah, I got it.
Let's just get it over with.

512
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,000
I shouldn't be on location for a shoot
like this. Why am I even here?

513
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,720
Why are you being like this?

514
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,360
You need to be here in order for us
to get nice shots.

515
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,080
Goodness PD Lee, you sure like nice shots.

516
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,560
Hey, she wants nice shots!

517
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,680
Hoon, have you finished setting up?

518
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,560
(Yes, it's almost done, sir!)

519
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,120
What are you doing there?
What do you mean it's almost done?

520
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,480
Why don't you move all those things there!

521
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,800
Organize those lines there. Hurry it up!

522
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,400
It's hot enough as it is.
Don't annoy me, okay!

523
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,160
(-Yes, yes.)
-Have some of this while you work.

524
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,080
Have some of this.

525
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
-Hey Bong!
-Yes?

526
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,480
What are you doing?
You should give it to the director first.

527
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,120
-Cold water has a hierarchy too.
-I'm sorry.

528
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,160
-Get some sense.
-Okay, I'm on it...

529
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,520
-Here, I'll do it.
-Okay.

530
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,280
And look at this thing getting in the way.
Get rid of it.

531
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,440
Yes, Sous Chef.

532
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,440
-Leave it, I'll move it.
-Huh?

533
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,800
-It's okay.
-Take care of the crew.

534
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,040
Okay.

535
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,960
Oh, that's sour. I don't want it.

536
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,800
Director, you're not going to check the
white balance?

537
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,960
I already checked it earlier.

538
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,880
What? Did you think I wouldn't have?

539
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,880
My goodness. So picky.

540
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,880
Gosh, young PD's these days act like they
know everything when they don't.

541
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,280
Hey, Hoon!

542
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,000
Where the heck is he now?

543
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:49,280
You're off somewhere on your phone again,
aren't you?

544
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,880
You better not get caught by me!

545
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,560
So hot...

546
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,360
Hey you, bring that battery box
over there.

547
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,320
-Hurry.
-Me? Battery?

548
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,240
The battery box!

549
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,400
-No.
-This one here?

550
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
No, the one in the corner.

551
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,160
-This one?
-No, the corner!

552
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,400
-No, don't you know 'corner'?
-Uh...

553
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,720
Is that the corner?

554
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
-Is this the one?
-Yes, that one.

555
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,080
Okay.

556
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,000
-Goodness sake...
-Why are you asking Bong-sun?

557
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,320
Oh, thank you so much.

558
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,480
Oh dear, oh dear.

559
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
-Oh, thank you so much.
-Thank you.

560
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,320
Just give it to me. So annoying.

561
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,480
How can you not know what a corner is?

562
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,520
Man, my nose is runny.

563
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,080
-Hey, hey.
-Yes?

564
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,200
Bring me one of those.

565
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,400
-Excuse me? Bring what?
-You know!

566
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,240
-Kleenex!
-Kleenex?

567
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,040
-My nose is runny. Can't you just tell?
-I'll bring it right away.

568
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,760
Gosh...

569
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,520
-This is what I deal with.
-Here you go.

570
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,560
Do you have any more tasks?

571
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,240
No... I don't.

572
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,920
-Come on.
-What?

573
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Don't do anything and sit here.
Do only what I tell you to.

574
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,840
-Chef, I'm really okay.
-I said sit down.

575
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,160
You're not even getting a break and
doing this.

576
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,360
If I knew it'd be like this,
I wouldn't have agreed to the shoot.

577
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,120
Hey, Heo Min-soo!

578
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,240
Aren't you going to
take care of your own family?

579
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,840
Because you keep looking down on Bong-sun,
other people are looking down on her too!

580
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,600
Yes, I'm sorry, Chef.

581
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,760
What do you mean, I looked down on her...

582
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,880
You're making me feel apologetic.

583
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,400
I'm just borrowing some help from
your employees, Chef Kang.

584
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,760
Why are you so upset?

585
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,480
Are you two dating or something?

586
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,960
Yes, we are dating.

587
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,680
So, don't treat her so carelessly.

588
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,080
Chef...

589
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,280
This is huge... Huge!

590
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,080
How could something big happen like this?

591
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,320
See, what did I say?

592
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,720
I told you the mood between them
was suspicious.

593
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,520
Why wouldn't you guys believe me?

594
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,520
It's a good thing.
We should congratulate them.

595
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,640
What is this? Did you already know?

596
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,960
I sort of caught on.

597
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,960
Gosh, you... You purposely didn't tell us,
didn't you?

598
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,000
You French jerk!

599
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,440
You saw me picking on Bong and
you wanted to screw me over.

600
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,880
So, you didn't tell me on purpose.

601
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,199
No, they're keeping it quiet so
why would I tell other people?

602
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,960
Such a cool logic you got there, you punk.

603
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,760
Why are you doing that, really?

604
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,159
What?

605
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,560
What do I do now?
Do I have to quit or what?

606
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,400
You don't have to do anything.
Why would you quit?

607
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,320
Grab him.

608
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,120
Jun, get the cutting board and knife.

609
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,800
-Eunuch Heo, take out your manhood.
-You promised!

610
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,800
-Hey, that tickles, that tickles!
-You promised.

611
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,480
Oh, what is it? Do you want some food?

612
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,239
Tell me. Just tell me.

613
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:48,199
If you want anything to eat,
I'll go out and get it for you.

614
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,400
I'll do it.

615
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,280
What?

616
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,280
I'll do the ritual for the dead.

617
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,960
Have you made up your mind now?

618
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,760
I want you to do it
so that it doesn't hurt too much.

619
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
Okay?

620
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,760
Okay... You got it.

621
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:17,040
I'll gather up all of the power I have.

622
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,520
I'll do my best to send you away quickly,
so you don't have to suffer as much.

623
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
Don't you worry.

624
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,400
All right, let's do it tomorrow.
Let's not drag it on too long.

625
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,120
Will you be okay with that?

626
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,800
Yeah.

627
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,240
I'll just visit my father and say goodbye
one last time.

628
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,320
-Chef Kang, sorry about before.
-

629
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,600
-Bye, good work.
-

630
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,080
-You worked hard Chef Kang.
-Yeah.

631
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,840
You were pretty cool today.

632
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,960
When was I ever not?

633
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,920
Today, you were a little bit more
than usual.

634
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,520
You were romantic too.

635
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,000
Love must change people.

636
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,880
Chang-gyu told me a long time ago.

637
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,120
He said when he liked a girl,
he'd make her rings out of flowers.

638
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,360
-But, you were the type to be a jerk
-Why are you bringing up the past?

639
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,920
You're done with work, right?

640
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,600
Let's go.
I'll buy you and Bong-sun drinks.

641
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,440
Both of us?

642
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,920
Hey, what's she doing?

643
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,720
Bong, Bong! Wait, wait!

644
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,400
Don't do that.

645
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:36,440
-Hey!
-I'm going to do it!

646
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,160
Hey, you know my specialty is
push and pull.

647
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,280
Must Bong-sun do heavy work like this?

648
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,640
Sous Chef, I can do this.

649
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,640
Hey, come on now.

650
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,480
-Come over here now.
-What?

651
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,840
-You can come here.
-What?

652
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,640
Sous Chef...

653
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,440
Wait, wait. Sit down. Sit down here.

654
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,960
Just stay put.

655
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,760
-You know you're precious to me, right?
-Yeah...

656
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:04,680
That's why I lectured you a lot and stuff,
because I wanted to train you.

657
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:07,040
And I gave you lots of work so that
you could get experience.

658
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,160
-Me too.
-Okay, okay.

659
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,320
You, be quiet.

660
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,920
So, you know my true feelings right?

661
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,960
Of course, I know how you feel.

662
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,520
Oh you know when you smile,
your eyes go like this like a dog...

663
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
-Like a puppy...
-Just like a puppy! So cute.

664
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:24,000
I'm not saying you're like a dog.
I'm saying you're like a puppy.

665
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,080
What is this?

666
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
I'll be good. I'll do my best.

667
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,160
Oh no, Sous Chef. I'll have to do better.

668
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,200
No, no. I'm going to do better.

669
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,400
You come over here.

670
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,200
-Over here.
-Thank you.

671
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,880
Oh, Chef.

672
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,880
You were surprised, right?

673
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,120
I wasn't planning on being open like that.

674
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,800
Are you okay, Chef?

675
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,600
I'm fine, of course.

676
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,960
I'm just feeling concerned because...

677
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:10,640
I spat it out without even talking to you.

678
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,600
Please understand. I'm just very rash.

679
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,960
You're okay, right?

680
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,520
Oh, yes.
I'm fine as long as you're okay with it.

681
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,320
You just choose the prettiest things
to say.

682
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,560
So-hyung would like to go for drinks.

683
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,520
-With you.
-What?

684
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,640
With me too?

685
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,080
She says she's sorry to you and
wants to resolve things.

686
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:38,880
Is that all right with you?

687
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,920
Yes.

688
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,760
Okay.

689
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,560
-What is it?
-Do you want this, Chef?

690
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,760
-Who gave this to you?
-Sous Chef.

691
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,680
Goodbye.

692
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,280
Thanks so much for everything today.

693
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,280
Here.

694
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,840
Since it's the first drink,
let's do a one-shot.

695
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,400
-Cheers.
-Okay.

696
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,200
Should I order you a beer or a cider?

697
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,480
No, I'll just drink this soju.

698
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,040
Goodness, you're whipped.

699
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,560
I'd be losing if I get envious.

700
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,520
Honestly, I am envious of you, Bong-sun.

701
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,440
Oh no, you're such a cool person PD Lee.

702
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,760
I've always been envious of you.

703
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,080
How could someone be so bright, confident,
and full of charm?

704
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,480
-Really?
-Yes.

705
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,240
Yes, really... For reals.

706
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:49,880
You'd have to be insincere in order for
me to find you annoying.

707
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,000
But, you just seem so sincere.
I can't dislike you.

708
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,080
I lose, Bong-sun.

709
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,800
-Here, pour me a shot.
-Oh, okay.

710
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,800
What's with you two?

711
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,000
Am I a ghost?

712
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,680
Goodness.

713
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,720
Here.

714
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,360
You really are treating me like I'm
a ghost.

715
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,040
-Yes, brother-in-law.
(-Yes, it's me. Where are you right now?)

716
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,880
I'm having drinks after work. What is it?

717
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:16,160
(Eun-hee went in for rehab treatment.)

718
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,760
(But, I have an emergency.)

719
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,600
(I was wondering if you could pick her up
and drive her home.)

720
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,440
Oh, yeah?

721
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,160
Okay, I will.

722
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,960
Okay, bye.

723
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,720
What is it?

724
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,440
Something came up for my brother-in-law

725
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,400
so it looks like I have to pick up
Eun-hee.

726
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,160
-What should I do?
-Oh, you should go.

727
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,480
Yeah, go.

728
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,120
Aren't you guys too eager to get rid
of me?

729
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,080
-Well, you have to go.
-I'm about to get annoyed.

730
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,600
-Don't drink too much.
-Okay.

731
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,800
-If she hits you, call me.
-Eh?

732
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,680
If she does, I'll hit her too.

733
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,200
-Oh my!
-She's not one to get hit lately.

734
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,920
Stop hanging around and just go.

735
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
Don't you see I have my drink and
I'm waiting?

736
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,440
-Okay.
-Drive safe.

737
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,480
-Bye.
-Okay.

738
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,240
-Here. I'll pour you a glass.
-Okay.

739
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,200
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

740
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,120
Okay, careful.

741
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
I feel so bad.
You came in a rush because of me.

742
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,040
Don't even mention it. It's fine.

743
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,720
You're my number one priority forever.

744
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,440
You're touched, right?

745
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,640
You have someone as your
number zero, right?

746
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,680
What?

747
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,360
-I'm sorry. You were surprised, right?
-Yes.

748
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,560
I don't know how things turned out
that way.

749
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,160
I feel like I've been bewitched
by a ghost.

750
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,800
You looked good.
Love makes even Kang Sun-woo dance.

751
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,120
What love? You're going overboard.

752
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,920
I'm right, though.
You had hearts in your eyes.

753
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,560
I had always liked Bong-sun,
so I'll cheer for you two.

754
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,160
I now have thousands of troops and horses.

755
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,920
Oh right,

756
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,240
don't tell Mom about it.
I don't know how she'll react.

757
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,520
Okay.

758
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,720
But, I think Mom has already noticed.

759
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,680
-She asked me what Bong-sun's like.
-Tell her you don't know, no matter what.

760
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,880
Just feign ignorance.

761
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,520
-Okay, I will.
-All right.

762
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,480
Dad.

763
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,600
Don't put things on the stove and
forget about it.

764
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,480
Once you're done at the end of the day,
make sure to turn off the gas.

765
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,080
Look at that again.

766
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,520
Turn that off already.

767
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,840
Oh right, the gas.

768
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,600
My dad listens well.

769
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,360
Don't go around lifting heavy things.

770
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,960
You can't go hurting your back.

771
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,200
Get Kyung-mo to do it if you can.

772
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,800
Oh yeah!

773
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,320
Hey, you punk.

774
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,520
You're all Dad has left now. Okay?

775
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,480
You need to grow up now.

776
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:29,760
I already know that you have a good heart.

777
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,240
Take good care of Dad.

778
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,160
-Kyung-mo.
-Yes, sir!

779
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,800
Hey, kid. Stop playing games.

780
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,040
You made me die!

781
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,840
Gosh, when's that kid going to grow up?

782
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,040
Just one last time...

783
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,040
I want to see him one last time.

784
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,200
That's weird.

785
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:36,640
We're on our second bottle.
I should be getting woozy by now.

786
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:39,160
Why am I not getting drunk at all?

787
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,800
Here... Yes.

788
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,200
-Let's drink.
-One-shot.

789
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:50,880
You drink really well.

790
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,240
Bong-sun, you should be my drinking buddy.

791
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,400
Yeah, this is good.

792
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,920
-Bong-sun.
-Yes?

793
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,440
You're very...

794
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,480
-Unique...
-Huh?

795
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,200
I think you're this way,
but you're that way.

796
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,880
I think you're that way,
but you're this way.

797
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
Sun-woo must've fallen for that about you.

798
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,960
-Am I right?
-Yes.

799
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,720
That is one of my charms.

800
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,960
Oh, are you drunk Bong-sun?

801
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,280
Oh no.

802
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:29,960
I'm just in a very good mood.
I'm not drunk at all.

803
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,240
I'm perfectly fine.

804
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,440
You're really cute when you're drunk.

805
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:40,080
Anyways, please forget the trouble that
I caused at the MT.

806
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,320
Clean slate.

807
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:45,200
And please make Sun-woo happy from now on.

808
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,200
Oh yes, of course.

809
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,760
You're so cute.

810
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,200
I just can't dislike you.

811
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,360
-Okay, okay. Yes.
-Yes.

812
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,800
Bong-sun, I'll take you home.

813
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,560
No PD Lee, I really am okay.
I'm really not drunk.

814
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,640
Do you want to see?

815
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,680
-See this?
-Oh my!

816
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:13,720
A drunk person can't do this for a long
time, but I can do it.

817
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,200
Are you really okay?

818
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,880
I'm really fine.

819
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,560
PD Lee.

820
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,280
People are all naturally selfish,
aren't they?

821
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,480
When you have enough problems of your own

822
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,400
and you're in a dire situation...

823
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,040
Then you wouldn't have time to
think of others, right?

824
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,760
People are like that, right?

825
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:40,920
Yes...

826
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,040
Because they are human.

827
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,560
That's true.

828
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Why? Because you feel sorry to me?

829
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,640
Yes.

830
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,600
I am sorry to you, PD Lee.

831
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:57,160
I'm sorry to the ghost and to Chef.

832
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,480
Yeah.

833
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:04,360
I'll just turn a blind eye this time.

834
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,800
Okay, I'll be on my way now PD Lee.

835
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,280
Good night.

836
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,760
Be careful on your way home.

837
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,960
I could get in trouble with Sun-woo.

838
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,400
Okay.

839
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,760
Bong-sun can be quite odd when
she's drunk.

840
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,840
I think I can see why Kang Sun-woo
fell for her.

841
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,560
(Everything is okay.)

842
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,400
(It will all work out.)

843
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,720
(I have a...)

844
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:41,960
(Bright future ahead of me.)

845
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,920
(Everything is okay.)

846
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,880
(It will all work out.)

847
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,560
That's right. It will all work out.

848
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,680
Have you ever been happier than
you are now?

849
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,440
What are you doing? Let's play together.

850
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,080
No! I won't play with you.

851
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,280
Why is Na Bong-sun always alone?

852
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,760
Is she mute?

853
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,120
Hey, she does respond in a small voice
like a mosquito every now and then.

854
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,640
Don't pay attention to her.

855
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,760
There's something gloomy about her.
I get a bad feeling.

856
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,440
-Me too.
-Let's go.

857
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,440
Okay.

858
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,440
I can't be happier than this.

859
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,880
Yeah, that's right.

860
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,560
Everything is okay.

861
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,160
It will all work out.

862
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,880
Na Bong-sun.

863
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,400
Oh, wait!

864
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:18,480
Wait, wait... Wait.

865
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,560
Didn't you come to see Chef?

866
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,760
No, I didn't.

867
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,320
I went to say my last farewell to my dad.

868
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,920
It was just by chance...

869
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,920
Are you all right?

870
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:46,920
Yes.

871
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,640
Hey, you're lucky.

872
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,840
You almost became my junior.

873
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,400
I saved you, Na Bong-sun.

874
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,760
Be careful of cars.

875
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,520
It's your loss if you cross over and die.

876
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,080
-I'm going now.
-Wait!

877
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,160
The thing is...

878
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,000
I'm sorry.

879
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,960
And thank you.

880
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,320
You're telling a cock and bull story.

881
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,520
What are you sorry about?

882
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,200
Who's the one that possessed someone
without permission and caused problems?

883
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,040
You're putting me to shame.

884
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,120
Na Bong-sun.

885
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,880
Be happy, please.

886
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,960
I'm really going now. Live well.

887
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,240
Wait, isn't this the car from before?

888
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:30,920
Officer Choi?

889
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,480
Shin Soon-ae.

890
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:39,680
Damn it. Damn bastard!

891
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,400
Hey you! Are you insane? Come out!

892
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:45,640
Hey! You're not coming out? Come out now!

893
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,880
Come out you punk. Right now!

894
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:49,560
Come out.

895
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,760
Oh my, you scared me!

896
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,440
It's about time I get used to this.

897
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,600
Gosh, I still get shocked every time.

898
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,960
Hey, did you see your father?

899
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,360
Did you get to say your farewell?

900
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,680
Hey... You!

901
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,400
Why is she so out of it?

902
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,680
Is it because you're sad after seeing
your dad?

903
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,120
My goodness.
Why would you go say bye to him?

904
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,520
It just hurts more.

905
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,600
-Sis.
-Yeah. What?

906
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,760
About the ritual for the dead...

907
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,240
I think I need to postpone the date.

908
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,160
What? Why? What now?

909
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,800
You don't think you can go because
of your dad?

910
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,120
No, not that.

911
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,480
Something seems a bit... Odd.

912
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,200
Odd? What seems odd?

913
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,160
Right now, you, wench, are the oddest one.

914
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,960
No.

915
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,520
He's not the person I knew.

916
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:22,040
I just get...

917
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,400
Strangely bad vibes.

918
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,800
I don't think I should just go away now.

919
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,720
What the heck are you saying?

920
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:37,680
You're not making excuses to avoid
the ritual for the dead, are you?

921
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:41,360
Or did you go meet that man of vitality?
It's your wavering heart, right?

922
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,600
That's not it.

923
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:45,120
That man...

924
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,080
He's trying to kill Na Bong-sun.

925
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,840
Who is? The man of vitality?

926
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,840
No.

927
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,480
Officer Choi.

928
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,640
Officer Choi...

929
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
You mean the man of vitality's
brother-in-law?

930
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,400
-Na Bong-sun!
-Yes, Chef.

931
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,960
Did you drink a lot?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

932
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,520
-Phone?
-Yes.

933
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,640
MISSED CALLS

934
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,440
You seem like you're in a bad mood.

935
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,760
-Did something happen with So-hyung?
-No, not at all.

936
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,760
No, I'm in a good mood.

937
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,760
-You are?
-Yes.

938
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,520
I worried for no reason.

939
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,480
Then go inside and make something.
I'm so hungry.

940
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,800
Oh, you haven't eaten anything yet.

941
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,280
What should I make, Chef?

942
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,680
-Rice?
-What?

943
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,360
That fried rice you made before.

944
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,120
Fried rice?

945
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:57,040
I thought you don't eat rice.

946
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,840
Yes, I told you that I don't eat it,
not that I can't eat it.

947
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,680
-What?
-I decided to start eating rice now.

948
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,080
Since avoiding it too much caused me
to get indigestion.

949
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,840
And didn't you say you're more of
the rice type?

950
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:13,320
I need to practice if I'm going to
eat rice with you.

951
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,280
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.
-Oh, okay.

952
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:18,920
It's all done.

953
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,600
The smell is pretty impressive.

954
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,520
Stalker ate it up like there's
no tomorrow.

955
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,640
Here.

956
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,880
It's pretty good.

957
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,560
Wow, as expected.
Whose student are you again?

958
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,960
Make me rice every now and then, okay?

959
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,320
Let me try to be more Korean now.

960
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,840
Okay.

961
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,920
What's wrong?

962
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,040
You've been weird since before.

963
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,920
No, I'm okay.

964
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,760
I don't think you're okay.

965
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,200
Are you sure nothing happened?

966
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,280
Yes, I'm just a little tired today.

967
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,560
Yeah, you were taken by surprise today.
You should be tired after all that.

968
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,920
Okay, let's eat fast and go out.

969
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,680
Go out where?

970
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,400
To get some air.

971
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,600
-Where is this?
-Can't you tell by looking? It's Namsan.

972
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:23,640
Didn't you say you wanted to go?

973
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,120
People from small towns always want
to visit Namsan and Building 63. So lame.

974
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:29,960
I wanted to?

975
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,440
You said that last time when we were
at the playground.

976
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,320
That you have many things
you haven't done.

977
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,800
You haven't been to Namsan.
You haven't been on a cruise and so on.

978
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,520
So I'm going to let you do all those,
okay?

979
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,160
Since they are your wishes.

980
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,200
I'm quite thoughtful, huh?

981
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:51,080
I usually don't pay attention to what
other people say.

982
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,800
But, I made sure to remember
what you said.

983
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,080
Are you impressed?

984
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,880
-Why? You're not?
-What?

985
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,960
-No, I like it.
-Then shall we go?

986
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,920
Although it's a bit tacky, there's got to
be a reason why many couples go there.

987
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,280
I'm really not the type to enjoy
night scenery like this.

988
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,040
Because of Na Bong-sun,
I'm doing all kinds of stuff.

989
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:26,920
Anyways, you're supposed to do these
things at places like this.

990
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,320
Like, take pictures and stuff.

991
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,600
-Come over here.
-Okay.

992
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,000
-With the night view...
-Oh...

993
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,200
Get ready.

994
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,400
Okay done.

995
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:51,680
So refreshing.

996
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,760
-It really is nice.
-It's because you're here with me.

997
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,640
It's important who you come with,
you know?

998
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,960
I'm saying I like it too because I came
here with you.

999
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,840
Okay.

1000
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,480
Do you know when I was really grateful
to you?

1001
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,640
You know when my old classmates came
to the restaurant?

1002
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,520
I went a little crazy.

1003
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:26,320
After I came to my senses...

1004
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,200
In all of my 33 years...

1005
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:35,320
I felt it was my most embarrassing,
pathetic, and lonely moment.

1006
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,880
But, that buckwheat pancake you made and
how you bothered me and conversed with me.

1007
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,200
It gave me comfort.

1008
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,800
(That wasn't me.)

1009
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,280
I've always been alone since I was young.

1010
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,400
Even when I was lonely and sad

1011
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:57,480
it became a habit to hide on my own and
hold it all in.

1012
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,960
But, having someone next to me...

1013
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,240
That alone was enough to console me.

1014
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,720
I learned that.

1015
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,320
(That wasn't me.)

1016
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,680
(The reason why Chef wants to eat rice...)

1017
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,680
(And the person who consoled Chef...)

1018
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:19,640
(None of it was me.)

1019
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,280
Thank you, Na Bong-sun.

1020
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,000
For making me want to do things
I've never wanted to do before.

1021
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,480
And for being by my side.

1022
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,600
(It's not me...)

1023
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:35,120
(It wasn't me.)

1024
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,400
Let's go.

1025
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,560
We are moving.

1026
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,520
The view is different on the way down.

1027
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,080
It's amazing.

1028
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,720
Since we did Namsan,
we'll do the cruise next time.

1029
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,920
It's pretty tacky, but what can I do?

1030
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,560
It's not.

1031
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,960
Oh, all right!

1032
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,320
You're not tacky. I'm just kidding.

1033
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:36,560
No need to get mad.

1034
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,320
I'm not the one that you like, Chef.

1035
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:43,920
What?

1036
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,960
What are you saying?
You're not the one I like?

1037
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,880
What are you saying, Na Bong-sun?

1038
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,520
It's a ghost.

1039
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:04,120
What?

1040
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,680
The one you like is a ghost.

1041
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,680
I... I...

1042
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,200
To be honest, I can see ghosts.

1043
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,080
And I had a ghost in my body.

1044
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:28,520
Do you know about possession that
people often talk about?

1045
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,040
So,

1046
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,480
the person that you liked...

1047
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,240
It was me possessed by that ghost.

1048
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,040
It's not me, as you see now.

1049
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,400
I'm sorry.

1050
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:04,160
Gosh.

1051
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:06,800
I'm sorry, Chef.

1052
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,880
I don't think I understand what you're
saying to me. I really don't.

1053
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,600
Stop crying and tell me.

1054
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:51,360
I'm sorry, Chef.

1055
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:52,800
Na Bong...

1056
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,480
OH MY GHOST
