1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,600
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,120
OH MY GHOST

3
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,160
OH MY GHOST

4
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,160
EPISODE 5

5
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,320
It seems to be a temporary shock
due to high blood pressure.

6
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,840
She should be fine.

7
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,840
Her immune system is not so good.

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,440
So, make sure she gets the nutrient
injections before leaving.

9
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,920
-Okay.
-Yes.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,880
-Thank you.
-Yes.

11
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,840
She sure is good at giving people a shock.

12
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,960
Gosh.

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,960
Are you okay? Are you fully awake now?

14
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,760
Yes, why are you here Chef?

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,600
Where am I anyway?

16
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,280
You're in the hospital.

17
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,199
You fainted from your high fever.

18
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,560
Fever?

19
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,640
Why didn't you do anything when you
had such a high fever like that?

20
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,160
What?

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,520
You should've gone to the hospital
or told me about it.

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Never mind... You did tell me.

23
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,600
But honestly, from my point of view, you
kept coming at me asking me to do it...

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,480
If someone who kept trying
to do it with you

25
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,640
suddenly says they're sick with a fever,
would you buy it?

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,760
What?

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,040
No...

28
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,480
JULY 17

29
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,720
17th...

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,080
It can't be.

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
Anyway, I am sorry.

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,079
The doctor says that your immune
system is not well.

33
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,400
Why don't you admit yourself and
take a few days off?

34
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
I'll look into a room for you. Wait here.

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,760
Where did she go off to?

36
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,040
Ah, she's not even well. Where did she go?

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,000
-Grandma.
(-Yeah, Sun...)

38
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,040
(What's going on?)

39
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,159
(Are you okay?)

40
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,400
No, I'm not okay Grandma.

41
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,240
The last thing I remember was falling
asleep at a bus stop.

42
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,920
But when I woke up,
it had been over two weeks.

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,760
Also, I don't look the same and
my room's not mine anymore.

44
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,080
I don't remember anything,
but people are saying I did things.

45
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,320
Grandma, I'm scared!

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,120
I don't know what's going on at all.

47
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,560
(My feeling was correct, after all.)

48
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,600
(Something was off the
last time we spoke.)

49
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,440
Grandma, we spoke on the phone? When?

50
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
(Listen carefully.)

51
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,280
(You've been taken over by a ghost...
I'm talking possession.)

52
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,400
Possession?

53
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
Oh, Chef!

54
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,200
Why are you alone? Where's Na Bong-sun?

55
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,280
What is it?
Is she in a very bad condition?

56
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
Was she admitted?

57
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,159
-She's not possibly...
-She's not here yet.

58
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,720
She has nowhere to go. Where is she?

59
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,320
Who? Na Bong-sun?

60
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,280
After taking all the strength out of me...

61
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,480
So, she's not dead right?

62
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,080
Ah, you gave me a scare there.

63
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,000
I did die rather suddenly, you know.

64
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,120
-She's probably at the sauna.
-She doesn't have any money!

65
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,880
All she has is a cell phone in her pocket.

66
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,720
I take her to the hospital and pay
the bill. What more do I have to do?

67
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
That's true.

68
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,920
This is just an injury from the workplace.
It's not like I'm her parent.

69
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,400
That's true, but you should've still
brought her here.

70
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,960
She's probably having a total meltdown.

71
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
I don't know. Forget about it.

72
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,200
Yeah, I don't know. Just forget it.

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,520
What a tempting image.

74
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,800
What good is it if the man of vitality
is sitting right in front of me?

75
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
I can't even lay a finger on him.

76
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,720
No, don't put it on. Don't put it on.

77
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,200
Hey now...

78
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,320
I'm so tired.

79
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,040
Did she have a place to sleep this
whole time and lie to me?

80
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,640
It was so scary when she was
attacking me like that.

81
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,400
I worry when she's here and
worry even when she's not here.

82
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,560
I can't do anything.
This is just frustrating.

83
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,600
This is not what I should be doing.
I don't have time right now.

84
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
I have to possess some other woman
and make something happen.

85
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,080
Okay, okay then...

86
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,640
So, the woman who has the highest
probability of success...

87
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,640
Gosh, that woman.
She sure has strong vitality.

88
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,960
Since things turned out this way,
it's all or nothing.

89
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,640
CHEF VERSUS CHEF

90
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,640
Okay, let's get started.

91
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,840
She's strong, very strong.

92
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh, what's wrong with this?

93
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
Hey,

94
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,720
am I going to lose everything I worked on?

95
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,800
Senior! You're hungry, right?

96
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:36,000
-I have some cup ramyun for you.
-What's wrong with this thing?

97
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,040
What's wrong with you now?

98
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,600
There...

99
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,040
What is it?

100
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,240
What is it... Just say it.

101
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:57,880
(Starting now, you have to stay alert
and protect your body.)

102
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:03,160
(A ghost that possessed you once will
want to go back in again.)

103
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,120
(Don't even look it in the eye
and pretend you don't notice it.)

104
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,920
(And if it still keeps coming back,
then you've got to come on strong.)

105
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,480
(Look at it straight in the eye.)

106
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,720
(And yell out loudly...
'I'm not a human to be messed with!')

107
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,440
So, it is you Bong-sun.

108
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,480
What are you doing here, at this hour?

109
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,040
Oh, I'm just...

110
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,960
Coffee.

111
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,560
Thank you, thank you.

112
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,960
There's no need for 'thank you'.
You were my ramyun friend, remember?

113
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,640
Excuse me? Ramyun friend?

114
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,640
A few days ago, at the convenience store.

115
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,120
You don't remember?

116
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,760
Oh, I do, I do... I think I remember.

117
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,400
That time, ramyun...

118
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,040
Will you be alright?

119
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,400
Your face looks very pale.

120
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,760
Is something wrong?

121
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,000
If I can help out, I will.

122
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
Ah, well...

123
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,960
You don't have to tell me,
if it's too difficult.

124
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,600
But if you're ever up for talking,
you can call me. Okay?

125
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,800
I'll get going now. Thank you.

126
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,280
Let's go together.
I'll drive you to the store.

127
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,520
Huh? The store?

128
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,400
Brother! Are you going to exercise?

129
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,200
How come you two are arriving together,
at this hour?

130
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
I was patrolling the area early
this morning.

131
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,320
She was sitting on a bench by herself.

132
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,720
To perform my duty of
protecting citizens...

133
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,760
I escorted her to the station
and then brought her here. Sir!

134
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,280
Bench?

135
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,240
You didn't spend the night in some...

136
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,640
You can go in now.

137
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,800
-Pardon?
-Go on in.

138
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,640
Thank you.

139
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,880
Brother-in-law, don't you think you're
working too hard lately?

140
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,360
Cut back on the night shifts.
Think of your health.

141
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,600
-Bye now.
-Bye.

142
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,400
Bye.

143
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,880
(Starting now, you have to stay alert
and protect your body.)

144
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,960
(A ghost that possessed you once will
want to go back in again.)

145
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hey, Na Bong.

146
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,320
Did you spend the night out on the street?
Is that what happened?

147
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,640
Oh, huh no. What happened is...

148
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,160
Wow, you have no fear.

149
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
What if something had happened to you?

150
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,760
You're not even feeling well.
Why'd you do that?

151
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,240
I told you to admit yourself and rest.
Why'd you run off?

152
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,240
It was just that... Um...

153
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,840
What's with you today?
Have you lost your soul overnight?

154
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,040
Hey, Na Bong.

155
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,760
-I'm sorry... I'm sorry.
-Hey...

156
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,640
Oh... Been a while since I heard that.

157
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,000
'I'm sorry.'

158
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,800
Hey, Bong!
It's a very good morning, right?

159
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,960
-Bong Bong Roo Bong!
-What is it?

160
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,960
What do you mean?
Why are you acting like this suddenly?

161
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,760
You said you love being touchy-feely
like this, remember?

162
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,840
No, I don't. I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

163
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
What's up with her?

164
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,160
She's walking out like that and
making me feel awkward.

165
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,120
Just recently, she was drunk and singing
out 'I want it, I want it'.

166
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,960
I want it?

167
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,240
'I want to go to your house!'

168
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,320
Wow, her humor is really trendy.

169
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,800
It's really something.

170
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,120
Your house... Wow.

171
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,080
Let's be on our toes today.

172
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,800
We have many reservations today.

173
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,240
Some of them are important customers.

174
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,040
-Min-soo, can you list them?
-Yes, Chef.

175
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,040
At 11:30, there are five reservations.

176
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
There's a group that wants a window table.

177
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,760
I think we can change their reservation
to 1:00 and seat them at table one.

178
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,360
Oh and at noon, Mr. and Mrs. Jean from
the Canadian embassy have a reservation.

179
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:37,720
Two people from their party of six are
vegetarian so we have to prepare for that.

180
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,960
They can eat milk, eggs, and cheese.

181
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,720
Okay. What do you think we should
prepare for the two vegetarians?

182
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,920
Since it's summer,
how about a tomato-based, eggplant pasta?

183
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,360
And since they're foreigners, maybe put
crushed red pepper if it suits their taste.

184
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,040
Sounds good, let's do that.

185
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,720
For the rest, we'll prepare pollack and
beef ribs.

186
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
So, check on the pickled pollack that
we got last time.

187
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,520
Oh right, Na Bong. You know those table
cloths that we got laundered before...

188
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,120
Na Bong... Na Bong-sun!

189
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,360
Yes?

190
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,360
I'm sorry, Chef. Yes, yes?

191
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,800
Have the clean table cloths come in?

192
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,080
I'll go check on that right now.
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
Sorry, I'll go check on it quickly. Sorry.

194
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,200
She stopped that for a bit and now
the 'I'm sorry' is starting up again.

195
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,960
It's strange that she's always sleepy too.

196
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,320
I'm getting the feeling that she's going
back to the old Bong.

197
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,080
Why is there no happy medium with her?
I was just starting to like the new her.

198
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,760
Is she playing us?

199
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,120
Is she putting on a show,
going back and forth?

200
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Be quiet. Stop saying nonsense and work.
Today's going to be a war zone.

201
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,400
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

202
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,760
Do you really think Bong-sun's okay?
She doesn't look so good.

203
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,560
(Pretend you don't notice it.)

204
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:08,240
(Don't even look it in the eye and
don't talk to it.)

205
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
You look good, Na Bong-sun.
Are you okay now?

206
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,680
Is your fever down?

207
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,880
I know you can hear me.
Why are you pretending you can't?

208
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,040
I know you can see me.
You can see me, right?

209
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,599
Can't you see me?

210
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,480
-I'm sure you see me.
-Our Father who art in heaven,

211
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,280
-hallowed be thy name...
-Hey now... That doesn't work.

212
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,640
By the second year, I overcame that.

213
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,240
You will be done, on Earth...

214
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,120
I'm telling you it doesn't work,
Na Bong-sun!

215
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,120
Sous Chef, I'm... I'm so sorry.

216
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,320
What are you doing?
Hurry up and put the table cloths out.

217
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,960
-Sorry.
-Na Bong-sun!

218
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,320
Just listen to me!

219
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,240
Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun. Hello?

220
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,440
-I can't hear.
-Na Bong-sun?

221
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,360
Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun!

222
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,040
Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun!

223
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,000
-Hey, Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun!
-I can't hear you. I can't hear.

224
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,000
Don't know, don't know, don't know.
Can't hear you.

225
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,520
-I can't hear you.
-Hey, Na Bong-sun!

226
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,880
-Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun!
-Can't hear, can't hear...

227
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,080
I like it medium-rare.

228
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,440
They have a real Italian chef.

229
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,600
Here it is. Your pasta is ready.

230
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,760
Please enjoy.

231
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,720
Eun-hee, I didn't use my day off.

232
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,480
Can you just give me money instead?

233
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,600
And not tell your brother?

234
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,960
-Not tell him?
-Yeah.

235
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,080
Welcome!

236
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,320
Oh my God!

237
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
I'm happy...

238
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,960
Uh, vegetarian... Vegetarian!

239
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,880
Oh, salad good. Salad good.

240
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,240
Uh...

241
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,560
Welcome, Ambassador!

242
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,800
My friend, good to see you again.

243
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,520
Good to see you again. Hi Jenna.

244
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,240
-Hi, nice to see you.
-Nice to see you.

245
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,200
My friends.

246
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,560
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

247
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,000
How was your trip to Canada?

248
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Oh it was great.
The weather was wonderful.

249
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
Oh really? That sounds good.

250
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,160
-Please get a seat over there.
-Oh, you have our table?

251
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,960
-Yes.
-Wonderful.

252
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,440
My favorite.

253
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,560
-Take this to table three!
-Yes, Chef.

254
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,600
Table 5, two pollack, two beef,
two eggplant and one salmon salad.

255
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,160
-Jun, you get the salad.
-Yes, Chef.

256
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,800
-Min-soo, get the pollack and eggplant.
-Yes, Chef.

257
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
-Ji-woong, you cover Min-soo.
-Yes.

258
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
-I'll do the beef. Dong-chul, bring it.
-Okay.

259
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Since there are two pasta orders,
let's do them together.

260
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,960
-Okay, Chef.
-Na Bong!

261
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,680
Finish the dishes and take charge
of the hall.

262
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,640
Okay.

263
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,760
-Okay, fire!
-Fire!

264
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
-Jun.
-Yes?

265
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,360
-Slice that salmon thin, okay?
-Yes, Chef.

266
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,240
Gosh.

267
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,120
Is the torch broken or is it out of gas?

268
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
-Na Bong!
-Yes, Chef.

269
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,240
Go to the basement and get a torch
and a butane gas.

270
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,480
Yes, Chef.

271
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,880
Na Bong-sun, don't be that way and
hear me out.

272
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,240
I've followed you around enough for you
to know that I'm not an evil spirit.

273
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,280
Two and a half years ago,
I was a human just like you.

274
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,120
I'm a good-natured ghost.

275
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Hey.

276
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,960
After being in your body for two weeks,
I thought we developed a bond.

277
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,240
Aren't you being too harsh?

278
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
How can you just ignore me like this?
Making a talking ghost feel awkward.

279
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,280
(And if it still keeps coming back,
then you've got to come on strong.)

280
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,880
(Look at it straight in the eye.)

281
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,200
(And yell out loudly...
'I'm not a human to be messed with!')

282
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,680
Wow... Are you looking at me?

283
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,960
That's right! Eye contact is good.

284
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,080
I... I'm not someone to be messed...

285
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,320
Let me be blunt and ask you for a favor.

286
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,480
I'm only asking because I'm in a jam.
Let me borrow your body just once more.

287
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,240
It's a very urgent situation.

288
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,720
Please, just one more time.

289
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,360
No, no. Never ever!

290
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,080
Hey, hey. What's with you, huh?

291
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,600
You... You really can't.
Don't even try to mess with me.

292
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,000
-I won't ever let you possess me again.
-Hey...

293
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,120
-Don't come, don't come.
-Calm down, calm down...

294
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,600
-Na Bong-sun!
-Gosh!

295
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,280
How was your meal?

296
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,800
-It's great, thanks.
-Delicious.

297
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,040
Thank you. What about the steak?

298
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,400
-It was very good.
-Very good?

299
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,320
Thank you.

300
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,400
If I knew I'd be in this situation,
I would've studied English more in school.

301
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,720
I look like a foreign person, you know.

302
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,440
When foreign people come here,
I don't even look at them.

303
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
I'm scared that they might talk to me.

304
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,280
Hey, hey. Is it a shameful thing for a
Korean not to be able to speak English?

305
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,320
If they want to eat the food,
they can speak Korean.

306
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,120
You don't have to feel small about it.

307
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,240
Then, why don't you ever go out in
the hall?

308
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,920
Who... Me?

309
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,360
Really?

310
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,360
I just never found the need to.
You think it's because I'm scared, Cordon?

311
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,200
If you say so...

312
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,840
'If you say so'...

313
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,480
You're so rude, the way you laugh.

314
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
Wait,

315
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,400
I smell something burning.

316
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,520
Yeah really, the stoves are all off.
What is this?

317
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,280
-What is it?
-What is that white stuff over there?

318
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,280
Isn't that smoke?

319
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,960
Chef, there's a fire... Fire!

320
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,000
-There's a fire.
-Get everyone out.

321
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,040
-Get out!
-Get out of here.

322
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Eun-hee, get out of here.

323
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,720
-Get out quickly.
-Sun-woo!

324
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,200
Everyone, get out of here. Over here.

325
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,720
It's down here!

326
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,360
Move, move!

327
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,800
Why isn't the water coming out?

328
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,240
What is this?

329
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,800
Out of the way. Move!

330
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,960
FIRE

331
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,960
911 EMERGENCY SERVICES

332
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
KOREAN FOOD

333
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,520
Dad.

334
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,920
-Yeah?
-Mail.

335
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,080
Leave it there.

336
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,480
There must be a fire.
I saw a fire truck drive by.

337
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,520
Really?

338
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,360
I don't think it's a big fire though.
There was only one truck.

339
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,760
If it were a big fire,
that'd really be something to see.

340
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,320
Goodness... You really are so immature.

341
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,920
Hey kid, is that anything a 26-year old
should be saying?

342
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,440
What? It's true that fights and fires
are usually the most fun to watch.

343
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,920
When the beauty parlor lady and the pub
lady got in a fight, you went to look too.

344
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,840
I didn't go to look for fun.
I went to go and stop them.

345
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,200
Whatever the case...

346
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,880
You even flirted with the beauty parlor
lady while you were there.

347
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,720
What, kid? Flirt with who?
What are you saying?

348
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,080
I already know.

349
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,920
I already figured it out when
she did my hair for free.

350
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,600
Sometimes you're sly.

351
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,400
Whatever, I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

352
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,680
That punk. What is he talking about?

353
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,560
When is he going to grow up?

354
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
(That's not okay.)

355
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,040
(From now on, you should drink with me.
Don't drink alone.)

356
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,960
I wonder if she's busy.

357
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I haven't seen her at all yesterday
or today.

358
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,960
Hey.

359
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
Hey!

360
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,760
You...

361
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,280
What exactly were you doing?

362
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,480
How, exactly, did you...
My heart is beating too fast.

363
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,960
How, exactly, did the fire start?

364
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,520
What if it had been a big fire?
We'd all be barbecue pork!

365
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
Look at the state of this storage room.

366
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,680
-Do you realize the cost...
-It's fine...

367
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,000
Let's hear it. What happened?

368
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,400
Is your mouth glued shut?

369
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,200
-Chef's asking you, what happened!
-Shut up!

370
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Tell me.

371
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,280
I'm sorry, Chef. I'm truly sorry.

372
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,840
Hi, Doctor Hong. Yes, it's Kang Sun-woo.

373
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,160
Yes, have you been well?

374
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,640
Yes, I should've kept in touch more often.

375
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,640
I have been busy.

376
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:02,280
It's just that I had something to
ask you, Doctor.

377
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,920
Hey, Na Bong-sun.

378
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,400
You acted awfully crazy.

379
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
Why would you wave around a flame there?

380
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,360
What did I do to you, exactly?

381
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,600
That's why...

382
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,960
That's why I'm saying you should
get away from me. Okay?

383
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,040
I'm scared of you.

384
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,040
I'm afraid of being possessed.

385
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,240
I'm scared that others will see me
as another person.

386
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,360
I hate it.

387
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,280
So, don't show up in front of me.

388
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,680
Please, just leave me alone!

389
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,840
What did I do?

390
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,720
It's not like I'm doing it because
I want to.

391
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,000
That mean girl.

392
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,960
Dad,

393
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,440
have you been well?

394
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,160
It's been two days, right?

395
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,680
-Gosh.
-You haven't been drinking, right?

396
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,040
You have to keep your promise.
You can't break it.

397
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Sun-woo...

398
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,000
Are you really okay?
You must've been startled.

399
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,760
I'm really okay.
I must be used to these things.

400
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,840
Leave the clean-up to everyone else
and you go home.

401
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,440
There's still a smoky smell in the air
and it's not good for you.

402
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,320
I have somewhere I have to go.

403
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,680
Yes, Mom.

404
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,960
What, a fire?

405
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,680
So, was anyone hurt?

406
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,920
Oh just barely.

407
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,200
Yes... I know it's a relief.

408
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,200
Okay, fine! I'll call later.

409
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,640
What is it? There was a fire?

410
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,360
Where? At the restaurant?

411
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,640
They say they put it out quickly.

412
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,080
I'm telling you something's not good
for him this year.

413
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,240
That's why I got a talisman and did
the ancestral rites.

414
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,680
Oh my, now that I think about it...

415
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,440
Because I did the ancestral rite with you,
the fire must've been a small one.

416
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,480
Right, friend?

417
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,040
Yes, of course that's true.

418
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,760
Thank you! What would I have done
without you?

419
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,360
What's this?

420
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,600
Oh, my lecture payment came in.

421
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,360
-Lecture payment?
-Yeah.

422
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,720
How much do you get for that?

423
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,280
It's not much, 500,000 won.

424
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,600
That's what I thought.

425
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,920
By the way, about your daughter...

426
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,240
I think it'd be best if she got pregnant
very soon.

427
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,200
It's not that there isn't a way.

428
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:22,080
For example, you can do a ceremony
to the Samshin Grandmother.

429
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,960
Then, we should do it.

430
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,800
It's nothing to fancy.
We just need to go to that house.

431
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,760
-It costs a lot to travel there.
-How much?

432
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,360
-500,000 won.
-500,000 won?

433
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,320
Oh, this works out great.

434
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,840
I'll just give this money I just received
over to you.

435
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,320
I'll do it. Let's do it.

436
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,360
I already feel like a grandma. It's weird.

437
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,880
Imagine how cute the baby will be if it
looks like my daughter with round eyes.

438
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,640
Oh, I'm so excited.

439
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,880
Me too... I'm excited.

440
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Chef, were you looking for me?

441
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,600
-Get in.
-Pardon?

442
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,280
Get in... We're going somewhere.

443
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,760
Where?

444
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,920
Just get in already.
It's not like I'm going to sell you off.

445
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,480
Strange.

446
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,400
Uh... Chef, I'm really sorry.

447
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:39,360
Instead of paying me,
you can cover the loss of what...

448
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,520
Forget it. I'm not money crazy.

449
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,360
You've got me all wrong.

450
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,960
Where are we going right now anyway?

451
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,040
For the restoration and welfare of my
employee.

452
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,440
What?

453
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,960
From what I can tell,
you're not normal right now.

454
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,800
I could pretend not to notice.

455
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,880
But, it could present more problems
later when we're working.

456
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,440
Just think of it as a health exam.

457
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,720
Okay.

458
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,920
Honestly, this is something only big
corporations or foreign companies do.

459
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,720
Just know that you have a good boss.

460
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,800
Who does this for an employee that set
the workplace on fire?

461
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,280
I'm so sorry, Chef. I really am.

462
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
I got it, you're sorry.
Lean back. I can't see the side mirror.

463
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,960
Oh, okay... How should I...

464
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,240
Should I go back some more?

465
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,560
HONG'S NEUROPSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

466
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,920
This isn't going to examine anything
in particular.

467
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,800
Think of it as it putting a stethoscope
on your brain.

468
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,480
Okay then, let's begin.

469
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,480
Okay, breathe in.

470
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Breathe out...

471
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,280
Breathe in. Breathe out...

472
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,120
Right now! How do you feel?

473
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,680
Well, just normal.

474
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,120
Okay, just normal...

475
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,720
You're doing well. Okay again...

476
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,720
Are you okay, Doctor?

477
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,960
Magnesium. Magnesium.

478
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,440
My grandmother passed away.

479
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,040
So I couldn't sleep for a few days.

480
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,560
My eyes are having spasms.

481
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,040
I must be crazy. I must be crazy.

482
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,160
Oh, it tickles. It tickles.
What is this... Come on!

483
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,200
PATIENT REGISTRATION

484
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,560
I did tell you over the phone,
but to be more accurate...

485
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,600
I'm thinking that she's bipolar.

486
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,160
Bipolar?

487
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,040
It's known as being bipolar manic
depressive.

488
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,400
The patient's mood would go from very up
to being very down.

489
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,040
Manic depressives go from extreme highs
and lows over and over.

490
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,600
In the case of your friend,
she showed confidence all of a sudden.

491
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,080
Or she suddenly started talking a lot
unlike her usual self.

492
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,360
Also...

493
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,560
A sudden unexplainable sexual curiosity.

494
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,480
Yes, you're right. Sexual curiosity!

495
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,679
-Oh, so something happened.
-Well, no...

496
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
It's not that...

497
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,520
And when she's depressed,
she would be very low.

498
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,920
I think right now,
she might be in that depressed state.

499
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,800
Then, I must have seen her in her
depressed state this whole time.

500
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,080
She was that way this whole time?

501
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,440
I guess there are cases
where they're like that

502
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,920
a long time with no set schedule.

503
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,280
It's back and forth... It's unpredictable.

504
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
Gosh...

505
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,560
Also, from what I saw before...

506
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,800
I think she has symptoms of auditory
hallucinations.

507
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,240
Has she, possibly, been under a great
deal of stress or received trauma lately?

508
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,880
SUN RESTAURANT
WE ARE CLOSED TODAY. SORRY.

509
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:16,320
(Has she, possibly, been under a great
deal of stress or received trauma lately?)

510
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,960
I'm sorry, Chef.
I should've been more careful.

511
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,360
-Do you know why I dislike you?
-Pardon?

512
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,440
Seeing how you've been acting yesterday
and today, you misunderstood my warning.

513
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,160
You're banned from the kitchen for the
time being. You can work in the hall only.

514
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,440
I didn't even know she was sick.

515
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,400
I guess it would be stressful.

516
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,600
(I think she should be under direct
supervision.)

517
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,640
(I'll prescribe some medication,
so give that to her.)

518
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,680
(Don't ever leave her alone.)

519
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,080
(If her manic depression gets worse,
something extreme could happen.)

520
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,120
(She could do something very impulsive.)

521
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,120
Gosh, we spent the entire day cleaning.

522
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,960
Because of one stupid person.

523
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,320
-Hey, Bong.
-Yes?

524
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,000
Did you go somewhere with Chef?

525
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,520
Huh? No, we just...

526
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,280
Did you get in trouble?
Did he take you somewhere and hit you?

527
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,640
Is Chef some sort of a thug?
Why would he hit a woman?

528
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
You don't know what you're saying.
He took a big loss.

529
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,080
He's more than capable of hitting in a
fit of rage.

530
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,840
Remember that blog incident last time.

531
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,320
You're all still here?

532
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080
Yes.

533
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,760
What brings you into the break room?

534
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,080
-Isn't this part of my store too?
-You're right.

535
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,360
Amongst ourselves...

536
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,480
We were saying that in the midst
of today's fire...

537
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,480
Your God-given skill of shaking
the fire extinguisher non-stop

538
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,760
deserves to be recognized.

539
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,960
-Shouldn't that be recognized?
-Isn't that a given?

540
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,360
Good work everyone.

541
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,400
-Yes, Chef. Thank you.
-You can all go now.

542
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,480
Goodbye.

543
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,800
I was so startled.

544
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,520
You have to be careful what you say
in enemy territory.

545
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,000
Hey, hurry up. Let's go.

546
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,560
Let's go have some drinks and
talk about him some more.

547
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,400
Gosh... I'm really tired today!

548
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,920
He cleaned with his mouth,
so he probably has lots of energy left.

549
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,720
He put the fire out with his mouth too.

550
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,440
Bye.

551
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,840
Are you really okay?

552
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,200
Pardon? Yes...

553
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,480
I'm sorry.

554
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,440
I hadn't heard that in a while.
Guess you're really back, Na Bong-sun.

555
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,280
Are you really...

556
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,720
Never mind. Rest.

557
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,120
YONGSAN GOSHIWON

558
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,560
Hello?

559
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,360
It's the goshiwon, right?

560
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,960
Do you happen to have a room available?

561
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,080
Oh, they're all taken?

562
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,360
Okay.

563
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,920
BRING YOUR STUFF AND COME TO THE ROOF
-CHEF KANG

564
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,280
Why are you carrying these weird things?

565
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,040
-What it's used for is...
-Forget it. I don't care.

566
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,520
So, I should stay here?

567
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,520
I did move some stuff to the side,

568
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,040
but you can clean it again too.

569
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,720
It's not because you're special to me,
so don't get the wrong idea.

570
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:03,400
It's just that if you faint like that
in the hall again, it's problematic.

571
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,520
But, it's only until you get a room. Okay?

572
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Chef...

573
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,640
Oh, no... Don't do that.
Getting touched by this or whatever.

574
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,880
I'm scared you'll get manic depressive
again.

575
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,160
You heard what the doctor said, right?

576
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,200
Manic depression is an illness many
people suffer nowadays.

577
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,320
So, don't feel too bad about it.

578
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,080
You should be okay if you eat medication.

579
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,080
And...

580
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,240
About that incident before.

581
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,320
I want to say again that it was my fault.

582
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,320
I'm sorry.

583
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,200
Don't overthink it.

584
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,320
Uh... I hope you don't keep it buried
in your heart or anything.

585
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,440
This here,

586
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:52,880
it's a blanket.

587
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
It's new, totally brand new.
It hasn't even been opened.

588
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,520
I'll let you borrow it.

589
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,880
Oh, thank you.

590
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,960
-It's kind of expensive.
-What?

591
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,200
Don't be burdened or anything.

592
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,120
Okay.

593
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,360
I really hate when people get stuff on
the blanket, but don't worry about it.

594
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,080
Okay.

595
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,320
Dad, a long time ago...

596
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,560
After closing up, we'd sit here.

597
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,280
Do you remember how we'd play
go-stop and bet an ice cream on it?

598
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,600
Just like you had suspected,
I switched out cards and cheated.

599
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,480
You let me get away with it, right?

600
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,640
You just pretended not to know, right?

601
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,280
I know everything.

602
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,920
What are you doing, Dad?

603
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,120
GROOM, LEE TAE-MIN AND
BRIDE, CHOI MI-YEON

604
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,040
Wow, Mi-yeon is getting married!

605
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,360
You bad kid.

606
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,720
Your friend is getting married.

607
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
And you're...

608
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,600
Dad, you're drinking again?

609
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,280
Stop drinking, would you?

610
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,320
Dad,

611
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,680
please?

612
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,640
Dad, you really have to stop now.

613
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,560
You're making yourself sick inside.

614
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,880
Have some food with your drinks, at least.

615
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:24,400
Oh my!

616
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,280
It's nice and soft.

617
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,520
I can't have her come again,
so I better light this.

618
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:24,120
Wait now, she's probably hungry too.

619
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,920
She's not in a good state,
so maybe ramyun's not a good idea.

620
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,080
HOW TO MAKE CABBAGE PORRIDGE

621
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Then...

622
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,400
I'll put in some more meat.

623
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,120
Where's the cabbage?

624
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,520
Yes, coming.

625
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,880
-I brought you something.
-Oh, yes.

626
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,440
What is it?

627
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:57,480
Oh well... I had some cabbage I needed
to get rid of.

628
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,200
There was a lot left, so I made this.

629
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,440
It tastes to-die-for.

630
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,400
If you don't want it,
you can give it to the dog.

631
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,640
Apparently there's nothing better to
nourish the heart and ease the stomach.

632
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,880
It's not bad.
You should sleep comfortably.

633
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,640
Thank you.

634
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,600
Forget it, forget it. No need for thanks.

635
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:15,280
(Your recipes always contain happiness
that one can feel through taste.)

636
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,600
(I'm a fan. Fighting.)

637
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,120
Is she eating?

638
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:27,360
She must be eating.

639
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,760
It's so good, she'll go crazy for it.

640
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,280
She's not going to fall for me because
she's so touched by this, is she?

641
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,600
Ah, then she's going to get a manic
episode and attack me.

642
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,960
Whatever!

643
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,120
I did do something wrong.

644
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,440
Someone replied to me.

645
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,160
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

646
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:02,560
(Thank you very much.)

647
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,440
(Your comments are always a source of
strength for me.)

648
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,400
(It just so happens that I'm eating
the cabbage porridge right now.)

649
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,560
Oh really?

650
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,760
I just made that cabbage porridge.
That's amazing.

651
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:18,400
I think this person and I get each other,
emotionally.

652
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,760
I like you, Sunshine.

653
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,520
Dad!

654
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,760
It's a limited edition.
It'll be all gone if I go too late.

655
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:44,400
Hey, what kind of sneaker costs
180,000 won?

656
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:47,160
What? 180,000 won? You crazy punk.

657
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:48,840
It's actually priced low.

658
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,040
Dad, do you think it's a limited
edition for no reason?

659
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,440
They don't have many available.

660
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,040
It's worth that much in value.

661
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,640
-Gosh...
-Dad!

662
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,840
Fine, fine! Stop whining!

663
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:00,360
No, no. You can't, Dad.

664
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,560
You've been giving me a headache
all morning.

665
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,000
Don't give it to him. Don't do it.

666
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,600
-Here.
-Don't do it. He'll get bad habits.

667
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,480
-Here, 180,000 won.
-Thank you, Dad, I'll be right back.

668
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,440
Gosh, that idiot.
When's he going to grow up?

669
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,960
What is it, Dad? You're not feeling well?

670
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,800
I told you not to drink so much.

671
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,040
You can't be okay drinking two bottles
on an empty stomach.

672
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,120
Speaking of, I have to pay the taxes.

673
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:31,800
I don't have much left at the bank.

674
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,400
You can't just give it to him
because he asks.

675
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,480
You can't raise Kyung-mo like that.

676
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,880
You're always saying 'yes' because
he grew up without a mom.

677
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,640
Sales aren't even going well,
what are you going to do about taxes?

678
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:49,880
10,000 WON

679
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,720
Oh my.

680
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,840
-You first.
-Okay.

681
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,760
Did you sleep well?

682
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,160
I'm a sensitive person, so just okay.

683
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,440
I see.

684
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:54,680
Oh... You know that there's filming
today, right?

685
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,920
It's starting about a couple hours early,
so get ready by then.

686
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,120
-Filming?
-Did you forget?

687
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,320
It's the day of the shoot, Friday.

688
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:06,760
Ah... The filming.

689
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:18,960
Chef Kang Sun-woo...

690
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,320
CHEF KANG SUN-WOO

691
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,640
VIDEOS

692
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,280
Oh, oh... This can't happen.

693
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,760
What have you done...

694
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,280
Hello.

695
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,760
Why aren't you going in?

696
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,360
I don't think I can do this.
I'm sorry, Chef.

697
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,160
We have to go in right now.
What do you mean you can't do it?

698
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,640
Did you eat your medicine?

699
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,480
It's fine. It is.

700
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,880
-I'll take care of everything.
-Chef Kang, come on in.

701
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,120
Yes, I'm coming.

702
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,560
Trust me, okay?

703
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:49,880
Oh dear...

704
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,480
Oh, come in! Come in!

705
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:10,640
It's very fast on the bus, isn't it?

706
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,680
It is fast on the bus.

707
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,040
But, I had to walk 30 minutes from
the bus stop.

708
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,040
It's early morning, but I've already
sweat so much.

709
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,640
I felt very good.

710
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:24,680
Oh really? I had no idea.
I never take the bus, you know.

711
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,520
Of course, you don't.

712
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,040
Oh, your place is nice.

713
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,920
No, I didn't do anything nice with
the interior.

714
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,040
You have a den too.

715
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,160
Wow...

716
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,880
Goodness, you're so cute.
You're so charming.

717
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,480
Do you want something refreshing to drink?

718
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,240
No, no forget it. I'll drink it later.

719
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,840
Let's get down to work.

720
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,360
-Where's your daughter's room?
-Oh, right. That's why you're here.

721
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,840
-Over there.
-Did you forget?

722
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,480
I must have lost two inches off my waist.

723
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:55,640
Really?

724
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,400
I pray to you ancestors who are
now in the heavens.

725
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,040
Please bless the conjugal harmony
of this couple.

726
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,680
Please give us a pretty baby,
as soon as possible.

727
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,520
Give us, please. Give to us.

728
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:12,560
Goodness, stop that!

729
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,320
They won't like a soulless prayer
like that!

730
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,880
Oh really?

731
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:20,680
Bring me a pair of your son-in-law and
daughter's underwear.

732
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,560
-Underwear?
-I need to burn it.

733
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,920
Is this your son-in-law?

734
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,320
Yeah, isn't he handsome?

735
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,920
Yeah, he is.

736
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:36,680
But, it's really strange.

737
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,280
His horoscope was really odd too.

738
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:44,120
It's like he's the same person,
but something's different...

739
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,560
Hello!

740
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:51,960
Mister?

741
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:55,840
Did he go somewhere?

742
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,400
Mister...

743
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:17,040
My mother-in-law is such a nag.

744
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,800
The owner must be out somewhere.
Let's go eat at another place.

745
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,840
Let's just eat here.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

746
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,280
You said you're hungry.
Let's go somewhere else.

747
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,080
A new octopus place opened just nearby.

748
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,360
-Octopus?
-You like octopus. Let's go, let's go.

749
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,600
It's so hot. I don't feel like walking.

750
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,880
When it's hot out,
you have to eat spicy octopus.

751
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,040
Okay, fine.

752
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,960
So, after last week's first episode...
We had quite a big reaction!

753
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:56,000
Yes, we did.
I think that's the perfect way to put it.

754
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,000
Of course, Chef Kang Sun-woo won
first place.

755
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,360
Even his assistant's cooking was such
a hit that it was a top search term.

756
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,760
-There was a very hot reaction.
-Yes.

757
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,880
-Yes, it was very hot.
-Yes.

758
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,760
Yes, so starting with today's episode...

759
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,040
In order to drum up more interest...

760
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:16,840
-We've changed the structure a bit.
-That's right.

761
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:21,240
The concept of today's competition is
'tag'.

762
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,360
-Tag?
-Yes.

763
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,040
-Our viewers may not understand.
-Yes.

764
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,760
When we switch out with someone,
we tag them, right?

765
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,080
-Yes.
-Just like I described,

766
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,080
chef and assistant
will switch out when the time comes.

767
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:37,440
They will switch and complete
cooking the food.

768
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,800
Today, more than any other day, the chef
and assistant must be on the same page.

769
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,160
Today's competition will be...

770
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,120
Using canned salmon...

771
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,000
Cook a nutritious night-time snack for
a student studying for an exam.

772
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,360
A NUTRITIOUS NIGHT-TIME SNACK FOR
A STUDENT STUDYING FOR AN EXAM.

773
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,040
KANG SUN-WOO

774
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,720
Wow, it works if you practice!

775
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,440
Dad! Dad, I found big money!

776
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:38,560
Dad!

777
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,440
Dad... Dad, wake up!

778
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:50,360
Dad! Please get up, Dad!

779
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,840
911.

780
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:01,280
Why isn't it working?

781
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,040
Where the heck is Kyung-mo?

782
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:26,200
Dad...

783
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,560
Na Bong-sun...
It'll work with Na Bong-sun.

784
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:33,280
Na Bong-sun!

785
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,840
Na Bong-sun...

786
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,280
Dad, hold on a little longer.

787
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,880
Dad, please...

788
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:49,320
Okay, stop now. Time's up now.

789
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,520
Please put down what you were doing.

790
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:54,480
Please tag and switch out with the
assistant chef.

791
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:55,440
Okay.

792
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,360
Okay, there's no time.
Time's winding down.

793
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,960
Please switch.

794
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:04,480
I'm really looking forward to the skills
of the assistant chefs.

795
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,240
-We're starting...
(-Na Bong-sun!)

796
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,640
Oh, I'm sorry!

797
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,360
So... Sorry.

798
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,960
All this... This... What do I do?

799
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,520
Na Bong-sun, Na Bong-sun. Help me, please.

800
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,520
Na Bong-sun.

801
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,120
Na Bong-sun.

802
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,040
Let's stop for a moment.

803
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,480
Let's stop. We'll start up again.

804
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:34,240
Are you okay? Are you okay?

805
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,840
Chef, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

806
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,480
-Na Bong-sun.
-Hey, Na Bong-sun.

807
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,600
Where are you going?

808
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,000
What do I do?

809
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,280
Na Bong-sun, please listen to me.

810
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,360
My dad has passed out.

811
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,000
But, no one knows about it.
Please call an ambulance for me.

812
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,120
I don't know. I can't hear anything.

813
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,160
You're the only one who can help me.

814
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,560
Please, my dad's dying.

815
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,080
Stop doing this to me. Just go.

816
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,480
He's my dad!

817
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,720
He's not just anyone. He's my dad!

818
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,080
How can I pretend not to notice?

819
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:13,440
Even if I'm a ghost,
how can I just stand and watch?

820
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,360
Please, just make one phone call Bong-sun.

821
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,240
I'm begging you like this, huh?

822
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,040
(Na Bong-sun...
Na Bong-sun, where are you?)

823
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:00,640
OH MY GHOST

824
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,160
I have no intention of doing that,
so fire me as well if you plan to.

825
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,520
Is she not in yet?

826
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,360
She suddenly ran out.
Why isn't she back yet?

827
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,400
Tada! Surprise.

828
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,400
Do you want proper training from me?

829
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,120
I don't think I can do this any longer.

830
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,800
Maybe he showered and he's completely
naked.

831
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,600
About you and Bong-sun...
Have you two always been so friendly?

832
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,360
Do you and Chef have something going on?

833
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,880
No matter what happens today,
I have to have Chef tonight.
