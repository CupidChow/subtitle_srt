1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,640
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,200
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,840
Ah... good to see you too.

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,600
Hand over the key.
Stop playing around.

5
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,720
-What?
-Hand over the key!

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,160
What key?

7
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,040
Why, you...

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,440
Where is it?

9
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
(Seriously, this guy!)

10
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,080
-Chef!
-Chef, are you okay?

11
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Hey, are you crazy!

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,840
You may have quit, but this isn't right.

13
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,440
(What is this? Have I made a mistake?)

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,920
Do you think she's drunk? Huh?

15
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:40,160
-I don't smell alcohol.
-You better apologize to Chef right now.

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,680
-Apologize now!
-Chef?

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,759
(His name is Chef?
But, he's not a foreigner.)

18
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,200
That's enough.

19
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,400
Just hand over the keys.

20
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,880
What key are you going on and on about?

21
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,880
Oh... this thing?

22
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,240
Bong-sun, are you okay?
Are you feeling sick?

23
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,400
Seriously, Na Bong-sun. You. Amazing.

24
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,720
How could you do that?

25
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,760
(This isn't working.
I better get out of this body.)

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,120
Hey.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,240
(Oh, what's going on?)

28
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,760
Hey...

29
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,040
(-If you happen upon a body...
-Wait...)

30
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,920
(With a frequency that
matches perfectly...)

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
(It can't be.)

32
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,680
(You could get trapped and
not be able to get out.)

33
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,560
(It's not possible... This girl?)

34
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
Oh crap...

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Crap?

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,000
(No, I have to get out.)

37
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:41,160
(She said it'd be hard to get out
once I'm trapped.)

38
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,600
(I have to get out of here.)

39
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Hey, hey! Are you okay?

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,680
Bong-sun! Bong-sun!

41
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
-What's going on?
-She fainted. She fainted!

42
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,079
-Bong-sun!
-Bong-sun...

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,400
-She just fainted?
-Yes.

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Hey, lay her down on her back.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,000
Give her a massage... A massage.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,240
Bong-sun... Bong-sun!

47
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,160
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 2

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,160
Seriously...

49
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,200
I can't tell if she's putting on an act
or if she really fainted.

50
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,240
Still, shouldn't we call 911
or something?

51
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,960
Her breathing is normal and
her face seems to have regained color.

52
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,960
-Looks like she'll be okay.
-Wow, I almost got a heart attack.

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,680
Do you think she has
some sort of illness?

54
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,800
(Dang, this sucks. I'm now conscious but)

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,240
(should I open my eyes or not?)

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,040
Didn't she say she had insomnia?

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,440
-Do you think it's the medication?
-Oh, maybe.

58
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,920
Maybe the meds zonked her out?

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,800
That's got to be it.
Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense.

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,480
Did you see her do the body-drop throw?

61
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,840
(I guess I'm in a pickle.)

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,520
(It doesn't look like
I'll be out of this body anytime soon.)

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,680
(Oh... Oh nice.)

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,520
(This place is like a men's bath house.)

65
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,400
(It might not be so bad, after all.)

66
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,000
Her mouth is watering.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,720
Is she dreaming?

68
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,839
She is. She's dreaming, dreaming!

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Forget it.
She doesn't need to go to the hospital.

70
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,640
Hey... Wake up.

71
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,720
I saw your eyes open a little.
You can stop now.

72
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,920
Was it obvious?

73
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,640
I said I'm fine...
Besides being embarrassed.

74
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,000
It'll sting when you get water on it.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,160
-What will you do with Bong-sun?
-What do you mean?

76
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,000
She wrote that letter herself and left.

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll send her on her way
once she wakes up.

78
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,040
She didn't leave because she wanted to.

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,840
-Wasn't she half pushed out the door?
-Whatever the case...

80
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,920
This could be what's best for her life.

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,280
No, I don't believe that yet.

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,880
If you push people out before
they're ready...

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,120
Weak people like Bong-sun and I,
cannot survive.

84
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,920
Gosh, seriously.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,280
Bong-sun, are you okay?
You don't need to go to the hospital?

86
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,880
-Why don't you two talk?
-Talk about what?

87
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,040
Where are you going? Hey...

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,640
Hey, were you an athlete or something?

89
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,200
Like Hapkido or something? Forget it.

90
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,320
Are you okay?

91
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,960
About before,
I think I may have made a mistake.

92
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,680
What?

93
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,040
'I think I may have made a mistake'?

94
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,840
So, what I'm saying is that I'm sorry.

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,440
I'm not in a good state right now.
I think I was a little out of it.

96
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
So I hope you can let me off once.

97
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,080
Sit down for now.

98
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,560
-Na Bong-sun...
-Yes?

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,600
It probably wasn't easy for you
to decide to leave this place, right?

100
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,120
When you ask me to let you off...
Are you saying you're not ready to go?

101
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,840
Are you saying you want to stay?

102
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Well, yeah... I suppose.

103
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,520
Then, why did you leave
in the first place?

104
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,560
Because of what I said?

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,040
Yes, yes. It was that...

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Okay, then let's do this.

107
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,440
I will give you one month. You
make the decision within that time.

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,280
Whether to devote your life to this
kitchen or not.

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
Okay, I'm absolutely in!

110
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,520
Now that we've made up,
let's do our best. Okay?

111
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,160
You're not in your right mind
at the moment.

112
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,400
Gosh, that guy is so freaking rude.
He's has a decent looking face though.

113
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,440
What's with this girl?
What am I suppose to do anyway?

114
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,240
(This is very strange.)

115
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,880
(I don't feel out of place
in the kitchen.)

116
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,280
Wow...

117
00:07:54,600 --> 00:08:00,120
Ah, this is magnetic!
That's so amazing.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,840
Oh, this thing. I really wanted to try it.

119
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,040
Wow!

120
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,000
What are you doing at my station?

121
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,120
Aren't you going to go to your station?

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,680
Mine? Where... Here?

123
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,280
You haven't come back
to your senses yet.

124
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,280
Your station is in front of the dishwasher!

125
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,600
-Dishwasher... Dishwasher.
-Hey, Dong-chul.

126
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,080
-Yes.
-Where did you put the work log?

127
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,640
In the storage.

128
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,200
I told you to put things where
they belong. You never listen, do you?

129
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,120
Min-soo, keep track of inventory now,
so you don't go crazy during peak hours.

130
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,320
Yes, Chef!

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,480
That darn bastard and his lectures.

132
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,640
Hey, hey. Bong-sun. Go count how many
live seafood we have in the fridge.

133
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,120
Why should I do that?
Didn't he tell you to do it?

134
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,800
'Didn't he tell you to do it'?

135
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,920
Has the girl totally lost her mind?
Hey Na Bong-sun!

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
Oh my, you scared me!
Why the heck are you yelling?

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,400
What's wrong with you!
Have you seriously gone nuts?

138
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
Hey, calm down.

139
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,600
What's with you?

140
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,960
Well... It's not that...

141
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,760
It's that I'm probably not fully back
to myself yet.

142
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,560
I'll go splash some water on my face.

143
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
Gosh, what the heck.

144
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,480
What is this girl's character?

145
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,920
I need to at least act
like her somewhat.

146
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Dang, I can't get used to this.

147
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,320
You should've worn something else.
This one's always coming undone.

148
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,600
You're right.
This morning was just too hectic.

149
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,320
Should your brother quickly go
and get another pair?

150
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,720
No, don't bother.

151
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,840
(I thought he was a jerk,
but he's good to his sister.)

152
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,160
(I guess he's not all bad.)

153
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,680
What are you doing standing there?
We're busy. Get in there!

154
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:05,120
(He sure isn't a good guy either.
I should be on my guard against him.)

155
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,040
TODAY'S SPECIAL -
SEAFOOD STIR FRY NOODLE

156
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,240
Table 1 is still waiting for
their special. Please hurry up.

157
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Who read this?
Min-soo, aren't the specials ready yet?

158
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,920
-They're ready.
-Hurry it up. Hurry!

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
-Yes, Chef.
-Check if the water is boiling.

160
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,040
Table 3, two specials
and two stew pastas.

161
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,800
-Okay, got it!
-Yes, Chef!

162
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,360
Oh gosh, this place
must be super popular.

163
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,520
No matter how many dishes I wash,
there is no end.

164
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,160
Dang it!
Why am I suffering like this anyway?

165
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,000
Hey, Min-soo, step aside.

166
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,760
Hey, Dong-chul, come over here!

167
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Yes, Chef!

168
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,080
-Hey, Cordon!
-Yes?

169
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,000
-Get the garnish ready!
-Okay.

170
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,480
Don't you see
the stack of dirty dishes?

171
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,720
Yes, I'm cleaning out crap.

172
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
Man, it's so hot in here.

173
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,160
(Oh my...)

174
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,160
Hey, Bong! Can you move?

175
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
I kind of don't want to move.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,360
Has she gone crazy for real?

177
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,200
(Oh my god!)

178
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
-Hey, Na Bong! Come wipe the floor here.
-Okay.

179
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm done wiping.

180
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
Hey, Na Bong-sun!

181
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,520
Can't you just order me around
all at once? What? What now?

182
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't you know you're supposed to wipe
the floor with a dry mop?

183
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,280
Is this some sort of revenge?

184
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,280
Are you scheming to make me fall?

185
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,280
There's no way.

186
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,840
I mean if I was going to take revenge,
I'd at least break a few ribs.

187
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,800
This would be too childish.

188
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,160
Hey, Na Bong-sun. Did you maybe damage
your brain or something?

189
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,520
I'm currently in utter shock.

190
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,000
-I'm already busy enough.
-Hey.

191
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,960
Hello? I'm working right now, so...

192
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,960
Where?

193
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
That's ridiculous. What assault?

194
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,200
That lady was going on about her blog
and being rude

195
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,680
so I pushed her a bit to make her leave.

196
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,080
How can that be assault?

197
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,720
Detective, would you say this
is assault? This?

198
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,960
I get the picture...

199
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,160
But, she did file a lawsuit

200
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
and says she needs
3 weeks of hospitalization.

201
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,080
Three weeks of hospitalization?

202
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,760
That's total nonsense.

203
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,760
Brother-in-law! Oh, hello.

204
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,720
I talked to Eun-hee. What happened?

205
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
Well, this is... Gosh...

206
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Really? What about my brother?

207
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
Can you talk to him?

208
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,240
-You guys can go home now.
-Oh, okay.

209
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,760
We will. Let's go.
Hurry. Let's go.

210
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,480
I knew something like this would happen
sooner or later.

211
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,440
I mean there was no limit to his
cockiness. Acting as if he's all that.

212
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,880
Whatever it is,
excessiveness is worse than scarcity.

213
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,440
But, he is kind of all that.

214
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
Do you really want to say that in
this situation? You Cordon bastard.

215
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,040
Anyway, what now?
An assault charge is no joke.

216
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,960
I know, right?

217
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,840
Wow, Seoul people are scary as heck.

218
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,840
Why would anyone sue
over things like that?

219
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,680
So anyway. Did he actually hit someone?
That Chef or whoever he is.

220
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,120
Hello. You're the one who caused it.

221
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,600
You want to feign ignorance and
play dumb huh?

222
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,240
That's right! It was because of me.

223
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,080
My health has been on and off
lately... so...

224
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,280
Hey, Bong Bong Roo Bong Bong.
What are you touching?

225
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,360
My goodness. Oh.

226
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,240
I suffer from lack of affection,
so I tend to get attached to skin.

227
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,520
Sorry.

228
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,080
I've been really curious about this.

229
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,560
Why are there so many of these?

230
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,280
Do you guys all go running together?
What's this for?

231
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,560
Weird... Weird...

232
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Hey, can you do this for me?

233
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,840
Anyway, don't you think Bong is acting
very weird?

234
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,080
Yes, like, she is Bong-sun,
but then she doesn't seem like Bong-sun.

235
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,960
And it's not like she isn't Bong-sun.

236
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,640
It is very strange.

237
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
You know there's a saying...

238
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,960
Almost Bong-sun...

239
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,960
But, not really Bong-sun,
but like Bong-sun. You are...

240
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,160
The weirdest is the way she talks.

241
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,520
-She doesn't sound like Bong-sun.
-Right?

242
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,560
You see? Even someone who doesn't care
about others can see the difference.

243
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
What is wrong with her?

244
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,440
Did she get traumatized from
yesterday or something?

245
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,160
Oh, oh. You know those things on TV shows.
People with many personalities.

246
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,200
-Dissociative identity disorder.
-That's it.

247
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,760
Maybe she has that?
And we didn't know about it until now?

248
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:36,280
If not, what is that...
Intermittent explosive disorder?

249
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,760
-Yes.
-I saw this on TV recently.

250
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,520
If you have that disorder,
you get outbursts of rage...

251
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,440
And murder people for no reason.
It was on TV.

252
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,600
Oh yeah. There were cases of killing
noisy upstairs neighbors.

253
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,720
The more stressed out the society is,
the more prevalent psychopaths are.

254
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,880
After being mistreated by their boss...

255
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,240
Kaboom! They explode.

256
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,080
-And stab, cut, and thrust.
-Okay, hold on.

257
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,840
Bong has suffered a lot.

258
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,160
If she hasn't forgotten them all,
I'm sure she'd want to kill all of us.

259
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,920
-Nah... I doubt it.
-That's right.

260
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,480
I doubt it.

261
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,600
Wow, this is totally like
a Samurai knife.

262
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,720
It even has initials engraved.
Everyone has their own knife, huh?

263
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,800
Is there anything I can cut?

264
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,840
A zucchini.

265
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,400
Let me try this.

266
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,840
Oh, impressive.

267
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,480
This knife...

268
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,920
Whose is this?

269
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,480
This is totally amazing.
It cuts so nicely.

270
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,800
The knife, knife.
Can you put it down first and talk?

271
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,240
But, will this kill people?

272
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,840
Yes, yes, that can kill.

273
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,680
They die!

274
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,200
What's with them?

275
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,440
This is insane. Seriously.

276
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,319
What if I counter sue?

277
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,319
No, not even worth my time.

278
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,920
That power blogger is no ordinary lady.

279
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,400
Apparently, she says she won't settle
no matter what.

280
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,840
Just think of it like you got bitten
by a dog with rabies.

281
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
-And apologize...
-What apology?

282
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,800
Getting bitten by a dog is upsetting
enough. Why should I apologize?

283
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,480
But, you're a public figure.

284
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,760
So what if I'm a public figure?
Does that make me a criminal?

285
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,680
Why does that have to be my weakness?

286
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,240
I'll go to court. I've always wanted to
visit a courtroom so it works out.

287
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,760
Your emotions shouldn't be making
this decision.

288
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,880
Humans are emotional beings by nature.

289
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,160
-You don't avoid...
-Isn't that Chef Kang Sun-woo?

290
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,080
I will never do that. Never.

291
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,280
He seems quite popular these days.

292
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:14,880
Chef is not even here. Should we really
go home? It doesn't feel right.

293
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,200
Eun-hee says we should.

294
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,680
It's better to do as asked.
If we stay, we'll be a nuisance.

295
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,800
Yeah, I'm sure she's
uncomfortable as well.

296
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,520
Well, this was something bound
to happen.

297
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,480
The way I see it...

298
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,560
Chef has been pushing his luck
thinking he's all that.

299
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,520
It's true though. He is all that.

300
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,040
I don't think you got the right context.
Do you? Huh?

301
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,800
Why are you hitting me?

302
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,080
Sorry.

303
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,480
-Have you gone mad? Get out!
-Oh?

304
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,080
Then where do I shower?

305
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
What are you doing? Close the door!

306
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,840
Okay. I'm sorry.

307
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,600
Excuse me.

308
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,280
I knew I was right about them.
Those guys, those guys...

309
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
You idiot. Seriously.

310
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,520
Hey, Bong, damn Bong,
like you ever showered here before!

311
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,080
Well, I mean today was
especially hot so...

312
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,520
What's with your gaze right now?

313
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,720
Cheer up.

314
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,280
It's okay. Not like people care about
such things. Right?

315
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,080
Fighting.

316
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,200
It's because you only got a glimpse!

317
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,840
Wow, my pride is hurt. So hurt.
My pride is so very hurt.

318
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,080
Wait for me.

319
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,240
This isn't the way to your home.

320
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,320
It is today. No matter what.

321
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,960
Really. Why are you like this?

322
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,360
What? What do you mean? Hm?

323
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,600
You've been acting weird all day today.

324
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,880
Is it because you quit once and came
back? You got a lot to think about?

325
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,760
What?

326
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,760
Did you decide to change yourself
completely?

327
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,560
Because you no longer want
to be the victim?

328
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,720
Well, yes, that's part of it...

329
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,920
Should I say it's more of an agony
over life in general?

330
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,520
But, I don't think this talk should
happen while standing up like this.

331
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,280
Shall we go somewhere and
get some cold beer or something?

332
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,640
-Yes?
-Let's go...

333
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,560
Let's go.

334
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,800
Just a moment.
Let's just rest for a bit.

335
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,160
I don't want to. I'm going home.

336
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,520
Just one hour. One hour.
I won't lay a finger on you. I promise.

337
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,240
I want to sleep at home.

338
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,600
Wait, wait. Just 30 minutes.

339
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,680
-Hey, hey. Wait.
-Taxi!

340
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,920
Yongsan please.

341
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,720
Hey, Bong, I'm going now.

342
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,040
Gosh.

343
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,880
Dang, what the heck is his problem?
I just got turned on for no reason.

344
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,680
Is he that drunk or does he not
see me as a woman?

345
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,480
My goodness. So tacky.

346
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,280
This explains it.
No wonder I can't seduce a guy.

347
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,720
I mean why did I possess someone
with such a...

348
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,840
Forget it. It's not going to work.

349
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,080
And where the heck does she live? Gosh!

350
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,200
What now?

351
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:43,080
-Hello?
(-Yes, room 305.)

352
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,040
(This is the goshiwon.
When are you going to move out?)

353
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,480
What? Goshiwon?

354
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,080
Someone actually lives here? Really?

355
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
Living like this isn't even better than
living as a ghost.

356
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,040
What the... What is this now?

357
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,760
What are you looking at?

358
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,800
This girl. I guess this girl attracts
all kinds of ghosts.

359
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,640
What's this? Oh, incense and all.

360
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,320
Why is this so damn big? What is this?

361
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,800
This is totally like
Commander Yi Sun-shin.

362
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,720
I'm so pissed off. Seriously.

363
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,680
I never ever encountered such a
nasty, trashy lady in my entire life.

364
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,480
What you got? What is your blog?
Let me see.

365
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,480
I ACCUSE THE CHEF OF SUN RESTAURANT
FOR ASSAULT

366
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,800
What? No common sense when it
comes to service or food?

367
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,720
Abusing his fame and commonly resorting
to violence... This is insane.

368
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
We have a new novelist, huh.

369
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,280
She's the one who truly lacks
common sense.

370
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
This makes me so angry.

371
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,320
ADD A COMMENT

372
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,840
ID: I LIKE STRAWBERRIES

373
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,840
I'm someone who frequents
Sun Restaurant.

374
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,560
I feel that this is a strategic attempt
at slander.

375
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,200
The service there is fairly good.

376
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:45,400
Making false statements to the general
public because of personal reasons...

377
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,280
Is not the right thing... To do...

378
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,080
Is not right... Is not right at all!

379
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,560
I Like Chocolate...

380
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,080
Master of noodle dishes.

381
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,800
Also very good looking.

382
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,760
Are you just getting into work?

383
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,280
Yes, I just had a meeting with the
art director. Are you heading out?

384
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,320
Yes. Meeting.

385
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,360
Hey, hey! You would've been in big
trouble if you cast Kang Sun-woo.

386
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,160
-Why's that?
-What do you mean, why?

387
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,280
He's number one on the search right now.

388
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,840
Because of assault.

389
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,800
You ought to know. Look into it.

390
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,680
-Assault?
-Hold on.

391
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,400
(Yes, Reporter.)

392
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,440
That article is not true.

393
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,400
It's not true so why would I address it?
It's not even worth responding to.

394
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,880
I'm not going to do an interview.
Okay, I'm going to hang up now.

395
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,360
-Gosh, really...
-Sun-woo.

396
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
Mom's throwing a fit.

397
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,440
With the article, it's just a matter
of time before things get worse.

398
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,600
-Shouldn't you come to an agreement now?
-Forget it!

399
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,040
If I were, I would've done it earlier.

400
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,840
-Still, Sun-woo...
-Don't pick up Mom's calls. Turn it off.

401
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,800
Things are really getting worse.

402
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,400
It's interesting.

403
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,080
The thing is, if things go wrong...
We may get hurt in the process too.

404
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,640
That could happen too.
I don't think he's going to say anything.

405
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,800
If he doesn't say anything, I'll die.

406
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,120
-Oh, me too.
-Gosh, what the heck.

407
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,120
Why don't you visit the hospital?
You seem to be in critical condition.

408
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,760
-Why, that little...
-Hey, hey. Come on now.

409
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,360
Hello, good morning! Good day.

410
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,680
She must be crazy.

411
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Why, why, why?
Is there something going on today?

412
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,000
Why's everyone so serious today?

413
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,720
-And why are you so bright suddenly?
-Why not?

414
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,120
I have to get changed.
Aren't you leaving?

415
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,680
Should I just change here? Huh?

416
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,560
What's wrong with her?

417
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,440
I heard that the chef here beat someone.
There was an article.

418
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,760
-Really, isn't the chef on TV too?
-Yes.

419
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,040
Why's he beating people?
Is he a gangster?

420
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,000
That's what I'm saying.

421
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
-Hey, Dong-chul.
-Yes?

422
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,400
Have we ever been this slow recently?

423
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,560
No, I don't think so.

424
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,000
Wow, mass communication is amazing.

425
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,920
-There's such a difference in customers.
-The restaurant won't be ruined, right?

426
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,240
Who knows? They say you can also get
soaked in drizzling rain.

427
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,000
If I knew this would happen,
I would have saved money earlier.

428
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,320
How cool would it be to have my own
restaurant and be the head chef?

429
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,360
Look at our chef all in black and
acting really cool all the time saying

430
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,520
'Cloth tree. Oil bird. Cooking style of
white dragon ascending to heaven.'

431
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,360
-'White dragon ascending to heaven.'
-Nice show.

432
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,560
Excessive showmanship can make
you look crazy.

433
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,760
Yes, Chef.

434
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,840
Hey, aren't you going to clean the
flour in the storage?

435
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,080
Do you really want to store meat in
that pigsty?

436
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,880
-Yes, sorry. We'll get on it.
-You always make me lecture.

437
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,520
-Hey, Na Bong-sun.
-Yes, Chef.

438
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
Clean out the oil in the hood.

439
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,800
Don't make it get clogged up.
And take care of this too...gosh!

440
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:58,560
Do I have to say it for it to get done?

441
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,040
Cleaning...

442
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,640
I have to do all of this.

443
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:09,120
-Over here.
-Yes, just a moment!

444
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,360
Yes, sir.

445
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,800
-I think this pasta is too watery.
-Okay.

446
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,120
Can you boil it down?

447
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,280
Ah, this is a pasta that's supposed to
have sauce like that.

448
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,520
Honey, she says it's supposed to be
like that.

449
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,920
No... it's yucky.

450
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,960
Well, everyone has different tastes.
Can you boil it down?

451
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,000
And why don't you put in more mussels?

452
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,160
How come there's only a few mussels?

453
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,400
Excuse me? I don't think it's a few.

454
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,760
Look... One, two, three,
four, five, six...

455
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Why don't you just give it to us,
if we ask for it, huh?

456
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,760
Is being rude to customers the concept
in this restaurant?

457
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:58,480
Do you all take after the chef?
Everyone here is just a mess.

458
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,520
Yes, sir.

459
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,400
That nasty man.

460
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,920
Acting like he's all that just because
he's in front of his girlfriend.

461
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,760
I'm only doing this because the owner
here is in a difficult situation.

462
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,040
If it were really up to me...

463
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,320
Why, I would just...

464
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,400
-What are you doing?
-What?

465
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
The customer wanted me to heat it up
so that the sauce was less watery.

466
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,040
So, I asked you... what are you doing!

467
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,040
Why are you getting angry?
I told you, didn't I?

468
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,800
The customer asked me heat it,
so do you see? This gochujang.

469
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm going to add this and boil it down.

470
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,920
Why are you throwing that away?
It's such a waste.

471
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,440
If you add gochujang,
it becomes thick and tasteless.

472
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,200
Who are you to touch my cooking?

473
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,440
Are you a chef? Are you the owner?

474
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,640
I'm sorry, Chef.

475
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,560
I acknowledge my mistake.

476
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,680
But, those people were going on about
the chef assaulting someone.

477
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,560
I was thinking of you when I did it.

478
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,520
Who are you...
Who are you to think of me?

479
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,840
What the heck! Can't I think of you?

480
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,760
And why are you so twisted about things?

481
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,520
If someone has good intentions,
can't you just accept it as that?

482
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,520
-Did you just talk informally?
-Can't you just accept it, sir?

483
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,840
Wow, seriously...

484
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,200
You...

485
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,440
I...

486
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:45,520
Seeing how you've been acting yesterday
and today, you misunderstood my warning.

487
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,680
You're banned from the kitchen
for the time being.

488
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,360
You can work in the hall only.

489
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,800
Don't make any judgments on your own
or think on your own.

490
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,680
You must be really crazy.

491
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,560
I wish I could really hit him,
just once.

492
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,720
Gosh! Why is he so darn rude!

493
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,520
So annoying.

494
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,680
You should've tried to accommodate them.
Things aren't even good now.

495
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,920
There's nothing to worry about.

496
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,960
If you get hurt while running,
those are just the effects.

497
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
Now that there are less customers,
it's kind of nice to have free time.

498
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,960
Yes, Police Commissioner.
I was going to call you anyway.

499
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,640
Excuse me?

500
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,760
-What do you mean, we settled?
(-Oh you didn't know?)

501
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,840
(Ah, your mother went to the complainant.)

502
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,800
(She apologized and delivered the money
for the agreement.)

503
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,480
Oh, you startled me.

504
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,520
What are you doing here, at this hour?

505
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,560
Who told you to settle the lawsuit?
Why would you?

506
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,760
Is that why you're here?

507
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,640
I'm asking you why you did it. Why
would you get involved in my affairs?

508
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,480
What could I do? You refused to do it.

509
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:15,480
There were so many comments on the
article and she's meeting with reporters.

510
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,720
It was only a matter of time before you
hit bottom. How could a mom do nothing?

511
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,920
Because you're my 'mom'?
Wow, you've brought me to tears.

512
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
You never even made me a proper meal.

513
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,320
You didn't come home until early morning
and left me cold and crying.

514
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,840
And now you're talking
about being a mom?

515
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm 33 years old, Mom.

516
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,720
I don't need you anymore.
You should've been there when I did.

517
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,640
That's right. I was too young.

518
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,400
I was busy trying to study, eat,
and live.

519
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,880
I feel bad about being a bad mother
and I'm trying to make up for it.

520
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,800
Do you have to act this way?

521
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,960
-I must've been raised wrong!
-That's right, awful boy.

522
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,000
-You live your life and I'll live mine.
-Gosh...

523
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,680
Please, let's do that.

524
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,920
-You awful punk, nasty man!
-That hurts, Mom!

525
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,080
No matter how much wrong I did,
I'm your mother.

526
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,880
This is why everyone says you're rude
with no manners. You know that?

527
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,280
-Hello!
-Hello, Professor.

528
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,160
Oh, yes.

529
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,320
Not my boyfriend! He's my son.

530
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,880
I told you to carry that talisman,
didn't I?

531
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,280
Your fortune this year is rough.
Didn't I tell you to carry it around?

532
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,520
Because you didn't listen to your
mother, bad things like this happened.

533
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,720
Do you know that, you show off?

534
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,800
-Why are you bringing that up again?
-Be quiet!

535
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,800
The agreement cost five million won.
Send the money.

536
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,560
-Five million won?
-That's right!

537
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,120
That was a discount because she's a fan
of mine. You don't know anything.

538
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,440
Whatever... Send me your account number.
I'll send it.

539
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,920
Oh gosh!

540
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,240
She sure sent it fast.
Fine, I'll send the money now.

541
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,720
Wait, I'm short on cash a little bit.

542
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,520
Right, today is fund settlement day.

543
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,880
Give me a discount of 800,000 won.

544
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:21,440
No, that's not it. It's settlement
day and I'm short on cash.

545
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,280
If not, then seize my belongings
or something. Bye.

546
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,200
This doesn't make me look very cool.

547
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,320
What, lady! What?

548
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,640
So-hyung .

549
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,240
I totally forgot to call you.

550
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,800
Yesterday and today were just...

551
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,920
full of various happenings.

552
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:48,880
I know. So, I was going to go alone.
But I thought you should clear your mind.

553
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:53,400
You did good. You did.
There's way less customers.

554
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,440
I have lots of time.

555
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,240
Are you okay or pretending to be okay?

556
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,720
I'm okay, of course.

557
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,600
It worked out better anyway.
I was just too busy.

558
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,760
You know how it is.
I was just too successful.

559
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,040
Okay, then I'll assume that you're okay.

560
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,280
Come on my program.
The shoot is next week.

561
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,400
What? What program?

562
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,320
A TV program... At this time?
That's nonsense.

563
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,960
It makes more sense at this time.

564
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,080
Do you know what the best strategy is?
It's an all-out attack.

565
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,960
Come out and be confident.
You can explain if you want, too.

566
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,320
If you hide now, people will think you
did something wrong.

567
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,080
Since it's a survivor concept,
it's a focus on your skills too.

568
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,800
It's a variety concept too,
so it's good for your image.

569
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,199
You're a great speaker too.

570
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,840
That's true. I am very entertaining.

571
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,840
But, well...

572
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,760
You guys must be done casting.

573
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,720
-We did cast Chef Yoon Se-shin.
-Chef Yoon Se-shin? I don't know...

574
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,200
That's what I'm saying.
He's not the right level.

575
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,720
He's a lower class.

576
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,280
I can cancel with him easily.
You can leave that to me.

577
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,040
Still, I don't think this is right.

578
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,080
I'll only wait one day, not any longer.

579
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,800
Have you been well, Chang-gyu?

580
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,120
I brought Sun-woo because you said
you missed him.

581
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,000
Did you? You're too nice.

582
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,520
I hated you to death.

583
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,760
-What's with you again?
-Just because...

584
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,720
Sun-woo...

585
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,760
There's a song lyric,
'Be good while he's still with you'...

586
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,080
To me, it's not funny at all.

587
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,280
I really should've been good to him
while he was still here.

588
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,960
JOO CHANG-GYU

589
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,840
Look at this. It's not dropping out of
the top 5 search words.

590
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,360
Wouldn't you say this is at the level
of a celebrity?

591
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,480
Wow, there are over 500 comments.

592
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,920
This is crazy, seriously.

593
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,960
He's got a nickname too.

594
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,640
Kang Sun-woo. Gangchef!

595
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,320
Short for 'gangster chef'.

596
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,360
Wow, those losers have nothing to do.
These witch hunts are a serious problem.

597
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,040
The witch hunt is not the problem.

598
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,560
The problem is the society that
encourages it.

599
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,400
These people have nothing and
nowhere to take their stress out on.

600
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:41,040
No matter how hard they work, only
the first and the best is recognized.

601
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,680
And they end up wiping the butts
of those who are rich and famous.

602
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,880
They should at least leave comments
for stress relief.

603
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:59,680
Not that I'm saying I was one of them.
Okay?

604
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,360
Didn't I bring my charger?

605
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,880
Anyway, whoever came up with
the nickname...

606
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,680
Did an awesome job. Gangchef.

607
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,480
He is skilled at assaulting people
with his words.

608
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,960
-Hello.
-You're here.

609
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,880
Seriously.

610
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,800
Oh, Chef.
Is it okay if I use the bathroom?

611
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
You said that I always need
to get your permission.

612
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,240
Do whatever you want.
And don't ever talk to me, okay?

613
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,840
Hey, hey, hey.

614
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,960
My friend works at Chef Marco's place,
and apparently they are ecstatic.

615
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,400
Saying that you won't be able to come
on TV since you must be too ashamed.

616
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,640
He should be more concerned
about himself.

617
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,280
You know he's all round...
lacking in looks.

618
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,840
Not only in looks.

619
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,720
His cooking skills are lacking too.

620
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,680
This won't work.

621
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,200
That pig bastard is annoying the
crap out of me.

622
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,520
Today is all kinds of a mess.

623
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,800
Give me a break, seriously.
He's ecstatic, huh?

624
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,440
SO-HYUNG

625
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,320
Hello? Hello...

626
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,160
Is this So-hyung ?

627
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,400
Oh, hey, I pressed the wrong speed dial.

628
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,400
Did you get back to work okay?

629
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,200
-So next week...
-Oh. I'm leaving the kitchen now.

630
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,920
I have a recording scheduled for a
TV show next week.

631
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
I wasn't interested in doing it,
but my friend asked me for a favor.

632
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,680
I'll need a second chef.
Min-soo, do you want to do it?

633
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,400
-Me... me?
-What's wrong?

634
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,040
-Dong-chul?
-Yes, thank you.

635
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,120
No. Gosh.

636
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,520
I will.
I will have to be your second chef.

637
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,200
-Okay, you do it.
-Yes, Chef.

638
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,120
Anyway, that day we'll just open for lunch.

639
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Yes, Chef.

640
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,400
Chef, shouldn't I go for a
special skin care session?

641
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,200
-Right. You shouldn't.
-Ah, I see.

642
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,120
This isn't like looking for
husband Kim in Seoul.

643
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,480
I can't even run my business because
of that virgin ghost. What is this?

644
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,800
So hot.

645
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Oh no. Yes, I understand.

646
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,120
I'm looking for her. Yes.

647
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,120
It's not a crime to be able to see
ghosts. Gosh. That idiotic wench.

648
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,280
Oh, yes. Hello. This is Seobinggo.

649
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,440
Oh, yes, Bodhisattva.
(an enlightened being in Buddhism)

650
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,120
I'm Cho Hye-young.
Professor Kim gave me your number.

651
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,040
Yes, I'm calling about my son.

652
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,920
Seobinggo-dong is
a bit far from where I am.

653
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,320
Any chance you can come to where I am?

654
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,200
Travel expenses?

655
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,400
Of course, I'll pay for your
travel expenses.

656
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,440
Okay, yes. Yes, I'll wait for your text.

657
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,400
I guess she must be good

658
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,880
since she's demanding a lot of money.

659
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,880
Hey mister.

660
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,720
-Another bottle of soju please.
-Sure.

661
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,080
How come you are alone today?

662
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,720
What happened to the one
that was with you before?

663
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,200
Oh, my ex-boyfriend?

664
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,160
We broke up two months ago.

665
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,640
Maybe it's because I'm not dating anyone
now. It feels especially lonely and

666
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,320
I keep worrying about my son these days.

667
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,480
They say my son will have ill luck
this year.

668
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,880
He has no clue
how much I worry about him.

669
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,040
Kids are all like that.

670
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,360
Honestly, I'm a big failure as a mother.

671
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,880
I got pregnant by accident when I was
19 and gave birth.

672
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,120
I lived with the guy and also had
a daughter later.

673
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,840
I asked my aunt to raise my daughter
so I could go to college.

674
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,320
I didn't even make them a nice meal.

675
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,320
I never even made it to my son's
graduations.

676
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,240
How lonely he must've felt. All
because he was given to a bad mother.

677
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,240
I see.

678
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,400
Anyway, mister owner, are you single?

679
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:38,640
Are you in 30s? 40s?

680
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,080
You sure it'll be okay to go on air?

681
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,800
-What if something goes wrong...
-Don't worry.

682
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,960
Don't you know I have a knack for
being on TV?

683
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,240
I'm going to obliterate
all my anti-fans.

684
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,520
-Mom.
-Hey, gangchef!

685
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,280
My smart son. Bring a bottle of wine.

686
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,160
Bring me some wine.

687
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,880
Eun-hee, you come here too.

688
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,720
-No, no. Just one glass of wine.
-Come on.

689
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,240
-No, no, no. Mom. Let's go.
-Just one glass.

690
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,840
-I should stay still?
-Yes, mom, you should.

691
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,680
Oh, Eun-hee.

692
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,560
This kid sent me money today.
His settlement fund.

693
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,680
He never gives me money.

694
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,360
Oh, Eun-hee.
Should we go for a second round?

695
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,960
No, we should go to the car, not there.

696
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,800
-No, no, let's go for another round.
-No, we should go to the car.

697
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,200
-We are here. Get in.
-We are?

698
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,800
-Okay.
-Alright.

699
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,240
-We should've called for help.
-No, it's okay.

700
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,040
-What are we going to do?
-I'll get the car out soon.

701
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,440
Why do you keep putting the shoes
in the room?

702
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,400
If she can't hold her liquor,
she shouldn't have had any.

703
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,720
Always showing off, pretending
to be tough. Her entire life is a show.

704
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:06,400
Is cockiness hereditary?

705
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,640
Who are you? Hey.

706
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,320
What? Don't follow me.
Your owner isn't around.

707
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,720
Hey, stop.

708
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,720
I don't really like dogs. And I'm not
the type to feed stray dogs either.

709
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,120
What the heck?

710
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,960
Here.

711
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,760
Is it yummy?
I guess so since you seem to enjoy it.

712
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:36,560
I told you not to follow me.

713
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Are you a stalker?

714
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,440
Wow, now I even have a dog as a fan?

715
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,920
Hey, I'm feeding you and letting
you sleep here today.

716
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,600
But, there's no way we're repeating
this tomorrow. Okay?

717
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,320
I can't keep you.
Understand? Got it?

718
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,200
You're eating well.

719
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,760
Here. Okay. This is it.

720
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,480
I should be seducing a guy
when I'm possessing a body

721
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,120
for the long term like this.

722
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,880
Gosh, how can a body look the
same from the front and back?

723
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,360
That's why split second decisions
matter so much

724
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,280
regardless of whether
you're a person or a ghost.

725
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,600
What's that?

726
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,280
Oh, that cop.

727
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,920
(Where did I see him? He looks familiar.)

728
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,720
(Did I try to seduce him before?)

729
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,520
(That's not it...)

730
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,640
Oh no...

731
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,320
-I think they are dead.
-Oh no...

732
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,360
-Really?
-My goodness.

733
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,080
Oh, mister cop is totally hot.

734
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,760
My heart totally skipped a beat.

735
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:16,160
He's my type.

736
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:33,080
I mean how can you charge 5,000 won
for soft tofu that tastes so bad?

737
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,520
All I got for side dishes is old kimchi.

738
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,520
Why didn't you say something
before you ate?

739
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,320
Does it make sense to do this
after you're done?

740
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:42,800
It's okay.
It's fine. You can just go.

741
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,880
-Dad!
-It's okay.

742
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,880
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

743
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,800
Is there a problem?

744
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,920
-No.
-No...

745
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,320
I'm not saying I won't pay.

746
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,520
I'm just saying it's a bit pricey
considering how it tastes.

747
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,680
Thank you.

748
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:04,840
I should never come back here.

749
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,560
Dad, you shouldn't do that. How do we
make money if you sell a meal for free?

750
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,200
What he said isn't exactly false.

751
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,520
I'm sorry Officer Choi. Take a seat.

752
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,400
I told you we should go elsewhere.

753
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,400
Okay, what can I get you?

754
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,240
-Two soft tofu stews please.
-Alright. Just wait one moment.

755
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,560
(You know the mission will get revealed
during the recording, right?)

756
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,880
That's the concept.

757
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,040
Of course.
It's all about being real these days.

758
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,200
But, any way I can get two more
guards in the back?

759
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,800
Sometimes the losing chef
can get violent.

760
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,640
Don't worry.
I don't fight someone bigger than me.

761
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,280
By the way, Chef Marco,
your size is perfect for this show.

762
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,840
Since your body is just so real.

763
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:12,320
-Um, Chef.
-Yes.

764
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,200
-I've got to go pee. Pee.
-Okay, hurry.

765
00:48:18,040 --> 00:48:22,440
Idiot. You idiot. You must've left your
mind at the karaoke bar yesterday.

766
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,040
Hey, Bong, it's me.

767
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,720
You know... the knife.
Chef's knife. I need you bring it here.

768
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,480
What? Chef's personal knife? Hold on.

769
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,720
Oh, it's here.

770
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,000
(Kang Sun-woo.)

771
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,320
Born in the year of guihai.

772
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,520
How old are you again?

773
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,040
How do you have a son older than
30 already?

774
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,720
Well, it just turned out that way.

775
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,120
Wow, it's intense.

776
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,000
-His fortune is unusually intense.
-Right?

777
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:14,800
People say he has a fortune of two arms
and the gates of ghost.

778
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,600
That's why you got
so many talismans for him?

779
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,000
How did you know?

780
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,240
It's so frustrating. What good is it
if I get a talisman for him?

781
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
My nasty son rips up every single
one of them.

782
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,640
The Chinese Astrology
won't be enough.

783
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,840
I'll have to read his physiognomy.

784
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,160
What?

785
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,160
A person's destiny is

786
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,000
determined by how that person is
living right now.

787
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,880
And that's all written on the face.

788
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,320
Let's see...

789
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,560
You got to do everything you wanted
even though you lived a hard life, huh?

790
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,000
Your face has an air of resplendence.
You can't live without a man.

791
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,800
Oh, you are a master cougar.

792
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,240
-Right?
-So amazing...

793
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,960
You can tell all that from physiognomy?

794
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,720
When you get a chance, can you read my
son's physiognomy at his restaurant?

795
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,680
I'll tell you where his restaurant is.

796
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,400
If I travel offsite again from an
offsite location...

797
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,480
My fee gets quadrupled.

798
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,720
It's right here.

799
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,800
Well, the land location is good.

800
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,360
(Why is she here? Wait...)

801
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,600
(I'm Na Bong-sun right now.)

802
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,800
-Oh, Na...
-Uh.

803
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,320
I wonder why she just left without
saying hello. How odd.

804
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,160
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

805
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,440
Can you do this side?

806
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,040
What is it? Why are you here?

807
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,520
The sous chef called and asked me
to bring your knife.

808
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,800
What, that punk. I told him to take
care of that stuff.

809
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,440
Wow, the make-up makes you look
totally strange and awkward.

810
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,240
-What?
-Just kidding.

811
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,240
It's not bad. You look nice.
That's really cool.

812
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,240
Why isn't he coming anyway?
After creating this mess?

813
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,640
Please continue.

814
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,240
(Mister, I am a cast member.
My pass is inside.)

815
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,040
That's why I'm asking.
Which program is it?

816
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,640
-What's the PD's name?
-I heard it, but I forgot... I forgot.

817
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,680
Okay, okay...

818
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,320
-Open it up.
-No way.

819
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,720
Get yourself a visitor's pass or
you can just leave.

820
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,040
Producer, hi...

821
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,960
Seriously, I have to get in.

822
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,480
I have to go, I have to go, I have to go!
I have to go! I have to go!

823
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,840
What is it? Is there a problem?

824
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,640
-We're shooting soon.
-Min-soo's not here, that dummy.

825
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,960
You have to get in there now.

826
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,760
There's no more time.

827
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,120
Isn't she one of your employees too?
I think I saw her at the restaurant.

828
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,280
You can take her with you.
We have no time, Sun-woo.

829
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,480
Please do this for us.

830
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,920
Don't do a thing.
I'll take care of it all.

831
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:18,960
You always say, don't do anything.

832
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,240
That feels nice.

833
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,400
Before we head into the mission...

834
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,920
-Let's hear a statement from our chefs.
-Yes.

835
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,960
-Chef Kang Sun-woo.
-I don't have much to say.

836
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,800
These are not hands that hurt people,
but hands used for cooking.

837
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:42,200
It seems that Chef Kang Sun-woo is
using this program to...

838
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,920
Indirectly give an explanation of his
situation.

839
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,640
-I won't be indirect. I'll be direct.
-Okay.

840
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,240
Not everything you see is always true.

841
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,160
My conscience
and that person's conscience,

842
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,160
we both know what really happened.

843
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,800
-Assuming we both have conscience.
-Yes, that's true.

844
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,280
I am very curious about what that
truth is.

845
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,080
It would be nice to officially hear
about it another time.

846
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,640
Okay, let's not waste anymore time.

847
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,080
Here is the random mission sent in from
a viewer.

848
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,520
Here it is...

849
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,200
After receiving
army enrollment notice...

850
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,560
prepare the morning rice meal a mother

851
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,080
would feed a son who drank the night before.

852
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,520
A duel between two master chefs.

853
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,880
Chef vs. Chef, starts now!

854
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,440
There's only 10 plus minutes left
remaining.

855
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,480
We're going to take a look at how far
they've progressed.

856
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,880
-First, Chef Marco...
-Yes.

857
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,680
Oh, is he already finishing up?

858
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:14,400
-He's neatly plating his food.
-Yes, he is.

859
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,000
Chef, I think the rice is burning.

860
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:54,920
What are you doing?

861
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,600
I said, what are you doing?

862
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,680
It's nurungji pollack soup.

863
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,880
-What?
-Nurungji pollack soup.

864
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:11,280
Oh... We don't sell that anymore.

865
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,760
-Oh really.
-Yes.

866
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,840
I came because I wanted to eat that.

867
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:21,800
I stopped working for a while and
I started again.

868
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,000
I see.

869
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,440
I remembered that pollack soup.

870
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,120
But, I don't see your daughter.
Has she gone somewhere?

871
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,880
Yes, she left... For a bit.

872
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,440
Should I just...
give you the jeyuk?

873
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,360
(Two meals have been prepared that are
quite different.)

874
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,320
(-Yes.
-Yes, they are.)

875
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:51,200
First, the panel members will come in
and taste the food. Come in, please.

876
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:54,880
First, taste Chef Marco's food.

877
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,520
Next, taste Chef Kang Sun-woo's food.

878
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:03,880
It's quite different from Chef Marco's
meal.

879
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,960
Chef Kang Sun-woo's meal is a very cozy
and warm meal.

880
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:14,680
Why don't the two chefs that cooked
today take part in the tasting, as well?

881
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:26,400
The chefs will probably be satisfied
with their cooking, since it's their own.

882
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,880
-I'm sure there's a sense of pride.
-Yes.

883
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,560
Congratulations.

884
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,680
I think it turned out pretty fun too.

885
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,440
That's a relief. Good job.

886
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,440
Your traditional food idea was better
than I thought.

887
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,880
I was worried about you after the
mission was selected.

888
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,800
I know you dislike rice.

889
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,960
Just because I don't like it,
doesn't mean I can't cook it.

890
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,080
Chef, Chef!

891
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,160
-Chef, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!
-What the heck were you doing!

892
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,680
Oh, forget it. The shoot ended well.

893
00:56:58,800 --> 00:56:59,640
Gosh...

894
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,440
But, I think Bong-sun will have to
continue doing the show.

895
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:04,840
What?

896
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,640
Why? I'm supposed to do it.

897
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:12,360
I know that, but there needs to be
continuity. We can't change the helper.

898
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,960
No, you can't do that.
She's not qualified to do it.

899
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,200
And moving the machinery is really hard.
She's too weak to do all that.

900
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,320
Excuse me, coming through.
Move out of the way everyone.

901
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,840
Sun-woo, Sun-woo, Sun-woo...
Come on, Sun-woo.

902
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,840
Sun-woo, this makes no sense.

903
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,080
How can Bong be on TV?

904
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,760
Sun-woo, this can't happen.

905
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,360
Can you talk to the PD for me?

906
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,360
The bus has left the station.
You did this to yourself.

907
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,120
I did this to myself... I don't know.

908
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,800
We're all done here, right?
Then, I'll go back and organize it.

909
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,680
Look at him...

910
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,960
-Na Bong-sun.
-Yes?

911
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,800
-You can come in the kitchen tomorrow.
-Excuse me?

912
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,760
Are you deaf? I said... You can
come back in the kitchen tomorrow.

913
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,480
Ah, the kitchen? Sure, I'll do that.

914
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:08,560
I got it.

915
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,280
You must be thankful to me for the
shoot today, right?

916
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,880
Thankful? Yeah right.
Why are you grabbing my arm?

917
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,920
Let's go.

918
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:21,800
You are thankful. You and your pride.

919
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,480
Today felt like a good day.

920
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:31,240
It really is amazing. How did that idea
pop into my head, at that moment?

921
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,480
Burnt rice pollack soup.

922
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,040
Was it a food I always liked?

923
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,200
Wow, how much did he drink?

924
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,360
Oh dear...

925
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:54,480
What'll he do if he falls over...
Oh gosh.

926
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:00,440
Oh my! His face is totally bruised too.

927
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,160
Look here... uncle.

928
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,960
Young man!

929
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,840
You can't lie down here like this.
It's dangerous.

930
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,000
Auntie's going to come and get you.

931
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,560
Ah, why can't I mind my own business?

932
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,960
Oh, there's his dad.

933
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,560
(The customer you have dialed is
not available.)

934
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,960
Hey, uncle.
I've done more than my share.

935
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,880
-Hey!
-Oh, why am I such a good person?

936
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:10,760
Oh gosh, pull yourself together.

937
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:12,520
I'm going crazy.

938
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:17,080
-Oh no, oh no!
-Ouch.

939
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,040
Please, can you walk properly.
Seriously!

940
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:27,000
-I'm dying.
-You'll die at my hand.

941
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:29,000
We're here. We're here.

942
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:30,920
Oh my, wait.

943
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,280
-Bong-sun!
-Oh my!

944
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,360
What brings you by?

945
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,560
-Yes.
-Kyung-mo!

946
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,720
Oh, you know him?

947
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:39,880
What's wrong with you?

948
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,200
He was drunk and passed out over there.

949
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,680
Kyung-mo, why are you so drunk?

950
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,000
Sit down.

951
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,960
-Sit down here, Miss.
-Thanks. I'm good.

952
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,560
Yes, Mister. It's Officer Choi.

953
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:02,200
Yes, Kyung-mo is very drunk.

954
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,160
He was sleeping on the street and
a young lady brought him in.

955
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,240
Yes... yes.

956
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:14,320
Ah, okay then come.
Yes, come safely.

957
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:17,440
I'll be heading out now.

958
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,360
-Stay a bit, if you have time.
-Pardon?

959
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,480
His father would like to thank you.

960
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:26,480
There's no need. It was nothing really.

961
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,520
-Still, sit down. Have a coffee.
-Okay.

962
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,880
-Is black okay?
-Yes.

963
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,840
-Kyung-mo, Kyung-mo?
(-So, I knew this person?)

964
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,880
(He's not bad at all. I get a good vibe.)

965
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,400
(If he wasn't a cop, I'd just...)

966
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:50,040
Oh, thank you so much.
Where is my son?

967
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,920
-You're here, hello.
-Yes.

968
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,840
Oh, this kid. Hey, Kyung-mo.

969
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,880
Kyung-mo, hey. Get up now.

970
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,960
Wake up now, Kyung-mo...

971
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,880
Gosh, this kid.
Where did he drink so much?

972
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:07,640
Kyung-mo... Shin Kyung-mo!

973
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,320
Wake up already, wake up! Kyung-mo!

974
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:17,640
Hey, wake up. You have to get up.
We have to work now.

975
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,200
You think that'll wake him?

976
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,120
Hey, Shin Kyung-mo,
aren't you getting up?

977
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:25,400
-Wake up, wake up!
-Hey, hey...

978
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:28,600
-You punk. Your naps are too long.
-Don't hit me.

979
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,480
-Get up, get up.
-Don't hit me.

980
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,360
-Why you little...
-Hey, come on now.

981
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,640
-You hit me with that?
-Why are you hitting his head?

982
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,080
He keeps talking back to me.

983
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:40,320
I can't just leave him like that.
Oh my, look at the rudeness.

984
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,600
(Just don't hit me.)

985
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,880
(Oh, it's so busy... so busy.)

986
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,840
Okay, here's your food.

987
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,040
One bulgogi and three pollack soup please.

988
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,200
Soon-ae, one bulgogi
and three more pollack soups!

989
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,040
Okay, one bulgogi
and three more pollack rice soups.

990
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,800
Oh my, I'm so busy I'll die.

991
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:03,920
No, you can't. Even if you die,
you have to feed us first!

992
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,680
We're going to die of hunger!

993
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,720
I won't let you die of hunger,
so just wait a moment.

994
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:15,160
Kyung-mo, wake up now okay?

995
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:18,280
Hey, Kyung-mo...

996
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,360
What should I do with him?

997
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:25,120
Father...

998
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,480
(Soon-ae, when should we go shopping
for groceries?)

999
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,080
(Soon-ae, should I buy you some bandages?
Is your back feeling okay?)

1000
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:34,600
(Soon-ae, let's eat some rice.)

1001
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,200
(Hey, Soon-ae... Soon-ae...)

1002
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,360
(Soon-ae!)

1003
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,480
OH MY GHOST

1004
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,400
(Why did I leave behind all these
memories and die?)

1005
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:22,400
(Being born once and dying once...)

1006
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,800
(When you date, you should have like
two guys at once, no three guys!)

1007
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,040
Your eyes are really bad, right?

1008
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,560
Before, you couldn't even look me in
the eye. What's with you?

1009
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,400
(My face must be red right now.)

1010
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,400
Oh, I have no shame.

1011
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:35,920
Use all these.

1012
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,960
Things have been disappearing from the
kitchen for the past few days.

1013
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,040
You'll have lots of ghosts around you.

1014
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,440
-Get out!
-Me?
