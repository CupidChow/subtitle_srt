1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,640
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,200
OH MY GHOST

3
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,560
A 25-year old male.

4
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,479
Found unconscious on the stairs of
a club in Itaewon.

5
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,280
His vitals are unstable and his body
temperature is 25 degrees Celsius.

6
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,440
-Seems like he has hypothermia.
-Another one?

7
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,640
-Goodness.
-Hey, we got another one?

8
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,440
I know, right? I lost count for this
month. During a heat wave too.

9
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,720
Maybe it's a similar virus to Ebola?

10
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,800
What Ebola?

11
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,080
My theory is... It's drug related.

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,480
What did the police say?

13
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,760
The victims were all with women before
the incident.

14
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,680
-But?
-Their ID's and jobs all check out okay.

15
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,680
But, there is nothing connecting
these women.

16
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,720
-Then what is her true identity?
-No idea.

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,840
Oh, but we did find one common trait
of these women.

18
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,800
What is it?

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,640
All of them are exceptionally
beautiful and...

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,520
Have a well-proportioned figure.

21
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,200
A well-proportioned figure?

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,640
(What is her true identity exactly?
Not like she's a ghost or anything.)

23
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,880
(Maybe it is a ghost?)

24
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
Gosh, that bastard.
Getting me all hot and bothered.

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,840
That was a letdown.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,520
Leave!

27
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,400
Sorry.

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,360
You can see? Me?

29
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,720
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 1

30
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,240
(Hello. This is DJ Jin-hee from
"Music at Noon".)

31
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,880
(Once again, today's high will be
north of 30 degrees Celsius.)

32
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,440
(On this hot summer day...)

33
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,240
(I'm sure everyone has their
own way of dealing with the heat.)

34
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
(Turning on a fan or AC is a given.)

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
(Ah, watching a horror movie could
help too.)

36
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,240
(Ghosts... Scary, right?)

37
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,560
(Oh, did you know...)

38
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
(I read this from a book.)

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,960
(Usually people think of a ghost
in a white gown, with long black hair...)

40
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,600
(Only appearing in a deserted house.)

41
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,279
(But the truth is, they exist in our
daily lives. Right now. Next to us.)

42
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,240
(Ghosts. Chatting away.)

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,200
Amazing weather.

44
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,640
This heat is making me so lethargic.

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,240
-True.
-What's for lunch?

46
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,600
Bibimbap for me. Or cheonggukjang?
Cheonggukjang could be good today.

47
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,320
On a scorching hot day like today,
we should go for cold noodles.

48
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Okay, I'm in for cold noodles.

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,280
-Okay!
-Eat rice.

50
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
Koreans get strength from rice.

51
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,840
-I already feel cold...
-Yeah.

52
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,360
-Just thinking of cold noodles.
-Rice! Rice! Rice!

53
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,600
-Rice!
-Right? Let's go.

54
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Should've taken me along.

55
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,000
I wanted to go along and enjoy my eye
candies, but not a chance for me huh.

56
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,200
You think you're all that because
you're handsome.

57
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,360
(I am a ghost.)

58
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,120
(A virgin ghost at that.)

59
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,600
(The ghost with the most bitter
grudge out of all ghosts.)

60
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,960
(Imagine how painful it must've been
to die as a virgin)

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,240
(to decline the heavens' invitation and
roam around this 'other world'.)

62
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,360
(I'm known as the ill-natured libertine
queen of the ghost world.)

63
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,200
(But I wish to be understood.)

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,440
(I'm a pitiful love song,
a soul full of regrets.)

65
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,640
(And I'm so, very bored.)

66
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,640
Hey, who are you?

67
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,960
You're so pretty.

68
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you want to play with me?

69
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,720
Can you see me?

70
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
The ball, ball, ball!

71
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,040
Wow, the sky is ridiculously high.

72
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,320
So blue.

73
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,120
Very pretty.

74
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,520
Gosh, this is depressing.

75
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:50,159
I should find some funeral food and
get some energy.

76
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,480
Dong-chul, Dong-chul, Dong-chul.

77
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,080
Stir the sauce in one consistent
direction. What the heck are you doing?

78
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Give it to me.

79
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,600
-Like this. Like this. Like this.
-Okay!

80
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,560
I know, but my arm fell asleep so...

81
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,240
That's why you need to work out.
That's also a skill, you know?

82
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,360
Yes.

83
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,720
You do look like a manager
at some corporation.

84
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,440
Who would see you as someone that's
a year younger than me?

85
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,320
Your face discourages anyone from
talking to you informally. So dull...

86
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,680
-That's not...
-He's not dull. He's more sharp...

87
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,960
He does look older than his age...

88
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,920
but it's worse because Sous Chef,
you look way younger than your age.

89
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,960
People think you're in your 20's, right?

90
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,640
Yeah, I even got high school before.

91
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,200
I almost spoke informally to you at first.

92
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,360
I bet.

93
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,040
Dong-chul, I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry!

94
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,040
Okay.

95
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,520
Hey, Jun.

96
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,720
The meat is too thick.
Are you making steamed galbi?

97
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,360
Huh? The meat for the stock should
settle nicely in the soup.

98
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
You don't know these things?

99
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,400
Le Cordon Bleu didn't teach
you these things?

100
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,760
-They don't teach those things.
-Do you think I don't know that?

101
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,480
I was being snarky. Do you know
what metaphors or satires are?

102
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,680
Wow, I'm busting his chops, but he's not
fazed. Maybe I should just fire him.

103
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
Hey, Sous Chef. Is something burning?

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,039
My heart is burning. I have a heartburn!

105
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,480
This is why I don't like those who
studied abroad.

106
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,360
What good is it to have top
qualifications when your character sucks?

107
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,039
Oh, it does smell like something
is burning.

108
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
It's from outside.

109
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,440
Hey, hey, hey!

110
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,400
Hey! Na Bong-sun!
Are you out of your mind?

111
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,760
-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Look at all the smoke. What do we do now?

112
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,920
Who falls asleep while cooking sauce?
Who does that?

113
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,120
I'm sorry Sous Chef. I'm very sorry.

114
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you think an apology is enough?
You almost caused a fire!

115
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,640
Why don't you even have the bare basics?
I should just fire you.

116
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Whose restaurant are
you trying to burn down?

117
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
I'm sorry, Sous Chef.

118
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,400
Not your restaurant.

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,600
I thought this was the Himalayas.
Such a thick layer of fog.

120
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,720
The scenery here is epic. Don't you think?

121
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
Heo Min-soo,
what's your role in this kitchen?

122
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,000
-Sous Chef.
-Then you're number two.

123
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,800
Earlier, you acted like this is
your restaurant. Taking so much care.

124
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,960
But, you left someone like this in
charge of sauce?

125
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,920
Honestly, I was on it the whole time,
but asked her to watch it for ten minutes.

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,040
-She couldn't last such a short moment.
-Is any moment in the kitchen short?

127
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,200
Those moments are life and death.
Don't you know?

128
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,640
I'm sorry. It was my mistake.

129
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,400
I'm sorry, Chef. It was my fault.

130
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,160
You go around bad mouthing me, right?

131
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,440
Well, it's okay.

132
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,880
The work here is crappy and difficult.
It's heavy labor.

133
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,480
At least, you need to bad mouth your boss.

134
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,680
No way, Chef. How can I even dare?

135
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,320
But then you delegate your work to
someone else.

136
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,040
Lacking professionalism...

137
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,600
I can't tolerate that.

138
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,400
That's part of your nature and character.

139
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,560
Not something you can learn.

140
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,360
I'll keep that in mind, Chef.

141
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,640
Let's do well, Min-soo.

142
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,440
-Yes, Chef.
-Do well, okay?

143
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,400
Yes, Chef.

144
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,160
-I'll keep my eye on you.
-Yes, Chef.

145
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm in my 30's and
I'm being disciplined like a child.

146
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,280
This is so degrading.
I should leave and start my own place.

147
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm sorry, Sous Chef.

148
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,880
Hey, Bong-sun. You.

149
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,320
You, Bong, damn Bong. Seriously.

150
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,880
Why can't you sleep at night?

151
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,720
Why are you falling asleep
during the day? Why?

152
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,880
Why!

153
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,000
-Let's do better, huh?
-Okay.

154
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,360
Gosh.

155
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,120
My goodness.

156
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,880
Oh, gosh.

157
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,040
It stings!

158
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,600
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name

159
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,600
thy kingdom come, thy will be done

160
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,320
on earth as it is in heaven.

161
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes, Grandma.

162
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,440
(Why do you sound so weak?)

163
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,080
(Have you eaten?)

164
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,920
Yes. How about you?
You're doing well, right?

165
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,520
(You know me. How about you?)

166
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,400
(Are you getting any sleep?)

167
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,840
(Are ghosts still bothering you?)

168
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,120
No. I'm sleeping well.
And they haven't been coming lately.

169
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,960
That's good to hear. You should not live
like I used to as a shaman.

170
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,360
Make sure to burn incense
where you sleep. Okay?

171
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,720
Okay... Bye, Grandma.

172
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,240
Ouch.

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,880
Ah, what do I do now?

174
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,680
Okay, report card.

175
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,160
-Good work.
-There's nothing I'm bad at.

176
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I'm good at cooking, good looking,
and witty.

177
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,840
The heavens are being unfair.
Giving me everything.

178
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,200
You would be perfect if you didn't
always compliment yourself.

179
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,000
That is the weakness
I intentionally created.

180
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,640
If I am too perfect, then I'd be hated.

181
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,160
You're so friendly like this, but I wonder
why you're hostile towards two women.

182
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,360
-Who?
-Bong-sun.

183
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,040
She's becoming more diffident since
you're being hard on her.

184
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,040
I just don't like her.
Who's the other one?

185
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,560
-Hello.
-Perfect timing.

186
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,200
You came, Mom.

187
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,880
Are you here to check?

188
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,320
You're making me dizzy. Can you sit?

189
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,120
I told you not to come to the restaurant.

190
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,360
Are you embarrassed by me?

191
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,840
Why can't I come to my son's restaurant?

192
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,920
The customers say stuff.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,360
They ask if you're my aunt.

194
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,560
Or if you're my secret older lover.
Total nonsense.

195
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,520
-Having me when you're only 19.
-What about it, huh?

196
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,520
Is my life theirs?

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,760
-Who says these things?
-That's why you should live your life.

198
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,760
Why come here?

199
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:06,840
He must get lessons on how to
speak in hurtful ways.

200
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
Sun-woo.

201
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,080
Sun-woo.

202
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,160
-Sun-woo.
-What is that?

203
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,080
It's not that.

204
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,040
You have the fortune of two arms.

205
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,400
You have intense vitality and this year,
there's a ghost in your fortune.

206
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,640
A ghost will be attached to you.

207
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,640
-Scary, right?
-Said who? Master Tae?

208
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,600
No, this is from
Mr. Jang in Seongbuk-dong.

209
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,520
Gosh, Mom.

210
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,160
Mom, I'm okay.
I told you I don't believe in ghosts.

211
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm not saying you should!

212
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,920
-Just keep it with you.
-I really don't want to.

213
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,640
I don't like this.

214
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,840
You're a professor.
Why are you into this superstitious stuff?

215
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,040
Do your students know you're like this?

216
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,640
-Gosh.
-Your phone... Phone.

217
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,880
Yes, PD Lee.

218
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,280
Yeah, I'm always busy. What is it?

219
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,200
-Over here!
-Hey.

220
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,200
You all came early.

221
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,480
Come sit down.

222
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,560
Hey, it's been a while.

223
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,520
Of course, I wondered why you weren't
showing up to eat sacrificial rites.

224
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,000
I suppose you'd be hungry.

225
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,480
You can't even get your own sacrificial
rites, so you must be so hungry.

226
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,920
It's actually funny,
if you think about it.

227
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,960
I've never heard of a ghost with a
memory problem.

228
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,600
That's true. That's not common.

229
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,600
Well, I guess if you died from a sudden
trauma, it's possible.

230
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,400
If you can't share your sacrificial rites
you shouldn't eat peoples' like that.

231
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,760
Even ghosts should have manners.

232
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,120
They say appetite for food and sex
usually go hand-in-hand.

233
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,400
You really can't hide the fact that
you're a virgin ghost, can you?

234
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
Hey, give it a rest.

235
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,760
-Even a dog is left alone to eat.
-You think you're better than a dog?

236
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,360
I hear you still possess women to go
around seducing men.

237
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,920
I hear Seobinggo is out to catch you.

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,960
It has nothing to do with you.

239
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,760
I'm saying this because it does have
something to do with me.

240
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,480
Because of you, we're all getting in
trouble as a whole.

241
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,800
They said not to do it from up above.
Why do you keep possessing people?

242
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,240
How about you?
You never did anything wrong?

243
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
I recall you used to possess people
quite often.

244
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,880
-We're both crazy ghosts. Let's fight?
-Yeah sure, let's go!

245
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,760
-I'll take you on.
-Let's go.

246
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,240
-Get over here.
-I can take you!

247
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:24,839
What's going on? Where are you
all going? Are you all scared?

248
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,000
Come at me, come at me!
I can take you all on!

249
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,440
You... You little wench.

250
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,160
-Are you doing well?
-No, I'm not!

251
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,040
How could I be when you're around?

252
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
Whatever do you mean...

253
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,560
-Go on and eat.
-Where do you think you're going?

254
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,880
You... You stand right there! Hey you!

255
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,280
Hey you! Hey!

256
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,640
Stop there!

257
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,240
Hey, hey!

258
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,880
Let go!

259
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, I'm not crazy.

260
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,040
I have to catch her. I'm not crazy.

261
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,400
She's scary fast!

262
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,640
Stop right there!

263
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
How much positive energy has
she been eating up?

264
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
I can't even catch her.

265
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,080
Stop right there!

266
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,040
That... That bus.

267
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,160
Taxi... Taxi!

268
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Gosh, that woman.

269
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,440
Hey, you wench!

270
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,240
Okay, let's hide here for now.

271
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,840
Gosh, where is she now?

272
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,880
Has she possessed someone again?

273
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,280
She's just not following the rules,
seriously.

274
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,800
It'd be best for you to come out.
Come out now.

275
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,040
Where is she?

276
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,640
-Sun-woo!
-Yeah.

277
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,560
Hey, you! I caught you.

278
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,040
-Get up, get up, get up.
-Take it easy.

279
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,920
Get up now.

280
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,440
Did you think I wouldn't be able to
catch you?

281
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,720
-Hurry up.
-What's going on?

282
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,040
-Hurry up.
-It hurts!

283
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:06,680
It hurts? Well, I'm hurting too from
chasing you around.

284
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,200
Oh... Stop putting on a show.

285
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,720
Seriously, who can control my mother?

286
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:20,560
When did she put this in here?
She drives me crazy.

287
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,920
Here you go, lukewarm Americano, right?

288
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,520
You don't like hot food, right?

289
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,800
You said it messes with your taste buds.

290
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,680
That was when I first started working in
the kitchen. I'm not a beginner anymore.

291
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,080
What's going on anyway?
I don't have much time.

292
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,920
Oh, I know, you're so busy.

293
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,440
Honestly, I'm working on a new program.

294
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,080
It's a cooking program where you receive
missions from the viewers.

295
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,560
I wanted you on the first episode with
Chef Marco.

296
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,480
He's doing another one?
He thinks he's a celebrity.

297
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,600
He has star quality and
an interesting career.

298
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,960
What do you think? You'll do it, right?

299
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,560
No, I don't do pilots.

300
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,280
I'll think about it if it becomes a
regular program.

301
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,560
Hey, even though I'm asking for a favor?

302
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,600
I have to cut back on my TV programs.

303
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,760
I didn't pay attention for a while,
and the culinary industry went downhill.

304
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,600
Oh my... such a show off.

305
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,400
I'm not a show off. I'm really that great.

306
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,600
How many times have I told you?

307
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,200
-So, you're really turning me down?
-Yes, I really am. I already have.

308
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,200
Wow, I'm sad.
Rejected by a friend I trusted.

309
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
-This is a life lesson.
-I'll be going now.

310
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,160
Oh yeah. I'm going there this weekend.
Do you want to go with me?

311
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,920
I'll see. He'll want it to be just the
two of you anyway.

312
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,680
I'll be going.

313
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,680
Get over here.

314
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,240
Aren't you going to look away?
I'm pressing my secret code.

315
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,320
You realize I'm trying to get out,
not in... right?

316
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,920
You're very detailed.

317
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,480
I better put a lock on the inside.

318
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,160
-7182.
-I'm going to change it!

319
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,040
SEOBINGGO-DONG SHAMAN HOUSE

320
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,200
-Help me...
-Stop acting.

321
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,200
These talismans won't hurt you.
They just keep you locked in.

322
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,760
Why are you picking on me?

323
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,280
Do you really want to know?

324
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,120
Because you possessed people and
went around fainting men....

325
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,520
There was quite a ruckus from up above.

326
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,240
Until I lock you up, they won't even
show me my fortunes anymore.

327
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,440
Well, what can I do? I like men.

328
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,000
Of course you do. You're a virgin ghost.

329
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Still, you're going to take over another
body...

330
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,640
And seduce men you were never able
to in your life?

331
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,400
Go on and keep trying.

332
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,560
There's no man out there that can
overcome the chill of a ghost.

333
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,080
What do you mean? I hear there is.

334
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,080
Sunshine of two arms.
A man full of Yang energy.

335
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,840
That's one in a million.
You dare to look for him?

336
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,800
Still, I should try.

337
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,680
If I pass the 3-year mark as a ghost,
I'll become an evil spirit.

338
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,120
I have to resolve this grudge before
then and leave this place.

339
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,240
That's what I'm saying...

340
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,120
You need to resolve your feelings.

341
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,760
Just forget this grudge, find peace,
and go on up.

342
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,040
Do you think I can control that?

343
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,480
If you keep going around like that,
something will go wrong!

344
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,200
If you happen upon a body whose
frequency matches perfectly...

345
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,520
You could get trapped and
not be able to get out.

346
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,560
I guess it's nice to have someone worry
about me.

347
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,280
It's nice to have someone to talk to,
as well.

348
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,960
You wench...

349
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,680
-You poor girl.
-What's with you?

350
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,040
I know just how you feel.

351
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,480
-This is so awkward.
-You have such a pretty neck.

352
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,680
You pretty girl.

353
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,560
Alright, alright...

354
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,160
Why are you so emotional today?

355
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,920
-I love you.
-I love you too.

356
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,520
What is this? What is this!

357
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,640
How could I trust you?
I have to put bells around your neck.

358
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,160
Wow! Am I a cat or a dog?

359
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,920
Don't even bother trying.

360
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm the only one who can take it off
or touch it.

361
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,120
No... Take it off! Take it off!

362
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,200
Oh, wow. Look at the maintenance fee.
Why is it so high?

363
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,480
Move, move, move.

364
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Gosh... Here you go.

365
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:14,720
By the way, shouldn't we eat dinner?
I think we'll be working late today.

366
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,760
What should we eat?

367
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,080
Chef's not here, so should we have rice?
Let's eat some rice.

368
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,280
If he gets here, he won't like it.

369
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,840
That's right. He really dislikes rice.

370
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,720
He doesn't like rice and side dishes.

371
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,600
What's with the Chef, seriously?

372
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,600
So what if he doesn't like rice?

373
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,520
Do we always have to eat noodles too?

374
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,120
Is he Nero or something?
He's like a dictator.

375
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,720
Chef has never enforced it.
We just followed along.

376
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,360
-That Cordon punk.
-Let's order quickly before Chef comes.

377
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,560
I'm really craving that
leek bibimbap that I had.

378
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,240
-Then, I'll have that too.
-Me too.

379
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
I'll have seonjiguk with radish leaves.

380
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,960
-Then... Hey, Bong!
-Yes?

381
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,840
Three leek bibimbaps, one seonjiguk,
and you have kimchi stew. There's no soup.

382
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,480
Oh, but... Are we really ordering?

383
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,920
Yes, we are really ordering.
The Sous Chef says to, so who cares?

384
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,320
Today, let's sit here like human beings
and eat our dinner.

385
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,320
Not stand and eat like a bunch of bums.

386
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,120
You haven't eaten yet, right?
Let's go in and make jjamppong.

387
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
-Yes.
-Yes, Chef!

388
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,440
Yes, Chef!

389
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,360
Has the salmon arrived?

390
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,040
-Should I bring it?
-Yeah, let's take a look.

391
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,080
-Tweezers.
-Here.

392
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,400
Where did they bring this from?

393
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:23,120
Are the customers alley cats?
I can't feed them this.

394
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,240
They must be crazy. Return this fish.

395
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,640
Tell them we'll stop doing business
with them if they keep this up.

396
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,520
Yes, Chef. I'm great at threats like that.

397
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,920
Chef, what do we do with the
scallops from yesterday?

398
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,960
Can't leave it much longer.

399
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,480
Oh yes, the scallops. We ordered too much.

400
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,880
What should we do? Is there spinach?

401
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,280
-Yes.
-Okay.

402
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,240
Change today's special to scallop and
spinach pasta.

403
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,800
-Okay.
-Everyone...

404
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll be responsible for the taste.
So, tell the customers it's really good.

405
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,720
-Advise them, don't force.
-Yes, Chef!

406
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,360
(Okay, orders are coming in!)

407
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,320
(Let's make it so delicious that the
customers think it's to-die-for.)

408
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,600
(Table 1, two specials. Table 2,
two seafood stews.)

409
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
-Hey, Jun.
-Yes?

410
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,600
-Noodles.
-Okay!

411
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,400
Table 5, two steak pastas and one special.

412
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,280
Table 7, one special, one lasagna,
so check the orders first!

413
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,160
Yes!

414
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,040
Table 8, two specials! Hey, pour this.

415
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,560
Hey, I got the specials.
Min-soo, do the pastas.

416
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,440
Yes.

417
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,480
Dong-chul, you do the salads.

418
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
Ji-woong, get this out there.

419
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:47,760
Yes, Chef.

420
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,600
-Bring me a deep frying pan!
-Yes, it's coming!

421
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,200
Here you go.

422
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,080
Hey, get some water in here.
Water, water...

423
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,640
Get the garlic going.

424
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,560
Hey, Min-soo. Table 5, since they are
pretty, make it extra delicious.

425
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,160
Okay, I saw, I saw.

426
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,640
Put in more salt.

427
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,800
Yeo Sal Jun Eul Sa Jun Gye Il Jo.

428
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,640
Yeo Sal Nim Yeo Sal.

429
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,560
Yeo Sal Jul Sa Jun.

430
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,840
Nim Yum Sal Nim Yum Sal.

431
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,360
Yeo Sa Jun Eul Sa Jun Gye Il Jo.

432
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:45,160
Shut up, would you! Sit down!

433
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,000
Who told you to put bells around my neck?

434
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,560
Ouch! That hurts!

435
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,400
-Good job everybody. Let's finish up.
-Yes, Chef.

436
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,400
Chef, if you're not busy,
come for drinks with us.

437
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,400
Don't say things you don't mean.
I'm going to go work out. See you guys.

438
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,760
-Yes, Chef.
-Thank you. Goodbye!

439
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,520
Goodbye...
At least he knows he's not wanted.

440
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,440
Let's quickly wash up and go.

441
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,480
Bye.

442
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,840
Gosh, I must have made 100 servings
of pasta today.

443
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,240
Why do customers keep coming? So annoying.

444
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,040
Still, if the business does well,
our pay might go up, right?

445
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,080
I doubt it. Look at Chef.

446
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,480
He's not half as good to us
as he is to his sister.

447
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,960
But, Eun-hee is no ordinary sister.

448
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,160
She's different.

449
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,720
She used to be so lively.

450
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,680
She lost her legs in a hit and run.
How must he feel seeing her?

451
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,840
That's why they say the heavens are fair.

452
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,000
In return, she has a good husband and
great brother.

453
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,640
How great for her.
They're both really great...

454
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,480
Cordon, why are you looking at me
like that?

455
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,600
-Do they teach you that at Le Cordon Bleu?
-No, they don't!

456
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,680
-They don't?
-Hey, hey. Let's go, Sous Chef.

457
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,960
Sous Chef, it's time for drinks.
What should we drink?

458
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,000
-Soju or beer?
-Both.

459
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,360
-Should we mix it up?
-Let's mix it up.

460
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,040
Gosh, I just can't stand it!

461
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,920
That guy is much younger than me.

462
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,080
Sous Chef's no big deal. Is he a king?

463
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,240
I wish I could just come out and
swing my fist and...

464
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,760
Shut up, you punk....gosh.

465
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,920
So, why'd you lie about your age to
begin with?

466
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,080
What could I do? I couldn't get
interviews because of my age.

467
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,120
I should've kept fixing cars.
Shouldn't have started cooking.

468
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,320
(Dong-chul, are you coming or not?)

469
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Oh, I'm coming! What's the rush?

470
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,720
We're all dressed. You can come in.

471
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,080
Here, enjoy. Thanks.

472
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,520
JOONGANG GOSHIWON

473
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,280
So noisy. Noisy!

474
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,600
It's so noisy.
I can't focus because of that.

475
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,760
I'm sorry... I'm an Assistant Cook.

476
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,600
I have to practice. I'll try to be quiet.

477
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,600
Everyone is a chef these days.
Those TV shows ruined the industry.

478
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm sorry.

479
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,480
(Because I was a weak child that often
had digestion issues...)

480
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,960
(My grandmother would make me
this cabbage porridge.)

481
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,760
(She scared me with acupuncture if
I didn't eat it.)

482
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,600
(So, I would drink it down in fear.)

483
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:32,600
(Thinking back to my grandmother who
relieved not only my stomach but my heart)

484
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,560
(today, I will post this cabbage
porridge recipe.)

485
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:41,440
(-Room 305! You have a delivery.)
-Okay.

486
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,680
Excuse me! Excuse me!

487
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes?

488
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,280
The soup got cold so the pictures
aren't coming out well.

489
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,800
Can you warm it up for me?

490
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,880
Um, then the noodles will get
overcooked, so it won't be good.

491
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,680
Look, I've been running a foodie blog
for five years now.

492
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,920
I know all about these things.

493
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,160
So when I tell you to warm it up,
just do as I say.

494
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,160
Okay.

495
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,600
-Mom, when will you be done?
-Just wait a little longer, okay?

496
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,160
Why can't I get a good shot?

497
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,760
-What are you doing?
-Um...

498
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,320
Just hurry, hurry up.

499
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
Ouch, it's hot!

500
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,480
Jun-soo, are you okay?
Did you burn yourself?

501
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,920
What is this?

502
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,840
Are you okay kid? Are you alright?

503
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,600
What are you doing? How can you be
so careless with a steaming hot bowl?

504
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,560
What if he got burns?

505
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,720
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

506
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,040
I mean kids run around because
they are kids.

507
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,000
Grown-ups should be the ones being
careful, not the other way around!

508
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,320
What kind of employee training is this?

509
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

510
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,240
Hey, how old are you?
Are you in kindergarten or no?

511
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,160
Did you learn that you shouldn't run
around in public places?

512
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,000
-I did.
-You did?

513
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:52,160
-Then did you do something wrong?
-I did.

514
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,280
You did, didn't you?

515
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,480
-What are you doing?
-What?

516
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,720
Oh, are you upset
because I'm disciplining him?

517
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,960
I, too, was upset because you were
disciplining my employee.

518
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,200
What kind of a ridiculous
situation is this?

519
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,200
I know, right?
It is a ridiculous situation.

520
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,000
Asking for the soup to be reheated
when the noodles will get overcooked.

521
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,120
And when it ends up being
not tasty, you'll...

522
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:14,440
Let go. I mean that alone was alarming
on its own.

523
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,280
But why blame an innocent person when
you couldn't control your kid?

524
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,880
What? Are you done talking? You think
you're all that because you were on TV?

525
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,880
-Please let's calm down first.
-What are you?

526
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,960
Huh, I guess there isn't anyone
normal here.

527
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,320
-Leave. Get out. Get out now!
-Let go!

528
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,880
This isn't even funny. Oh, my!

529
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,400
We only serve normal customers.
So just leave!

530
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,080
Seriously, I'm speechless.

531
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,880
Let's go, Jun-soo.
I'm not going to let this pass.

532
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,240
Excuse me. You dropped your card.

533
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,560
Do you know who I am? Let's go.

534
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,840
I'm sorry. Good bye.

535
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:01,880
Hey.

536
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,720
-I'm sorry.
-Really.

537
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,120
You. Come inside.

538
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,400
What do I do...

539
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,880
I'm really sorry Chef.
I should've been more careful.

540
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,320
Do you know why I dislike you?

541
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,760
-What?
-Your attitude irritates me.

542
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,880
Whether you did or didn't do something
wrong...

543
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,560
you're always sorry, always at fault,
and always wrong. That attitude...

544
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,480
That's not even being nice.

545
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,520
You don't even know that the way you
behave makes others around you look bad.

546
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm really... sorry.

547
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,400
The kitchen isn't an easy place to be.
It's a battlefield.

548
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,080
Only the strong and powerful can last.

549
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,840
You have no chance if you keep
making yourself out to be the weak one.

550
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,880
Let me give you sincere advice.

551
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,160
You should think long and hard. About
whether you belong in a kitchen or not.

552
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,720
Don't be foolish and stubborn, get hurt,
or be a nuisance to others.

553
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,560
Go put on some cream.
Girls' hands shouldn't have burn scars.

554
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,000
Did you give Bong-sun a hard time?

555
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,160
It wasn't Bong-sun's fault this time.

556
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,080
-Being nice isn't a crime.
-It is a crime to be nice.

557
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,880
Anyways, will we be okay?
She's an influential blogger.

558
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,680
Is that some sort of official rank?

559
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,120
These days, the more annoying bunch
than the reporters are bloggers.

560
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Who are they to give ratings?
Based on what kind of standard exactly?

561
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,760
Who is she trying to fool?

562
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,520
DAEMYUNG MIDDLE SCHOOL
JULY 15TH 18:30 ROYAL HOTEL

563
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,640
What? What is it?

564
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,240
Nothing. It's just spam.

565
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,600
DAEMYUNG MIDDLE SCHOOL
JULY 15TH 18:30 ROYAL HOTEL

566
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,320
DELETE

567
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,480
Gosh, everything fell out.

568
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,760
-So dirty.
-Sorry. I'll clean it up

569
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,200
Hey, it was your fault.

570
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,760
You shut up.
It's this idiot Kang Sun-woo's fault.

571
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,680
Can you move your foot...

572
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,280
You clean it.

573
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,280
(Sun-woo, mom won't be home
till late today.)

574
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,840
(I feel bad since it's your birthday.
Order some gimbap with this money.)

575
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,480
JUNGKI RESTAURANT

576
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,920
-Can we get our check here?
-Yes.

577
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
It's 15,000 won.

578
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,680
Yes, I'll be there in about 10-20 minutes.

579
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,920
Yup. Okay.

580
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:43,840
The side dishes today were a bit lacking.

581
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,720
Sorry, I couldn't get to market today.

582
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,560
No, it was good.

583
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,480
Here you go.

584
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,920
This is too much change.

585
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh my. What's wrong with me? I'm sorry.

586
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,760
You almost lost all your profit
from today.

587
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,360
I know.

588
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,360
-Where's Kyung-mo?
-Hanging out with friends.

589
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,680
It's better for me when he's not around.

590
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,200
I can't get the coffee to come out.

591
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:14,720
Again? Goodness.

592
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,400
Hold on a sec. Let me open it up first.

593
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,360
Oh, no, it's okay.

594
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,280
-Let me...
-It's fine. It's alright.

595
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Oh, Eun-hee, Eun-hee!

596
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,160
-I get scared when we go down the ramp.
-It's okay.

597
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,360
He's here.

598
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,400
-You waited long, right?
-Not at all.

599
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,000
-I had to resolve a civil case.
-Long time no see Mr. Kang!

600
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:43,520
-Hello.
-What! Oh my goodness, you shocked me.

601
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,200
Who is this goddess?
She completely stunned me.

602
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:47,480
-You came.
-Yes.

603
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
Officer Hwang, I guess you have
a new favorite restaurant.

604
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,080
You don't come by to have your
favorite seafood noodle soup.

605
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,400
What... You're disappointing me.

606
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,920
Of course I always crave seafood
noodle soup from here.

607
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:03,080
But, I need to stand in line to eat.
There are way too many people in line.

608
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,560
It's not my type of thing.

609
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,920
If you come by,
we'll get a special table for you.

610
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,160
Really? I knew my loyalty
would bear fruit.

611
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,280
-Be good to her.
-Yes, sir.

612
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,880
Oh, are you on your way somewhere?

613
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,920
Yes, a junior from school is opening
a restaurant so...

614
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,120
I should congratulate him by
giving him a lecture.

615
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,000
I see.

616
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,800
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

617
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,160
I should go too. See you tomorrow. Bye.

618
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,880
-Good work today.
-You too.

619
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,040
Okay. Shall we get going too?

620
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,760
Yes, husband.

621
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,800
Today was a long day.

622
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:47,680
-How about you?
-I was busy too. Hold on tight.

623
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:49,400
Let's go.

624
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,760
It's sophisticated.
Yes, classy. Very classy.

625
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,560
I thought why is it so classy?
It's exactly the same as my restaurant.

626
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,920
Whatever.
Did I bring the whole restaurant here?

627
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,120
That's right. Of course good things
are imitated. It's what you taught me.

628
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,800
This is an exact replica.

629
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,640
You're at it again, huh? Being a chef.

630
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:17,640
You know chefs eat with their nose 50%
and with their mouth 50% of the time.

631
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,520
That's true.

632
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,880
Finally, Chef Kang Sun-woo will
taste the food.

633
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,160
You won't go bankrupt.

634
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,840
It has good texture and flavor.

635
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,840
Yes!

636
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,680
Wow, what's with Sun-woo today?

637
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,480
Then does that mean I'm now
at the level of the dirt on your heels?

638
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,000
Hey, how can you compare a god to humans?

639
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,080
My cooking is the profound
secret of the heavens.

640
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,840
-Yes. Of course.
-That's right.

641
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:00,320
Hey, not everyone gets to hear
my advice. Listen carefully.

642
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,040
Don't ever play with food.
What you put out on a plate isn't food.

643
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,520
It's your face.

644
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,680
He'll cause a lot of trouble.

645
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,080
Wow, Wang-ju is here. Wang-ju.

646
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,480
She's not the type to show up.
Have a seat.

647
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,480
Okay, Wang-ju. Let me introduce you.

648
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:26,080
She's the famous Wang Joo.
You know him right?

649
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,120
Chef Kang Sun-woo.

650
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

651
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,840
And that's Chef Choi.

652
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,720
Of course, you did.
I knew you'd be burning incense again.

653
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,640
I'm sor.. sorry.

654
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:11,200
That's not the point.
How many times do I have to tell you?

655
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:15,240
It's not like you have a window.
It can easily start a fire.

656
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,120
And there's no proper ventilation.
People can suffocate.

657
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,600
-I'm sorry, I'll be careful.
-That's okay.

658
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,200
I can't give in anymore.

659
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,600
-Find some other place to live.
-Mister...

660
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,400
The incense is one thing.

661
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:34,680
There are all these strange items on
the wall. It's giving me the creeps.

662
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,560
Move out as soon as possible, okay?

663
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,240
Mister...

664
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,320
BONG-SUN'S SCRAP BOOK

665
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:09,280
TOMATO BACON SALAD

666
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:24,480
(You don't even know that the way you
behave makes others around you look bad.)

667
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,280
(You should think long and hard. About
whether you belong in a kitchen or not.)

668
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,880
(Don't be foolish and stubborn, get hurt,
or be a nuisance to others.)

669
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,600
CHEF KANG SUN-WOO

670
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,120
SEEING THE EXPRESSIONS OF THE PEOPLE
EATING MY FOOD...

671
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,880
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Watch where you're going.

672
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,280
To be honest, my birthday is next week.

673
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,480
And I'm planning a party. Any chance
you can be in charge of the food?

674
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:02,000
All my friends are fans of yours.

675
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,440
Oh, what should I do? I'm quite pricey.

676
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,160
It was a joke. I can't even
make a joke? Gosh you guys.

677
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:14,840
No matter how expensive you are, you
won't be asking for a building, right?

678
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,400
-I'll pay whatever you ask for.
-Sun-woo, you can ask for a lot.

679
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,040
She's a daughter of
Youngchang Group's owner.

680
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,360
Oh, is that so?

681
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,800
I was going to do it because
you're pretty.

682
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,200
But, I think I'll have an appointment
on that day. Sorry.

683
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,240
I forgot I had another meeting.
I'll take off now.

684
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,960
Why? Why? Stay a bit longer.

685
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,480
Why? You should have some coffee
and hang out a bit.

686
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,120
I'm meeting someone for coffee.

687
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,440
Yeah? A woman?

688
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,240
Isn't it more weird for me to meet up
with a man at this hour?

689
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,200
-Here. Take it.
-Well.

690
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,640
I didn't even bring a flowerpot. Take it.

691
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,240
I'll do my best.

692
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,200
Jung-ho

693
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:06,480
Don't get too close to that daughter
of Youngchang or whatever.

694
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,640
Work hard. Didn't you say you got a loan
to open this? I'm going now.

695
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,280
I love you.

696
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,920
Good looking young man. Beautiful
golden proportion. Here.

697
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,600
Thank you.

698
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:37,280
Your coffee is truly the best. Seriously.

699
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,640
It's totally sobering me up.

700
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,120
You were drinking so you came late, huh?

701
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,520
-Or you came too early?
-Whichever it is.

702
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,440
I'll have my coffee and take a look at
the products.

703
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,200
-I'll be going now.
-Bye, good looking young man.

704
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:55,920
Yes... Okay.

705
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,960
Handsome young man, take a look at this.
I'll sell it cheap.

706
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,200
No, I don't think so.

707
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,280
-Is this fresh?
-Yes, it is.

708
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:20,920
This looks very fresh too.

709
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,560
I'll look around and come back.

710
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:27,480
Okay... okay!

711
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,600
You're not going to buy it anyway.

712
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,800
This isn't fresh. How can I buy it?

713
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:39,880
Don't sell things like this.

714
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,360
It's bad for your image.

715
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,280
You're like a ghost. How'd you know?

716
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,720
The shrimp. This really came in today.

717
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,760
This looks good.

718
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,840
It's good. You don't need to even look.

719
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,360
-Just go.
-The shell looks good too.

720
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,440
I'll take 3kg.

721
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:57,520
But make it seem like 5kg.

722
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,760
What... who's there?

723
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,120
Na Bong-sun?

724
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,560
What are you doing here, at this hour?

725
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,880
Are you arriving for work or leaving work?

726
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,720
I'm arriving... No leaving.

727
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,120
What are you saying?

728
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,440
-I'll do it.
-Bring it in the back.

729
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,480
KANG SUN-WOO

730
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,320
What the heck? I went down in ranking.

731
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,840
Why is Marco number two?

732
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:52,480
He blogged pictures of himself with
celebrities.

733
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,960
Look at this guy.

734
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,160
He can't make it with his skills alone,
so he's always doing this.

735
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,040
Go ahead and do that.

736
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,680
You are my sunshine.

737
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,680
Joys of daily life.

738
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,960
Dreaming of a warm table...

739
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,280
How nice is that?

740
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,280
Cabbage, that's a good ingredient.

741
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,560
This person has a lot of sincerity in
her cooking.

742
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,480
I can feel the true sincerity through
the blog.

743
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,960
To: Sunshine, your recipes...

744
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:47,320
Always contain a happiness that one
can feel through taste.

745
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,280
I'm a fan. Fighting!

746
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,600
Fighting!

747
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,600
I wonder if this person is a chef.

748
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,400
(Chef, I want to thank you
for everything.)

749
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,120
(You were right about what you said.)

750
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,640
(Wanting to do something and
being able to do it are different.)

751
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,640
(I was too ambitious.)

752
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:21,720
(Sorry to everyone at the restaurant.
Goodbye to you all.)

753
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:27,800
(This is something I couldn't write in
the letter.)

754
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,080
(I learned one more thing thanks to you,
Chef.)

755
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,880
(A person's feelings are like a cold.)

756
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,560
(Once it starts, no matter how much you
try to resist being ill...)

757
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,760
(It will only end once you go through
the necessary pain.)

758
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:43,600
I don't know if your dream is to be a chef
or not, but let's work hard nonetheless.

759
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:46,760
Yes, Chef.

760
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:56,120
Who told you to put garbage on my plate!

761
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,160
You don't want to eat off a plate with
garbage on it either, do you?

762
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:02,480
Do it again.

763
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,080
(I wanted to become a chef like you.)

764
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,520
Like this... Hey, like this.

765
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,760
Hold it here.

766
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,000
Hold it straight like this
and then do it again.

767
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,480
(I was excited because of you.)

768
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,840
(I was happy because of you.)

769
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:33,120
(I was in pain because of you...
Again and again.)

770
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,720
(I've gone through the necessary pains,
so now I'm going to leave.)

771
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:41,640
(For an abnormal person like me,
Sun Restaurant was like a home to me.)

772
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,040
(And the world may push me away again.)

773
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,000
(But, I will leave anyhow.)

774
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,480
(Goodbye, Chef.)

775
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,280
Hello?

776
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,160
(Hi, Chef. It's me.
It seems that Bong-sun has left.)

777
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:39,920
Who?

778
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,320
She didn't even say goodbye.
It's a bit much.

779
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,160
She probably didn't have the nerve to,
with her personality being that way.

780
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,040
This month, give her three months' pay.

781
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,400
Okay.

782
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:56,360
Chef! Chef... Chef.

783
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,880
The key for the back storage room is gone.

784
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:02,600
I think Bong-sun might have taken it.

785
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:05,160
-What do you mean? Na Bong-sun?
-Yes.

786
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,560
-I'll do it.
-Bring it in the back.

787
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,520
Did you look everywhere?
Are you sure she took it?

788
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,480
We checked all the drawers.

789
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,880
What should we do? It's a special key.

790
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,520
It takes time to cut.

791
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,080
-It's already ten, Chef.
-Call her. She's probably not far.

792
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,200
-I'm calling, but she's not picking up.
-Gosh, seriously!

793
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,240
Right till the end, she's...
Keep calling until she picks up.

794
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,200
Yes, Chef.

795
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,440
Jun, you look into cutting a new key.
Dong-chul and Min-soo, prep the dough.

796
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:41,400
Yes, Chef!

797
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,760
(A room with a window is 300,000 won
per month and 50,000 won maintenance.)

798
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,240
(There aren't many vacancies.)

799
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,320
Rooms with windows are expensive.

800
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,200
JI-WOONG

801
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,320
I'm sorry.

802
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,960
Oh, my head hurts.

803
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,880
What's wrong? Why is my head hurting?

804
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:23,000
I'm so bored!

805
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,800
I'm so bored. I'm going crazy.

806
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,840
-Hello.
-Be quiet!

807
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,680
My poop went back in because of you.

808
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:35,560
That's because I'm so bored!
You don't even have any customers.

809
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,680
That's all your fault.

810
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,560
You're the one getting in the way
of the living.

811
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,040
That's why you should just let me go.

812
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,160
No good comes of us being together.

813
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,520
If you let me go, I'll live quietly as
if I were dead.

814
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:51,840
You're already dead. How could you
live as if you're dead?

815
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,320
-Would you trust you, if you were me?
-No.

816
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:57,960
Is that a customer?
You must have a customer!

817
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,480
-It's the bossam.
-Bossam. I like bossam!

818
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,200
I like buckwheat noodles too.

819
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,720
-Hello.
-Bossam, bossam.

820
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,400
-It's 35,000 won.
-35,000 won? Here you go.

821
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,280
Oh, you should've told me before
if you had a coupon!

822
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,280
Why do I have to tell you beforehand?

823
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,040
If I tell you before, do you guys take
out a few pieces of meat?

824
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:21,040
That's not it. I'm going to get in
trouble for this.

825
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,880
What trouble? I'll talk to the owner.

826
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:28,480
-Gosh, really?
-Hey, don't even think of running...

827
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,640
This girl, where did she...

828
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:37,120
Why do I have to deal with this?
Move, move!

829
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,560
-I can't believe...
-Ma'am, Ma'am! Ma'am!

830
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,320
Stop right there!

831
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:58,360
Stop!

832
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,480
Let's finish this thing today!

833
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,200
I'm going to kill you.

834
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,720
Stop right there!

835
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,760
Where is this girl hiding?

836
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:01,800
Where is she?

837
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:06,280
Gosh!

838
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:09,280
Na Bong-sun, is this where you were?

839
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,720
There's no time. Let's go.
Let's go and talk.

840
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,320
Hurry up and get on.

841
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:16,600
You got it? I'm going.

842
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:36,760
Bong, you head in first. Hurry.

843
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,440
Where is this place?

844
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,520
-What are you saying? Come on, get off.
-Goodness.

845
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:42,800
Chef, I found Bong-sun!

846
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,120
Wait, excuse me...

847
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,880
Chef, I found Bong-sun!

848
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,880
Wait, hold on a moment.

849
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,760
Hey, Na Bong-sun!

850
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:59,440
What... what is this?

851
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:12,200
Ah... good to see you too.

852
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,040
Hand it over. Stop playing around.

853
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,520
-What?
-Hand over the key!

854
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,120
What key?

855
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,360
(What's up with this rude jerk?)

856
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,680
Why, you...

857
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,040
(Seriously, this guy!)

858
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,520
OH MY GHOST

859
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,240
(This is very odd.)

860
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,320
(I don't feel out of place
in the kitchen.)

861
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,320
(Oh my, wow...)

862
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,520
(This might not be as bad as I thought.)

863
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,200
What are you doing? It's busy.
Aren't you going in to help?

864
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:16,120
Na Bong-sun!

865
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,160
If you want me to do something,
then say it!

866
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,800
Did you hurt your head or something?

867
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,280
That's nonsense.
What do you mean, assault?

868
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:25,640
Do you think he hit someone?
That chef person or whatever.

869
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:28,920
Is he someone I seduced when I possessed
someone? He seems familiar.

870
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,840
Does she work for you too?
She can go on with you.
