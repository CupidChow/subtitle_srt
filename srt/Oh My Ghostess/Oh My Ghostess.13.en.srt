1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,560
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,000
OH MY GHOST

3
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,520
Hey Na Bong. Hey!

4
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
What are you doing, Na Bong-sun?

5
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,120
How can you disappear like that after
saying that nonsense?

6
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,560
Are you,

7
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,160
by chance, playing a
'hidden camera' prank on me?

8
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,280
If that's what this is,
then it's really not fun for me.

9
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,840
Do you have a death wish or something?

10
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,760
What exactly are you doing, right now?

11
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,600
So you're saying you see ghosts.
Is that it?

12
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,440
Yes.

13
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,840
Every time I thought you were manic

14
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,440
you were possessed by a ghost?

15
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,760
Yes.

16
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,480
So, what you're saying is...

17
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,640
That ghost ...

18
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,760
That was inside you...

19
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,120
Or as people say, the ghost that
possessed you...

20
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,360
She is the one that I've been
spending time with.

21
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,920
Giving lessons to...

22
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,880
Having skinship with...

23
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,200
This is what you're saying, isn't it?

24
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
And you don't remember any of it, right?

25
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,519
Right.

26
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,480
Sounds plausible.

27
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,720
Why don't you just write a movie script?
You expect me to believe that?

28
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,800
Why don't you just say, 'I'm a ghost too.'

29
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,760
That'd be quite the twist.
It would be like 'The Sixth Sense.'

30
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:43,880
Why are you doing this to me? Why?

31
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,840
Why in the world are you doing this?
Have your feelings changed?

32
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
Are you trying to break up with me?

33
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,200
If that's what it is, then just say so.

34
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
Don't go on and on about this ghost
nonsense and drive me crazy.

35
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,360
It's not like that, Chef.

36
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,640
If that's not it, then what is it?

37
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Everything I said is true. Really.

38
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,200
You know the ghost that possessed me?

39
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,360
She is the daughter of that little
restaurant owner.

40
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,120
I'm seriously going to go crazy.

41
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,200
OH MY GHOST EPISODE 13

42
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,760
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

43
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,160
(It was Shin Soon-ae for sure.)

44
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Is something wrong?

45
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,640
If I can help, I will.

46
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
It's...

47
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,000
So...

48
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,760
Actually...

49
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,320
Never mind, it's nothing.

50
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,640
Your shoelaces are tied in a strange way.

51
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,920
Oh, this? You know Bong-sun from
the restaurant?

52
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,320
She tied them for me.

53
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,680
(She's been in Na Bong-sun's body,
all this time.)

54
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,880
Hello.

55
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,480
Oh, what's this? Officer Kang!

56
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,640
-You're back to work starting today?
-Yes.

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
-Are you feeling better?
-Yes, I'm a lot better now.

58
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,280
You must've all had a hard time,
taking on my share of the work.

59
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
What do you mean?

60
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,520
Sure, we couldn't take days off.

61
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,800
We worked late every day
and his nose bled.

62
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,280
We were so tired to death every day.

63
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I'm so sorry.

64
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
I'll buy you both a meal sometime.

65
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,200
What kind of money would an
officer have? Huh?

66
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,960
Buy us meat, okay? Beef.

67
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,800
I'm just kidding.

68
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,560
She got prettier since she's
been sick, right?

69
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,840
Oh, you're right.

70
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,160
Relax, would you?
Don't overstrain yourself.

71
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,240
You got pretty.

72
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,760
That's right. Rest and don't do anything.
Don't even breathe.

73
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,680
No wait, you should breathe... Breathe.

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,760
Man, it's really boiling out... It's hot.

75
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
It's a hot summer, a hot summer.

76
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,640
When it's this hot out,
Chef-Bong couple probably can't do...

77
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,840
Stuff like this, right?

78
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,200
Are you going to talk or sweep?

79
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,480
Where are Chef and Bong anyway?

80
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,280
Does she think she can be late
now that she's dating Chef?

81
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,320
Hey, hey! What if Bong says to us...

82
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,360
'You lowly servants! You frivolous
peasants!' What do we do then?

83
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,400
-I'm sorry I'm late. I'm sorry.
-You're here.

84
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,360
What are you doing coming in now?

85
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,320
You're only 30 minutes late.

86
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,000
What?

87
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,960
A person ought to be late more often.
It makes them seem more human.

88
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,800
I just can't breathe when I'm next to
people who are always on time.

89
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
Bong, you shouldn't be like that.

90
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,400
Okay... Okay.

91
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,520
Why do you all have that look
on your face?

92
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,800
-It's nothing.
-You're the best.

93
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,880
What's with all the idle talk
in the morning?

94
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,200
We have many reservations so hurry.

95
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef!

96
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,760
-Jun.
-Yes?

97
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,640
Today's special is chicken pasta
using chicken breast.

98
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,040
-Marinate with pepper.
-Okay.

99
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,720
-Dong-chul.
-Yes?

100
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,920
You should cut them a bit thicker.

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yes, Chef.

102
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,200
-Woong.
-Yes?

103
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,880
We'll serve salmon raw today
so put them in the fridge.

104
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:56,840
Yes, Chef.

105
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
-And clean the scallops.
-Yes, Chef.

106
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
Yes, yes.

107
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,600
This is Heo Min-soo reporting from
the kitchen.

108
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,840
Sun Restaurant has its first
official couple.

109
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,920
It really is romantic and so sweet.
I can taste the sweetness in my mouth.

110
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,400
Yes, Bong.

111
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,720
What term do you use to call Chef?

112
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,200
'Honey,' 'baby,'

113
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,480
'husband'?

114
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,720
Bong Bo Roo Bong?

115
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,800
Yes, Bong is too embarrassed to answer.

116
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,280
Then I will take the mic to Chef.

117
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,600
When did you first start to see
Assistant Cook Na Bong-sun as a woman?

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,120
Number one, Bong who always dozed off
was sexy.

119
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,080
Wow.

120
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,920
Number two, Bong who said
'I'm sorry, I'm sorry'

121
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,880
and was all shriveled up and fearful.

122
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,200
And you wanted to protect her.

123
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,640
-Number three...
-Is this your playground?

124
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,480
Do I pay you to play?

125
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
-No.
-Go check on...

126
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,280
Go check on the dough for the noodles.

127
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
And go do your job.

128
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,840
Like I said, we have many reservations
today.

129
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,880
Yes, Chef.

130
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,880
Something is going on between them.

131
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,560
Something is off with Chef and Bong,
right?

132
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,200
There's tension there, isn't there?

133
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,840
It seems like they got into a big fight.

134
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,360
They were acting so cold to each other.

135
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,920
Yeah, they must have had a fight.
They weren't even making any eye contact.

136
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,240
I thought the kitchen became Siberia.

137
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,640
Why are you all so curious?
It's their personal life.

138
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,840
If you're not curious... Then get lost!

139
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,280
Gosh, seriously...

140
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,320
Maybe that's not it.

141
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,640
Maybe they went at it last night and now
they're just embarrassed in front of us.

142
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,400
What do you think? Right?

143
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,000
Their acting is awesome. We're at Cannes.

144
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,400
Are you saying they fooled us?

145
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,120
I don't think that's it.
I'm telling you they totally fought.

146
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,800
No, what I'm saying is right.

147
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,440
Our Bong... She is a very politically
savvy girl.

148
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,640
Her shriveled self suddenly turning into
a sassy girl is how she got Chef.

149
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,800
So that's why we have to keep
things friendly with Bong.

150
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
-Friendly Bong.
-Yes. Got it?

151
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,960
What the heck are you looking at?
I thought you weren't curious!

152
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,320
Officer Choi...

153
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,720
Why would Officer Choi do that?

154
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,640
To Na Bong-sun. Why?

155
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,680
Think carefully.

156
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,840
Does anything stand out?

157
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,880
When you possessed Na Bong-sun,
did anything happen with him?

158
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
When I possessed her?

159
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,320
Now that you mention it...
I went to see Officer Choi.

160
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,880
I asked him if he's sure about Shin
Soon-ae's suicide and to look into it.

161
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,640
And after that,
he tried to kill Na Bong-sun?

162
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,560
-Yes.
-If that's the case...

163
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,600
It means it has something to do with
your death.

164
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,800
You know there was something off
about Officer Choi from the start.

165
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,200
His fortune was different from
his current life.

166
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:14,560
His old picture and current picture were
weirdly different physiognomically.

167
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,520
And the gloomy look in his glare
when I met him.

168
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,640
Although it's not for sure, but maybe...

169
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,640
Maybe...

170
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,960
Officer Choi...

171
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,320
May be possessed by an evil spirit.

172
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,160
Evil spirit?

173
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,400
Once an evil spirit latches onto a person,
it doesn't leave and is like a parasite.

174
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,520
Between the evil spirit and
the person it possesses...

175
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,280
Over time, they can't be differentiated.

176
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,440
I'm getting a sense.

177
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,400
For now, warn Bong-sun or
whatever her name is to be careful.

178
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,280
Keep your eye on Officer Choi.

179
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,040
If he is an evil spirit,
he may be able to see you.

180
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,320
You must be very careful.

181
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Okay.

182
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,720
Hey, it's right.

183
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,120
-It's really not.
-How much do you want to bet?

184
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Hey...

185
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,360
-Bong. Miss Bong?
-Yes?

186
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,200
You... Tell us. Be honest.

187
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,160
You didn't have a fight with Chef, right?

188
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,520
It's because you two made
too much progress last night.

189
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,400
And you're embarrassed, right?

190
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,240
No... No. That's not it.

191
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,280
-It's not?
-No...

192
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,960
Then, did you guys really fight?

193
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,600
Yes...

194
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,880
By chance... Is Chef a pervert?

195
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,560
So last night he went 'eeeh' and
you went 'eee'?

196
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,520
He went 'eeeh' and you went 'eee'?

197
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,960
-Huh?
-Was it really like that?

198
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,000
You should talk about these things
with your seniors like us.

199
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,160
We won't tell Chef. Tell us what happened.

200
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,720
Go ahead. Tell us.

201
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,120
Na Bong-sun! Come out for a bit.

202
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,600
Come.

203
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,880
Chef, Bong is supposed to be in charge of
the dinner special salad.

204
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,400
Cancel dinner today.
You guys can clean up.

205
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,080
Chef, wait...

206
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Our Chef just let go of his restaurant,
right?

207
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,240
I think so...

208
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,000
Wow, what is going on seriously?
This is huge.

209
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,920
It doesn't look like a trivial matter.
Based on Chef's mood.

210
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,880
I thought about it.

211
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,640
And I think you're seriously ill.

212
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,080
You seem to experience hallucinations.
You need to see a doctor.

213
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,080
If it's serious, get treatment.
If needed, get hospitalized.

214
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,360
I'll get you better, Na Bong-sun.

215
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,520
-I'm not... Manic depressive.
-How do you know? Are you a doctor?

216
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,320
Have you seen an insane person admitting
that they are insane?

217
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,320
-For now, let's go in. Get diagnosed.
-I...

218
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm really, really, really not, Chef.

219
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,480
I know it's difficult to believe,

220
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,600
but you have to.

221
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I lived like that for 28 years.
My grandma is a shaman.

222
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,640
I'm of that bloodline and
I can see ghosts with my eyes.

223
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,920
This is my reality.

224
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,840
You know, I...

225
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,360
I thought about dying many times,
but I endured and held on.

226
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,680
Chef, I'm really sorry.

227
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,680
Na Bong-sun.

228
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,280
Why? What's up now?

229
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,760
Na Bong-sun, listen to me carefully.

230
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,880
The time you almost
got into an accident...

231
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,600
Hey, Na Bong-sun!

232
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,800
Fine, let's say what
you're saying is true.

233
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,920
You are a unique person.
And you can see ghosts.

234
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,320
Okay, that's possible. Why?

235
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
Because there are many unexplainable
things in the world.

236
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,440
But, even so...

237
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,720
I refuse to believe that who I've seen
up to now isn't the real you.

238
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,920
That ghost or whatever...

239
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,280
I won't believe it until I see it with my
own two eyes. I can't believe it!

240
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,560
I told him everything.

241
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,200
Why?

242
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,560
What?

243
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Why?

244
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,320
I didn't like it.

245
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,200
I don't like Chef getting confused
between you and me anymore.

246
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,079
What are you saying?

247
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,200
She's here.

248
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,440
The ghost I told you about before.

249
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,160
She's here right now.

250
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,520
What?

251
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,000
You're really not going to stop, are you?

252
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,480
Chef...

253
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Don't talk to me.
My head is about to explode now.

254
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,840
You didn't know about it, right?

255
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,760
You didn't know since the ghost
possessed you on her own.

256
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,200
At first, I didn't know.

257
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,440
When I woke up, I had been possessed.

258
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,520
But after that,

259
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,240
I gave her permission.

260
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,280
Permission to possess me.

261
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,200
Why?

262
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,920
Why would you do that? Why?

263
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,600
I... Really... You...

264
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,960
I want to understand you like crazy.

265
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,000
But, I just can't right now.

266
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,680
There's something very strange
about this place.

267
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,640
Strange?

268
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,040
There's a mysterious mix of chill
and vitality in this place.

269
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,520
No, you can't!

270
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Stop touching me, please!

271
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,280
Ah, ghost! Please! I can't hear you!

272
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,640
That's too left.

273
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,200
Right! Left!

274
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,680
-I think I'm going... Wait.
-Left. Right.

275
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,960
I thought you couldn't ride.

276
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,560
What? What do you mean?
I'm really good at riding bikes.

277
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,840
-Slowly, okay.
-I'm going!

278
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,360
-Let's go!
-Okay, okay. Slowly.

279
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,840
-Slow down.
-We're going!

280
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,760
Oh, hey, what's with all that drinking
with no food?

281
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,360
You'll get drunk at this rate, Chef.

282
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,720
When you get drunk and become sexy,
then I'd want to do it with you again.

283
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
Chef... You should eat something too.

284
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,880
Otherwise, you'll harm your stomach.

285
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm going crazy.

286
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Brother-in-law!

287
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,680
Oh, brother-in-law.

288
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,400
I was walking by and saw...

289
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,360
Are you drinking alone?

290
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,760
You should stop. I think you had enough.

291
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I did? I drank a lot?

292
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,160
Why am I not getting drunk?

293
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,840
I really want to get drunk today.

294
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,880
I can't even get drunk.

295
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,040
Are things bad? With Bong-sun?

296
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,480
Bong-sun?

297
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,400
-Na Bong-sun?
-Yes, Bong-sun.

298
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,680
Do you...

299
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,040
Do you believe in ghosts?

300
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,560
What?

301
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,760
Do you believe that ghosts exist
in the world?

302
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,880
No, I never really thought about it.

303
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,840
Right.

304
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,880
It's not something most people would
think about.

305
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,480
What kind of absurdity is this?

306
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,840
Na Bong-sun is Na Bong-sun.

307
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,040
But, she's not Na Bong-sun.

308
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,800
So, Na Bong-sun is Shin Soon-ae.

309
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,520
KANG SUN-WOO

310
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,120
I was so stupid, Chef.

311
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,680
I thought if I could make you mine
like this...

312
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,800
I thought it would be okay.

313
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,680
Na Bong-sun...

314
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,560
Na Bong-sun!

315
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,800
Chef.

316
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,600
Why did you tell me?

317
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,560
Why did you...

318
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,920
If you were going to fool me,
why didn't you fool me till the end?

319
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,640
Why did you tell the truth now?

320
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,000
It would've been better for me not
to know.

321
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,680
You know?

322
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,120
I would've been better off thinking
you were manic depressive.

323
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
I couldn't...

324
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,960
Lie to you anymore, Chef.

325
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Why!

326
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,040
Why couldn't you lie?
You did it just fine all this time.

327
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
Was it fun?

328
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,360
Here I was, unable to differentiate
whether it was you or a ghost.

329
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,520
Did you have fun watching me by chance?

330
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,480
No, Chef! It wasn't like that at all.

331
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,120
Gosh...

332
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,480
I'm going crazy, Na Bong-sun.

333
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,960
What do you mean, ghost?

334
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,080
Isn't this like those summer horror
specials on TV?

335
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,440
Who was it that I liked?

336
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,840
Did I like you or the ghost... Huh?

337
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,960
Why did you do this? Why?

338
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,920
Because I liked you.

339
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
Because I liked you so much.

340
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,880
I liked you so much from the moment
I first saw you.

341
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,840
I wanted to keep you by my side,
even if I had to resort to that.

342
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,440
I think I need some time. Go in and rest.

343
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,600
Sun-woo! What are you doing here
at this hour?

344
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,840
-I just came here to sleep.
-Hey, hey. hey.

345
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,240
What's going on?

346
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,320
Is something wrong with Bong-sook?

347
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,440
-Did you break up?
-It's not like that.

348
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,280
Mom, I'm going to rest.

349
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,080
Gosh, what's going on?

350
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,120
That kid is so charismatic.

351
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,560
He is my son,
but he looks good when he's like that.

352
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,840
No, no, no.

353
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,400
This isn't the time to think of that.

354
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,280
You can do it, Shin Soon-ae.

355
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,800
First, look into Officer Choi.

356
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,960
And tell Na Bong-sun about it.

357
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,080
You can do it!

358
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,880
CHEF KANG SUN-WOO

359
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,480
Where did she go?
I have to tell her about Officer Choi.

360
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,680
Her bags are gone too.

361
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,040
Did she, by chance...

362
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,320
Did Na Bong-sun leave?

363
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,880
No way.

364
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,120
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

365
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,400
-Jun.
-Yeah?

366
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,880
Where's the fried crab meat?

367
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,960
Bong said she'll put it in the fridge.

368
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:35,840
Is it not there?

369
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,440
Hey, hey. Call Bong, would you?

370
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,680
This is going too far.
Being late two days in a row.

371
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,920
Her phone is turned off.

372
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,440
Do you think she's not coming after
getting in a fight with Chef?

373
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,120
I doubt it.
Bong is not that irresponsible.

374
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,600
-Oh, Chef!
-Chef!

375
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,200
Why are you coming in from the front door?

376
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,080
I came from home. I'll get changed.

377
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,920
Chef, I'm not sure if you know this,

378
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,960
but Bong-sun isn't at work yet.

379
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,080
Na Bong-sun?

380
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,120
I was worried so I called,
but her phone is turned off.

381
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,960
She isn't someone who'd act this way.

382
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,160
Okay, I got it. Get to work.

383
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
Today's special is abalone pasta, right?

384
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,520
Get that out and prepare the abalone well.

385
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

386
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,440
What do you mean by that?
You think Bong-sun is gone?

387
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,080
It's starting to look that way.

388
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,600
We thought she was late or missing a day.

389
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,720
But, we checked her locker and
it was completely cleaned out.

390
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,320
Actually, things weren't good between her
and Chef yesterday.

391
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,720
I think that might be why.

392
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,920
That's crazy. Even still...

393
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,480
This is why dating in the workplace
is bad.

394
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,760
If a problem arises between the two,
one of the two has to leave.

395
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,520
Why? Because it's super uncomfortable!

396
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,600
Still, I don't think this is right.

397
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,080
There is never any boredom here.

398
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,840
It's one shocking thing after another.

399
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,480
So, Na Bong-sun is gone.

400
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,560
Then, that means she's not back in
that body.

401
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,040
Shin Soon-ae, where are you, ghost?

402
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,960
RESTAURANT

403
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,400
Oh, she opened her eyes. Dad, she's alive.

404
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,520
Are you okay now, Bong-sun?
Are you awake now?

405
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,800
How did I end up here?

406
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,440
I found you passed out when I went
for my morning exercise.

407
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,720
I considered calling the ambulance.

408
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,880
But, you didn't seem
completely unconscious.

409
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,560
Do you know how much of a scare I got
when my dad called me?

410
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,120
My legs were shaking from carrying
you here.

411
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,040
You're anemic, aren't you?

412
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,239
Look at that pale face.
It's got to be anemia.

413
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,560
I'm sorry. I've been such a burden.

414
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:20,800
Oh my, where do you think you're going
in this state?

415
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
-What?
-Huh?

416
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Seeing that you have this bag,
you must have left your job.

417
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,679
Isn't that true?

418
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,679
Get better and then go. It's okay with us.

419
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,440
Oh no. I'll go stay with my grandma.

420
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,639
Do you think your grandma will be
happy to see you this way?

421
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,960
Well... Even if you go,
you should go when you're better.

422
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,760
You sure don't listen for such a
small thing.

423
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,560
What will you do if you faint again?

424
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,719
That's true. Just do as we say.

425
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,719
You've done so much for us too.

426
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,000
This is my daughter's old room.

427
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,280
It's an empty room,
so you can use it for a bit.

428
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,240
Okay.

429
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,960
Kyung-mo, let's leave so she can rest.

430
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,840
Why? I want to stay for a little longer.

431
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,240
Let's go! Come on.

432
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,040
-Rest comfortably.
-Thank you.

433
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,200
Come on.

434
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,040
What's got you so busy this morning, Dad?

435
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,080
Have you been well?

436
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,480
I'm a bit disturbed, Dad.

437
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
I'm disturbed because of Officer Choi.

438
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,720
And I'm disturbed because of Na Bong-sun.

439
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,640
This wasn't what I wanted to happen.

440
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,920
What's with the porridge anyway?

441
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,720
Is Kyung-mo sick?

442
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,800
He must've gotten drunk and sick again.

443
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,440
Gosh, that kid.

444
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,600
You have to cut off
his allowance to fix his habits... Huh?

445
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,920
What is it? Is Kyung-mo in my room?

446
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,280
Yes.

447
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,720
Oh!

448
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,240
Why are you so surprised?

449
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,120
-It's as if you've seen a ghost.
-What?

450
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,280
-No, that's not it.
-What are you doing here?

451
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,800
I brought you some egg porridge.

452
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,400
Even if you don't have an appetite,
you should eat to get your strength.

453
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,440
-Eat this.
-Thank you.

454
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,520
Thank you for the food, Mister.

455
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,960
-Okay.
-Thank you.

456
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,320
My dad has a lot of compassion.

457
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,680
What happened?

458
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,640
I went to the rooftop storage room and
I was worried when you weren't there.

459
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,920
It just worked out that way.

460
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,440
I had passed out and your father
spotted me.

461
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,760
What a relief.

462
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:43,160
Is it because of me, by chance?

463
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,400
That you left Sun Restaurant?

464
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,400
Yes.

465
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,640
I'm sorry.
I didn't think it would go this far.

466
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,640
Honestly, I did resent you for a
little bit.

467
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,160
If you think about it, it's half my fault.

468
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,480
At least, I have memories with Chef.

469
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,040
That's something.

470
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,320
He's someone I couldn't even look
at before.

471
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,160
You're making me feel even sorrier...
By being so nice about it.

472
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,120
But, this isn't the time for us to feel
sorry and whatnot.

473
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,560
There's an urgent situation.

474
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:30,400
-What is it?
-You know that car that nearly hit you?

475
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,120
That was Officer Choi's doing.

476
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,080
Officer... Officer Choi?

477
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,520
Why would Officer Choi do that?

478
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,320
I don't know either. I have to find out.

479
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,400
You shouldn't be seen by him.
You should stay inside if you can.

480
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,520
I'll find out what I can and come back.

481
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,000
Okay.

482
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,960
-Na Bong-sun.
-Huh?

483
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm thinking that my grudge isn't
a virgin grudge, after all.

484
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,400
Why would Officer Choi do such a thing?

485
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,200
Okay, these are the last orders.
Everyone, let's do it.

486
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,360
Yes, Chef!

487
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,680
Salmon salad and two Shrek pastas
at table four.

488
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,840
One steak and one Shrek pasta
at table six.

489
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,320
One vegetable bibimyun and
two bean pastas at table seven.

490
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,680
I'll do the vegetable and bean.
Min-soo, you do the Shrek pasta.

491
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,720
-Jun.
-Yes.

492
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,920
-You do the steak.
-Yes, Chef.

493
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,320
-Dong-chul, do the salad.
-Yes, Chef.

494
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,280
-Ji-woong, help Min-soo.
-Yes, Chef.

495
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,280
-We're on it, Chef.
-We're on it, Chef.

496
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,960
-Hey, Cordon.
-Yes?

497
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,880
Forget the steak and work on the
intestines.

498
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,800
-Okay.
-Where did the lentils go?

499
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,560
Jun, did you use all the lentils?

500
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,880
Yes. Should I go get more?

501
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,720
-Keep working. I'll get it.
-Okay.

502
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,200
-Ji-woong.
-Yes, Chef.

503
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,720
Give table seven some more bread.

504
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,640
They finished it and
have been licking their fingers.

505
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,120
Bong left like that,
but Chef must not care at all.

506
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:07,040
He's more upbeat and full of charisma
than usual.

507
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,960
I'm grown fond of our Bong Bong.

508
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,400
So, I'm feeling betrayed, you know.

509
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,120
I'm feeling really let down by you, Chef.

510
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,640
The way I see things,
Chef is not okay at all.

511
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,320
That's the feeling I get.

512
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,040
What are you saying?

513
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,040
I've known Chef a long time.

514
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,200
The bigger the ordeal,
the more he pretends he's okay.

515
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
He has a habit of doing that.

516
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,440
He had that look in his eye... A sad look.

517
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,800
-Give that to me!
-Oh, what?

518
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,160
Are you going to get sick again and
take time off from holding this?

519
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,560
Gosh, now I feel like I'm back at work.

520
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,000
With you picking on me, Officer Han.

521
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,720
-I'll do it...
-Oh my!

522
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,200
Look at you.

523
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,480
You're so weak. How can you be an officer?

524
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,080
You're so worrisome.
How can we send you out anywhere?

525
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,920
She's been weak her whole life and
always wanted to be an officer.

526
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,640
She's become much healthier.

527
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,560
She always looked so pale because
of her anemia.

528
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,320
She's can't really walk well though.

529
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,640
(Keep your eye on Officer Choi.)

530
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,320
(If he is an evil spirit,
he may be able to see you.)

531
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,600
(You must be careful.)

532
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,440
Oh my... Here.

533
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,520
Thank you.

534
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh, my legs... My legs.

535
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,160
She's weak, she's weak.

536
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,760
That makes me want to possess you.

537
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,400
YONGSAN POLICE STATION

538
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,320
Officer Choi.

539
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,040
-Yes?
-Do you have the digital camera?

540
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,120
-Oh, yes.
-Give me that, would you?

541
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,400
Wait.

542
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,800
-Here.
(-Oh, my diary.)

543
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,840
Your diary is in that cop's drawer?

544
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,520
Yes. And that drawer is locked with a key.

545
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,200
Now that I think about it,
it was odd then.

546
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,880
I said I'd take my diary.
But he insisted on keeping it.

547
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,560
That means there's something in there
that's incriminating.

548
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,280
Yeah, I wonder what it is.

549
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,480
Goodness, it's your diary!

550
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,560
-That's true.
-Just think about it.

551
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,840
You don't remember anything?

552
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,760
I don't know.

553
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,760
Suffering underwater...

554
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,560
And some strange music.

555
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,760
I just keep seeing images of that in
my head.

556
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,920
Okay, don't try too hard.

557
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,480
Just get that diary for now.
I think that's urgent.

558
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,480
Okay.

559
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,920
How do I get that thing?

560
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,720
This darn thing.

561
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,280
This isn't more than how much
baby chicks pee. It's so hot too.

562
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,440
You're hot? Should I help you cool down?

563
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,560
Huh?

564
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,680
You wench!

565
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,720
Do you like this too?

566
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,600
TODAY'S SPECIAL

567
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,040
Chef.

568
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,720
Good work guys. See you tomorrow.

569
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,240
The dog days of summer are over.
How about some ginseng chicken stew?

570
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,480
And if you drink some ginseng alcohol

571
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,600
your stamina, which was down here,
can rise up like this.

572
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:35,200
I think it will help us be
efficient workers, Chef!

573
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,760
-Are the dog days of summer already over?
-Yes.

574
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:41,760
I'm not really hungry.
You guys should eat something.

575
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,400
We always go together, so it's no fun.

576
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,560
Okay, Chef!

577
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:48,800
If you don't like ginseng chicken stew,
how about some beer?

578
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,120
Oh, what should I do?
I really want to drink with Chef today!

579
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,760
What's with you?

580
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,240
Let's go, Chef. I'll join in today too.

581
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,960
-Let's go!
-Go with us.

582
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,600
Kang Sun-woo, Kang Sun-woo!

583
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,200
-Okay, okay.
-Kang Sun-woo!

584
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,280
Cheers!

585
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,520
Let's drink!

586
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,080
What more is there to life?

587
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,640
We work until we sweat, drink beer,
eat this good food,

588
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,400
and be with each other as a family, right?

589
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,920
Yeah, it's great with just us guys.
Girls are just a pain.

590
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,400
Of course!

591
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,280
Yes, this is an old saying they say
in Italy... Italia.

592
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,960
When you're dealing with cows,
watch your front.

593
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,320
-With horses, watch your back.
-That's right.

594
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
When you're dealing with women,
watch out everywhere.

595
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,360
There's a saying like this.

596
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,200
What the heck? Is that some saying in
Jeolla-do?

597
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,560
Gosh, seriously?

598
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,960
The important point is that all women
are wicked people.

599
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,680
I don't need any of them.
I don't need them!

600
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,480
You startled me.

601
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,400
It's been confirmed. It's been confirmed.

602
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,240
Whoever betrays us and dates a girl...

603
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,480
I will take away all of your manhood.

604
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,600
-Goodness.
-Gosh.

605
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,880
Go on in.

606
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:08,800
Chef?

607
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,120
What?

608
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,760
About Bong-sun...
You're not going to give up on her, right?

609
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,680
-What?
-She's a good person, Bong.

610
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
She has a kind nature.

611
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,920
The Bong that I know...

612
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,560
From the first time she came in,
she's always been looking at you.

613
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,240
Whether she was washing dishes or
serving customers.

614
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,680
And even when she was on her break.

615
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,680
Her eyes were always looking for you,
Chef.

616
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,880
I respect you, Chef.

617
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:41,000
But if you let Bong go like this,
I think I'll be disappointed in you.

618
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,520
I know I'm overstepping my boundaries
when I say this.

619
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,520
I just want two people I like to be happy.

620
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:12,080
Officer Kang, what are you doing?
You haven't left work?

621
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,040
You shouldn't work too hard on your
first day.

622
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,800
Yes, I will go soon.

623
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,360
I must've had dinner too early.
I'm hungry again.

624
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,960
This punk... He eats and craps,
eats and craps.

625
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,880
Do some work, would you?

626
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,520
Should we order some pork hock?

627
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,840
It is a bit much, but at this hour...
There aren't many other places to order.

628
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:31,680
Don't bother doing that.

629
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:34,960
I'll stay here. Go out and eat, okay?

630
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,040
No, no. We should all stay together.

631
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,400
No, I have stuff to organize.

632
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,360
Go out and eat.

633
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,440
-Yeah?
-Yes.

634
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,440
-Should we?
-Yes, let's go.

635
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,400
Yes.

636
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,440
Will you be okay, Officer Kang?
You used to be scared alone.

637
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,480
What?

638
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,800
I should get over it now.
I am a police officer, after all.

639
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,000
Go on now. Okay.

640
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,120
-Work hard.
-Okay.

641
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,200
Bye.

642
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,320
-Where should we go?
-To Soon-ae's restaurant.

643
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,240
Not again.

644
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:21,760
What are you doing?

645
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:25,480
Officer Han.

646
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,240
Officer Kang, do you perhaps...

647
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,800
Have reason to be suspicious of
Officer Choi?

648
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,960
Tip?

649
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:38,760
Yes.

650
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,600
They told me that a tip came in regarding
Officer Choi.

651
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,840
Something regarding bribes and so on.

652
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,560
I can't give you specifics.

653
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,120
People at the top told me to look into it.

654
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,480
Is that so?

655
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,360
Officer Choi has several things that
seem off about him, doesn't he?

656
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,520
What do you mean?

657
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,160
Actually, I'm keeping my eye on
Officer Choi too.

658
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,120
-There's something suspicious.
-What do you mean by suspicious?

659
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,240
I'm not sure if you heard.
Recently, I got assaulted and mugged.

660
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,960
I was on my way back from restoring the
CCTV from Officer Choi's wife's accident.

661
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,760
As I passed out that day,
I thought I saw Officer Choi.

662
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,400
-On the scene that day?
-Yes.

663
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,760
In my opinion,

664
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,640
I think he's trying to
cover up for the criminal.

665
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,520
There must be some backdoor deal.

666
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,960
-How could something like that...
-That's what I'm saying.

667
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,840
For now, it's just my gut feeling.

668
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,160
Once I get the results, I'll be sure.

669
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,360
I've secured evidence that will determine
with certainty.

670
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:53,360
I just need to wait for the results.

671
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,920
Then, Officer Choi won't have anywhere
to turn.

672
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,200
Here is your meal.

673
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,280
I'm sorry, Mister.
You can't even close because of us.

674
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:13,640
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'm just selling you what I have.

675
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,960
Please, eat up.
You have to work all night.

676
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,240
-Yes.
-I'll be outside cleaning.

677
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,680
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy.

678
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,880
Officer Han said he'd be right back.
Where is he?

679
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,280
Why do you keep looking around anyway?

680
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,240
-Huh?
-Are you looking for someone?

681
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,280
-No, no. Let's eat.
-Okay.

682
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:41,960
(You shouldn't be seen by him.
You should stay inside if you can.)

683
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,120
STIR-FRIED RICE CAKE

684
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,320
That kid.

685
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,640
I guess she did study on her own.

686
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,120
CABBAGE

687
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,360
I saw this on Sunshine's blog.

688
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,160
BUCKWHEAT

689
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,640
BUCKWHEAT

690
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,520
(It was a hot summer night.)

691
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,720
(The buckwheat pancake I ate with him
was a privilege.)

692
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:36,720
(He said to me that those who cooked were
conductors of an orchestra in kitchen.)

693
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:41,280
(As I think about those wise words,
I will put up a buckwheat pancake recipe.)

694
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,480
(Think about what oil they used and
what they put in this dough.)

695
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:47,120
(What kind of seasoning they put in here.)

696
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,400
Think about this and don't just eat it.

697
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:53,800
Cooking is like being a conductor of
an orchestra in the kitchen, okay?

698
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,320
(If I perfect my understanding of
ingredients...)

699
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:05,040
(I am told that I can cook food to
my liking no matter where I go.)

700
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,280
(Try tasting all kinds of seasoning.)

701
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:13,120
(A cup of ginger tea will help get rid of
the after taste from your mouth.)

702
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,600
(Your recipes always contain a happiness
that one can feel through taste.)

703
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,200
(I'm a fan. Fighting.)

704
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,240
(Thank you very much.)

705
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,840
(Your comments are always a source of
strength for me.)

706
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,920
(It just so happens that I'm eating
the cabbage porridge right now.)

707
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,160
I think this person and I get each other,
emotionally.

708
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,560
I like you, Sunshine.

709
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,640
SUNSHINE

710
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,520
Resume... Resume.

711
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,440
RESUME

712
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:54,320
Kyunggi-do...

713
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,520
THANK YOU TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

714
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,280
READING 'YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE'

715
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,160
Yes?

716
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,440
What is this?

717
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:28,960
Can't you see? It's ice cream. Eat it.

718
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,440
My dad told me you didn't eat all day.

719
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,000
At least eat this and gain some strength.

720
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,120
I'm fine. I don't feel like it.

721
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,800
Why not, you wench!

722
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,760
You have to eat to live.

723
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,200
And why do you keep using honorifics
to me?

724
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,240
Are you trying to create a barrier
between us or what?

725
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,920
This is all because of Kang Sun-woo,
isn't it?

726
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,520
You left that place because of him.
Am I wrong?

727
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,200
You dumb girl.

728
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,960
If you threw me away and chose him,
you should, at least, be happy.

729
00:54:58,720 --> 00:54:59,960
But, you got dumped like a moron.

730
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,440
You quit your job and can't even eat.

731
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:06,040
You dummy.
Why did you like someone like him?

732
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:22,880
A guest is coming.

733
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,760
Who could it be?

734
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,720
Hello, anyone home?

735
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,120
Hello there, is this the home of
Na Bong-sun's grandmother?

736
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:46,880
Yes, it is.

737
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,120
You're from Seoul.
You're someone who uses a knife.

738
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,400
Oh, yes.

739
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:58,800
Ah, I'm Bong-sun's work senior...
My name is Kang Sun-woo. Nice to meet you.

740
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,400
Oh! You chose a good career.

741
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,160
Your horoscope shows four positive 'yang'.

742
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:09,040
You should've been either an
artist or a soldier wielding a weapon.

743
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,720
It's not bad.

744
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,240
You're very compatible with my Bong-sun
who is all four 'yin'.

745
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,000
Oh, I see.

746
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,480
But, what brings you here?

747
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,080
Is something wrong with my Bong-sun?

748
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:31,840
No, that's not it.

749
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,200
I had some business nearby.

750
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:37,880
Bong-sun told me that her grandmother
lived around here.

751
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,160
I came to say hello.

752
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,280
Is that so?

753
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:44,960
Goodness, you sure have good manners.

754
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,720
-Please sit.
-Oh no, it's okay.

755
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,760
-I should...
-Oh, just sit down!

756
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,680
Unless you think it's filthy,
please just sit down.

757
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,920
Okay.

758
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,480
Well...

759
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,280
Bong-sun is doing very well.

760
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,600
She's such a deep person with integrity.

761
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:17,080
I know. I never worry about her.

762
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:21,520
She's always been so mature ever
since she was young.

763
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,080
She lost her parents when she was young.

764
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:30,280
She grew up without any peace
under a shaman grandma.

765
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:33,320
Yet, she would never complain.

766
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,960
She would prepare my meals every
morning and dinner.

767
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,920
And she would wait for me.

768
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,160
Goodness, she's got such a good heart.

769
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:47,800
It would have been so good...

770
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,360
If she didn't inherit my blood.

771
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,160
But since she was young,
she would see those ghosts.

772
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,440
She grew up so lonely without a
single friend.

773
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,600
Oh my...

774
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:08,760
I'm being so foolish,
in front of a guest at that.

775
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:11,720
Sit here for a moment.

776
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:13,640
I'm going to buy a bottle of soda.

777
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,920
-Oh no, Grandma.
-Just stay.

778
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,640
It's because I want to drink it.

779
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,400
I'm thirsty.

780
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,840
-Okay.
-Stay put.

781
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,760
(You must have been as lonely as I was,
Na Bong-sun.)

782
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,160
Hey, Kang Sun-woo. You're a total jerk.

783
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,440
-Oh, you...
-Yeah, it's me, you punk.

784
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,280
Wow, you look just fine.

785
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:30,120
You play around with an innocent girl and
kick her out.

786
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,240
You must be in great condition after that.

787
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,880
What are you talking about?

788
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,760
You want to know?

789
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,360
You really don't know what I'm talking
about, you awful punk!

790
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,720
Why did you do that to Na Bong-sun?

791
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,080
Why did you hurt that weak girl?

792
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,320
I...

793
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:52,320
I have never met anyone so bright and
positive besides my sister.

794
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,880
What did you do to her that she shriveled
up like that overnight?

795
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,920
She won't even eat one spoon of rice!

796
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,120
Are you even a human being?

797
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,360
How do you know that she isn't eating?

798
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,160
Because she's at our house, you jerk!

799
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,280
Be happy.

800
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,680
Yeah, Grandma.

801
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,320
What?

802
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,120
No, nothing's going on.

803
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,200
I'm doing well.

804
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,320
What?

805
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,440
Who dropped by?

806
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,440
-Who?
-Na Bong-sun!

807
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,160
-Gosh...
-Chef...

808
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,240
So, you've been alive?

809
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Have you?

810
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,640
You only got this far when you ran off?

811
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,680
You purposely stayed here
so I'd come get you, didn't you?

812
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,760
-No, that's not it...
-I'm right.

813
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:17,600
Don't be mistaken, Na Bong.

814
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,320
I didn't run over here because
I've forgiven you for lying to me.

815
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,120
I was just so worried.

816
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,520
I'm holding you because my heart
told me to.

817
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:34,680
So, I'll just hold you a bit for now...
I'll stay like this for a moment.

818
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,720
I missed you.

819
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,800
Don't talk like a mosquito.
I can't hear you at all.

820
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,760
I said, I missed you a lot.
I missed you so much, Chef.

821
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,560
I thought about it and I'm sure of
one thing.

822
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:07,240
Even before, I...

823
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,000
Long before you were ever possessed...

824
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:13,560
I watched over you, thought about you,
and worried about you.

825
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,040
So, don't disappear from my sight again.

826
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:18,280
I'm going to go crazy with worry.

827
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,320
Chef.

828
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,400
You got that?

829
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,160
Yes.

830
01:04:04,680 --> 01:04:06,760
OH MY GHOST

831
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,800
(I haven't done anything wrong,
but I feel like a bad guy.)

832
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,960
(It's not like I cheated.)

833
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,960
(I feel worried.
I'd rather we go together.)

834
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,760
(I'm never going to let go of this
hand again.)

835
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,040
(Looking at the circumstantial evidence,
it's almost definitely Officer Choi.)

836
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,560
Shouldn't we tell Chef now too?

837
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,360
(You know I rely on you a lot, don't you?)

838
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,040
About Eun-hee's hit-and-run case...

839
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:33,320
(She says Officer Choi could be involved.)

840
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,440
(What do you mean by that?)
