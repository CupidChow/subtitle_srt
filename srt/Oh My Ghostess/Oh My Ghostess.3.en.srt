1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,600
OH MY GHOST

2
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,160
OH MY GHOST

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:44,720
(Wow. Alright. Okay. Alright, alright.)

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,320
(Okay, okay. Here we go.)

5
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,800
Have some cold drinks while you wait.

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,520
Sir, how much longer?
My stomach is crying out for food.

7
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,040
I'm sorry. A seat will open up soon.

8
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,880
This place can't afford more publicity.
The sun will go down, at this rate.

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,040
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,480
Oh, they are done.
Two more people can enter.

11
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,800
-Hey daughter, two more people.
-Yes, welcome! Over here.

12
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,800
I'll clean this up quickly.

13
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
What would you like to have?

14
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,240
-We'll have two rice soups please.
-Okay, two rice soups.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,520
-You like it spicy, right?
-Of course.

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,560
They'll be ready soon.

17
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,200
Are you a bat or something?
Coming in late every night!

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,760
I told you to help out during
the lunch rush, didn't I?

19
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Ah, I'm so tired of your nagging.
I'm out here, aren't I?

20
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,520
Hey, Miss! When is our
spicy pork coming out?

21
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,240
-I'm dying over here.
-Yes, yes.

22
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Yes, it's coming soon.

23
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,400
-Daughter, they're waiting. Hurry.
-Yes, it's coming.

24
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,320
Go on and serve some side dishes.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,120
Hey, Miss! Why don't you sing us
a song while you're at it?

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,160
It's fun for you and
we'll be less bored too.

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,160
Goodness! I'm busy as heck! What song?

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
Sounds good!

29
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Good!

30
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,040
Daughter! One more person!

31
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,560
Come on in!

32
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,280
Gosh.

33
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,440
Miss, just a moment. I'll be right out.

34
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,000
Goodness sakes...

35
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,880
(Dad, I told you to clean the utensil
case carefully.)

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,880
(And you have to dry the utensils before
putting them in. There'll be watermarks.)

37
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,720
(Dad, you have to put a saran wrap on
the kkakdugi container.)

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,560
(It'll dry up and won't taste good.)

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,040
Gosh...

40
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,360
-Is the food okay?
-Yes.

41
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,880
Oh my, how thoughtless of me.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,080
It's so hot out. I didn't even turn
on the fan. Just a moment.

43
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,600
Oh, what's with this?

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,240
It's acting up again.
It was working before.

45
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,960
My gosh...

46
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,040
Oh! It's working.

47
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,720
How did you know what to do?

48
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,200
I just pulled it and it worked.

49
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,120
I was just so grateful. I brought you
here because I wanted to feed you.

50
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,760
But, I'm not sure if it's to your liking.

51
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,120
Yes, it's good.

52
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,280
Actually, I have to get going.

53
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,080
Wait, wait. Please wait.

54
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,560
Goodness, look at me.

55
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,560
Taking up your time when you're so busy.

56
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,040
Here.

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,960
This isn't much money,
but take a taxi home.

58
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,040
No, no. That's okay.

59
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,280
I just want to thank you.

60
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,640
The way the world is today...
He would be in trouble if not for you.

61
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,840
It's my gratitude, so please accept it.

62
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,080
-Thank you for the food.
-Okay...

63
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,760
(Yes, this is it.)

64
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,720
(The neighborhood where I lived.)

65
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,560
SEMAEUL LAUNDRY

66
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,120
Hey, Soon-ae.
Are you going out for delivery?

67
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,000
Pick up your dad's suit, would you?

68
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,400
He left it here after some wedding and
he still hasn't picked it up.

69
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Pick it up soon, okay?

70
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,720
Soon-ae,

71
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,720
When are you paying me
for the haircut I gave you?

72
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,360
You're always getting it on tab.
Pay me back soon.

73
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,080
Why isn't Kyung-mo coming by?
It's almost time for his haircut too.

74
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,920
STYLISH

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
Hello, Ma'am.
Is your back feeling better these days?

76
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,920
Who are you...

77
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I came to buy clothes last time.
I guess you don't remember me.

78
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,320
You said that your back was hurting.

79
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,640
Take care of yourself.

80
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,120
My back? I had surgery on that a year ago.

81
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,400
The food is here.

82
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,840
-You're here.
-Let's eat!

83
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,120
Wow, it's heavy. Let's eat everyone!

84
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,440
There are lots here.

85
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,480
It's been a while, Soon-ae.

86
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,760
Please enjoy your meal.

87
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,880
Thank you.

88
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,200
This... This one is for Officer Choi.

89
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:40,720
What's this?

90
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,840
-They all have different amounts of rice.
-Oh, okay.

91
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,159
Leave the plates outside when done.

92
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
-Okay.
-Thank you.

93
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,080
-Come on.
-Come on.

94
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,200
Soon-ae!

95
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,120
-Let's eat!
-Bon appetit.

96
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,080
(My one-sided love with Officer Choi...)

97
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,760
(No, I guess you're Commander Choi now.)

98
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,280
(I see that you've remained warm
and handsome, as always.)

99
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,680
(Everything else
is still just as before...)

100
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,640
(But, why am I
the only one that's missing?)

101
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,200
(Why did I leave all these memories behind
and die?)

102
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,240
(I remember everything,
except for that moment.)

103
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,760
(What was it that happened to me?)

104
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,560
Oh, that young lady...

105
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,320
She was a chef?

106
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,560
Wow,

107
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
she's even been on TV.

108
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
I didn't realize she was famous.

109
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,720
NURUNGJI POLLACK SOUP

110
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Hey, that...

111
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,040
My Soon-ae used to make that.

112
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,080
A young person like that knows how
to make it?

113
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,440
Gosh.

114
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,000
(Wow.)

115
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,080
(Chef must be a genius. Seriously.)

116
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,480
(Our panel of judges are
tasting the food now.)

117
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,120
He doesn't even like rice.
How did he think of this?

118
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,240
I know right?

119
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,680
Anyways, Na Bong-sun, you're a natural.

120
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,360
It doesn't seem like this is your
first time on TV.

121
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,880
Natural, yeah right. Is it natural to
stand there eating nonstop?

122
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,240
What an embarrassment.
Others would think we starve her.

123
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,320
What do you mean? It's a lot more natural
than just standing around.

124
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,840
Being natural is good,
but she just keeps eating and eating.

125
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,840
What is Jun doing? This is almost over.

126
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,120
Wow, this is really fun.

127
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,840
I was organizing the new
rubber gloves we got from the sponsors.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,920
Maybe it's because they're expensive,
but they feel very good on the hands.

129
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,480
I think two boxes will
last us a long time.

130
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,280
(Please return to your places.)

131
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,040
Where is Chef, by the way?

132
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,120
Gosh! They should've done a close-up here.

133
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,640
I even smiled on purpose for
my charm explosion.

134
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,160
What's with the camera director?

135
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,000
Hi, by chance...

136
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,480
Oh, yes...

137
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,080
I am.

138
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,920
But, what do I do? I don't have a pen.

139
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,080
I just wanted to ask you,
which way is it to Mapo Bridge?

140
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,160
Ah... Mapo Bridge?

141
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,160
It's probably this way.

142
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,720
What do you think?
They're very good, right?

143
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,320
Yes, I suppose so. They are very good.

144
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,600
But does my opinion really matter?

145
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,200
Of course, it does.

146
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,720
The opinion of someone who uses
them daily counts the most.

147
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,040
That's why I'm giving you this sample.

148
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,880
Whatever the case, just use them.
Don't feel burdened.

149
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,240
Thank you.

150
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
My rubber gloves had a hole and
I was thinking of buying a pair.

151
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,120
I guess if you've been on TV,
they give you free products like this.

152
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,520
I told you, I'm just an Assistant Cook.

153
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,480
I'll be throwing this away now, okay?

154
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,960
Wow, what a relief to get rid of that
thing.

155
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,560
-Can you taste the seasoning?
-Sure.

156
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,320
How is it?

157
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,280
Can I take a look in your kitchen?

158
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,200
Go ahead.

159
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,280
Gosh, now...

160
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,680
This is the fridge of a restaurant,
after all. Everything's a mess.

161
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Oh my! Why would you pour soda in here?

162
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,400
This is different than sugar.
It gives a different savory flavor.

163
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,920
-Try mixing it in.
-Is that right? Let's see.

164
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
Let me see.

165
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,360
You're right!

166
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,280
It's just like the kimchi my daughter
used to make.

167
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,920
I didn't even know anything and
I just poured sugar in there.

168
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Goodness.

169
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,040
You have a daughter?

170
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,200
Yes, I used to.

171
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,840
She's gone far away now.

172
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,040
She was a daughter that was like
a son to me.

173
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,240
Gosh...

174
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,320
By the way, what's your name?

175
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,880
I don't even know your name yet, Miss.

176
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,840
(It's Soon-ae, Dad.)

177
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,680
It's Bong-sun. Na Bong-sun.

178
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,640
Ah, Bong-sun.

179
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,240
That's a very good name.
There's a good feeling to it.

180
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Oh, right... Hold on a moment.

181
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,400
I ran out of yogurt this morning.
I have no drinks to serve. I'll buy some.

182
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh no! I'm fine. I really am.

183
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,960
Still, that isn't right.
I'll be right back, so stay put.

184
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,000
Gosh, seriously...

185
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,480
Well, my father never did turn away
a guest empty-handed.

186
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,960
Where was the kimchi container again?

187
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,480
My dad is truly the best.

188
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,800
It's been over two years,
but how could it all be just the same?

189
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,680
Hasn't changed at all.

190
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,960
That's funny.

191
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,840
Are you happy?

192
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,760
Well...

193
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,360
Who knew that picture would turn
out to be my last portrait?

194
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,520
my diary.

195
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,280
SOON-AE'S DIARY

196
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,040
(Who... Who's there?)

197
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,000
Who are you?

198
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,400
Oh, is the bathroom not here?
Is it over there?

199
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,560
Hey, excuse me!

200
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,080
You can't tell the difference between a
bathroom and a room?

201
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,720
Are you blind?

202
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,080
Yes, I have astigmatism.

203
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,960
(-What's his problem?)
-What the...

204
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,720
(He usually sleeps till the sun goes down
when he drinks. What's he doing up?)

205
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,480
Why are you looking at me
like that?

206
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,160
-What do you mean?
-What?

207
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,480
Oh, are you up?

208
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,800
-Have you two said hello already?
-Yes.

209
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,240
What hello?

210
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
-She's not a customer?
-Hey, kid.

211
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,640
When you were passed out last night,
she took you to the police station.

212
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,040
You should thank her.

213
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,200
Why do you always sleep on the street
when you drink?

214
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,560
I'd wake up when the sun comes up.
Why bother?

215
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,840
Thanks anyway.

216
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,440
(Thanks anyway? Check out his manners...)

217
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,200
Yeah, you're telling me.
Why did I bother taking you the station?

218
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,520
By the looks of you,
you've been unemployed a long time.

219
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,600
It doesn't look like you help your father.

220
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,520
Whether you slept there till morning or
got attacked...

221
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
I should've just ignored you and
gone on my way.

222
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,400
Goodness, what's it to you?
It's none of your business.

223
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,680
(It is my business. That's the problem.)

224
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,240
That's true.

225
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,920
If you're here at this time of day,
you must be unemployed too.

226
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,720
I was actually working when...

227
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,800
What time is it?

228
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,240
I'm late... I'll be going now, Mister.

229
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,480
-Take this yogurt.
-I'll have it next time.

230
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,720
My goodness.

231
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,760
What's with her!

232
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,160
Mister, here you go.

233
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,240
-What is all this?
-Our store has so much of this.

234
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,079
-Please use them.
-But, still...

235
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:12,960
-Use these too.
-But...

236
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:18,599
What's this?

237
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,200
Gosh, now...

238
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,960
You put too much oil.
You won't be able to season it.

239
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,760
You can't put too much or too little.
It's very difficult.

240
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,360
It's super difficult. Once cooking becomes
easy for you, you're losing your skill.

241
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
Yes, Chef.

242
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,960
Where's the pollack roe for
today's special?

243
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
I'll get it, Chef.

244
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,560
Okay.

245
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,360
What is this? Why is it so mushy?

246
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,000
Wipe this off.

247
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,160
Look at the water on the bottom.
Gosh, these guys...

248
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,520
They brought us some crappy stuff.

249
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,560
-Hey, Min-soo.
-Yes?

250
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,440
Return this and tell them,
'you guys can eat this crap.'

251
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,320
Yes, Chef. I'll deliver the message,
just like that.

252
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,480
Chef, what will our special be for today?

253
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,200
What should we do?

254
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,480
Oh, right. There was caviar leftover
from before. Where is that?

255
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,600
Okay.

256
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,960
Will you be doing caviar pasta?
That'll cost us more per plate.

257
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,800
I won't take it from your pay,
so don't worry.

258
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,200
-Chef!
-What is it?

259
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,240
The caviar's gone.

260
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,240
What do you mean? It's there on the left.

261
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,040
It was there before...

262
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
What happened? Where is it?

263
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,400
What happened?
It was there just yesterday.

264
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,200
Chef, I don't know if I should bring
this up now.

265
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,760
Things have been disappearing from the
kitchen for the past few days.

266
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:53,240
It's been small amounts, so I didn't
bother telling you about it.

267
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,200
What?

268
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
Thanks. Come again.

269
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,080
-Okay, I'll be back.
-Okay.

270
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,200
Bong-sun.

271
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
What brings you here?

272
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,680
I was visiting the restaurant owner
while passing by.

273
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,960
You must've become very friendly with
that owner.

274
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,520
-Pardon?
-After that day...

275
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,280
Well, it's just that...

276
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,800
He's a very good person and
he feels like a father to me so...

277
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,360
You're much more outgoing than
I thought you were.

278
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,760
I thought you were very introverted.

279
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,880
I am a little.

280
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,560
(Ending up in this body must be fate.)

281
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,960
(I met my father and Officer Choi.)

282
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,240
(How could a man's hand be so
beautiful? I want to hold it.)

283
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
-Oh yeah.
(-I want to hold it.)

284
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,720
(-I want to hold it.)
-I saw you on TV.

285
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,960
You weren't nervous at all.

286
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,600
I want to hold it.

287
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,960
-Excuse me?
-What!

288
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,520
Oh, oh... never mind. That's not it.

289
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,880
I wasn't as nervous as I thought I'd be.

290
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,840
I don't think people know the real you,
Bong-sun.

291
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,680
That includes me, of course.

292
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Ah, yes.

293
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm going to go this way now.
I have to meet my senior.

294
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,440
Oh, okay then...

295
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,440
Next time then...

296
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:37,680
(Let's walk together again.
We'll hold hands next time.)

297
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,160
-Get back safely.
-Yes.

298
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,560
'Get back safely'.

299
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,520
He told me to go back safely!

300
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,360
Yes, yes. I will be safe.

301
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,120
Oh my, why is the sky so beautiful?

302
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,160
People are beautiful.

303
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,360
The flowers are so pretty too.

304
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,360
Oh, I think my face is turning red.

305
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
I'm so shameless!

306
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,080
It's been a while since I've gotten
all hot.

307
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,960
Oh, what do I do!

308
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,200
Goodness sakes.

309
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,240
I feel bad using it,
but I can't just leave it.

310
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,600
What do I do with this?

311
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
Hey, where have you been all this time?
Come home earlier.

312
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,160
Cheongdam-dong.
I can't get my hair done just anywhere.

313
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,120
What's all this anyways?
Are you donating items somewhere?

314
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:41,760
No, you know that young lady from
the restaurant.

315
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,600
She came again? She's really weird.

316
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,080
Why is she bringing this stuff?
We're not beggars.

317
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,160
She's up to something.
I'm sure of it, Dad.

318
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,000
Well, she hasn't said anything about
insurance.

319
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,720
Then, she's probably a con artist.
She thinks you're a rich, old man.

320
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,760
That can't be.

321
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,800
Look at her. She doesn't look that way.

322
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,920
Do you think con artists have
'Con Artist' stamped to their forehead?

323
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,040
Young people these days are scary.

324
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,640
You know what's scarier than a ghost?
It's a human woman.

325
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,080
(The fact that items have gone missing
from the kitchen...)

326
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,160
(means it's someone in this group.)

327
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,680
(It's not me, so it's one of you. Right?)

328
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,680
How could something so distasteful happen?

329
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,480
What... What is it?

330
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,480
If it was money you needed,
I would've given it to you.

331
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,520
Because you would've worked harder
afterward.

332
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:51,200
Or if you used it to practice your
cooking all night, I would praise you.

333
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,240
How could I wrong you for working hard?

334
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,360
But, what is it? Caviar?

335
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,040
Caviar... This much of it.

336
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,040
At most, it's 300,000 won.
It's such a waste, I can't stand it. Why?

337
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,040
Because the most fundamental trust
has been broken.

338
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,760
What is it?

339
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,040
-What's going on?
-Hey.

340
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,040
What?

341
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,800
Our immature Bong-sun is very curious.
Dong-chul...

342
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,880
-Yes?
-What, exactly, is missing?

343
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,760
Okay, so...

344
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,360
Caviar, the sample rubber gloves...

345
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,560
A bottle of soy sauce, a bottle of
sesame oil, whole sesame seeds.

346
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,080
Gosh...

347
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,160
The level of the items stolen is
shockingly pathetic.

348
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,000
Even if you sell these things,
you can't make money. What is this?

349
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,400
Turn yourself in.

350
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,440
Of course, you'll hear crap from me
if you turn yourself in. But

351
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,680
isn't it better than keeping it to
yourself and being burdened by it?

352
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,240
Come forward. Who is it?

353
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,160
-Uh...
-Uh, Chef?

354
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,320
Can I say something?

355
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,760
-Sure, speak.
-Yes.

356
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
Honestly,

357
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm very upset that such an
unfortunate event occurred in our kitchen.

358
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,000
I take partial responsibility too.

359
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,240
But, as someone who spent more time with
these people than you, Chef...

360
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,840
Don't you think trying to find the culprit
like this does more harm than good?

361
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,000
That's what I've been thinking.

362
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,960
You may succeed in finding the culprit.

363
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,720
But, our doubts and distrust of each
other will deepen.

364
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:39,080
And because I was feeble and weak,
I worried about the bond of our team...

365
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,080
I feared that we would break, and
pondered that.

366
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,520
The missing caviar, soy sauce,
sesame seeds...

367
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,960
-What else?
-Sesame oil.

368
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,320
Yes, sesame oil.

369
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,560
You can buy these things with money.

370
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
But, you cannot buy our teamwork with
money.

371
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,600
So, why don't we tie things up here?

372
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,440
Why don't we all take
on the responsibility here.

373
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,000
We'll work extra hard to make up for
the amount that went missing.

374
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,360
Let's do it like that.

375
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,840
I just had that thought to myself, Chef.

376
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,920
It was you.

377
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
Huh?

378
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Me?

379
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,320
It wasn't me, Chef.

380
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,280
I'm right. It is you, isn't it?

381
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
Look me in the eye.

382
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,440
Look at me.

383
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,960
It is you, Min-soo.

384
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,800
Well, Chef... That's not it.

385
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,680
Wait, wait, wait.

386
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,280
What happened was...

387
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,400
A girl I'm seeing wanted to try my food
and she came over late at night...

388
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,200
I was just borrowing it and
I was going to replace it.

389
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,400
I just forgot.

390
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,800
Hey you --- bastard!

391
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,520
Chef, the thing is I...

392
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,120
That caviar,
I was really going to replace it.

393
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,320
Please trust me. Once my pay came out,
I was going to buy more.

394
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,680
Are you starting a restaurant?
Why are you taking soy sauce?

395
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,320
No, no, no. That's not right.
The caviar was me. The rest isn't me.

396
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,320
I'm telling the truth, please.

397
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,960
Am I stupid? Why would I believe that?

398
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,720
-Excuse me, Chef...
-Then...

399
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,560
Then, why do you even work with me?

400
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,360
If you can't even trust me and
you can't stand me, why work with me?

401
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,640
Why do you think?

402
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,400
Well, you had some cooking skills so
I kept you around hoping you'd shape up.

403
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,040
What, you punk! Why you...

404
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,800
There are things you can do and can't do.

405
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,840
-Are you a thug?
-What do you mean, a thug?

406
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,400
-Aren't you being too harsh?
-Can I just say something...

407
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,840
What do you mean, harsh?
It's not worse than what you did.

408
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,760
Yeah, so... Gosh...

409
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,560
So...

410
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,080
The caviar was me,
but the other stuff wasn't me.

411
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,720
I really... I...

412
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,680
Do you think I don't have my share of
things to say to you?

413
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,480
-What?
-You always put me down...

414
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,120
In front of everyone.

415
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,200
But, I still try to get the team to bond
and even buy everyone drinks.

416
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,320
I've put my body and money into someone
who looks down on me like this. I'm crazy.

417
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,640
Body and money. What a joke!

418
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,440
It's not funny and it's not a joke.

419
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,600
I'm not working for you because I have
nowhere to go.

420
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,120
-I have lots of offers.
-Leave then!

421
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:34,440
-I'm not going to stop you.
-You know what? I will!

422
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,400
Seriously!

423
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,480
You know what? Stay healthy.

424
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
And please find some humility.

425
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,640
-Sun-woo, what are you doing? Get him.
-Why should I?

426
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,200
He wants to leave. Let him be.

427
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,320
Chef, wait. Hey, wait just a moment!

428
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,360
Chef, Chef, Chef...

429
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,720
I don't think it's necessary for you to
get so worked up like this.

430
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
What?

431
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,200
So what I'm saying is,
people can make mistakes in life.

432
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,880
You know sometimes when you see
something, you want it all of a sudden.

433
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,600
So, let's get the Sous Chef to come back.
Okay?

434
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,480
Should I go get him and
say you told me to?

435
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,120
Forget it.
Don't you dare do it. Don't stop him.

436
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
Chef, you know what they say.
Mistakes happen often enough.

437
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,640
And we Koreans have three times as
the established social courtesy.

438
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,920
So, let's just let it go this once
for the Sous Chef.

439
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,280
Then, you can be the owner and
give me my salary.

440
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,120
Chef, wait...

441
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,200
Gosh, why is everything getting so
twisted?

442
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,480
Seriously, I'm going crazy.

443
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
Well, are you seeing something?

444
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,640
I see a husband running away.

445
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,560
There's a very young girl next to him.

446
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,200
Southwest... They're headed southwest.

447
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,240
A husband I don't even have?

448
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,680
What I'm saying is,
even if it's not your husband...

449
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,760
It could be a family member that
symbolizes a husband figure.

450
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,320
If it's family fortune,
then they are considered the same.

451
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,640
-Then my daughter-in-law...
-Yes, yes. It's your daughter-in-law.

452
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
(What a rip-off.)

453
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,360
Since these fakes started taking over
all the spots in Gangnam...

454
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,400
True Bodhisattva's like us have
no place to stand.

455
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,600
-Oops, I'm sorry.
-Ouch, that hurts.

456
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,840
-I'm sorry.
-You should be more careful.

457
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,520
Hold on a sec!

458
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,960
Oh, we've met before, right?

459
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,600
I don't think so?

460
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,800
I think we did.

461
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,920
-Me?
-Your voice sounds familiar.

462
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,800
It's not because I didn't believe you
that I went there.

463
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,120
Oh, it's fine.

464
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,120
You don't need to worry.

465
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:16,920
Even when buying a cabbage,
you should shop around a few places.

466
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,400
Of course you should check out
other places.

467
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,080
That way, you'll realize that I'm
truly enlightened.

468
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,680
Right? That is true.

469
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,160
Anyways, you must've been very hungry.
You finished everything.

470
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,080
I was trying to find someone today.

471
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,600
So, I didn't get to eat.

472
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:37,880
Find someone?

473
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,040
That's interesting.

474
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,760
I guess, even you don't get to
see everything.

475
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
Oh, well,

476
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,560
what I'm looking for isn't a person.

477
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,760
It's a ghost...

478
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,120
A ghost? Oh my goodness.

479
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,920
Why?

480
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,480
Of course people say things they
don't mean when they're angry.

481
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,480
Or he should've not made a mistake.

482
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,680
I mean how long has it been since
we've worked together?

483
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,360
He can't even deal with that?

484
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,200
Hey, am I at fault?

485
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,400
Are you listening? Look at me.
Don't just eat.

486
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,920
You're better than humans.

487
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,360
At least you won't betray me.

488
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
Damn it. I don't care. Whatever.

489
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,680
Not like the kitchen won't run without
a Sous Chef.

490
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

491
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,960
-Hey, Bong-sun, hurry, clean this up.
-Yes, Chef.

492
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
-Slow down, slow down.
-Yes.

493
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,760
-Why are you so rushed?
-Yes.

494
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,840
Hey, did the seafood noodle dish
go out to table 3 yet?

495
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,360
I said did the seafood noodle dish
go out to table 3 yet?

496
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,200
-Huh?
-Yes, yes, Chef.

497
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,600
Can someone check?

498
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,040
-Okay.
-Okay.

499
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,960
Ji-woong, what's going on
with the flatfish?

500
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,280
I'm on it now.

501
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,040
Gosh, why would you destroy the fish
like that?

502
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,240
I'm sorry. Usually, Sous Chef does this.

503
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,640
Here, you do it from this side. Look.

504
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,160
-Got it?
-Yes, yes.

505
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,960
-Pull this.
-Yes, Chef.

506
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,080
-Pull it and do it slowly.
-Okay, okay.

507
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,440
You try again.

508
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,760
Never mind. It'll take you all day.
Just use it for salad.

509
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,400
-Hey, Bong-sun!
-Yes.

510
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,440
Wrap that fish with tangle and
put it in the fridge.

511
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,760
-Yes, Chef.
-Beef.

512
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,760
-Ji-woong!
-Yes, Chef!

513
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,440
Can you take care of the beef?

514
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,960
Sous Chef usually does that too.

515
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:49,080
What's with everyone today? So annoying.

516
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,080
Gosh.

517
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,520
Oh, hey. It's me.

518
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,880
Do you know anyone who could
work as a Sous Chef?

519
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm in a rush.

520
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:09,800
(Oh, I don't know. Chefs at that
level are too high in demand.)

521
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,080
(You're famous for being picky
and people call you the criticism chef.)

522
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,960
(People won't want to work for you.)

523
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,480
(Kids these days prefer comfort over
learning, you know.)

524
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,720
What? Criticism?

525
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,480
Wow, that's insane.

526
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,800
I only critique for their own benefit.

527
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,080
Forget it, forget it!

528
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,600
It's their loss.

529
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,040
(Hey, are you getting mad
at me right now?)

530
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,880
No, I'm not yelling at you.

531
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
No...

532
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,840
I'm sorry. I'm not getting mad at you.

533
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,960
I'm just so busy right now.

534
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,360
Okay, I'll be in touch. Be well.

535
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,760
Okay.

536
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,320
Gosh, I'm going nuts.

537
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,360
Where am I supposed to find a Sous Chef?

538
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,400
Excuse me?

539
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,360
There's a Bong-sun or
something here, right? From TV?

540
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,760
-Yes, there is. Why?
-It's the right place.

541
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm the son of the small restaurant
down there.

542
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,200
Here.

543
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,800
Give it to her.

544
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:11,080
If she thinks we're beggars,
we don't need her sympathy.

545
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,800
And if she's after my dad,
he's completely broke.

546
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,880
She won't get anything out of seducing
him. Tell her not to bother.

547
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,040
-You'll remember that?
-What?

548
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,000
I haven't touched any of this stuff,
so don't say otherwise later.

549
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,440
What's he saying?

550
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,719
What is all this?

551
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,159
Seriously!

552
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,360
Ouch, why? What is it?

553
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,679
Why? What is it?

554
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,360
Why are you doing this?

555
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,159
What is this?

556
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:47,920
What is this...

557
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:56,159
What is all this... Doing here?

558
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,240
By the looks of your reaction,
it is your doing, right?

559
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,600
The restaurant owner's son brought it.
Explain this to me.

560
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:07,360
Explain all this to me,
so that I can understand.

561
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,840
Well, this is...Well...

562
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,960
You're not really trying to get together
with that old man, are you?

563
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,760
What? Is that what that kid said?

564
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,960
That punk.
I ought to sew his trap together.

565
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,040
Hey, Na Bong-sun.

566
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,480
Yes?

567
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,880
You're very sick, aren't you?

568
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,560
I wouldn't say I'm sick...

569
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:36,040
I'm just a bit confused.

570
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,320
No, no. You are...

571
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:41,440
It's serious. What's with you lately? Huh?

572
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,960
Okay, well that's that.

573
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,240
What's your relationship with them?
Why would you give them this?

574
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,760
It's not that I have anything to do
with them.

575
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,800
I just felt bad for them.

576
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,560
You'd see it yourself if you went there.

577
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,520
Nothing there is properly set up

578
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,000
and I wonder how they can run at all.

579
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,480
His daughter died and the owner
is working hard on his own.

580
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,080
That son of his is absolutely no help
at all.

581
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,840
-So...
-You gave them this?

582
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,840
-Yes.
-The store's items, not yours.

583
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Yes.

584
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,120
I'm going to lose it.

585
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,040
Wow, I just can't understand your
thought process.

586
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,520
What's wrong with you?

587
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,960
You couldn't even look me in the eyes
before? What's with you now?

588
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,120
She's crazy... Crazy.

589
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,480
What are you going to do now?

590
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,640
Min-soo's gone now. How are you going to
take responsibility for this?

591
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,680
So, why did you just fire a person
like that?

592
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:47,320
And I went after you to stop you.

593
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,640
-You just kept getting angry.
-Gosh, really!

594
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,960
Oh, my head hurts.

595
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,160
Okay,

596
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,040
for now...

597
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,640
Let's keep this between the two of us.

598
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,240
-Okay?
-Yes.

599
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,840
We'll keep it between us and
I'll take care of it. Go inside now.

600
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,280
Yes, Chef.

601
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,960
-But, what about the Sous Chef?
-I said I'd take care of it.

602
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,400
Go inside.

603
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,880
Yes, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

604
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,640
Please deduct the cost of these items
from my pay.

605
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,880
The sinner will be heading back in now.

606
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,800
-I'll be going.
-Go, go already!

607
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,480
Okay! I'm going! I'm going!

608
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,640
-Stop.
-Hey, Huh Min-soo!

609
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,960
How can you put diesel in a gasoline car,
you dummy!

610
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,960
Hey, don't you know gasoline and
diesel in English?

611
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,320
-Of course, I do.
-You do and you put in that oil?

612
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,480
You're driving me crazy.

613
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,040
Why is a chef coming to me and
creating a nuisance? You're such a pest.

614
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,760
Stop it already. Just take it off my pay.

615
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,240
Do you know how much it is to change
an engine? It's 4,500,000 won.

616
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,880
You make 40,000 won a day.

617
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,040
My sister told me differently.
She told me it's 100,000 won.

618
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,920
Hey, you talk to your sister about that.

619
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,000
-Just wash the car.
-Sorry about that.

620
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,600
Wipe harder. Harder!

621
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,200
Like you're cleaning your body, you punk.

622
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,880
-Like I'm cleaning my body?
-That's right! Can't you wash cars?

623
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
Are you stupid? Are an idiot?

624
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,080
Gosh!

625
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,720
He's going too far when we're family.

626
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,880
You can't get off while...

627
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,160
Did you make a scene and leave
just to do this?

628
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,560
I thought you had lots of offers.

629
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,400
-Why are you here?
-Why?

630
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:43,000
-I came for a car wash.
-Okay.

631
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,960
What are you doing? Aren't you getting in?

632
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,480
Are you going to continue holding a
dirty rag instead of a knife?

633
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,120
Wait please.

634
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,840
Gasoline... Gasoline!

635
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:09,200
Sun-woo... I'm sorry.

636
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,640
-I'll do better.
-Gross, what's with you?

637
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,240
You acted like you'd never see me again.

638
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,080
Were you really never going to see me?

639
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,360
No, no. I was going to keep seeing you.

640
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,000
Okay, okay. Let go.

641
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Attention, everyone.

642
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,840
Min-soo's here.

643
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,080
This is great, isn't it?

644
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,840
I brought Min-soo back.

645
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,640
And

646
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,080
from this point on...

647
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,880
Let's not bring up that unfortunate
incident again.

648
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,160
It's not a good memory so let's forget it.

649
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,680
That never happened today, okay?

650
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,640
-Yes, Chef!
-Yes, Chef...

651
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:54,520
Let's tidy up and why don't we have a
team dinner today.

652
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,960
I don't think I've paid enough attention
to you guys, lately.

653
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,600
Come on, that's not true.

654
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,600
That kind of stuff is my duty as the
Sous Chef.

655
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,440
It's because I'm unworthy.
Please, just hit me.

656
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,080
No need for hitting.
No, I've been lacking lately.

657
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,680
What do you want to eat, huh?

658
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,160
-Beef ribs?
-Chicken.

659
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,400
-Chicken?
-Chicken.

660
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,920
Chicken...

661
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,240
Then we'll have chicken.

662
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,400
Yes, okay.

663
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,440
-Tidy up.
-Yes, Chef.

664
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,440
Thanks Chef.

665
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Everyone...

666
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,160
You were all very worried, right?
No need to worry anymore. Don't frown.

667
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
Let's clean up and everyone has to come
out to dinner today.

668
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,560
If anyone misses out,

669
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,520
-Sous Chef will be mad at you!
-Yes.

670
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,360
Is there anyone who wants to make
Sous Chef mad?

671
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,800
-No, there isn't!
-No, there isn't. Let's go.

672
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,760
Chef really is the bigger man.

673
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:59,200
If it were me, I wouldn't let him back.

674
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,280
Today was just one day of
springtime fantasy.

675
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,400
He's like a zombie that keeps coming
back even though you keep killing him.

676
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,920
He just doesn't drop dead.

677
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,200
You should come with us.

678
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,560
No, I'm tired.
Besides, Sung-jae's coming to get me.

679
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,960
Let's go.

680
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,760
-Coming Chef!
-Let's go.

681
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,200
Let's go, everyone.

682
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,120
Sun-woo... Eun-hee.

683
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,800
What are you doing here at this hour, Mom?

684
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,640
-Hello, everyone.
-Hello!

685
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,520
-You drank again?
-I just had a little bit.

686
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,840
This person is Seobinggo.

687
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,960
She's famous in Seoul and known to
be very enlightened.

688
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,360
We became friends today.

689
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,960
Friends, friends...

690
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,360
She came to see you.

691
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,760
We're about to go for dinner.

692
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:48,840
Dinner?

693
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,320
-You guys wait outside.
-Yes, Chef.

694
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,400
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

695
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,480
We love you!

696
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,840
I love you guys too. Enjoy your meal.

697
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,680
Hey, you... Young lady who doesn't
greet people.

698
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,960
What was your name again?

699
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,320
-Bong-soon?
-It's Bong-sun.

700
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,040
Right, Bong-sun.

701
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,560
I'm sorry to ask...

702
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,320
Can you get us two cups of water?
We're so thirsty.

703
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,040
Ah, water? Of course.

704
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,760
-Wait!
-Huh...

705
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,600
Me?

706
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,440
Can you bring me lukewarm water?
I don't have very good teeth.

707
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,720
Yes, of course.

708
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,880
There's something very strange about
this place.

709
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,400
There's a mysterious mix of chill
and vitality in this place.

710
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,640
It's strong.

711
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,640
-It's strong, very strong.
-Strong?

712
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,920
-It's strong. It is.
-Strong?

713
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,960
The fact that I can feel it even
though I'm tipsy...

714
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,520
You'll have many ghosts surrounding you.

715
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,320
Ghosts! I told you. I told you!

716
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,880
There are lots of ghosts
in this place too.

717
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,920
I'm sorry, but I don't believe in ghosts.

718
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,720
And my employees are waiting outside,
so I'll be excusing myself now.

719
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,720
Mother, we'll talk later.

720
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,280
-No, Sun-woo. Sun-woo...
-We'll talk later.

721
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,920
Leave him alone.

722
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,360
If he doesn't believe,
fortunes and talismans are all useless.

723
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,640
-Wait!
-Yes?

724
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,320
Thank you for the water.

725
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,160
Hope it's refreshing.

726
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,600
Gosh.

727
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,800
Okay now... Everyone listen up.

728
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,600
Attention!

729
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,720
Today, let's forget about age and rank.

730
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,880
Everyone just relax, okay?

731
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,920
Cheers!

732
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,560
Cheers!

733
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,960
-Gosh...
-Chef...

734
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Do you want to do a love shot with me?

735
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,200
A love shot? Between guys?

736
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:13,160
-Do it, Chef.
-He loves you a lot.

737
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,520
-Let's do one.
-Love shot!

738
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,080
Love shot, love shot, love shot!

739
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,600
-Hey.
-Love shot!

740
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,320
Love shot!

741
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,960
Gosh, really?

742
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,520
-Just try it.
-Why should I do it with a guy?

743
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,240
-Just do it.
-Okay, hurry.

744
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,120
-Now, you're a real person.
-Goodness!

745
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,440
Seriously!

746
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,680
-That's nice!
-Good job.

747
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,680
That was good.

748
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,680
That tastes good.

749
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,040
Chef, wait, wait!

750
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,840
I'll grab this piece and here you go.

751
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,920
So good. It's so good.

752
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,360
Chef.

753
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,520
Actually, I spent all day thinking quite
a lot Chef.

754
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,480
I thought about what human relationships
are and about what life is.

755
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,440
I thought a lot, Chef.

756
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,120
And honestly...

757
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,720
I am really thankful that you reached
out me first.

758
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,840
But, I really only took the caviar and
nothing else.

759
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,120
We said we wouldn't talk about it anymore.

760
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,120
My heart was so broken.

761
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,880
We said we'd let it go.

762
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,360
Here you are. Let's drink to a new start!

763
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,280
One more, cheers!

764
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,800
Cheers!

765
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:40,120
-Oh, Chef...
-Hey, hey, hey!

766
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,480
-Hey...
-Oh, this is so nice.

767
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,240
Why did you drink so much? Are you drunk?

768
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,480
No, I'm not. I'm not drunk.

769
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:49,680
Stop drinking.

770
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,840
Chef... You're in a good mood too, right?

771
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,600
About what?

772
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,800
About bringing the Sous Chef back.

773
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,320
You did a really good thing...
A really good thing!

774
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,000
Are you trying to catch a rat?
Why are you cornering me?

775
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,000
-Because I like it.
-Okay, okay. I got it.

776
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Chef...

777
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,640
-Chef...
-I'm glad too.

778
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,400
Anyways, I have a call.

779
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,440
-So-hyung, what is it?
-It's Chef!

780
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,920
-Chef!
-Hey, is something wrong!

781
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,960
-Huh?
-What is it?

782
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,320
Where are you going?

783
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,240
So-hyung!

784
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,920
-Sun-woo!
-Yeah.

785
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,680
Hey, what happened to you?

786
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,520
Sorry, I didn't have anyone else to call.

787
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,960
A cat jumped out in front of me and
I turned the wheel.

788
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:49,640
I think I grazed the cat.
I was just so scared.

789
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:50,720
No.

790
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,000
Are you okay?

791
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,960
Yeah.

792
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,280
Hey!

793
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,680
Do you know why I crawled back in here?

794
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,080
Don't you think other places heard

795
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,240
about me and asked me to come in?

796
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,160
I told them, forget it.

797
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:19,720
I just kept picturing you kids and
I just couldn't bear to go.

798
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,040
-Crazy bastard. What a liar.
-Seriously.

799
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,840
Hey, have a drink.

800
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:28,880
So, I'm planning on being with you all
till we're buried bones.

801
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,200
Buried bones?

802
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,520
-Bones go in here.
-I'll put the bone in here...

803
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,960
Bones go in here.

804
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:37,960
Bong-sun was the only one who was
truly thinking of you, Sous Chef.

805
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,800
Bong-sun spoke to Chef multiple times,
asking to bring you back.

806
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,040
-Yes.
-Did you?

807
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,560
-Really?
-I did, I did.

808
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,960
My Bong...

809
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,760
Thank you so much. You're really the best.

810
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,400
Well, it's nothing.

811
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,320
I had my reasons, but anyways thanks.

812
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,040
No, I'm more thankful.

813
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,160
No, I'm more thankful.

814
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:07,440
No, I'm more thankful.

815
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,800
Gosh, Bong. You really are cool.

816
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,960
Okay, then from now on...

817
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,840
You can call me by my name.

818
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,240
From now on,
you'll be one of Heo Min-soo's people.

819
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,520
-We are family... Family, okay?
-Really?

820
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:27,200
Really? So, we've become family?

821
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,440
I like it, I like it. I like it a lot!

822
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,960
Min-soo, where do you live?
Do you live alone?

823
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,920
I said I want to go to your house,
Min-soo!

824
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:43,680
We're family so you can't.
Why are you so open when you're drunk?

825
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:47,040
No, I want to. I want to go. Min-soo!

826
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:50,360
You can't come over.
My place is really small.

827
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,520
That's why we have to go.
Because it's small.

828
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,360
It's no fun if it's big.

829
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:59,800
She's so aggressive.
Our Bong-sun is so aggressive!

830
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,520
Can we stop walking like this?

831
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,240
-This is so uncomfortable.
-No, we can't.

832
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,840
No, you punk because we're a family.

833
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,200
-Family.
-That's right!

834
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,920
You have to listen, kid.
What's wrong with you?

835
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,160
Hey!

836
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,800
Don't you know how darn stubborn
this punk here is?

837
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,960
-You're all losers!
-Zombies!

838
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,800
-Do you want to die?
-I won't die. I won't die.

839
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,360
Are you cursing me because you're drunk?

840
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,480
Walk forward!

841
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,640
-Let's go.
-Catch me if you can!

842
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,480
-I think I'm walking forward...
-You're dead to me.

843
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,400
But I'm not moving.

844
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,360
Stop, stop!

845
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,200
Oh, Bong-sun.

846
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,360
Why are you closing so early?

847
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,120
I would have missed you completely
if I came any later.

848
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,760
Goodness, you must have had a drink today.

849
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,640
We had a work dinner and drinks.

850
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:58,480
It was really nice.

851
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,520
Laughing, talking and drinking with
people.

852
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:07,160
I was going to head home,
but then I thought of you.

853
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,880
Mister, you like this right?

854
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,160
Hey, Mister...

855
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,800
Why did you send back everything
I gave you?

856
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,200
I was really upset.

857
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,040
I had no agenda when I gave it to you.

858
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,720
I'm sorry.

859
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:29,360
It's just that my son
is very wary of people.

860
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,160
Sorry to do this,
but I was just on my way out.

861
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:35,720
Where?

862
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,200
My son wanted to go eat blood sausage,
all of a sudden.

863
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,280
I'll have soju with you, next time.

864
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,640
I like blood sausage too.

865
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,840
Oh, is that so?

866
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,080
It's just that my son is not so
good with new people.

867
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:53,880
Also,

868
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,640
about bringing me products and so on...

869
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,960
I'd prefer it if you didn't.

870
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,880
I know you have good intentions,
but I feel a little burdened.

871
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,520
You're welcome to come for a meal
whenever you want.

872
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,320
I'll be going now.

873
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,320
Yeah, he could find it burdensome.

874
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,280
Dad doesn't know who I am.

875
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,800
Of course, his son comes first.

876
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,360
Why would he want to eat
blood sausage stew with me?

877
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,560
I shouldn't have gone there at all.

878
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,960
I should just drink by myself.

879
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,160
Oh, Officer Choi...

880
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,840
-Eun-hee?
-Officer Choi?

881
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,960
Sister-in-law...

882
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,440
The rice rolls were awesome.
They really were.

883
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,400
Why is Officer Choi with Eun-hee?

884
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,040
Being a good chef must run in your family.

885
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:07,320
It really was especially yummy.
What I'm saying is, make me some more.

886
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:10,200
-Of course, whenever you'd like.
-Here you go.

887
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,400
Give it to me.

888
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,240
-I'll take my wife home.
-Okay.

889
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,320
-Goodbye.
-See you again.

890
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,880
You're like a goddess.

891
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:26,760
I feel bad.

892
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,600
I wouldn't have called if I
knew you were out with employees.

893
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,760
-I would've called for a driver, anyhow.
-I wasn't going to stay long.

894
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,720
I think I'm sensitive about things
like this.

895
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,640
Like the cat...

896
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,480
I don't even like receiving plants or
flowers as gifts.

897
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,960
I don't like something coming to me
and dying.

898
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,840
I think it's going to rain.

899
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,280
Want to come in for a cup of coffee?

900
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
No way...

901
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,200
What if you jump on me and
try to have your way with me?

902
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,120
You're crazy!

903
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,760
I know I've been starving,
but I'm still picky about what I eat.

904
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,920
Hey, what's wrong with me?
Am I rotten or something?

905
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:15,600
People don't only avoid rotten food.

906
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,520
There's also a thing called taste.

907
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,680
Just know that and go home.

908
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,720
Have something warm to drink and sleep.
You did have a scare, after all.

909
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,120
-I'll be going now.
-Okay.

910
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,760
He's not even turning around.

911
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,080
Cold jerk.

912
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,400
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your meal.

913
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,960
You startled me.

914
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,680
I've gone and done it.
Help me out, Sun-woo.

915
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:02,560
What's wrong with you?

916
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,360
You know that girl in my program
I told you about.

917
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,960
I made up an excuse
and asked to meet here.

918
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,120
-Something like that?
-Just like that.

919
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,280
Isn't this so old-fashioned? Will it work?

920
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,120
When you don't have a method,
traditional is best. That's my opinion.

921
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,320
Good for you.

922
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,320
She's here!

923
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,080
So-hyung.

924
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:43,960
This is my friend, Sun-woo.

925
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,600
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

926
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:49,720
(That's when I knew.)

927
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:53,600
(The reason why love is sad isn't because
two people are amiss.)

928
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,600
(It's because the timing is amiss.)

929
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:58,800
-Chang-gyu, I'll be over here...
-Okay.

930
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:04,040
(And once you miss the timing,
you can't turn things back.)

931
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,760
(That's just natural.)

932
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,160
-Chicken and beer?
-Chicken and beer?

933
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,760
I'm okay with anything.

934
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:11,720
-Really?
-Yeah.

935
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,640
Okay.

936
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:33,400
(Officer Choi is married and his wife
is Eun-hee.)

937
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:37,360
(I died and this body isn't mine.)

938
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,960
(Yes, it could happen.)

939
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,120
(Three years
isn't a short amount of time.)

940
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,480
(Many things could have happened.)

941
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,280
(Some people marry.)

942
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:57,840
(Some people lose a child,
but live on because they can't die.)

943
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,800
(And some people...)

944
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,480
(Yes, I was briefly mistaken.)

945
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,840
(I'm not Na Bong-sun.)

946
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,120
(I'm not Na Bong-sun and
I'm not Shin Soon-ae, either.)

947
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,560
(I'm just a ghost.)

948
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,880
(I'm just a virgin ghost possessing
the body of another person.)

949
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,560
What is this doing out here?

950
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,880
Oh, I'm so sorry.

951
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,960
Keep on doing what you were doing.

952
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,240
Excuse me! What are you doing in my room?

953
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,960
It's my room.

954
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,240
No, it's not. It's my room.

955
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,080
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

956
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,120
Do you want to come in?

957
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,280
What the heck?

958
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,600
This is right though...

959
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,040
Just because I missed the payment a
few days, they rent my room?

960
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,280
Goodness.

961
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,600
They didn't even tell me.
It really is too much.

962
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,960
What is all this stuff anyway?
What's in her luggage?

963
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,800
What's this?

964
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:26,800
How can she not even have one credit card?

965
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,640
She really is a strange person.

966
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,400
GRANDMA

967
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,920
Yes, Grandma.

968
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,760
(Why haven't you been calling?)

969
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,320
-Is something going on lately?
-No, Grandma.

970
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,520
(I received the money you sent.
You sent money for my back surgery too.)

971
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:04,960
(I'm sure you don't have much.
You don't need to send it monthly.)

972
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,360
Don't worry.
Just spend it as you wish, Grandma.

973
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,200
(But, why are you suddenly speaking
formally to me?)

974
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,280
What?

975
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,280
Oh, it's nothing really.

976
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,320
I just thought I should grow up already.

977
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,360
Hello...

978
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:25,640
Grandma?

979
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,560
Grandma?

980
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,640
(Okay, eat well and don't forget to light
the incense.)

981
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:34,440
Okay, goodbye.

982
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:40,800
She was a good granddaughter.

983
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,840
She gave all her money to her grandma.
Goodness...

984
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,600
What is this?

985
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,160
Is it make up?

986
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,400
Seriously so stupid.

987
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,160
She doesn't need to live this way.

988
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,680
You're born once and you die.

989
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,400
You should use everything you want and
do everything you want.

990
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,880
You have to date guys and date two...
No three at a time.

991
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,520
If she waits, it'll all turn to crap.

992
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Where am I supposed to go now anyway?

993
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,200
It's not my body.
I can't just sleep anywhere.

994
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,920
I have so much luggage too.

995
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,400
He has a nice body.

996
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,960
Oh, you scared me.

997
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,800
Who are you?

998
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,080
Are you an evil house spirit?

999
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,360
I guess it is the time for spirits
to enter.

1000
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:14,960
Hey, but I'm really tired right now.
I don't have time to deal with you.

1001
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,040
Can't you go somewhere else?
Do you have to be here?

1002
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,600
I'm just saying...

1003
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,280
Okay, I got it.

1004
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:26,440
If you want to stay here.
You don't want to go? Then let's stay.

1005
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:27,680
I'm not very shy.

1006
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:31,840
Whether you're a ghost or an evil spirit,
just don't bother me and I don't care.

1007
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,160
I'm a peaceful person, okay? Peaceful...

1008
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:39,960
Why are you being like this?

1009
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,760
I'm really tired. Okay, fine.

1010
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,720
Okay, if you want to start something,

1011
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,520
what can I do? I'll fight you.

1012
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,320
You better prepare yourself.

1013
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:57,880
I'm coming. Come at me, come at me!

1014
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:08,800
(You'll have many ghosts surrounding you.)

1015
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,960
(This place will have lots of ghosts too.)

1016
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,400
OH MY GHOST

1017
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:39,840
Oh, Chef...

1018
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,200
Just because I acted cute,
why does he get so angry?

1019
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,560
Did Eun-hee like you first or
did you chase after her?

1020
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:46,920
I chased after her.

1021
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,200
(Why is he such a gentleman?)

1022
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,480
Gosh, you should be careful!

1023
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,120
I'm right, aren't I?
You like her, as a woman.

1024
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:55,560
What are you saying?

1025
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,720
Oh, I found it!

1026
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,280
How could a person change that much
so suddenly?

1027
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,280
Please, I'm asking you.
Can't you please do this?

1028
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,240
I don't even need it twice,
please just once.
