1
00:00:01,833 --> 00:00:04,470
 30 billion, with no presentation. 

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:08,074
 I'll make the deposit immediately if you say you'll do it. 

3
00:00:08,074 --> 00:00:14,577
 I heard something happened to you, and that was the exact amount you needed. 

4
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,081
 News travels fast. 

5
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:20,752
 This is a tough business to be in without that. 

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,317
 Yeah. 

7
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:29,594
 It's an offer that's difficult to refuse. 

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:37,910


9
00:00:39,005 --> 00:00:43,470
 However, I'll refuse. 

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,900
 If you can't raise sales by 30 billion won, I heard you would have to leave the company. 

11
00:00:52,247 --> 00:00:53,286
 That's right. 

12
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:56,521
 But you'll refuse my offer? 

13
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:59,991
 Yes, I'm sorry. 

14
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:03,595
 Is it because of the rumors in the industry? 

15
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:08,800
 We can proceed without your name or VC Communications' name. 

16
00:01:15,074 --> 00:01:19,377
 Are you looking down on us, too? 

17
00:01:20,646 --> 00:01:25,881
 We are officially registered as a lender and loan brokerage business with the financial supervisory service! 

18
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,667
 Sir, that's not the reason. 

19
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:33,158
 This is only for personal reasons. 

20
00:01:50,977 --> 00:01:52,077
Where's my box?

21
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,112
What are you doing right now?

22
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:55,747
What do you think? I'm packing my things.

23
00:01:55,748 --> 00:01:58,016
But why are you packing your things?

24
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,219
Because I have to keep my promise.

25
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:05,191
Why wouldn't you take the ad coming in? Why would you resign from the company?

26
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,959
Because I'm the best.

27
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,284
As you live, there are times when you shouldn't do something

28
00:02:13,284 --> 00:02:16,167
because you're the best at it.

29
00:02:28,514 --> 00:02:30,382
Senior Director Go.

30
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:37,312
Your position is connected to all of us. I think we deserve to know the reason

31
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:40,258
why you turned the offer down.

32
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:49,884
All of you.

33
00:02:49,885 --> 00:02:53,905
Do you know what it feels like to have a loan shark come to your house?

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:02,100
When parents take out a loan they can't handle, do you know what kind of environment their children have to live in?

35
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:05,525
 Open the door! I know you're in there! 

36
00:03:05,526 --> 00:03:08,053
 Open the door! 

37
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:09,888
 Where's your father? 

38
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:14,192
 - Where's your mother? 
 - Answer us! Where did they go? 

39
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,292
I do.

40
00:03:16,897 --> 00:03:19,297
I know all too well.

41
00:03:19,297 --> 00:03:21,422
Sure.

42
00:03:21,422 --> 00:03:23,809
If I do it, I could do the best job.

43
00:03:23,809 --> 00:03:26,705
I could create a positive image for Human&amp;Money.

44
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:31,648
I can make it so people who don't even need the money take out loans.

45
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,047
But are you telling me to make others go through the same type of pain?

46
00:03:40,047 --> 00:03:42,287
Because I'm the best at it.

47
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:46,791
There are also times when you shouldn't do something

48
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,362
Still... you have to survive first.

49
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:56,932
As a person, it's the least I can do to protect my conscience, and my pride as an advertiser.

50
00:03:56,932 --> 00:03:58,738
I won't do it!

51
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,380
   

52
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:18,257
We'll help you.

53
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,320
   

54
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:35,980
   

55
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,464
   

56
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:44,971
   

57
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:47,186
   

58
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:51,623
Yes, Mr. Kim?

59
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,992
I sent you something.

60
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,220
I just got it.

61
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:56,990
   

62
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,084
Well?

63
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:01,633
It's time to turn on the speaker.

64
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:06,504
Your reaction is a little tepid.

65
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:07,993
No, Mr. Kim.

66
00:05:07,993 --> 00:05:11,810
Thank you, but the thing is...

67
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,340
It's too personal?

68
00:05:14,343 --> 00:05:16,648
 This is a conservative conglomerate in our nation. 

69
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,152
 Someone who takes psychiatric medicine as part of her daily routine 

70
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,287
will become the CEO?

71
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:24,255
 Won't she be too unstable? 

72
00:05:24,255 --> 00:05:26,588
You're right.

73
00:05:26,588 --> 00:05:27,959
I'll use it well.

74
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,495
I look forward to good results.

75
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,530
   

76
00:05:37,536 --> 00:05:39,638
The timing is a little late.

77
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,007
Why would he give me something like this when it's pretty much over?

78
00:06:07,466 --> 00:06:10,068
It's been a while since I've been here.

79
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:16,708
There's nothing difficult about this.

80
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:21,901
What I need in return is clear, and what I need to give is certain in this deal.

81
00:06:28,954 --> 00:06:31,169
Okay, tell me what you want.

82
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:33,092
   

83
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,893
Vice-President Kang Han Soo cut off the agency's ads.

84
00:06:36,894 --> 00:06:39,164
Please recommence them.

85
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,268
Is that all?

86
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:47,198
I'm sure you know what I want from you.

87
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,808
There's no reason you wouldn't.

88
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:52,932
I've been serving you for 20 years.

89
00:06:52,933 --> 00:06:54,379
How could I not know?

90
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,281
I'd appreciate it since I have nothing to lose, but this is a loss for you.

91
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:05,487
What type of relationship do you have with Go Ah In? Why are you being like this?

92
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:13,461
Your company grew at a rapid speed. Are you going to watch it go bankrupt?

93
00:07:13,461 --> 00:07:15,066
Of course not.

94
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,256
I feel the same way.

95
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:23,370
I'd like to see how far Go Ah In will go

96
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:26,177
and how much she can accomplish.

97
00:07:26,177 --> 00:07:29,381
Moon Ho, you're getting old too.

98
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:33,653
Your specialty is getting rid of people. Isn't this your first time raising someone?

99
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:40,411
Yeah, okay.

100
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:44,929
Recommence all of the ads. Right away.

101
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,190
   

102
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,490
Yes, this is Go Ah In.

103
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,827
Excuse me?

104
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,500
Yes, I understand. Thank you.

105
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:32,510
They're going to recommence all the ads they canceled.

106
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,278
What?

107
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:37,814
Then...

108
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:41,052
Doesn't that mean you increased the sales by 50%?

109
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,322
What's happening?

110
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:51,496
Senior Director Go, why would you resign?

111
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:54,932
Senior Director Kang, thank you!

112
00:08:54,932 --> 00:08:58,269
I knew you'd do it!

113
00:08:59,429 --> 00:09:01,030
Me?

114
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:04,575
What did I do?

115
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,617
 I didn't do this. 

116
00:09:13,752 --> 00:09:16,687
Then who got them to recommence all the canceled ads?

117
00:09:16,688 --> 00:09:20,191
Someone who knows all the internal affairs of the agency.

118
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:24,029
Someone who can persuade my father and grandfather.

119
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,610
That leaves just one person.

120
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:30,620
   

121
00:09:36,942 --> 00:09:39,710
Did you come to see me?

122
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,416
We're seeing each other often today.

123
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,528
Did you do it?

124
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:01,165
What are you talking about?

125
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:06,971
Your Go board is gone.

126
00:10:06,971 --> 00:10:09,875
It's time I quit.

127
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,985
By chance,

128
00:10:13,068 --> 00:10:15,842
did you meet the grand chairman?

129
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,088
What did you give him to save me?

130
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:28,392
I gave him what he wanted to get what I wanted.

131
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,898
You don't have to worry.

132
00:10:33,898 --> 00:10:38,803
I just have to return to a job that I've had before.

133
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,539
And it's not something you don't want to return to?

134
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:49,143
You know, people can't always only do what they want.

135
00:10:50,482 --> 00:10:54,291
Thank you so much. I know it's shameless of me.

136
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:57,722
Do you know what's really shameless?

137
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:00,424
Disappointing me.

138
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:04,829
Make sure my investment in you doesn't become a failure.

139
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,833
What can I do for you?

140
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,936
Just do what you think is right.

141
00:11:11,936 --> 00:11:14,839
Just as you have been doing so far.

142
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:18,476
On top of that, please help Hanna.

143
00:11:20,345 --> 00:11:22,436
I understand.

144
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:25,550
I'd like to thank you one last time.

145
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,168
It's about time they showed up.

146
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,677
Who?

147
00:11:44,678 --> 00:11:48,906
Who had the audacity to cancel the vice-president's orders?

148
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:50,908
What the hell were you doing?

149
00:11:50,909 --> 00:11:54,679
Has this punk lost it?

150
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,857
Who do you think it was?

151
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:59,083
It was one of two people.

152
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:00,418
Hey, don't mess around with me.

153
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:04,488
CEO Cho went to see the grand chairman.

154
00:12:04,489 --> 00:12:06,504
CEO Cho?

155
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:09,060
Why did that old man go and see the grand chairman?

156
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,397
Are you pretending as if you don't know? Or do you really not know?

157
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,165
What?

158
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:18,120
CEO Cho used to be the grand chairman's right-hand man. The old chief secretary.

159
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,670
That's ancient history!

160
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:24,142
It might be ancient history, but their methods still apply.

161
00:12:24,142 --> 00:12:26,711
That's how our nation's conglomerates work.

162
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,075
Either way, it didn't work this time.

163
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:33,585
Find another way.

164
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,300
   

165
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,929
That old bastard!

166
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,342
What do you think you're doing right now?

167
00:12:57,342 --> 00:13:00,077
You can just stay quiet before you retire!

168
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:02,847
What the hell do you think you're doing?

169
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:06,550
Take a seat.

170
00:13:10,455 --> 00:13:14,325
The CEO of the agency got involved in raising the agency's sales.

171
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,926
Is there a problem with that?

172
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,885
Is this only about sales?

173
00:13:17,886 --> 00:13:19,263
This is between Senior Director Go and me.

174
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:22,676
This will decide which one of us will become the next CEO!

175
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,369
Why would you get involved in this fight?

176
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,013
That's cheating!

177
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:30,376
You've grown weak.

178
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:32,968
Seeing you go on about cheating.

179
00:13:32,968 --> 00:13:36,914
What you just did...

180
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,860
Now that we're on the subject.

181
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:44,118
If you want to become the next CEO, you should show your capabilities as well.

182
00:13:44,118 --> 00:13:44,990
What?

183
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:50,298
For the last six months, Senior Director Go increased sales by 50%.

184
00:13:50,298 --> 00:13:54,432
That means you should show something, too.

185
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,178
Why do I have to do what you tell me to?

186
00:14:07,178 --> 00:14:09,814
Where do you get off telling me what to do?

187
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:12,750
Hey, Senior Director Choi!

188
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:17,321
Your CEO is telling you to increase sales.

189
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:21,225
A mere senior director will refuse the CEO's orders?

190
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,031
I'll give you a month.

191
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:29,998
Increase sales by 30 billion won.

192
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:34,205
That's the least you can do if you want to be qualified to sit here.

193
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,509
Wait.

194
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,406
How can I suddenly do that?

195
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,509
Senior Director Choi.

196
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,582
Starting today, I'll teach you.

197
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:48,753
I'll show you how VC Group turned into a big conglomerate.

198
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:56,025
Get out. Get out and bring me results!

199
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,510
Are you kidding me right now?

200
00:15:18,116 --> 00:15:22,238
You wanted to keep your promise to Hanna, so you broke your promise to me?

201
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:24,023
Yeah.

202
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,024
The promise I made to Hanna came first.

203
00:15:28,393 --> 00:15:31,054
I made that promise in front of my friends.

204
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,496
I had to save face.

205
00:15:32,497 --> 00:15:35,594
Isn't the only face you have to save in front of your friends who dress better

206
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:38,870
or who is skinnier? Isn't that everything?

207
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:41,319
No matter how angry you are, aren't you being a bit harsh?

208
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,057
Why?

209
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:44,676
Are you trying to nitpick with me right now?

210
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:48,513
If you have to fight with Hanna, do it yourself!

211
00:15:48,513 --> 00:15:49,880
Don't bring me into it.

212
00:15:49,881 --> 00:15:56,183
As long as you've decided to marry me, there's no way you can't get in between Hanna and me, is there?

213
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:58,731
True.

214
00:15:58,732 --> 00:16:03,158
Those who hang out with Hanna are so simple-minded. You wouldn't understand that.

215
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,929
Are you done?

216
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,230
Yeah.

217
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,091
Don't kid yourself.

218
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,402
You're not the only son of VC Group.

219
00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:13,437
I decide whether my company will do ads or not!

220
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,188
You'll decide?

221
00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:18,175
Wasn't Hanna the one who made the decision?

222
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:22,680
When will you stop feeling inferior to Hanna?

223
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,305
I swear.

224
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:27,218
Are you trying to escape her by marrying me?

225
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,888
Are you doing it so you can finally beat her once?

226
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,428
Jerk.

227
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,897
You're so full of yourself.

228
00:16:39,897 --> 00:16:42,898
You pretend to be so smart.

229
00:16:42,898 --> 00:16:46,336
You don't know the difference between what you should and shouldn't say.

230
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:49,206
How could you say something like that to your fiancée?

231
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,212
I wouldn't have had to say it if you had acted properly.

232
00:16:54,212 --> 00:16:57,061
Live like other people.

233
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:59,151
Like a decent human being.

234
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:17,601
Yeah, I'll try to do that.

235
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:24,975
   

236
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,814
Vice President Kang Han Soo.

237
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,249
Are you drinking?

238
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,490
Of course.

239
00:17:33,491 --> 00:17:36,020
Where? There?

240
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,623
Of course.

241
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:39,658
Would I let loose in a place where there are many eyes watching?

242
00:17:39,661 --> 00:17:41,509
Wait.

243
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:43,094
I'm on my way.

244
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:44,576
You?

245
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:46,465
Here?

246
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,633
Why?

247
00:17:49,634 --> 00:17:51,936
I want to live like a human being, too.

248
00:17:51,936 --> 00:17:54,450
Han Soo, you're all grown up now.

249
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,948
Come on over.

250
00:17:55,948 --> 00:17:57,986
Welcome!

251
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:12,390
Yeah, get here right now.

252
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:15,293
When opportunity comes knocking, you grab it.

253
00:18:15,293 --> 00:18:18,228
- Get a few designs. 
 - Okay.

254
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:23,134
What's going on?

255
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:25,990
We have to do a presentation.

256
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,472
We have to raise the sales by 30 billion by the end of the month.

257
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:31,442
All of a sudden? Why?

258
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,136
Mr. Kwon will do the smaller projects.

259
00:18:41,137 --> 00:18:44,388
Jeong Seok, you'll be in charge of Wooseong Milk.

260
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,710
   

261
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,395
This is a 20 billion project. It's a high bill.

262
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,477
Milk consumption has suddenly dropped.

263
00:18:53,477 --> 00:18:55,299
They want to be aggressive with the marketing.

264
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:00,837
That's mainly due to the cost of milk and the consumers drinking more imported milk lately.

265
00:19:00,837 --> 00:19:02,540
We have to resolve that issue first.

266
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:07,842
No, we don't need that. Just do a sales promotion direction.

267
00:19:07,842 --> 00:19:12,298
Senior Director Yoo, we have a trump card, so don't worry about losing the presentation.

268
00:19:12,298 --> 00:19:13,984
Hey.

269
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,189
I'm just saying we should be positive about this.

270
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:28,399
Yeah, did you resolve it?

271
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:37,274
Of course, VC Communications is receiving help from VC Group.

272
00:19:37,274 --> 00:19:39,995
Of course. Yeah.

273
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:42,095
Okay.

274
00:19:42,095 --> 00:19:43,782
Yeah.

275
00:19:50,755 --> 00:19:53,824
Oh, I'm so exhausted.

276
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:56,860
Coming back to work is hard, right?

277
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,196
Why do we suddenly have to do a presentation?

278
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:01,598
Senior Director Go already increased sales.

279
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:02,826
Oh.

280
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,102
CEO Cho is making him...

281
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:13,277
Oh, boy. I guess we'll be working late for the time being.

282
00:20:13,278 --> 00:20:17,851
I hate working late. I'm so sick of it.

283
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:23,192
Well, we're going to be working late starting tomorrow.

284
00:20:23,193 --> 00:20:24,354
Do you want to get a drink?

285
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,357
We should take care of our health.

286
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,425
Oh, really?

287
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,370
Okay then.

288
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,880
I got a company card now that I'm an executive.

289
00:20:34,881 --> 00:20:36,433
What's the point?

290
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:39,770
I have no one to drink with.

291
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:43,307
Yeah, you go home and go to bed.

292
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:47,848
We did have the kick-off meeting today.

293
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:50,614
It'd be a shame not to drink. Right?

294
00:20:50,614 --> 00:20:51,516
Do you know a place?

295
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,105
Oh, of course!

296
00:20:54,105 --> 00:20:57,788
Well, shall I take you there?

297
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:16,674
Yoo Bin, isn't that Jo Yoo Na?

298
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,356
What's she doing here?

299
00:21:19,357 --> 00:21:22,379
She was so full of herself before.

300
00:21:23,581 --> 00:21:27,451
She's keeping low after she got a DUI.

301
00:21:27,451 --> 00:21:31,243
She needs a foothold too, if she wants to make a comeback.

302
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,125
Did the chairman of VC Group agree to help her?

303
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,539
Maybe.

304
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,862
That depends on her abilities.

305
00:21:45,203 --> 00:21:47,571
Did something bad happen?

306
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,308
Sort of.

307
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:52,109
Tell me about it.

308
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,078
Tell you?

309
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:58,230
Isn't it more comfortable to tell your problems to someone you don't know?

310
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,891
I'm very good at it.

311
00:22:10,695 --> 00:22:12,464
Alcohol.

312
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:23,307
I didn't get a DUI for nothing.

313
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,757
Not to mention.

314
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:33,241
Everything I hear under the influence, I can hardly ever remember.

315
00:22:33,241 --> 00:22:36,620
Who had the audacity to upset you?

316
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:39,062
Well,

317
00:22:39,062 --> 00:22:45,093
there are people who should do as they're told, but they don't listen.

318
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:50,233
Then I guess it's fate that we met tonight.

319
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:54,705
I do everything I'm told to do.

320
00:23:19,497 --> 00:23:22,332
I barely survived.

321
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:27,471
Now, I just need to pay back Kang Han Soo in kind.

322
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:43,320
 You can forget what the grand chairman said. 

323
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,022
 What? 

324
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,825
 He asked you to become a stress factor for Han Soo and Hanna. 

325
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:48,693
 Yes. 

326
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:51,161
 You don't need to concern yourself with that. 

327
00:23:51,162 --> 00:23:55,332
 I've promised to become that stress factor from now on. 

328
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:36,947
 I sleep so well since I moved here. 

329
00:24:36,947 --> 00:24:39,987
 I know it's shameless of me, but this is nice. 

330
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,410
   

331
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:48,463
That's a relief. At least one of us can sleep.

332
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:07,785
The person I must provide for...

333
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,367
really has become my driving force.

334
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:20,017
Change it for me!

335
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:24,159
How many times do I have to tell you no? Why would we change your name?

336
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,523
My friends make fun of me for my name.

337
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,392
What do they say?

338
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,393
They keep calling me a calf.

339
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:33,869
But Song Ah Ji is another way to say calf. How is that making fun of you?

340
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,533
What was your nickname growing up?

341
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,618
Me?

342
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,443
Mine was Minnow.

343
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:43,073
Hey, do you know what my nickname was when I was your age?

344
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:46,221
It was Row. They took Jo Jeong from Jo Eun Jeong, which means row.

345
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:48,411
Like this.

346
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:54,151
It's normal to make fun of others with their names at your age.

347
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,819
They come up with the strangest things.

348
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,687
But you're so lucky!

349
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,891
They didn't make anything up from your name.

350
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,525
How could you call that a nickname?

351
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,026
Are they really making fun of you?

352
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,297
Still!

353
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,940
Look.

354
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,805
The Ah in your name represents "I."

355
00:26:07,806 --> 00:26:11,267
Ji represents "Know." Ah Ji.

356
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:15,269
"To know thyself." That's so important.

357
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:16,688
Socrates said it once before.

358
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:18,408
"Know thyself!"

359
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,744
It's not about the meaning.

360
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:24,612
Anyway, you can't change your name. Why would we change the best name I've ever come up with?

361
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,508
Still, I hate it!

362
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:29,619
If I can't change my name, change my last name.

363
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,837
Your last name?

364
00:26:30,838 --> 00:26:34,933
If you want to change that... Hey, Husband.

365
00:26:34,933 --> 00:26:38,295
Your son is forcing me to get divorced.

366
00:26:38,295 --> 00:26:41,799
How could you say something ridiculous in front of him like that?

367
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:46,094
You saw that, right? I can't change your last name or first name. Bye!

368
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:57,280
Good morning!

369
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,715
Did something good happen to you?

370
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:00,817
We increased sales by 50%!

371
00:27:00,818 --> 00:27:03,553
I mean, people might think you did it on your own.

372
00:27:03,554 --> 00:27:07,224
Of course, since we did it together.

373
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:13,063
The eyebrows, fingernails, nose hairs, and the heart.

374
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:16,433
We all worked hard. Let's get something for lunch later.

375
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,201
Okay.

376
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:33,383
Oh, my back. Has working late hurt my back?

377
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:41,650
I need to live a healthy and long life.

378
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:44,710
   

379
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,167
- Good morning. 
 - You're here!

380
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,369
Why are you standing?

381
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:55,605
Oh, Senior Director Go bought me this desk.

382
00:27:55,606 --> 00:27:59,610
Standing while I work makes my back hurt less and I can focus more.

383
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:03,981
Oh, what a smart way to work! That's nice.

384
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:06,716
Is Senior Director Go in her office?

385
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:19,496
Congratulations.

386
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:22,933
I was able to resolve things with your help.

387
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:24,968
It's a win-win for me, too.

388
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:26,352
That's true.

389
00:28:26,353 --> 00:28:29,506
Since this is a win-win, you deserve to get something too.

390
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,341
What?

391
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,943
We have to bring someone back.

392
00:28:34,378 --> 00:28:36,980
Are you going to meet him yourself and persuade him?

393
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:40,016
No, why would I meet him?

394
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,953
You have to meet him yourself.

395
00:28:42,953 --> 00:28:46,256
Why would I meet someone who left me because they dislike me?

396
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,962
Why would you say something you don't mean?

397
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:55,310
Words like that.They won't help you at work.

398
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:59,460
Don't say anything if you have nothing to say and when you have something to say,

399
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,141
make sure you express yourself clearly.

400
00:29:04,675 --> 00:29:05,724
What is this?

401
00:29:05,724 --> 00:29:08,445
It sounds like you're teaching me a lesson.

402
00:29:08,445 --> 00:29:10,614
- Is that how you heard it? 
 - Yes.

403
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,427
You're right. I'm teaching you right now.

404
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,685
Why would you teach me?

405
00:29:15,686 --> 00:29:18,288
Because I made a promise.

406
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:20,905
Choose.

407
00:29:20,905 --> 00:29:24,094
Are you going to listen to me and get what you want?

408
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:28,064
Or are you going to let your pride get in the way and lose what you want?

409
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:33,617
Are you really giving me a choice? It sounds like you're forcing me to do something!

410
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:38,074
I'll promise you one thing, too.

411
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:38,976
What?

412
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:43,146
Starting now, I won't lie to you or use you.

413
00:29:43,146 --> 00:29:48,018
I'm going to teach you everything I can.

414
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,446
Then,

415
00:29:58,231 --> 00:30:00,497
what shall I do?

416
00:30:16,714 --> 00:30:19,183
 You have to show him that he's not your weakness. 

417
00:30:19,183 --> 00:30:20,717
 What weakness? 

418
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:25,121
 Mr. Park left because he thought of himself as your weakness. 

419
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:27,457
 He won't return no matter how much you try to persuade him. 

420
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:29,169
 Then shall I go and praise him? 

421
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:31,227
 "Mr. Park, you're the best! I need you!" 

422
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:32,685
 You call that persuasion? 

423
00:30:32,686 --> 00:30:35,565
 That would be teasing him. 

424
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:37,574
 Don't get worked up. 

425
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:40,224
 Don't show him your emotions. 

426
00:30:40,225 --> 00:30:42,295
 Say it with confidence. 

427
00:30:42,295 --> 00:30:44,341
 Say what? 

428
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,644
 "I need you. 

429
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:54,339
 In order to get what I want, I need you no matter what." 

430
00:31:39,096 --> 00:31:40,531
I'm not buying.

431
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:42,054
What are you doing? Are you messing with me?

432
00:31:42,055 --> 00:31:44,234
Why would you open and shut the door?

433
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,719
You were glaring at me like you would kill me. How could I let you in?

434
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,575
Open it.

435
00:32:17,868 --> 00:32:21,304
I came here to talk calmly. Why would you get me worked up?

436
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:32,982
What did you bring with you?

437
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:39,522
It's a gift. It's ice cream.

438
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,759
Don't tell me it's mint-choco.

439
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:44,994
It is.

440
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:49,130
You come to someone else's house, and bring what you want to eat. What kind of person does that?

441
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,438
That's because you have me enraged.

442
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:54,104
I was going to eat it while we talked. That's why I bought it.

443
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,678
Go ahead.

444
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:59,743
Eat it and cool off.

445
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,900
I'll be straightforward.

446
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:15,124
I need you.

447
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,313
I'll be straightforward, too.

448
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:21,612
As for me, I don't need you.

449
00:33:27,838 --> 00:33:31,819
 Don't get worked up when you talk to him. Be calm. 

450
00:33:31,819 --> 00:33:34,110
 Okay? 

451
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:40,213
 You need to be in a stable state. Only then will Mr. Park believe you and return. 

452
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:49,793
You're not my weakness.

453
00:33:49,793 --> 00:33:54,995
I acknowledge that I made a mistake. I went on about how I would change the world and society.

454
00:33:54,995 --> 00:34:00,233
I was immature. I learned a lot from this.

455
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:04,373
You can forget the old me.

456
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:07,714
I won't shout like I did before.

457
00:34:12,838 --> 00:34:15,680
   

458
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,354
 Are you someone who makes decisions? 

459
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:21,724
 You rude bastard, how dare you speak without permission? 

460
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:25,295
Mr. Park, what is that?

461
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,911
You could just forget about it!

462
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:45,348
How could you be so small-minded to hang this up and look at it?

463
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,698
Don't laugh! How can you laugh at a time like this?

464
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:55,792
But... didn't you say you wouldn't shout anymore?

465
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:58,628
That's only because you keep provoking me!

466
00:34:58,628 --> 00:35:00,350
That's what I'm saying.

467
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,532
You need to be calm when you work.

468
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,969
Can you have someone beside you that provokes you?

469
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:23,252
Just come back.

470
00:35:23,252 --> 00:35:28,791
Just come back and stay by my side.

471
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,766
For what reason?

472
00:35:37,558 --> 00:35:42,071
Because... I'm scared.

473
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:46,943
Is someone evaluating me?

474
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:50,213
Is someone planning to bring me down?

475
00:35:50,213 --> 00:35:52,418
Or something more.

476
00:35:53,332 --> 00:35:58,858
Without you, the office is so scary.

477
00:36:02,726 --> 00:36:04,430
Just come back to work.

478
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,896
I have a plan.

479
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:08,731
What is it?

480
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,503
- Huh? 
 - What's your plan?

481
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,640
Oh, that?

482
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,497
You don't have one, do you? You were just saying so, weren't you?

483
00:36:22,246 --> 00:36:24,360
Yeah, I don't have one!

484
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,548
It's the Kang family's specialty to create a mess and handle it!

485
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,763
That jerk! That jerk!

486
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,469
   

487
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,744
 You didn't change your number. 

488
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,114
No.

489
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,648
Did you meet Senior Director Kang?

490
00:36:58,648 --> 00:37:00,349
She just left.

491
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,119
Was she calm when she spoke to you?

492
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,168
Of course not.

493
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:09,292
Come back to work. There's a job you have to do with me.

494
00:37:09,292 --> 00:37:10,860
A job?

495
00:37:10,861 --> 00:37:15,398
Me, You, and Senior Director Kang.

496
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,635
The three of us have a common enemy.

497
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:20,403
Is it possible?

498
00:37:20,403 --> 00:37:24,173
Do I look like someone who would take on an impossible challenge?

499
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:26,176
Of course not.

500
00:37:26,176 --> 00:37:30,011
- We have to pay them back in kind. 
 - That's right.

501
00:37:30,011 --> 00:37:36,252
Just taking and not paying back wouldn't be polite.

502
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,021
I'm hanging up now.

503
00:38:19,863 --> 00:38:22,808
I didn't expect this.

504
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:25,068
I guess there is synergy.

505
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:39,183
   

506
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:43,286
Shall I start acting up now?

507
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:58,067
We'll be able to handle our money problems with this.

508
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:02,770
Consumers aren't drinking less milk, they're just turning to imported milk.

509
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,719
Yes.

510
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,960
They're drinking more cheap imported sterilized milk. It's one of the direct causes of the decline in sales.

511
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,216
Just like how the Korean Beef Association increased the quality of meat,

512
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:15,071
you want to use the strategy of upgrading the quality of domestic milk?

513
00:39:15,072 --> 00:39:17,403
There's nothing more important than fresh milk.

514
00:39:17,403 --> 00:39:20,210
Okay. Let's develop a character, too.

515
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:21,311
A character?

516
00:39:21,312 --> 00:39:24,525
Like those stickers. People buy bread to collect stickers.

517
00:39:24,525 --> 00:39:27,551
People are willing to make a new bank card if it has a pretty character on it.

518
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:30,020
If we can't differentiate the product,

519
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:33,123
we need another reason for the consumer to buy our product. Right?

520
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:35,758
Yes, Ma'am.

521
00:39:36,728 --> 00:39:38,276
Who wants coffee?

522
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,243
- Me. 
 - Me.

523
00:39:40,243 --> 00:39:44,566
Let me get a Blonde Caramel Double Shot Macchiato.

524
00:39:44,567 --> 00:39:48,404
Make it a venti.

525
00:39:48,404 --> 00:39:52,183
One Mint Chocolate Cold Foam Cold Brew.

526
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,511
Make that a tall.

527
00:39:54,511 --> 00:39:57,380
They should just drink regular coffee from a coffee shop.

528
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:59,217
What the heck is all of this?

529
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,324
   

530
00:40:01,324 --> 00:40:04,020
I'll come back to order again. Just a second.

531
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,127
Hey, Traitor.

532
00:40:06,127 --> 00:40:09,214
What? You're near my office?

533
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,708
Hey, Senior Director Yoo.

534
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:15,165
You look so handsome now.

535
00:40:15,166 --> 00:40:19,402
You look like you could be one of the Five Eulsa Traitors.

536
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,879
Well, you want to keep going?

537
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,255
Do you want to keep teasing me?

538
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:28,864
No, I'll stop. That's enough.

539
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:32,349
Either way, congratulations.

540
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:35,619
Nothing is more important than making a living.

541
00:40:38,055 --> 00:40:41,591
No one knows better than me.

542
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:45,795
What it's like trying to keep going after your company goes bankrupt

543
00:40:45,795 --> 00:40:49,199
and how terrifying payday is.

544
00:41:01,312 --> 00:41:03,613
Say it. I'm busy.

545
00:41:08,953 --> 00:41:10,788
You're doing a presentation for Wooseong Milk. Right?

546
00:41:10,788 --> 00:41:12,169
Yeah.

547
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:15,492
Jeong Min, drop out of the presentation.

548
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:17,074
Why?

549
00:41:21,832 --> 00:41:23,263
Tell me the truth.

550
00:41:23,264 --> 00:41:25,502
You're up to something, aren't you?

551
00:41:27,038 --> 00:41:29,540
 Of course. 

552
00:41:30,641 --> 00:41:32,275
 What is it? 

553
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:37,713
 Mr. Kwon, you upset me. 

554
00:41:37,713 --> 00:41:40,082
 Aren't you, me, and Chang Soo in the same boat? 

555
00:41:40,082 --> 00:41:43,194
 But Senior Director Choi told me to keep quiet about things that are off the record. 

556
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,722
 Hey, I'm in charge of the Wooseong Milk presentation! 

557
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:48,225
 You want me to do the presentation without any information? 

558
00:41:48,225 --> 00:41:50,057
 That's true. 

559
00:41:50,057 --> 00:41:52,695
 This is really off the record. 

560
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:59,369
 The group is going to help. 

561
00:42:06,744 --> 00:42:08,971
What is it? Tell me.

562
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:10,882
Just drop out of it. I'm saying it for you.

563
00:42:10,882 --> 00:42:13,202
For me?

564
00:42:14,249 --> 00:42:18,722
I can't say this about others, but you can't do this to me.

565
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,073
You set up an independent agency.

566
00:42:23,073 --> 00:42:25,331
You suffered at the hands of others and went bankrupt!

567
00:42:25,332 --> 00:42:27,297
How could you do this to me?

568
00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:34,137
I don't care what you have. Do whatever you want.

569
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:37,407
I'm confident in this presentation.

570
00:42:37,407 --> 00:42:39,302
Jeong Min, don't be stubborn.

571
00:42:39,302 --> 00:42:44,247
Hey! Do you know how many months I'm behind in paying my employees?

572
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:47,918
Do you know how much money I've spent on this presentation already?

573
00:42:49,854 --> 00:42:52,268
I'm going to keep going even if I starve.

574
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,057
Do whatever you want.

575
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:28,124
Senior, have you been well?

576
00:43:29,961 --> 00:43:32,263
What are you doing here, Deputy Park?

577
00:43:32,263 --> 00:43:35,644
What do you mean? I'm returning to work.

578
00:43:36,767 --> 00:43:39,102
You speak as if you were on vacation.

579
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:41,196
You're right.

580
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:44,541
I think I used all my vacation days for this year.

581
00:43:55,052 --> 00:43:56,853
What are you doing?

582
00:43:56,853 --> 00:43:58,122
Excuse me?

583
00:43:58,122 --> 00:44:00,578
Do you not know why I'm appointing you as the next vice-chairman

584
00:44:00,578 --> 00:44:03,260
without your grandfather knowing?

585
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:07,965
I'm doing this so you and Hanna will stop fighting.

586
00:44:07,965 --> 00:44:12,599
Do you want to fight with Hanna over Deputy Park coming back to work?

587
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:15,764
No, sir. I understand what you're saying.

588
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:20,511
The winner should have the dignity of one.

589
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:22,612
I was wrong.

590
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,818
Are you getting along with Seo Jeong?

591
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:31,554
Make sure you stay on good terms with her.

592
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:35,939
If you upset Chairman Woo Won, the whole thing will be called off.

593
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,627
Yes, Sir.

594
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,027
If you'll excuse me.

595
00:44:52,476 --> 00:44:54,653
What are you doing? Why are you here?

596
00:44:54,653 --> 00:44:56,045
You told me to come back to work.

597
00:44:56,046 --> 00:44:59,282
You acted like you'd never come back, you jerk!

598
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:02,586
I felt like I wasn't being polite.

599
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:05,989
To who? Me?

600
00:45:05,989 --> 00:45:08,959
No, to someone else.

601
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:13,373
You said you had a plan. Tell me what it is.

602
00:45:15,566 --> 00:45:18,067
I don't have it.

603
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:20,403
Then, who has it?

604
00:45:23,874 --> 00:45:26,643
I don't have a plan.

605
00:45:28,345 --> 00:45:33,316
I mean, I totally thought she'd have one.

606
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:34,884
Then make one right now.

607
00:45:34,885 --> 00:45:38,021
Do I look like an idea vending machine to you?

608
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:42,826
The right thing to do now is wait quietly.

609
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:44,060
They think they've won.

610
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:48,800
Right when you think it's over, that's when you make a mistake.

611
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,868
But it could become too late.

612
00:45:51,869 --> 00:45:55,305
If we make a clumsy attack, we could lose desperately.

613
00:45:55,306 --> 00:45:59,142
It's better to reassure the opponent by playing dead.

614
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,337
Wait.

615
00:46:03,185 --> 00:46:05,715
They'll definitely make a mistake.

616
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,676
Just three months!

617
00:46:08,676 --> 00:46:11,254
That's all the time we need to differentiate the freshness of Wooseong Milk,

618
00:46:11,255 --> 00:46:15,859
and showcase its unique premium value.

619
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:21,832
That brings the campaign proposal we've prepared to an end.

620
00:46:21,832 --> 00:46:24,267
Yes, that's it!

621
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,042
I'd like to offer one more suggestion.

622
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:37,481
They call these stickers.

623
00:46:37,481 --> 00:46:40,683
Just like how people bought bread to collect these stickers,

624
00:46:40,684 --> 00:46:43,820
I'd like to create a trend where consumers will buy Wooseong Milk

625
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,322
to collect these stickers.

626
00:46:46,322 --> 00:46:48,091
That's nice.

627
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:52,729
I will explain in more detail after the presentation.

628
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:56,266
That's all for our presentation. Thank you.

629
00:47:08,345 --> 00:47:13,082
Okay, last but not least, shall we see the presentation by VC Communications?

630
00:47:13,082 --> 00:47:16,185
We will use an aggressive and active campaign.

631
00:47:16,186 --> 00:47:19,088
We'll also recreate Wooseong Milk's corporate image

632
00:47:19,089 --> 00:47:23,526
while we expand the consumer base of domestic milk.

633
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:30,333
This is what we have prepared.

634
00:47:30,333 --> 00:47:32,902
By chance, are there any questions?

635
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:43,644
- If there are no questions. 
 - We'd like to offer another proposal as well.

636
00:47:56,763 --> 00:47:58,001
   

637
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,059
The purpose of this ad

638
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,433
is to increase the sales of Wooseong Milk.

639
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:06,869
- Is that correct? 
 - Yes.

640
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:09,839
If you do your ad with VC Communications,

641
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,443
there's not just a possibility that your sales will increase,

642
00:48:13,444 --> 00:48:18,248
but rather a promise that there will be an increase in sales.

643
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:21,951
How is that possible?

644
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:29,457
These are the affiliates of VC Group.

645
00:48:29,457 --> 00:48:33,196
If you work with us,

646
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:37,893
we'll make sure to provide Wooseong Milk

647
00:48:37,894 --> 00:48:40,202
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner

648
00:48:40,202 --> 00:48:44,240
in all the cafeterias of all our affiliate branches.

649
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:03,159
The number of cafeterias under the group

650
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,628
and details regarding the number of people who eat there

651
00:49:05,629 --> 00:49:09,666
will be explained after the presentation is over.

652
00:49:19,343 --> 00:49:23,112
The truth is... your proposal was far better.

653
00:49:23,113 --> 00:49:26,783
So can you hand over your proposal to VC communications?

654
00:49:27,718 --> 00:49:29,852
We'll take care of you for next year's presentation.

655
00:49:29,853 --> 00:49:32,780
I assume you'll agree to it.

656
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:37,380
   

657
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:40,650
   

658
00:49:50,808 --> 00:49:52,928
Jeong Min.

659
00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:56,679
I'll drive.

660
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:00,804
I'm sorry.

661
00:50:00,804 --> 00:50:02,929
I knew we had something up our sleeve,

662
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,451
but I didn't know it was this bad.

663
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,964
Life is so hard.

664
00:50:16,111 --> 00:50:19,002
I'm sure others might not know, but you do. Right?

665
00:50:22,206 --> 00:50:26,643
You were right. I was foolish.

666
00:50:28,712 --> 00:50:32,383
If I want to survive in this nation, I shouldn't raise my head high.

667
00:50:32,383 --> 00:50:35,051
I should've just stayed under someone strong. Right?

668
00:50:35,052 --> 00:50:36,986
Jeong Min!

669
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:43,793
Have a good life.

670
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:25,195
Ah In! Go to Jeong Min's office right now!

671
00:51:25,195 --> 00:51:27,016
 Hurry! 

672
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:45,121
 - She'll get the proposal. Right? 
 - Of course. 

673
00:51:45,121 --> 00:51:47,857
 Do you think we'll get paid this month? 

674
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:49,358
 It's been three months. 

675
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,694
 She can't pay us because she doesn't have the money. 

676
00:51:51,695 --> 00:51:53,763
 I bet we'll get paid when we get this proposal. 

677
00:51:53,764 --> 00:51:57,066
 - Yeah, we can do this! 
 - We got this! 

678
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:19,791
 Going up. 

679
00:52:21,278 --> 00:52:23,526
 The doors are closing. 

680
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:21,698
Whoa!

681
00:53:28,025 --> 00:53:29,859
What are you doing?

682
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:39,768
What do you think you're doing?

683
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:42,738
- I came here to watch. 
 - What?

684
00:53:42,739 --> 00:53:45,106
Originally, I came to tease you.

685
00:53:45,106 --> 00:53:47,076
I heard you lost the proposal.

686
00:53:47,076 --> 00:53:48,844
You little brat!

687
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:03,039
Just go.

688
00:54:13,203 --> 00:54:15,337
Go!

689
00:54:18,275 --> 00:54:20,115
Because of you,

690
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:24,109
I can't die!

691
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:31,521
Why are you doing this to me?

692
00:54:32,623 --> 00:54:38,009
What do you all expect from me? Well?

693
00:54:48,305 --> 00:54:50,406
I don't expect anything.

694
00:54:50,407 --> 00:54:53,189
If you're going to die,

695
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:56,278
let's make sure you look good at least.

696
00:55:04,454 --> 00:55:07,256
Ugh, it won't come off.

697
00:55:15,699 --> 00:55:20,169
Hey. How is this going to make me look good?

698
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:23,406
I said I'd buy you alcohol, not food.

699
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:36,128
Major companies only give business to affiliates and agencies.

700
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:40,022
Companies without agencies that are large and stable

701
00:55:40,022 --> 00:55:43,412
and big conglomerates only work with major agencies.

702
00:55:43,412 --> 00:55:48,603
The few projects that do come out are all stolen by major companies.

703
00:55:48,603 --> 00:55:51,300
How are we supposed to live?

704
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:55,571
The advertising industry in Korea is already over.

705
00:55:55,571 --> 00:55:58,174
What can we do about it? That's life.

706
00:56:04,181 --> 00:56:08,150
There are no parents who want their children to work for agencies.

707
00:56:09,352 --> 00:56:11,402
After graduation,

708
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:14,957
they tell their kids to choose stable jobs like being a teacher

709
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:18,427
or working at a bank.

710
00:56:18,427 --> 00:56:20,229
Why did you choose this line of work?

711
00:56:20,229 --> 00:56:22,119
It gets paid a lot.

712
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:26,602
I also heard you could get promoted on skills alone in this line of work.

713
00:56:27,871 --> 00:56:29,816
Yeah, right!

714
00:56:29,816 --> 00:56:32,341
Who told you that?

715
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:38,027
You don't regret it?

716
00:56:38,027 --> 00:56:40,083
Who has the time to regret?

717
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:44,568
I have a mountain of work in front of me, and I don't have the time to do it all.

718
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:54,029
How will I live now?

719
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:56,647
Don't ask yourself that.

720
00:56:56,647 --> 00:56:58,481
Just live.

721
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,769
One day at a time.

722
00:57:00,769 --> 00:57:02,588
Whatever.

723
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:05,608
You only live for tomorrow.

724
00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:15,384
Go here.

725
00:57:20,791 --> 00:57:23,893
What is this? I can't see anymore.

726
00:57:23,893 --> 00:57:26,621
   

727
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,865
What kind of name is that?

728
00:57:28,865 --> 00:57:31,110
Make sure you go.

729
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:33,903
I'm going to check to make sure you went.

730
00:57:35,772 --> 00:57:37,487
Okay?

731
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:46,960
♫  When the world turns its back  ♫

732
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,050
♫  Tell me, "I'm on your side"  ♫

733
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:07,900
♫  When an anxious tomorrow hurts you, tell me  ♫

734
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:10,960
What's this?

735
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,890
He wasn't here?

736
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:20,830
♫  Love yourself and believe myself  ♫

737
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:24,040
♫  I know everything but there are times when I don't  ♫

738
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:28,840

♫   to know me  ♫

744
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:56,585
Yeah, are you in front of the bar?

745
00:58:56,585 --> 00:59:00,027
What are you doing? Why did you decide to come back to work?

746
00:59:00,027 --> 00:59:04,077
I'm sure you noticed. I have something to do.

747
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:05,537
I've only come back temporarily.

748
00:59:05,537 --> 00:59:09,782
What do you have to do? Why did you come back?

749
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:11,997
I received something.

750
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:15,430
I forgot to pay it back.

751
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:19,153
Where are you now? Let's meet and talk.

752
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:21,390
Ah In?

753
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:23,192
Yes?

754
00:59:24,848 --> 00:59:27,783
I'm appearing on TV today.

755
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:28,832
What?

756
00:59:28,832 --> 00:59:30,979
I'm going to be on the news tonight.

757
00:59:30,979 --> 00:59:32,649
Make sure you watch.

758
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:36,057
Jeong Seok, what do you mean?

759
00:59:36,057 --> 00:59:39,360
Where are you? I'll be right there!

760
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:44,430
♫  Tell me that I became your strength on this tiring day  ♫

761
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:48,240
♫  Tell me  ♫

762
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,830
♫  Please tell me  ♫

763
00:59:53,530 --> 00:59:59,280
   

764
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,413
Thanks. It worked out well thanks to you.

765
01:00:02,413 --> 01:00:04,720
Let's make things easier.

766
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,473
Oh, man.

767
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:10,626
Hey, about CEO Cho. Why is he suddenly this energetic?

768
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:12,342
I don't know.

769
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:15,541
I don't know what he's up to with the grand chairman.

770
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:19,369
 This is quite shocking. 

771
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:22,805
 Are you saying things like this happen often? 

772
01:00:22,805 --> 01:00:23,932
 Yes. 

773
01:00:23,933 --> 01:00:28,110
 It even happened this afternoon during a proposal with Wooseong Milk. 

774
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,230
 If the ad was given to VC Communications, 

775
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:33,348
 an offer was made to provide Wooseong Milk 

776
01:00:33,348 --> 01:00:36,285
 in all the cafeterias affiliated with the group. 

777
01:00:36,286 --> 01:00:39,789
 We were able to win the proposal with that offer. 

778
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:43,459
 That's a difficult offer to refuse for the advertiser. 

779
01:00:43,459 --> 01:00:45,167
 That's right. 

780
01:00:45,167 --> 01:00:47,796
With the quantity that VC Group purchases alone,

781
01:00:47,797 --> 01:00:49,865
the advertiser will reach their advertising goal.

782
01:00:49,866 --> 01:00:50,933
I see.

783
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:55,104
What type of idea do you need in a situation like this?

784
01:00:55,105 --> 01:00:57,172
What kind of competition is this?

785
01:00:57,173 --> 01:01:00,442
If that's the case, this might be a question that's difficult to answer.

786
01:01:00,443 --> 01:01:05,414
Who was in charge of this at VC Communications?

787
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,673
I was.

788
01:01:19,796 --> 01:01:22,718
I, Executive Creative Director Yoo Jeong Seok,

789
01:01:22,718 --> 01:01:25,234
 did this along with Chief Project Officer Choi Chang Soo. 

790
01:01:25,234 --> 01:01:28,970
 We worked on it together. 

791
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:31,840
 I bet it wasn't easy for you to come on here. 

792
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:35,010
 May I ask you why you decided to? 

793
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:37,746
People like me and Senior Director Choi Chang Soo...

794
01:01:42,852 --> 01:01:47,513
are useless in this industry, and they should get rid of us quickly.

795
01:01:52,429 --> 01:01:54,664
 We need to get rid of useless things at work. 

796
01:01:54,664 --> 01:01:57,372
 Why am I useless? 

797
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,440
Yes?

798
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,320
Oh, yes. No, not at all.

799
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,918
I knew nothing of this.

800
01:02:37,928 --> 01:02:42,611
Did you lie to me and come back to the company to do this?

801
01:02:53,589 --> 01:02:57,286
   

802
01:02:57,286 --> 01:03:00,629
 Don't believe only what you see. 

803
01:03:00,629 --> 01:03:05,767
 Don't look at the fishing rod, look at the bait. 

804
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:11,380
 Is it revenge if you use yourself as the bait? 

805
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:13,508
 That's self-destruction. 

806
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,714
Why haven't you gone home yet?

807
01:03:22,753 --> 01:03:24,954
I found something strange.

808
01:03:24,954 --> 01:03:25,888
What is it?

809
01:03:25,889 --> 01:03:30,325
I got a call earlier that they decided on the brand model for VC Construction.

810
01:03:34,364 --> 01:03:37,733
She was keeping low because she got a DUI last year.

811
01:03:37,733 --> 01:03:40,969
But now they want to use her as the brand model?

812
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:43,739
They decided on this at VC Construction?

813
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:46,178
No, I looked into it since it was strange.

814
01:03:46,178 --> 01:03:51,811
Headquarters signed a contract with her, and then they notified VC Construction.

815
01:03:59,822 --> 01:04:02,123
Look at this.

816
01:04:02,123 --> 01:04:05,370
He made a mistake right on time.

817
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:12,370


818
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:18,810
It's almost time for our king to fall off his horse.

819
01:04:23,847 --> 01:04:29,930
   

820
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:36,650
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

821
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:42,850
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

822
01:04:42,850 --> 01:04:48,100
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

823
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:52,910
♫  So I will make my road  ♫

824
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:54,476
 We need to make our move. 

825
01:04:54,476 --> 01:04:56,579
 A love triangle? 

826
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:58,814
 Don't you know it's all over if Chairman Woo Won objects? 

827
01:04:58,814 --> 01:05:00,382
 I'll take care of it. 

828
01:05:00,382 --> 01:05:04,817
 I'll meet Jo Yoo Na's CEO, and make him say that Go Ah In wine and dined him. 

829
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:08,855
 There's someone who has to leave the company anyway, can't we put this on him? 

830
01:05:08,855 --> 01:05:10,826
 We'll know once we try. 

831
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:15,495
 We prepared strategically. So, it's my turn to act mad. 

832
01:05:15,495 --> 01:05:17,180
 Don't look for a way. 

833
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:21,300
 If you succeed, other people will call that the right way, too. 

834
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:23,305
 There'll be a big blow from public backlash. 

835
01:05:23,306 --> 01:05:26,960
 That's what people thought? 

836
01:05:27,975 --> 01:05:30,150
 Why would other people decide my limits? 

837
01:05:30,150 --> 01:05:36,340
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
