1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,521
I'll make sure Ah In doesn't find out. I'll just clean and disappear.

2
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:12,509
So, please. Please, just this once.

3
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,682
I beg of you. Please.

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,497
What are you doing?

5
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,519
What are you doing in my office now?

6
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:07,834
   

7
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:14,880


8
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,245
What did she do wrong?

9
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,050
Did she steal something?

10
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,320
    
 She was on her knees in front of you.

11
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,256
What could she have done wrong? At work, no less!

12
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,098
I left you alone when Senior Director Choi was using you for his dirty work.

13
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,368
Are you learning from him now?

14
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,291
She came here to work. Did she come here for your power trip?

15
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,009
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,081
What are you apologizing for? Tell me what this is about!

17
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,334
   

18
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,336
Dad, aren't you home right now?

19
00:02:17,336 --> 00:02:18,371
I'm at home.

20
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:20,906
Then why are you calling me? I'll be right down.

21
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,409
Do you want to go somewhere with me today?

22
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:25,844
- Where? 
 - Let's get some air.

23
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:28,614
What are you talking about? I'm about to go to work.

24
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:32,919
Sure. I have something to tell you, too.

25
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,988
Get ready and come down.

26
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,027
Ugh, come on.

27
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,630
He could've told me before I got ready. Now I have to change again.

28
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,272
Did you call for me?

29
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:54,841
Sit down.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,561
What are you doing?

31
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,063
- Pardon? 
 - Take it.

32
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,633
Yes, Sir.

33
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,808
I heard your mother bought you some shoes.

34
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,610
Yes.

35
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,345
What did you buy for her?

36
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:34,247
I haven't bought her anything yet.

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,618
This is why there's no use in raising children.

38
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,721
I put 500,000 won in there.

39
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,527
Thank you.

40
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,497
Buy your mother some shoes.

41
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:54,700
Buy some beef and visit home.

42
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,571
Is that not enough? Well, is it?

43
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,274
No, Sir. It's more than enough.

44
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,784
Sir? Since we're speaking, may I say something?

45
00:04:14,784 --> 00:04:16,689
Sure.

46
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,526
I don't think I'm ready to be promoted to an executive position.

47
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:22,962
I'm still lacking.

48
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,381
This is the first time I saw anyone turn down a promotion.

49
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:28,534
You don't want it?

50
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:30,135
- No. 
 - Why?

51
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:33,839
I believe the right person suited for that position should sit there.

52
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,910
And you're not suited for the position?

53
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,177
No. I could never be that person.

54
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:47,254
It seems that Hanna thinks differently.

55
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:51,457
But this is my promotion.

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,596
I don't want to have to become someone else to be promoted.

57
00:04:57,596 --> 00:04:59,733
What if you're still promoted?

58
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:04,670
I can make the decision that the position isn't suited for me.

59
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,744
Then I'll have to leave it.

60
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,586
Yeah, I understand.

61
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:24,824
Hanna's not going to work today, so you should take the day off too.

62
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,959
Thank you.

63
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,928
You work too hard.

64
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,452
Since he doesn't want it, it makes me want to promote him more.

65
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,754
Ride beside me.

66
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,722
Where's Deputy Park?

67
00:05:56,722 --> 00:05:58,858
I gave him the day off.

68
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,028
What? So you're going to drive?

69
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,874
Why are you grabbing that?

70
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:15,975
Because I'm nervous.

71
00:06:15,975 --> 00:06:17,643
What's there to be nervous about?

72
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,946
This is the first time I'm riding a car that you're driving!

73
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:21,981
It's not the first!

74
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,550
When was the last time you drove?

75
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:29,753
Hey, come on. I used to drive a stick in the past!

76
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:31,691
That's why I'm nervous!

77
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:36,007
If you drove stick, that means you drove in the eighties and haven't since!

78
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,598
We could've gone with Deputy Park. Why would you drive and make me nervous?

79
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:43,835
- Are you like this when you're with Deputy Park? 
 - Like what?

80
00:06:43,835 --> 00:06:47,673
You're being so loud that I can't focus on my driving!

81
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:50,711
So, why would you do something you have to focus on?

82
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:54,013
You could ask someone who's better at this to do it and not have to focus yourself!

83
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,452
 Compared to last year's sales, VC Group has seen a two percent decrease. 

84
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:04,156
 China's consumer market... 

85
00:07:04,156 --> 00:07:08,525
I can't have a quiet day. No one leaves me alone for more than an hour.

86
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,537
I organized the proposals and sent them to the advertisers.

87
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,773
They wanted to go with Eun Jeong's idea.

88
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,108
Which proposal?

89
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,311
The one where you reunite a family member with their late daughter through VR?

90
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,046
Yes.

91
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,150
It's best to forget about lost things. But that's not easy.

92
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,837
That's right. It's hard to forget about trivial matters.

93
00:07:35,837 --> 00:07:38,791
But if what you lost was a child, that would be tough.

94
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,595
Anyhow, since it's for a fire insurance company,

95
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,397
car accidents have relevance so the advertiser must've liked it.

96
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:47,166
Yes, they want to start the PPM and the shoot.

97
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:52,803
Okay. Since we're not going to decorate this, let's try to make it as natural as possible on-site.

98
00:07:52,803 --> 00:07:55,041
Still, we'll need at least one line for a copy, right?

99
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,942
Most likely. As for the concept,

100
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:03,282
"The people we have to meet in order to say goodbye."

101
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:05,117
Don't spill the main copy but bring it together.

102
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,619
I'll make sure it doesn't stand out too much.

103
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,589
Start it quickly. Byeong Soo, I want to talk to you.

104
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,701
I want to get rid of her.

105
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,102
Who?

106
00:08:23,102 --> 00:08:24,904
My assistant.

107
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,930
   

108
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,265
Does she still report to Senior Director Choi?

109
00:08:53,265 --> 00:08:55,067
I don't think she has been doing it lately.

110
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:58,438
Don't be obvious for now and ask human resources about it.

111
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,108
You only come when I ask you to.

112
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,777
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:06,145
Why do you even get a paycheck?

114
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,582
You didn't report to me when Deputy Park stopped by.

115
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,085
I'm sure Kang Hanna came, too.

116
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,220
The thing is...

117
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,650
I'm sorry.

118
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:23,560
Do you want to quit? Shall I fire you now?

119
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:27,298
- What? 
 - Quit if you don't want to do it anymore.

120
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,936
Do what I ask you.

121
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,072
There are plenty of others who are willing to do so to become full-time employees.

122
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:42,115
Get out if you don't want to do what I ask you.

123
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,562
I have something to tell you.

124
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,377
Soo Jeong?

125
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,915
What are you doing in the Project Department?

126
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,118
Ah... that...

127
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:23,756
The bathroom near the Creative Team Office was completely packed.

128
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,492
I should go.

129
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,604
The women's restroom is that way.

130
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,078
Then how about we make it a little smaller?

131
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:49,547
Yeah, put that inside. Doesn't that look okay, too?

132
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:50,850
There's no reflection.

133
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,185
Oh, I think we're going to have to make it a little smaller. It has to go inside of that.

134
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:57,591
I think that position is good.

135
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,092
What are you doing?

136
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,794
What do you mean?

137
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:05,829
This mysterious touch of emotion. Is this strange?

138
00:11:05,829 --> 00:11:08,468
No, it's not strange.

139
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,137
Just keep up the good work.

140
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:15,541
There are a lot of things that don't go your way in life.

141
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:24,250
Next.

142
00:11:25,586 --> 00:11:29,555
I guess Jang Woo was only destined to work hard.

143
00:11:33,327 --> 00:11:38,862
In order to increase followers in a short period of time, it's best to lean to one side.

144
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:43,603
Really? Does Senior Director Kang Hanna do that?

145
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:48,174
Feel free to speak.

146
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:50,944
You all know more about this than I do.

147
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:53,779
What's the biggest problem?

148
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:55,448
There's no content.

149
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:57,116
Content?

150
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:01,220
Senior Director Kang Hanna is the content in her social media.

151
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,490
But that's not the case when it comes to Vice President Kang Han Soo.

152
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,661
That's ironic.

153
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,764
You start social media to raise your recognition.

154
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:16,469
But you must be recognized in order to increase followers.

155
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,471
I have a good idea.

156
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,672
What is it?

157
00:12:19,672 --> 00:12:21,808
Let's start a dating scandal with a top model.

158
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:24,910
That will solve his recognition issue right away.

159
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,948
He has a fiancée but you want to start a scandal?

160
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:33,152
I apologize.

161
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:38,456
Are there ideas you haven't shown me after you showed him?

162
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,694
Yes, Sir.

163
00:12:40,694 --> 00:12:44,264
Send all of them to me.

164
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,873
Do you want me to toast some marshmallows that you like?

165
00:12:52,873 --> 00:12:55,240
- No. 
 - Why not?

166
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,276
I'll get fat.

167
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:02,047
Whenever I look at you, I don't want to earn money.

168
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,684
Why?

169
00:13:03,684 --> 00:13:05,419
What's the point?

170
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:09,822
My kid won't eat anything so all that's left of her are skin and bones.

171
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:17,260
Then go into my closet. Then you'll feel like you need to make a lot of money!

172
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,134
You said you wanted to tell me something.

173
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,470
Yeah.

174
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,205
What?

175
00:13:27,508 --> 00:13:29,576
I'm going to go on a blind date.

176
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:31,711
With who?

177
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:34,647
Him. Ulsanbawi Rock.

178
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,318
 No! 

179
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:39,488
 You're done studying and you work at the company now. 

180
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:41,953
 - It's time to marry! 
 - He's Han Soo's friend! 

181
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:46,359
 Is there a man among any of your prospects that Han Soo doesn't know? 

182
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,594
 There is. Men you don't know! 

183
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:51,065
 If I don't know them, they're probably not worth knowing! 

184
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,565
 Who cares if they're from nice families? They're all blockheads! 

185
00:13:53,565 --> 00:13:55,235
 What do you mean by blockheads? 

186
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,637
 He got his MBA from the States, too. 

187
00:13:57,638 --> 00:13:58,839
 Do you think he did that? 

188
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:01,241
 I'm sure his tutoring team got it for him! 

189
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,843
 Then what about you? What makes you different? 

190
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:05,446
 That's what I'm saying. I'm a blockhead too. 

191
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:09,482
 If my husband's also a blockhead, what will happen to our kid? 

192
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:13,585
 A blockhead born between two blockheads. 

193
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,656
 What do you think will come out if his family and our family combine? 

194
00:14:16,657 --> 00:14:18,958
 We'll have the biggest blockhead in the country! 

195
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,828
 Is that a person? It'll be Ulsanbawi Rock! 

196
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:23,964
 Then what will you do? 

197
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,330
 I'm going to live with a self-made man. 

198
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,768
 You don't have to worry about it! 

199
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,720
You'll really go on a blind date with him?

200
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,013
Yeah.

201
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:52,525
Blowing on the smoke will only sting your eyes.

202
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:54,427
What are you saying?

203
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,234
There's an easy path.

204
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,702
Why do you want to go down the hard path?

205
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:10,109
Hanna, can we live like this from now on?

206
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:13,413
Let's forget about work or business.

207
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:17,284
Let's use the money we have and live in peace.

208
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:20,620
Living with good people in a good place

209
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:23,356
while eating what we what. What do you think?

210
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:26,893
Do you not like doing business?

211
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:30,229
Yeah, I hate it.

212
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,298
I'm sick of this life, too.

213
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,703
I'm a lot different from your grandfather.

214
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:53,853
Don't do business.

215
00:15:53,854 --> 00:15:56,690
It'd be nice to live with a self-made man, right?

216
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,260
Who?

217
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:06,830
Someone who's always with you that will take your side.

218
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:22,340
♫  Is what you see, everything?  ♫

219
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,717
You won't do as I say, will you?

220
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,760
You already knew that.

221
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,350
♫  I'm lost in thought  ♫

222
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:31,624
Yeah, do whatever you want.

223
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,693
Go on the blind date if you want.

224
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:37,964
Just don't push yourself too hard.

225
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:40,533
Tell me if you're having a hard time.

226
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:44,838
There's only one thing I want from you.

227
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,674
Just one.

228
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:50,610
What is it?

229
00:16:52,713 --> 00:16:54,981
That you won't live like me.

230
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,818
Kang Hanna of the Kang family,

231
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:02,587
I just want you to be happy.

232
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,850
♫  The wind is cold today 

233
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,340
♫  No matter how much I try to tie up  ♫

234
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,720
♫  the heartache and pain

236

239
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:50,890
♫  Still, take one more step... again  ♫

240
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,789
 Since yesterday, did you learn anything new? 

241
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,525
 I know that the two of you paid a visit to the district ward office. 

242
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,961
 We see him every day. He's like family. 

243
00:18:14,962 --> 00:18:17,230
 I can't wait. Good luck to you. 

244
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,132
 You work so hard. 

245
00:18:20,534 --> 00:18:23,803
Everyone who could know already knew.

246
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:30,043
When I was hired by this big conglomerate,

247
00:18:32,646 --> 00:18:35,581
my mom was so happy then.

248
00:18:52,032 --> 00:18:57,036
Ta-da! The breadwinner of this family got off work on the dot today!

249
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:05,378
Mother? What is this?

250
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,830
She could've called if she was going to have dinner at home.

251
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,931
She's always like that.

252
00:19:24,932 --> 00:19:28,268
Mom's here! We get to eat meat!

253
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,338
Are you happy I'm home?

254
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,874
All the vegetable side dishes turn into meat when I'm home, right?

255
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:34,841
Yeah!

256
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:38,879
Do you like that we get to buy meat with the money I get paid at work?

257
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:42,588
Yeah! Wait, no!

258
00:19:42,588 --> 00:19:45,983
What do you mean? You don't like meat?

259
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:47,320
I like meat.

260
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:51,124
That means you like that I go to work.

261
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:52,493
I'm right.

262
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:56,229
If you like meat, a salary is a good thing!

263
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:59,699
In other words, you like that I work!

264
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:06,505
Not at all.

265
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:10,274
How so? It's perfectly proven by syllogism.

266
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:14,080
That's not what I mean.

267
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:21,519
Okay! Fine. Then prove to me otherwise.

268
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,830
This time.

269
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:35,234
I'll dip it in the oil.

270
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,170
One bite.

271
00:20:46,547 --> 00:20:49,180
Do you want to eat it? That's work.

272
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,986
That's not the same thing.

273
00:20:50,986 --> 00:20:56,189
Really? That's the last piece of meat in this house.

274
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,127
Hey, you should act like a mother.

275
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:02,094
Why are you teasing him with food?

276
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:05,665
Mother, kids need to know that not everything in life is for free.

277
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:07,433
Choose.

278
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:11,271
Do you want to live your life eating only vegetables with an unemployed mom?

279
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:15,241
Or do you want to live your life eating meat with a working mom?

280
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:44,171
There you go! Game over!

281
00:21:44,171 --> 00:21:47,608
You approve of your mom going to work now!

282
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:51,210
You'd better not go back on your word, got it?

283
00:21:52,212 --> 00:21:53,846
Okay?

284
00:21:59,186 --> 00:22:01,354
Ah Ji, why are you crying?

285
00:22:01,354 --> 00:22:03,423
I hate myself.

286
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:04,825
Why?

287
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,429
I hate the idea of you going to work.

288
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:14,330
But the meat! It tastes so good.

289
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,962
I'm sorry about yesterday. It was all my fault.

290
00:22:41,962 --> 00:22:44,965
I didn't tell her.

291
00:22:44,965 --> 00:22:46,916
Yes, I know.

292
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:50,069
If you had, she would've said something.

293
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:53,207
But doesn't she deserve to know?

294
00:22:53,207 --> 00:22:55,909
A person should have shame.

295
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:59,011
I'm going to quit after a week.

296
00:22:59,012 --> 00:23:02,014
I'm a nuisance to you, too.

297
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:06,919
I'm sorry, and thank you.

298
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:25,137
We gave the advertiser a PPM this morning, and there were no edits.

299
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:26,239
What time is the shoot tomorrow?

300
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,840
The staff will get there at 7. I think you could get there by 8.

301
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,913
Director Jang, how's your VR shoot?

302
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:37,350
I have a team that has done a lot of VR shoots, so they're good.

303
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,653
What about the model? I bet she's nervous.

304
00:23:39,653 --> 00:23:42,823
Mr. Han and I are going to pick her up tomorrow.

305
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:47,557
Okay, let's do that. Mr. Han, come see me.

306
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,533
What happened?

307
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:57,270
She's a contract worker so it won't be difficult.

308
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:02,041
Okay. Let's settle things after the shoot tomorrow.

309
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,345
But is this because she keeps reporting to Senior Director Choi?

310
00:24:05,345 --> 00:24:06,480
What do you mean?

311
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,416
It looked like she was coming out of his office before.

312
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,390
It's for the best.

313
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:21,060
Still, don't tell HR about Senior Director Choi.

314
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,429
It'll be hard for her to find another job as a secretary if word got out.

315
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:25,298
Of course. That would be fatal.

316
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:27,767
Just tell them that she's not a good fit for me.

317
00:24:27,768 --> 00:24:29,869
Yes, Ma'am.

318
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:39,371
 Senior Director, have you stopped coming to my restaurant because you're a big shot now? 

319
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:47,588
Hey! Are you that big of a deal? Well?

320
00:24:47,588 --> 00:24:51,457
I think you've had too much. Please, come back another time.

321
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:56,262
He used to be a big shot making ads, but look at him now!

322
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:58,898
He sits here alone every day and he never has customers.

323
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:01,434
We brought you some business because we felt bad for you!

324
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:05,037
Let's go. I'll never come back!

325
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,507
I'll take care of you next time, Sir!

326
00:25:17,117 --> 00:25:18,118
It's been a long time.

327
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,955
Sit down.

328
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:05,731
Why are you here?

329
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,234
Have a drink.

330
00:26:09,102 --> 00:26:12,138
We don't have that type of relationship.

331
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:21,178
Things were bad only towards the end. But we were hired at the same time.

332
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:22,381
Do you remember?

333
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:27,718
When we were fresh hires, we cried over a bottle of soju in the parking lot.

334
00:26:27,718 --> 00:26:30,456
Don't speak nonsense.

335
00:26:31,959 --> 00:26:33,793
Just go.

336
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,533
I'm sorry.

337
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:47,039
Life is hard.

338
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,016
   

339
00:26:58,318 --> 00:27:00,186
Take it.

340
00:27:02,923 --> 00:27:04,191
Yes, hello?

341
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:06,492
 What are you going to do about the rent? 

342
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:09,295
 You lost your deposit, too! 

343
00:27:09,997 --> 00:27:13,599
Yes, I'm sorry. I'll settle it soon.

344
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,703
   

345
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,746
Yes, I'm sorry. I understand.

346
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,583
   

347
00:27:31,852 --> 00:27:34,287
Hey! What are you trying to do?

348
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:40,323
Things might have been bad between us towards the end, but what are friends for?

349
00:27:40,323 --> 00:27:43,262
Use this money to put out some of your fires.

350
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:46,599
Hey, why would I accept your money for no reason?

351
00:27:47,234 --> 00:27:49,302
There's a reason.

352
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:56,642
I have a plan I want to propose to you.

353
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,180
   

354
00:28:12,192 --> 00:28:15,094
He's the one that called me here. Where did he go?

355
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,648
   

356
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:10,314
 Is something wrong? I waited for you. I'm leaving now. 

357
00:29:22,062 --> 00:29:26,099
Money is so scary.

358
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,201
It's scary.

359
00:29:38,545 --> 00:29:41,582
   

360
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,561
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:55,462 --> 00:30:00,633
Forgive me just this once.

362
00:30:31,064 --> 00:30:32,432
Thank you for everything.

363
00:30:32,432 --> 00:30:35,668
Is today really your last day?

364
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,872
She has a shoot today so she won't be coming to the office.

365
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:44,510
I have to go somewhere right now.

366
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:48,514
Yes, go ahead. Thank you.

367
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:21,048
Yeah, I stopped by the office, so I'm going to be a little late.

368
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:26,382
Okay, take your time. We're on our way to pick up the model.

369
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:28,087
Okay.

370
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,982
What are you doing?

371
00:31:58,252 --> 00:32:01,553
What did you put in your pocket?

372
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:04,323
It was nothing.

373
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:06,826
Take out what you put in your pocket.

374
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,665
Now I know why my secretary acted this way.

375
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:15,601
Give me what you were trying to steal.

376
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,172
Yes.

377
00:32:20,374 --> 00:32:22,576
It was yours.

378
00:33:22,403 --> 00:33:23,970
 Mom, 

379
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,772
 you're not abandoning me and running away. Right? 

380
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:29,075
 I'll be back to get you. 

381
00:33:43,991 --> 00:33:46,392
It's been so long.

382
00:33:47,394 --> 00:33:50,029
Has it been 35 years?

383
00:34:05,412 --> 00:34:09,283
 I heard her daughter passed away in a car accident. 

384
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:13,653
 Yes, it was a truck. 

385
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:18,040
 It happened right in front of her. 

386
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,026
 That's what happened. 

387
00:34:57,331 --> 00:35:00,500
I'm going to go inside after a smoke. Go ahead.

388
00:35:00,501 --> 00:35:02,435
Okay, let's go.

389
00:35:02,436 --> 00:35:04,837
Right this way.

390
00:35:16,149 --> 00:35:17,950
Your here.

391
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,887
- Are you not feeling well? 
 - I'm fine. Let's get inside and work.

392
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,935
This deserves praise.

393
00:35:35,935 --> 00:35:37,071
What?

394
00:35:37,071 --> 00:35:40,907
Seeing you eat what you normally do.

395
00:35:42,276 --> 00:35:45,712
I have to blow smoke so I don't stand out.

396
00:35:50,617 --> 00:35:52,852
I'm going on a blind date.

397
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:54,053
Go ahead.

398
00:35:54,054 --> 00:35:56,223
I'm telling you so you don't get the wrong idea.

399
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,958
He's not even a person anyway.

400
00:35:57,958 --> 00:36:01,660
I heard it was the son of the Seoksan Group.

401
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,164
Yeah, he's not a person.

402
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,877
I heard you're going on a blind date with Hanna.

403
00:36:17,877 --> 00:36:22,445
Yeah. She turned it down the first time, but I guess she had a change of heart.

404
00:36:22,445 --> 00:36:24,717
- When is it? 
 - Tonight.

405
00:36:24,717 --> 00:36:26,619
It won't be easy handling her.

406
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,255
Come on. There's no one that doesn't know that.

407
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:31,824
Do you want a tip?

408
00:36:31,824 --> 00:36:35,027
Hey, do you want to become in-laws with me that badly?

409
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,763
Nope.

410
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:40,199
But your dad does.

411
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,070
Well, do you want to hear it? Or shall I just go?

412
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:47,006
I'll hear it!

413
00:36:49,343 --> 00:36:52,111
Hanna has a secretary.

414
00:36:52,946 --> 00:36:57,350
Provoke him. Step on him.

415
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,886
Why? For what reason?

416
00:36:59,886 --> 00:37:03,489
He's become cocky after going abroad with her.

417
00:37:03,489 --> 00:37:06,392
So Hanna's planning on kicking him out.

418
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:11,663
Oh, I see. That's my specialty.

419
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:14,434
Would you be okay with getting a nephew that quickly?

420
00:37:15,068 --> 00:37:16,869
If you think you're up for it.

421
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,740
Okay! I'll make it happen for sure.

422
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,612
Okay, we're going to start filming!

423
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,782
We're going to film! Quiet on set!

424
00:38:02,783 --> 00:38:04,317
Senior Director Go?

425
00:38:07,521 --> 00:38:09,122
Ma'am?

426
00:38:11,325 --> 00:38:13,259
We're going to start.

427
00:38:18,799 --> 00:38:20,533
Just a moment.

428
00:38:37,884 --> 00:38:40,019
I just have to put this on.

429
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:44,724
Then I'll be able to meet Soo Ah again, right?

430
00:38:46,293 --> 00:38:49,429
It won't be completely the same,

431
00:38:51,064 --> 00:38:53,499
but you'll be able to meet her.

432
00:39:07,581 --> 00:39:09,249
Director Jang?

433
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:13,119
Yes?

434
00:39:14,254 --> 00:39:18,389
- Send the staff somewhere they won't be able to see. 
 - Okay.

435
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:23,127
Let's all leave the area.

436
00:39:34,274 --> 00:39:36,809
Can we start the shoot now?

437
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:39,045
Just a moment.

438
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:45,251
I don't know what to say first.

439
00:39:46,186 --> 00:39:48,788
I haven't made up my mind yet.

440
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,592
If only she would appear in my dreams.

441
00:39:53,527 --> 00:39:56,229
I prayed for that endlessly.

442
00:39:57,831 --> 00:40:02,368
Now that I'm about to see her, I don't know what to say.

443
00:40:11,712 --> 00:40:15,014
You're going to meet your daughter again for the first time after you separated.

444
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:22,455
What did you want to say the most?

445
00:40:34,168 --> 00:40:36,036
I'll tell her.

446
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,507
How sorry I am.

447
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,979
I'm sorry.

448
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,985
 I'm sorry. 

449
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:54,320
 I'm so sorry. 

450
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:58,424
 What are you so sorry for? 

451
00:41:00,194 --> 00:41:04,164
 Are you sorry that you abandoned me in the gutter so you could live your life? 

452
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:08,668
 Or do you feel bad about lying to me and telling me you'd come back? 

453
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:18,377
 It seems you knew that I worked here. Why did you come? 

454
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,146
 Just because. 

455
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:24,283
 I just wanted to see you once. 

456
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:27,020
 Oh, is that so? 

457
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:29,456
 Well? 

458
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:32,859
 Are you happy now that you see me? 

459
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,431
 What a relief. 

460
00:41:39,967 --> 00:41:41,667
 I thought maybe you needed money 

461
00:41:41,667 --> 00:41:46,537
 or maybe you needed a kidney or something. Or... 

462
00:41:48,242 --> 00:41:52,412
 I was worried you would tell me that you were terminally ill or something! 

463
00:41:55,048 --> 00:41:59,452
 What? If you have something to say, say it. 

464
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:10,196
 If you have nothing to say, I'm leaving. 

465
00:42:17,437 --> 00:42:19,572
Can we start shooting?

466
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:03,850
I see.

467
00:43:04,752 --> 00:43:08,554
The fact that I'm alive is a nuisance.

468
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:57,036
Soo Ah!

469
00:43:58,405 --> 00:44:00,240
Soo Ah!

470
00:44:00,908 --> 00:44:03,109
Mommy!

471
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:07,580
Soo Ah!

472
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,217
Soo Ah.

473
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,894
Soo Ah.

474
00:44:32,573 --> 00:44:35,575
Mommy, did you come to see me?

475
00:44:36,743 --> 00:44:40,213
Of course, I came to see you.

476
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:51,822
What took you so long? I've been waiting for you.

477
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,659
I'm sorry.

478
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:57,063
I wanted to come sooner.

479
00:44:57,798 --> 00:45:01,667
I wanted to live here with you.

480
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:04,537
But I couldn't come.

481
00:45:05,405 --> 00:45:07,373
That's okay. You're here now.

482
00:45:07,373 --> 00:45:09,842
I was bored on my own.

483
00:45:09,842 --> 00:45:12,745
Let's play together.

484
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:26,860
Get ready.

485
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:28,395
Okay.

486
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,366
It's okay.

487
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:42,509
 I heard her daughter passed away in a car accident. 

488
00:45:42,509 --> 00:45:44,611
 It happened right in front of her. 

489
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:48,916
 She wasn't able to do anything then. 

490
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:52,186
 She said she could've saved her but wasn't able to. 

491
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:55,688
 She can't escape that guilt. 

492
00:46:05,499 --> 00:46:07,700
Soo Ah!

493
00:46:45,606 --> 00:46:47,940
Honey, you can do it.

494
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:37,223
Soo Ah?

495
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:41,894
My Soo Ah.

496
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:46,699
Mommy.

497
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:53,974
Mommy, are you okay?

498
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:58,545
Soo Ah, are you okay? Were you hurt?

499
00:47:58,545 --> 00:48:03,183
Yeah, you protected me so it doesn't hurt at all.

500
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:05,484
I'm sorry, Soo Ah.

501
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,796
I'm sorry.

502
00:48:15,796 --> 00:48:19,131
I was just so scared before.

503
00:48:21,101 --> 00:48:24,370
I was scared that I could die.

504
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:36,916
 I was scared. 

505
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:42,088
 That I could die. 

506
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,159
 I did it because I was scared that I could die. 

507
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,135
 They say your children are the most precious in the entire world. 

508
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,670
 I thought it'd be the same for me. 

509
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,241
 I thought you would be more precious than my own life. 

510
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,279
 I was scared. 

511
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:09,015
 I thought I'd die if I stayed there. 

512
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,054
 I'm sorry. 

513
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,159
 I guess it wasn't for me. 

514
00:49:21,828 --> 00:49:25,231
 Maybe I was more precious to me than you. 

515
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:31,337
 Ah In? 

516
00:49:34,575 --> 00:49:37,410
 Don't forgive me. 

517
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:04,336
Don't forgive me.

518
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:06,673
Mommy.

519
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:08,008
Yeah?

520
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:11,978
I missed you.

521
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:18,810
♫  When the world turns its back  ♫

522
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:23,850
♫  Tell me I'm on your side  ♫

523
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:39,800
♫  Tell my heart that is infinitely getting smaller  ♫

524
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:47,720
♫  Please tell me  ♫

525
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:26,820
 I texted you her address. 

526
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:29,389
 She quit and said today was her last day. 

527
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:31,791
 Did something happen? 

528
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,318
 Who is it? 

529
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:03,022
Open the door.

530
00:52:10,163 --> 00:52:11,931
Ah In.

531
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:35,755
Are you running away again?

532
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,529
What are you afraid of this time to run away?

533
00:52:45,532 --> 00:52:47,567
Ah In.

534
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:50,704
You should be living the good life after you ran away and abandoned your daughter!

535
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:52,939
What the hell is wrong with your house?

536
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,726
Ah In.

537
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,931
Eat before you go.

538
00:53:43,156 --> 00:53:47,959
In the past, you couldn't eat sometimes when you were too surprised.

539
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:51,230
But you could always eat with this.

540
00:53:55,435 --> 00:53:58,237
Do you think I came here to eat?

541
00:54:07,347 --> 00:54:09,482
Answer me.

542
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:13,753
Why didn't you come back for me then?

543
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:18,325
I was going to come back.

544
00:54:18,325 --> 00:54:22,728
I was going to get you as soon as I had enough money for a place.

545
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,999
 Welcome. 

546
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:32,039
 Where is she? 

547
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,807
 Where the hell is she? 

548
00:54:33,807 --> 00:54:37,845
 Come out before I kill you! 

549
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:39,378
 - Who are you? 
 - Is it you? 

550
00:54:39,379 --> 00:54:43,583
 Did you seduce my wife and make her leave the house? 

551
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:45,577
 What are you doing? 

552
00:54:45,577 --> 00:54:48,721
 Run away right now! Hurry! Go! 

553
00:54:51,024 --> 00:54:54,762
I was so scared that I couldn't go back.

554
00:54:54,762 --> 00:54:58,865
I thought about calling your aunt.

555
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:02,702
Then I thought he'd find me somehow.

556
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:08,541
I'm so sorry.

557
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:11,978
No matter what I say, it's just an excuse.

558
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:20,753
I got to cook for you.

559
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:24,557
That's good enough.

560
00:55:25,225 --> 00:55:28,094
Even if I die, I have no regrets.

561
00:55:32,065 --> 00:55:34,400
Don't speak nonsense.

562
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,390
What about now?

563
00:56:01,995 --> 00:56:04,430
Are you still scared?

564
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:11,537
Is that why you're always ready to run away like this?

565
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:15,207
Is that how you live?

566
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:18,744
This is comfortable.

567
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:24,684
Going to a place where no one knows me.

568
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:57,250
Don't get the wrong idea.

569
00:56:57,951 --> 00:57:00,953
Just because I eat this, it doesn't mean I forgive you.

570
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:05,318
 Oh, there's one more thing. 

571
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:09,689
 Thank your secretary for me. 

572
00:58:21,735 --> 00:58:24,370
Yes, ma'am. Are you okay?

573
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,639
I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling well.

574
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,309
Did the shoot finish well?

575
00:58:29,309 --> 00:58:31,277
Yeah, we're cleaning up now.

576
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:34,013
 Okay, great job. 

577
00:58:34,715 --> 00:58:36,182
Oh, and about the secretary issue...

578
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:38,918
I'll speak with her as soon as we get to work tomorrow.

579
00:58:38,918 --> 00:58:41,087
No, don't.

580
00:58:41,087 --> 00:58:43,022
What?

581
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,391
Don't say anything.

582
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:48,394
Okay.

583
00:58:57,604 --> 00:59:00,573
How do I pay her back for this?

584
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:16,856
Mr. Park, why are you being so quiet today?

585
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:21,661
You're the one that normally talks and I just respond.

586
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:26,365
Am I acting differently than normal?

587
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,537
Do well.

588
00:59:30,537 --> 00:59:32,539
Do you mean that?

589
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:36,075
   

590
00:59:37,978 --> 00:59:39,279
Yeah.

591
00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:42,149
Hey, I heard you're going on a blind date with the son from Seoksan Group!

592
00:59:42,149 --> 00:59:43,416
Yeah.

593
00:59:43,416 --> 00:59:46,119
Don't you know he goes around hitting on girls everywhere?

594
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:50,223
I know. Is there anyone that doesn't know that?

595
00:59:50,223 --> 00:59:51,657
Then, why are you going on a blind date with him?

596
00:59:51,657 --> 00:59:54,760
I'd hardly call it a blind date.

597
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,130
It's more like a business meeting.

598
00:59:57,130 --> 01:00:00,399
You said you'd never do an arranged marriage.

599
01:00:04,304 --> 01:00:09,008
Yeah, I still stand by that. This is all part of a strategy.

600
01:00:59,293 --> 01:01:02,528
Hey, did the sommelier change here?

601
01:01:02,528 --> 01:01:03,464
Excuse me?

602
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:05,498
What's wrong with the taste?

603
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:07,500
You taste it.

604
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:10,871
I apologize. I'll prepare something else.

605
01:01:10,871 --> 01:01:13,973
It's fine. Just leave it and go.

606
01:01:21,715 --> 01:01:24,718
Don't be rude, and use honorifics.

607
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:28,721
Honorifics should be used on someone worthy of it.

608
01:01:40,134 --> 01:01:42,201
Pour me a glass.

609
01:01:46,573 --> 01:01:49,409
Pour it yourself.

610
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,690
Hey!

611
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:09,495
Yeah, you. Come here.

612
01:02:17,905 --> 01:02:19,939
Pour me a drink.

613
01:02:34,988 --> 01:02:36,623
More.

614
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:47,166
More!

615
01:03:00,614 --> 01:03:04,317
Hey, why would you stop?

616
01:03:09,122 --> 01:03:12,825
I stopped because I thought it would spill over.

617
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:16,295
Are you someone who makes decisions?

618
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:20,166
That's enough.

619
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:23,610
Why did you stop without my instruction?!

620
01:03:29,176 --> 01:03:31,811
You can't pour anymore because you're afraid it'll pour over?

621
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:34,580
But I heard you were full of yourself.

622
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:36,251
Why?

623
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:40,920
Since you got an MBA, did you think that would make us the same level?

624
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:49,529
I'm sorry.

625
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,542
You rude bastard, how dare you speak without permission?

626
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:32,638
You rude bastard, how dare you speak without permission?

627
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:54,000

633

 How much for a piggyback ride? 

634
01:05:25,834 --> 01:05:27,360
 It's on the house. 

635
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,929
 Forever? 

636
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:31,998
 Keep meeting Hanna. You can marry her. 

637
01:05:31,998 --> 01:05:35,501
 Okay, what do I gain from this? 

638
01:05:36,136 --> 01:05:42,104
 Hanna, starting now, you're going to have to get used to defeat and despair. 

639
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:44,277
 Is the VC Group Wedding Room available? 

640
01:05:44,277 --> 01:05:46,145
 I'll wrap up Plan B. 

641
01:05:46,145 --> 01:05:48,581
 Why didn't you tell me? 

642
01:05:48,581 --> 01:05:51,330
 People would go see the minister if his dog died, 

643
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:54,340
 but they wouldn't show up if the minister died. 

644
01:05:55,184 --> 01:05:56,707
 There's no betrayal. 

645
01:05:56,707 --> 01:06:01,580
 The person who trusted the other is at fault.
