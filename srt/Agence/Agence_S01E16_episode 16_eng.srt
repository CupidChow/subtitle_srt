1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:02,502
 The final crisis that erupted two years ago. 

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:06,238
 In other words, the aftermath of the IMF crisis continues... 

3
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:10,170
   

4
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,312
 Excuse me. How much is a ticket to Seoul? 

5
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,760
 It's 14,400 won. 

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,860


7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,830
   

8
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:26,850
   

9
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:56,722
 14,000 won. 

10
00:01:01,282 --> 00:01:03,808
 14,100 won. 

11
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:16,455
 14,120 won. 

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
   

13
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:32,213
   

14
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,060
   

15
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,933
 The last bus to Seoul is leaving. 

16
00:01:47,007 --> 00:01:49,887
 I wanted to visit. 

17
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,940
   

18
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,581
 Even if I couldn't attend the school. 

19
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:00,786
 I just wanted to visit at least once. 

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,960
   

21
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,600
   

22
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,987
Wait and see.

23
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:35,555
 I'm going to be more successful than all of you! 

24
00:02:47,234 --> 00:02:51,707
 If There's No Wind, You Must Row Ahead] 

25
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:02,647
    
 Why haven't you gone home yet?

26
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:08,454
I found something strange.

27
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,256
What is it?

28
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:13,693
I got a call earlier that they decided on the brand model for VC Construction.

29
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,934
She was keeping low because she got a DUI last year.

30
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:23,836
But now they want to use her as the brand model?

31
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:27,573
They decided on this at VC Construction?

32
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:30,009
No, I looked into it since it was strange.

33
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:35,661
Headquarters signed a contract with her, and then they notified VC Construction.

34
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,200
   

35
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,425
Look at this.

36
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:51,497
He makes a mistake right on time.

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,420
   

38
00:04:00,474 --> 00:04:05,630
It's almost time for our king to fall off his horse.

39
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,040
   

40
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,992
- Did something happen? 
 - We need to make our move.

41
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:22,995
Did they make a mistake?

42
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,564
We need confirmation.

43
00:04:24,564 --> 00:04:28,283
To be more precise, we need a few pictures of Jo Yoo Na with the vice-president.

44
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,304
Jo Yoo Na? What about her?

45
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,305
She's been keeping a low profile because of her DUI,

46
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,408
but she was signed to be the brand model for VC Construction.

47
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,645
So there's something going on with her and Han Soo?

48
00:04:40,847 --> 00:04:43,917
So you're going to mess with Kim Seo Jeong to provoke Chairman Kim?

49
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,822
That too.

50
00:04:45,822 --> 00:04:53,354
The most important issue is the embezzlement of company funds. It's an act that'll tarnish the group's brand image.

51
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:56,636
It's too much to ask the other secretaries to follow Vice-President Kang Han Soo,

52
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:59,698
and take pictures of him.

53
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,810
Not Vice-President Kang Han Soo.

54
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,303
Ask them to take pictures of Jo Yoo Na.

55
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:07,373
What reason should we give them?

56
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:11,642
There's a bad rumor going around about our brand model's personal life, so there's a reason to check.

57
00:05:11,642 --> 00:05:16,664
And while doing that, they may happen to get a picture of her and Han Soo?

58
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:20,419
Yes, I'll prepare the rest.

59
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,671
My intuition is kicking in.

60
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,662
The bells are ringing!

61
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:36,779
No wonder my back hurts so much!

62
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:39,472
It's time to get up already.

63
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,780
Yes, Ma'am?

64
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,290
   

65
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,572
Mr. Han, let's do the ad for VC Construction with Jo Yoo Na.

66
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,184
You're going to proceed with it? You're not going to switch out the model?

67
00:06:16,184 --> 00:06:17,110
Yeah.

68
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,478
There'll be a big blow from public backlash.

69
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,080
We need the blow to be big for the person who chose Jo Yoo Na to be the brand model.

70
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,486
I'll organize the copy and send it to you.

71
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,300
   

72
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,378
This punk.

73
00:07:02,378 --> 00:07:04,857
I felt sorry for him so I took him in.

74
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,072
Did you think I'd be like you?

75
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:10,529
Did you think I wouldn't have a backup plan?

76
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,666
- Did you call Hanju News? 
 - Not yet.

77
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,668
Do it quickly.

78
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,625
   

79
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:26,566
   

80
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,322
Yeah.

81
00:07:30,322 --> 00:07:31,960
What happened?

82
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,919
I'm in a meeting.

83
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,578
 Hey. 

84
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:36,455
Wrap it up and make it look like Senior Director Yoo deviated on his own.

85
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,658
Chang Soo, just wait.

86
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:40,694
Do you think you can handle it?

87
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:43,396
Have we only done things we could handle?

88
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,165
When something happens, we handle it however we can.

89
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:53,199
You can trust me. Don't make any moves on your own.

90
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,174
Okay.

91
00:07:54,175 --> 00:07:58,530
Don't come into work today. Use a vacation day and rest at home.

92
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,778
Yeah, okay.

93
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,332
Sir, do you plan on burying this?

94
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:26,491
Are you crazy? How can I bury something that was said live on the evening news?

95
00:08:28,575 --> 00:08:31,375
Call the audit agency.

96
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,163
Tell them to handle him as quickly as possible.

97
00:08:34,163 --> 00:08:36,282
Yes, sir.

98
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,411
 I'm sorry. I was harsh. I apologize. 

99
00:08:59,411 --> 00:09:02,007
 Will you forgive me this once? 

100
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,038
Yeah, I can forgive him once.

101
00:09:06,038 --> 00:09:09,185
Only once.

102
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,565
   

103
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,530
   

104
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:22,780
   

105
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,770
   

106
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,850
   

107
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,970
   
   

108
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,490
      
   

109
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,800
       

110
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:42,682
What is this?

111
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:45,851
How can you laugh right now?

112
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:49,881
If you use Jo Yoo Na as our brand model and put out this ad, did you not know this would happen?

113
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:50,789
I did.

114
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,125
How could you proceed with this if you knew?

115
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:55,194
What do you mean? We can just apologize.

116
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,129
Who?

117
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,563
You.

118
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,065
Why would I apologize for something that Han Soo screwed up?

119
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:05,199
If there's someone who causes trouble, and there's someone who provides solutions...

120
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:12,817
The person who apologizes and provides a solution will look like the next leader.

121
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,915
Are you ready to release the article?

122
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,684
It's ready to be released immediately.

123
00:10:18,685 --> 00:10:22,334
Record an apology video as soon as possible. Post it on your social media.

124
00:10:22,334 --> 00:10:25,367
Release the article tomorrow at 6:00 a.m.

125
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:29,085
So that everyone can see it on their tedious way to work.

126
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:31,597
Shall I post the article on my social media, too?

127
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,822
No.

128
00:10:32,823 --> 00:10:35,834
Then the public might think that Kang Han Soo's deviant behavior was

129
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,719
due to conflict over the successors of VC Group.

130
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,106
They might get the wrong idea.

131
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,307
I understand what you're saying.

132
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:46,300
As for the article title, go with "Jo Yoo Na is in a love triangle."

133
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:53,282
As for the content you must include, "The other members of the love triangle are Woowon Group's Kim Seo Jeong

134
00:10:53,282 --> 00:10:56,889
and VC Group's Vice-President, Kang Han Soo."

135
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:07,266
Send me the news article as soon as you get it.

136
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,409
- Do you want to check it? 
 - No.

137
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,710
There's someone who I want to show first.

138
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:18,076
Still, she's your friend. Will you be okay?

139
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,713
I'm showing it to her because she's my friend.

140
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,421
Just leave it.

141
00:11:30,421 --> 00:11:32,991
Don't clean it up!

142
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,037
   

143
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:50,066
This article will be released soon. I thought you should know.

144
00:11:56,483 --> 00:12:01,750
Are you out of your mind? Don't you know it's all over if Chairman Woo Won objects?

145
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,817
Father, it's not what you think.

146
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:07,526
All we did was drink.

147
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,732
I told you to get along with Seo Jeong. But you mess up like this?

148
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,167
I asked them to take down the article. It's nothing. I'll take care of it.

149
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,438
The shareholders' meeting is tomorrow.

150
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,174
- I know. 
 - Do you want it to be overturned?

151
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,178
No, sir.

152
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:28,180
Go meet Seo Jeong today and calm her down.

153
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,816
Yes, sir.

154
00:12:44,397 --> 00:12:48,934
About Jo Yoo Na's ad. I'll take care of it.

155
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,105
How?

156
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:58,407
There's someone who has to leave the company anyway, can't we put this on him?

157
00:12:58,407 --> 00:13:00,380
Who?

158
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,822
Hey, did you take care of it?

159
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,659
 Of course. 

160
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:19,130
Oh, I saw something happened over the brand model.

161
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,799
I bet it was trouble for the vice-president.

162
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,369
Things have been chaotic since this morning.

163
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,638
Hey, I'll take care of this.

164
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,407
You?

165
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,400
How?

166
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll meet Jo Yoo Na's CEO, and make him say that Go Ah In wine and dined him.

167
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,050
Then the vice-president won't have to take the blame, and we can fire Ah In.

168
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,120
 What do you think? 

169
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,623
- Chang Soo. 
 - Yeah?

170
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,693
You really do think just like me.

171
00:13:48,693 --> 00:13:50,729
Okay for now.

172
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:59,604
But I told the staff from the audit office to name Senior Director Choi

173
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,375
as the person who wined and dined them, not Senior Director Go.

174
00:14:26,767 --> 00:14:28,561
Senior Director Choi.

175
00:14:28,562 --> 00:14:33,969
You've been dismissed from your position as of today. Along with Senior Director Yoo Jeong Seok.

176
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:39,011
I'll turn in my letter of resignation.

177
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,179
That's a wise choice.

178
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,960
If you turn in your resignation today, there will be no further investigation

179
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,396
and no legal action will be taken against you.

180
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:01,333
That's including the entertainment you received from Jo Yoo Na's agency.

181
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:04,878
What are you talking about? I didn't do that!

182
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,414
 You really do think just like me. 

183
00:15:09,414 --> 00:15:11,576
 Okay for now. 

184
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,884
"I had a cup of coffee with the CEO of Jo Yoo Na's agency."

185
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:21,553
I was told to relay this message to you.

186
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:24,289
The chief secretary said you'd sign it if I did.

187
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,794
You should protect your severance pay.

188
00:15:32,865 --> 00:15:37,732
You know better than anyone else. You can't win this.

189
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,609
Sign it.

190
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,210
   

191
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,110
   

192
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:07,800
The audit staff are inside Senior Director Choi's office right now.

193
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,167
Over Wooseong Milk?

194
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:11,436
No, over Jo Yoo Na.

195
00:16:15,676 --> 00:16:18,910
I guess he's of no use to them now.

196
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,234
Let go! How dare you touch me?

197
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,581
Why do I have to leave?

198
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:03,732
I worked late on the weekends and even over the holidays.

199
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:09,194
I'm the one that built VC Communications into what it is today.

200
00:17:16,936 --> 00:17:21,459
She's the one that pops psychiatric meds as if they were candy!

201
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:24,226
Is she qualified to be the next CEO?

202
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:32,313
Do you really think you can leave this company to someone who's mentally unstable?

203
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:47,697
If what you're saying is true, I've been taking prescription meds from my psychiatrist for the past three years.

204
00:17:47,697 --> 00:17:51,002
Does that mean I'm not qualified to work at VC Communications?

205
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:59,511
Me too. I take them, too.

206
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,446
So do I.

207
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,949
So do I.

208
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,951
Me too.

209
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,097
Senior Director Choi.

210
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:24,098
I learned everything I know about advertising planning from you, sir.

211
00:18:24,098 --> 00:18:29,205
There were times we bumped heads and times we embarrassed one another, but as someone in advertising,

212
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:32,860
I respected you.

213
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,315
I would like to keep respecting you until the very end.

214
00:18:38,887 --> 00:18:40,954
Can you help me do that?

215
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,157
Sir.

216
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:47,360
Please?

217
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,560
   

218
00:19:04,563 --> 00:19:06,985
   

219
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,788
   

220
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,471
I was thoughtless.

221
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:38,970
What a shame. You should've joined the project team.

222
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,805
I'm sorry. For showing you such an ugly side.

223
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,908
I had nothing personal against you.

224
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:12,645
I just...

225
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:15,714
The company made you this way.

226
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:23,188
Trying to make a living isn't easy.

227
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:29,160
Thanks. Thanks for saying that.

228
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,831
Don't worry about what happened today.

229
00:20:32,831 --> 00:20:37,135
I wouldn't have been any different if I were in your position.

230
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,272
I hope you win.

231
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:47,033
This is a first. I've never rooted for you before.

232
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,115
I'm sure we'll see each other again if you stay in this industry.

233
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,340
No.

234
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,688
I'm sick of advertisements.

235
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,165
You've been through so much.

236
00:21:23,816 --> 00:21:25,652
I'll go by myself.

237
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,529
Sir, thank you for your hard work.

238
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,565
 - Thank you for your hard work. 
 - Thank you for your hard work. 

239
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,776
Work hard.

240
00:21:53,136 --> 00:21:55,829
Not like me.

241
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,799
   

242
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,360
   

243
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,210
   

244
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:37,313
Living a tepid life isn't so bad. isn't so bad.

245
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,933
Daddy!

246
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:57,902
I won't marry him!

247
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,508
A news article was released. Everyone in the country knows.

248
00:24:05,508 --> 00:24:08,446
How can I marry him?

249
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:15,486
Han Soo, that punk!

250
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,846
   

251
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,666
What is it?

252
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,589
Look here, Chairman Kim.

253
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:33,538
You're not in the mood to speak to me, are you?

254
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:37,308
Did you call me to ask me that?

255
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,867
No.

256
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:43,848
I called to make you feel better.

257
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:47,518
Let's meet quietly right now.

258
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,969
   

259
00:24:58,797 --> 00:24:59,740
It's me.

260
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,860
   

261
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,223
Yes, sir. I understand.

262
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:08,974
However, I have to ask you something.

263
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,975
Do you think Senior Director Go will believe me?

264
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:15,743
If it wasn't for her, do you think you'd still be getting paid at my company?

265
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:20,182
She did you a favor and you're trying to repay her kindness. Why wouldn't she believe you?

266
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:35,266
You can't try to escape me already.

267
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:43,808
I'm sure you're busy. Why did you want to see me?

268
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:46,645
There's a shareholders' meeting tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.

269
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:51,457
The key issue on the agenda is appointing Vice-President Kang Han Soo to Vice-Chairman.

270
00:25:51,457 --> 00:25:53,286
Already?

271
00:25:53,286 --> 00:25:56,387
Am I too late?

272
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,599
Yes, come in!

273
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,011
I came because I was frustrated.

274
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,947
It will be too difficult to find a way in just one day. Right?

275
00:26:22,947 --> 00:26:24,326
You already knew.

276
00:26:24,326 --> 00:26:26,484
I just found out.

277
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:29,220
I finally see the end.

278
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:33,877
Yes. At this rate, Senior Director Kang Hanna and I are...

279
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:38,227
I'm aware that you're doing something with Senior Director Kang Hanna. Something to do with a model?

280
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:40,698
Senior Director Choi took responsibility for it and resigned from the company.

281
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:44,301
It's not a card we can use to turn the tables at the shareholders' meeting.

282
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:48,206
What do you have to do when there's no way?

283
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:49,574
You have to make a way.

284
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:53,812
No. People who've never worked properly say things like that.

285
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,947
You don't need a way.

286
00:26:55,947 --> 00:27:01,148
Don't look for a way. Just keep doing what you're doing.

287
00:27:01,148 --> 00:27:06,954
If you succeed, other people will call that the right way, too.

288
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,461
Even if it ends up being a storm in a teacup?

289
00:27:10,461 --> 00:27:13,829
Are you afraid of failure?

290
00:27:13,829 --> 00:27:17,535
I must've misjudged you.

291
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:21,172
Just do it?

292
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:26,010
Whether you succeed or fail, do it your way.

293
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:30,579
Who knows? Something unexpected might happen.

294
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,584
Like what?

295
00:27:57,222 --> 00:28:00,450
   

296
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:19,865
Yes?

297
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,867
Come to the conference room alone.

298
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,903
Do you think it'll work in just a day?

299
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:29,079
We'll know once we try.

300
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,900
It's going to be a long night.

301
00:28:50,496 --> 00:28:52,863
- Straighten your shoulders. 
 - What?

302
00:28:52,863 --> 00:28:55,096
Straighten your shoulders, and fix your expression.

303
00:28:55,096 --> 00:28:57,201
Go stand over there.

304
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:09,320
   

305
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,481
Now, this is a presentation to get the shareholders on your side.

306
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:16,754
Let's begin.

307
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:38,995
Has Hanna not come home yet? Or did she leave early?

308
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:41,679
She must've stayed out all night with some friends.

309
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,815
Really?

310
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,925
Does she have the time to do that now?

311
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,280
Yong Ho?

312
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,975
Yes?

313
00:29:50,975 --> 00:29:53,491
Are you busy today?

314
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,693
No, not really.

315
00:29:55,693 --> 00:29:58,406
Then, why did you eat so quickly?

316
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:00,935
I guess I was just hungry.

317
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:03,100
If you'll excuse me.

318
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,045
What happened with your meeting with Seo Jeong?

319
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:16,247
It's been handled.

320
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:17,458
Really?

321
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,518
I promised her that something like this will never happen again.

322
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,820
It really won't either.

323
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,890
Do you think your grandfather knows?

324
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,424
He didn't say anything about it.

325
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,426
It doesn't matter if he did.

326
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:32,663
We just need Chairman Kim on our side.

327
00:30:32,663 --> 00:30:35,099
I heard you're having lunch with him today.

328
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:37,768
We're going to go to the shareholders' meeting together.

329
00:30:37,768 --> 00:30:39,737
I want you to come with Seo Jeong later.

330
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,807
Yes, sir.

331
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:46,177
That brings my presentation to an end.

332
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:57,588
You could be a decent deputy head now.

333
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,328
Great job.

334
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:06,364
Not everyone could improve this much in just one night.

335
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:10,793
Don't compliment me. It's annoying.

336
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:14,572
Your appearance is also an aspect of a presentation.

337
00:31:14,572 --> 00:31:18,976
Do something about your looks, and I'll see you at 1:00 p.m.

338
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,990
   

339
00:31:41,802 --> 00:31:46,837
Ah Ji, I have to go to work. Aren't you going to say bye?

340
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:51,175
Eun Jeong, we need to talk.

341
00:31:55,981 --> 00:32:00,185
Ah Ji got into a huge fight at his kindergarten yesterday.

342
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,421
Why?

343
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:05,917
The other kids were singing, "Calf, calf, spotted baby calf."

344
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:07,958
While singing this song,

345
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:09,779
they told him that they weren't making fun of him

346
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,997
but just calling him by his name.

347
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:24,767
But I like Song Ah Ji. It's so cute and nice.

348
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,544
- Eun Jeong. 
 - Yes?

349
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,291
It's not your name.

350
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:32,016
It's his name and he's going to use it forever.

351
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:40,624
Okay, I'll think about it.

352
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,207
What happened between Han Soo and Seo Jeong?

353
00:32:56,207 --> 00:32:59,510
They met yesterday and reconciled.

354
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,082
Chairman Kim must be on Han Soo's side then.

355
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,460
- What's this? 
 - What?

356
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,629
You said appearance was an aspect of the presentation!

357
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,231
Why do you look the same as you did before?

358
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,867
Because I'm not going to the shareholders' meeting.

359
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,735
How could you not go?

360
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,669
I'm an employee of the agency. I work on behalf of the others.

361
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:32,711
My work is done. It's your turn to step up.

362
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:36,714
Can't you coach me from the sidelines?

363
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,049
Are you nervous?

364
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:39,717
Of course.

365
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:42,687
I trust you'll do a good job.

366
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:46,090
Because I prepared so hard last night?

367
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,195
No. Because you're a madwoman.

368
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,993
Just like now.

369
00:33:52,994 --> 00:33:58,232
It doesn't matter if you win or lose, so go and be confident.

370
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:06,007
We prepared strategically, so it's my turn to act like a madwoman?

371
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:30,160
   

372
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:35,573
I think things are going to go well thanks to you.

373
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:38,211
Thanks to me?

374
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,479
This is a win-win.

375
00:34:42,479 --> 00:34:46,216
We both have shares in this.

376
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:50,020
Our kids will be here soon. Let's head inside.

377
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,330
When shall we go in?

378
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,867
We're uninvited guests.

379
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:07,504
Let's go in right on time, so they can't kick us out.

380
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:09,242
Okay.

381
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,113
 We'll go in right on time. 

382
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,449
 I'll keep you posted. 

383
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:23,360
   

384
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:52,249
I know you're all busy.

385
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:56,120
I want to thank all the shareholders for attending today.

386
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:04,094
We will start the VC Group Shareholders' Meeting.

387
00:36:14,353 --> 00:36:15,609
Move!

388
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,944
 Get out of the way! 

389
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,111
 What do you think you're doing? 

390
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,017
 Senior Director Kang Hanna is a shareholder. 

391
00:36:22,017 --> 00:36:24,048
Why can't she attend the shareholders' meeting?

392
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:27,517
We're just following orders.

393
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:31,529
Then I'll give you orders. Move.

394
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:39,138
Hey! Who do you think you are to block me?

395
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,932
Senior Director Kang Hanna.

396
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,404
- You should leave. 
 - I don't want to.

397
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,208
I know how you feel.

398
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,307
But what do you think you can do now?

399
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:53,008
Whatever it is, I'll figure it out.

400
00:36:53,008 --> 00:36:54,511
Move out of my way.

401
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:56,116
Senior Director Kang.

402
00:36:56,887 --> 00:37:00,120
Just go. Go.

403
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,720
What do you think you're doing?

404
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,067
Yeong Woo, what are you doing?

405
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:06,357
Take her away.

406
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:28,315
Do you want a drink?

407
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:31,326
No. I'm waiting for news.

408
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:33,240
Then you should've gone to the shareholders' meeting with them.

409
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,284
Why did you come here?

410
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:37,188
We're not the type to stand at the front line.

411
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,859
Oh.

412
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:41,191
If things go well, it's because the person at the front line was capable.

413
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:44,561
If things go wrong, it's the people behind the scenes' fault. Right?

414
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,898
I needed to do some market research, too.

415
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,266
What kind of market research?

416
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,803
A decision will be made depending on the news that comes.

417
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:57,701
Whether I'll continue working at the company, or whether I'll start a restaurant like you.

418
00:37:58,543 --> 00:38:00,577
You'll start a restaurant?

419
00:38:00,577 --> 00:38:04,815
How could you work in the service industry with your temper?

420
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:08,264
After hearing what you said, I think it'll be better if you're a little drunk.

421
00:38:08,264 --> 00:38:10,521
Why did you do it?

422
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:19,116
You could've just kept your job at the company.

423
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:21,298
You'd be living a better life than now.

424
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:33,313
Hey. I'm sick of advertising now.

425
00:38:33,313 --> 00:38:37,247
And thanks to that, my daughter had a great wedding.

426
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:39,517
You haven't changed at all.

427
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,151
What?

428
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:43,520
You can't lie.

429
00:38:56,048 --> 00:38:59,403
Seeing as how I haven't gotten a call yet.

430
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:02,773
It means they didn't even get inside.

431
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,551
Starting now, we will vote on the topic of today's agenda

432
00:39:19,551 --> 00:39:24,128
for appointing Vice-President Kang Han Soo to Vice-Chairman.

433
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:47,551
You can't give up like this, right?

434
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,724
What are you going to do?

435
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:58,896
We should break down a door that won't open.

436
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,715
Look here!

437
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,690
How dare a bunch of mere servants block my granddaughter's path?

438
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,758
Grandfather!

439
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:31,061
Hello, Grand Chairman.

440
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,903
Did you prepare something like this behind my back?

441
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,642
Oh, that.

442
00:40:40,642 --> 00:40:43,207
They were Chairman Kang's orders.

443
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,877
True, what power would you have?

444
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:49,179
If things go well, the owner did a good job.

445
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:52,516
If things go wrong, it's the servants that did a bad job. Right?

446
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:54,319
Excuse me?

447
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:57,020
There should be someone who takes responsibility.

448
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:08,498
- Hey. 
 - Yes, Grand Chairman.

449
00:41:08,498 --> 00:41:11,669
Why do you have your necktie around your hand and not your neck?

450
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,639
Oh, this?

451
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:19,880
That's true.

452
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:23,180
She always liked wild animals since she was a little girl.

453
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,689
How did the grand chairman walk here?

454
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:36,447
You didn't know? My grandfather walks really well.

455
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:39,129
Then, why does he use a wheelchair?

456
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:43,099
Who do you think I take after to hate walking?

457
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:45,354
 What are you doing? Are you not going to work? 

458
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:47,738
Yeah, I'm coming!

459
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,060
   

460
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:23,393
   

461
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:33,984
Hello, I'm Senior Director Kang Hanna of VC Communications.

462
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:38,222
I know you're all busy, so I'll keep it short.

463
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,260
   

464
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,833
 Don't smile. 

465
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:53,771
 How many times have I told you not to smile like that? 

466
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,806
 Then shall I frown while I speak? 

467
00:42:55,806 --> 00:43:00,677
 Just let your lips curl up a little, and keep a soft smile on your face. 

468
00:43:00,677 --> 00:43:04,147
 If you look too bright, it diminishes the credibility of the presenter. 

469
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,316
 Start over. 

470
00:43:11,723 --> 00:43:15,829
Just recently, VC Construction used a model with a drunk driving record

471
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:18,295
and it caused quite the controversy.

472
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:24,025
As a result of that, we had about 57,800 negative social media posts.

473
00:43:24,025 --> 00:43:29,072
Also, about 121 negative articles were circulated.

474
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:34,344
What do you think the reason was?

475
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:39,212
They said it was due to personal corruption done by some director at VC Communications.

476
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:44,121
Of course, but that's just on the outside.

477
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,963
 Hand! 

478
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,064
 Bring your hand to the front. 

479
00:43:55,233 --> 00:43:57,835
 This is a habit! A habit! 

480
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,777
 Also, CEOs in the States put their hands in their pockets when they present. 

481
00:44:00,778 --> 00:44:01,838
 This is no big deal. 

482
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,441
 Are we in the States? 

483
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:08,145
 An arrogant posture causes negative emotion towards your audience. 

484
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,081
 Then, do you want me to look guilty like I killed someone? 

485
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,392
 I want you to look humble but confident. 

486
00:44:14,393 --> 00:44:15,619
 Maintain that posture. 

487
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:18,820
 Be humble but confident? 

488
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,657
 Does that even make sense? 

489
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:25,162
 Why don't you ask me to make you a hot iced-coffee? 

490
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,354
 The content is what's important. 

491
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:30,133
 Why do I have to stay up all night over these small things? 

492
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,002
 Form is just as important as the content. 

493
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,571
 Attitude is just as important as your form. 

494
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,275
 The presenter's tiniest expressions, behavior, and posture. 

495
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:42,133
 These elements are important to the audience. It's intuitive to them. 

496
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,372
 So do it. 

497
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,221
 Don't whine. 

498
00:44:45,221 --> 00:44:47,550
 Start over. 

499
00:44:57,462 --> 00:44:59,596
Are you saying there was another internal reason?

500
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:01,601
Of course.

501
00:45:01,601 --> 00:45:05,069
Before her DUI, Jo Yoo Na earned 500 million won a year.

502
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:11,303
But now she's earning 1 billion won and was also chosen to be a brand model. The reason?

503
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:36,467
I'll leave the rest to your imagination.

504
00:45:36,467 --> 00:45:39,603
However, if my speculations are correct,

505
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:43,033
company funds were used for personal reasons.

506
00:45:43,034 --> 00:45:44,942
This is a breach of trust.

507
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,279
Plus,

508
00:45:47,279 --> 00:45:52,579
these are the results of the time and cost required to recover the damaged brand value.

509
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:56,019
The amount of losses that VC Group has suffered...

510
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,790
is estimated to be about 1.2 trillion won.

511
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:17,541
Furthermore, as one of the major shareholders of VC Group,

512
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:22,358
I object to appointing Vice-President Kang Han Soo...

513
00:46:23,306 --> 00:46:25,415
to be the vice-chairman.

514
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,942
I don't care if he's my grandson.

515
00:46:46,943 --> 00:46:50,440
We can't promote someone who causes damage to the company.

516
00:46:50,441 --> 00:46:52,275
I oppose.

517
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,748
I'm in favor.

518
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:02,018
- I'm in favor. 
 - Me too.

519
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:04,868
- I'm in favor. 
 - I'm in favor.

520
00:47:04,892 --> 00:47:07,566
- I'm in favor. 
 - Me too.

521
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:21,571
It's in your hands now, sir.

522
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:36,620
I would be happy to decide.

523
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:43,860
When it comes to appointing Vice-President Kang to Vice-Chairman,

524
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:50,670
I oppose.

525
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:16,740
 My grandson caused a mess. I bet you were upset. 

526
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,862
 So? 

527
00:48:19,862 --> 00:48:21,464
 What do you want to do? 

528
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:24,308
 What do you mean? Call the wedding off. 

529
00:48:24,308 --> 00:48:25,654
 What? 

530
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:30,612
 So, you want to break our friendly relations as well? 

531
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:34,490
 Look here.  Can our relationship only be maintained 

532
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:37,380
 if your daughter marries my grandson? 

533
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,083
 Don't we both need one another? 

534
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,719
 We need to defend our management rights. 

535
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:54,327
 I can return what I received with no regrets, but what do you gain from this? 

536
00:48:54,327 --> 00:48:58,468
 Han Soo and Hanna's endless competition. 

537
00:48:59,335 --> 00:49:02,238
 How's my offer? 

538
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,746
Wait, sir.

539
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:10,046
How could you not discuss this with me?

540
00:49:10,046 --> 00:49:12,074
Hey, you punk.

541
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:15,852
You made my daughter cry.

542
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:19,889
Did you think I'd let this go?

543
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,881
Han Soo, I can forgive you once.

544
00:49:24,882 --> 00:49:28,998
But isn't twice too much?

545
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:44,184
Vice-President Kang Han Soo's appointment to Vice-Chairman has been canceled.

546
00:49:44,184 --> 00:49:48,985
I'd like to introduce a professional to be our next vice-chairman.

547
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:56,295
Come in.

548
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,773
Father?

549
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:14,477
I learned recently that you're still a little rough when you work, Yong Ho.

550
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:16,073
Learn a little more.

551
00:50:16,073 --> 00:50:19,937
From Moon Ho, as you did before.

552
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:28,294
Sir!

553
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:41,096
I'm Cho Moon Ho, the next candidate to be the vice-chairman.

554
00:50:41,096 --> 00:50:43,506
Please take care of me.

555
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:06,250
   

556
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:22,212
I was just about to teach you what I know about running a bar.

557
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:25,682
Don't you think my bar would go under if I learned from you?

558
00:51:32,183 --> 00:51:33,623
Congrats.

559
00:51:33,623 --> 00:51:35,425
Thanks.

560
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,094
Cheers!

561
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,863
- YRN! 
 - YRN!

562
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:43,833
But what does "YRN" mean?

563
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,534
Oh, that?

564
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:48,137
It stands for, "Youth is right now."

565
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,205
Oh.

566
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:52,549
You don't even know the popular slang phrases.

567
00:51:52,549 --> 00:51:54,177
How could you call yourself a VC Communications executive

568
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:57,914
that will lead the nation's advertising industry?

569
00:51:58,516 --> 00:52:01,714
Senior Director Go isn't here yet. Can we start drinking like this?

570
00:52:01,714 --> 00:52:03,871
Sure. We have a lot to toast to.

571
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:07,491
There's DST, VAWC, and DPG.

572
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,526
What's DPG?

573
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:11,027
That's my favorite, too.

574
00:52:11,028 --> 00:52:12,231
I knew it.

575
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:15,365
Everyone has their favorite toast.

576
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:17,233
What is it?

577
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:22,472
Drink, pay, and get out!

578
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:33,483
But where is the senior director?

579
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:42,061
I'd like to pay.

580
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,597
That'll be 5,000 won.

581
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,234
You're working hard.

582
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:53,740
Thank you.

583
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,308
Senior Director Go!

584
00:52:56,308 --> 00:52:59,075
Have you been well?

585
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,378
How did you know I worked here?

586
00:53:02,378 --> 00:53:03,914
I'm being promoted.

587
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:07,717
Oh, congratulations.

588
00:53:08,953 --> 00:53:10,887
I'm getting promoted.

589
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,343
Oh, okay.

590
00:53:14,343 --> 00:53:16,864
I'd like to congratulate you again.

591
00:53:18,662 --> 00:53:21,598
I came here to keep my promise to you.

592
00:53:23,432 --> 00:53:25,132
 Just wait a little while. 

593
00:53:25,132 --> 00:53:28,037
 I'll find another way. 

594
00:53:32,063 --> 00:53:33,680
Drink it.

595
00:53:35,654 --> 00:53:36,447
What?

596
00:53:36,448 --> 00:53:39,248
You're going to have to drink a lot tonight.

597
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,353
Oh, she's here!

598
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:46,923
Oh, it's Soo Jeong!

599
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:48,641
Hello.

600
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,153
Thank you.

601
00:53:50,177 --> 00:53:52,609
- Have you all been well? 
 - Yeah.

602
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:53,662
No.

603
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:56,399
But I think that's about to change now.

604
00:53:57,034 --> 00:53:58,768
What was that? Did you just hear him?

605
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:01,704
Oh! He's so aggressive!

606
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,841
Okay, Senior Director Kang, say a few words!

607
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,779
Thanks, everyone. This is all thanks to you.

608
00:54:08,779 --> 00:54:09,736
Eat and drink as much as you want!

609
00:54:09,737 --> 00:54:12,282
I'm going to DPG tonight!

610
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:16,472
DPG?

611
00:54:16,472 --> 00:54:18,955
You don't even know the popular slang phrases.

612
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,651
How can you call yourself the CEO of VC Communications

613
00:54:20,651 --> 00:54:24,260
that will lead the nation's advertising industry?

614
00:54:29,066 --> 00:54:30,434
Cheers!

615
00:54:38,997 --> 00:54:40,677
I should get going.

616
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,125
Let's get another round.

617
00:54:42,126 --> 00:54:44,046
I think the employees are starting to loosen up.

618
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,715
I'm going for another round now.

619
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:48,751
This time it's not to celebrate but to comfort someone.

620
00:54:49,887 --> 00:54:51,283
That's true.

621
00:54:51,283 --> 00:54:54,957
Someone's victory is someone else's defeat.

622
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:56,916
I'm off.

623
00:55:22,553 --> 00:55:24,054
Congratulations on breaking off your engagement.

624
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,392
You little brat!

625
00:55:25,392 --> 00:55:28,658
There's a time and a place for teasing someone.

626
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,928
I'm not teasing you. I mean it.

627
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:39,669
People think we live our lives doing whatever we want.

628
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,889
But you know. It's not like that.

629
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:48,711
Even if you're angry now, it was a good thing.

630
00:55:48,711 --> 00:55:51,581
Why would you go through with an arranged marriage?

631
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:54,851
Then, who would I meet?

632
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,287
Someone who will love you forever.

633
00:55:58,288 --> 00:55:59,558
Hey.

634
00:55:59,558 --> 00:56:01,624
Where can you find someone like that in the world these days?

635
00:56:01,625 --> 00:56:03,188
You can.

636
00:56:03,188 --> 00:56:05,728
In places closer than you think.

637
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,009
I hate you.

638
00:56:16,635 --> 00:56:19,182
You think you're so great.

639
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:30,286
I'll drink with you all night.

640
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:52,909
Everyone, come here!

641
00:56:57,314 --> 00:56:59,285
Ah Ji!

642
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:04,421
This is the last time I get to call you that name.

643
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,823
Are you going to change my name?

644
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,860
- Good job. 
 - Wise choice.

645
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:18,500
   

646
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,197
I like this name.

647
00:57:21,197 --> 00:57:23,773
I'm not Song Ah Ji anymore!

648
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,174
That's nice.

649
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,577
But what does the name mean?

650
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:30,246
The meaning? Oh.

651
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,415
I'm sure it means something.

652
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:36,706
I guess you can't say that it doesn't have a special meaning or anything.

653
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:41,724
But I guess you kind of could, too.

654
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:45,194
Mom, I don't care about the meaning.

655
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:52,301
I picked it so you could live a long life.

656
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,203
As what? A commander?

657
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:55,717
No.

658
00:57:55,717 --> 00:57:56,966
You don't remember?

659
00:57:56,967 --> 00:57:59,241
We saw it on a comedy show once.

660
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:03,279
A father named his son this so he could live a long life.

661
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:06,688
Kim Soohanmu.

662
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:08,367
Turtle and the crane.

663
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:09,719
Samcheongabja, dongbangsak.

664
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,688
I shortened that and got your name from it!

665
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,699
So your full name is

666
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:18,754
Song Suhanmugeobukeewa Doorumisamcheongabja.

667
00:58:18,755 --> 00:58:19,696
- Oh, honey! 
 - Eun Jeong!

668
00:58:19,697 --> 00:58:20,896
Mom!

669
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:22,999
What?

670
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:29,572
Song Suhanmugeobukeewa Doorumisamcheongabja.

671
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:30,912
You're doing great!

672
00:58:30,913 --> 00:58:35,411
Samcheongabja, dongbangsak!

673
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:38,261
Oh, that's refreshing!

674
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:41,117
May I have some more soup?

675
00:58:41,117 --> 00:58:43,753
If you'll all excuse me.

676
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:46,059
Hey, Grandson!

677
00:58:46,059 --> 00:58:49,125
- Yes? 
 - Sit down.

678
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:52,110
It's fine. I have business to tend to.

679
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,067
Sit down!

680
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:03,572
Don't leave a single grain of rice, and eat it all.

681
00:59:12,316 --> 00:59:14,917
There you go. That's good.

682
00:59:15,652 --> 00:59:17,493
It's just the start now.

683
00:59:17,494 --> 00:59:19,789
You can't be tired already.

684
00:59:19,789 --> 00:59:21,361
Yes, Grandfather.

685
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:22,625
Yes, sir.

686
00:59:22,626 --> 00:59:26,162
Don't avoid something because you're uncomfortable.

687
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:27,979
If you start running away and turns it into a habit

688
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:31,768
just because things are hard, you'll live as a loser forever.

689
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:35,204
Han Soo. Hanna.

690
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,226
- Yes? 
 - Yes?

691
00:59:37,226 --> 00:59:38,372
Keep fighting.

692
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:40,843
The winning side is our side.

693
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,459
Hanna, I wanted to tell you...

694
00:59:57,459 --> 01:00:00,963
I know. You did it for me.

695
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:03,732
Then, you'll forgive me?

696
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,154
Forgive you for what?

697
01:00:05,155 --> 01:00:07,236
I want you to forgive me.

698
01:00:07,236 --> 01:00:08,338
For what?

699
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,434
For not living the way you want me to and living the way I want to.

700
01:00:12,434 --> 01:00:14,543
That's not something that needs forgiveness.

701
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,912
It's something to support.

702
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:19,669
Just wait a little while.

703
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:23,953
The best in the world is a little over the top, right?

704
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,689
I'll make ours the best company in Asia.

705
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:30,059
I should live a long life.

706
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:44,884
We'll get going now.

707
01:00:44,908 --> 01:00:47,610
Wait! Give me your hand.

708
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,413
- My hand? 
 - Yeah.

709
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,136
Oh, I feel so relieved!

710
01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:21,877
 Deputy Head Park Yeong Woo and I are dating! 

711
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:25,447
 There's no arranged marriage in my life. 

712
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,384
Take it down right now!

713
01:01:29,384 --> 01:01:31,457
Shall I?

714
01:01:38,899 --> 01:01:41,030
I'm not messing with you!

715
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:44,833
Really? Then I should get back in.

716
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:08,190
What? Why?

717
01:02:08,190 --> 01:02:11,961
Kang Hanna, are you really going to go out with me?

718
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,563
Yeah, I am.

719
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:18,100
But did you just call me by my first name, Mr. Park?

720
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:21,428
I'm 9:00 to 6:00. It's not working hours yet.

721
01:02:35,506 --> 01:02:39,093
I don't know what to do anymore.

722
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:41,194
Just go!

723
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:50,967
 Are you going to use honorifics when it's 9:00? 

724
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:54,036
 I was only giving it a try. 

725
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:56,438
 Why? Keep doing it. It's kind of sexy. 

726
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:58,647
 Is that what you were into? 

727
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:00,142
 Then I take it back. I won't date you. 

728
01:03:00,143 --> 01:03:02,945
 What? Mr. Park!

No.

815
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:30,899
You left your position as CEO of VC Communications

816
01:09:30,899 --> 01:09:33,869
to be the CEO of a tiny independent agency.

817

818
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:40,074
Then what about all of you?

819
01:09:40,074 --> 01:09:41,548
Us?

820
01:09:41,548 --> 01:09:46,141
You quit your stable jobs at VC communications and you followed me here.

821
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:49,618
It's the same for us. Did you think we'd be servants forever?

822
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:53,155
We're all shareholders of Key Woman Communications.

823
01:09:53,156 --> 01:09:53,856
I have 5%.

824
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:54,923
I have 3%.

825
01:09:54,924 --> 01:09:56,058
I have 4%.

826
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:57,492
Yeah, I have 10%.

827
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:01,463
I have about 0.5%?

828
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:06,068
You don't regret it?

829
01:10:06,068 --> 01:10:10,039
People thought that if Go Ah In became the CEO of VC Communications,

830
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,075
she would be satisfied.

831
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,383
That's what people thought?

832
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,566
Why would other people decide my limits?

833
01:10:40,456 --> 01:10:43,860
   

834
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:48,071
   

835
01:10:48,071 --> 01:10:50,820
   

836
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:56,940
♫  I don't want to wake up from a blue dream that resembles you  ♫

837
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:03,660
♫  How the day passes by  ♫

838
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:10,370
♫  When morning comes, I'll find you again  ♫

839
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:17,140
♫  Wake me up turn off the alarm, I'm more comfortable in my dreams, 
 I just wanna be with you again  ♫

840
01:11:19,742 --> 01:11:21,517
   

841
01:11:21,518 --> 01:11:23,578
   

842
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,474
   

843
01:11:25,475 --> 01:11:27,583
   

844
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:29,498
   

845
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:31,500
   

846
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:32,841
   

847
01:11:32,842 --> 01:11:34,223
   

848
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:36,318
   

849
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:38,153
   

850
01:11:38,154 --> 01:11:40,022
   

851
01:11:40,023 --> 01:11:42,424
   

852
01:11:42,425 --> 01:11:44,960
   

853
01:11:44,961 --> 01:11:48,223
   

854
01:11:48,224 --> 01:11:49,843
   

855
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:50,867
   

856
01:11:51,445 --> 01:11:56,179
