00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:08,720


2
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:14,313
   

3
00:00:14,314 --> 00:00:17,214
Congratulations on your promotion, Senior Director.

4
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:20,614
 Congratulations, Senior Director! 

5
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:38,047
   

6
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:43,647
 Being a copywriter makes you feel special, doesn't it? 

7
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:47,647
 And working for an ad agency sounds cool, right? 

8
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:50,481
 How dare you come up with such nonsense? 

9
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:53,181
 You think anyone can write ad copies? 

10
00:00:54,981 --> 00:00:58,514
 A person should do what they are good at, not what they like. Right? 

11
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:01,614
Find another job. You don't have what it takes.

12
00:01:44,747 --> 00:01:46,547
 Were you crying? 

13
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:52,847
 Oh, boohoo, you cried, our little rookie. 

14
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:57,780
 For a woman to become a creative director at an ad agency, 

15
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,814
 she must shed enough tears in the restroom to fill five buckets. 

16
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:05,814
 What do I have to do to write good ad copies? 

17
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:08,814
 - I don't know. 
 - You do know. 

18
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:11,646
 Why are you getting upset at me? 

19
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:15,881
 If you have bones to pick, go pick them with the one who made you cry. 

20
00:02:19,547 --> 00:02:21,781
 Write them until you get sick of it. 

21
00:02:22,614 --> 00:02:25,780
 What kind of shortcut would there be for a rookie? 

22
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:28,581
 The best thing to do is write as much as possible. 

23
00:02:33,747 --> 00:02:38,846
 Even if your boss gets sick of reading them, keep going until they can't say you're bad at writing copies anymore. 

24
00:02:40,447 --> 00:02:44,300
 Don't run away and keep trying! 

25
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,320
♫  Like a tender flower, you bloom  ♫

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,640
♫  Tell me everything, all of your stories  ♫

27
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,530
♫  Wake up, open the closed door, and take a step  ♫

28
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:04,920
♫  Step out, jump into the world with both feet  ♫

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,810
♫  Now I enter a whole new world  ♫

30
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,830
♫  Flying into another sky, nothing is gonna stop my heart  ♫

31
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:25,281
 What? Did you bring me your letter of resignation? 

32
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:30,647
 No. These are the new ad copies I wrote. 

33
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:34,947
 Let's discuss whether or not I have what it takes after you read them. 

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,240
   

35
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:54,114
 We've got a psycho here. 

36
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:06,747
   

37
00:04:10,614 --> 00:04:14,981
   

38
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:20,881
   

39
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:35,881
Let's go. Dinner's on me.

40
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:39,381
Really? You'll have dinner with us?

41
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,813
Can we come, too?

42
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:42,546
Anyone in the Production Team who's free can come.

43
00:04:42,547 --> 00:04:43,382
Let's go!

44
00:04:43,382 --> 00:04:46,813
Before Creative Director... I mean, Senior Director changes her mind.

45
00:04:46,814 --> 00:04:49,181
Okay, let's go!

46
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,247
 Can I make a reservation? 

47
00:04:54,247 --> 00:04:56,814
 What is she going to treat us with? 

48
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:13,852
He should be on his way.

49
00:05:13,852 --> 00:05:16,640
   

50
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,943
He has arrived.

51
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,300
Senior Director!

52
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,357
You're so predictable.

53
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,300
What is this?

54
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:29,199
How could you pass over me and...

55
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,299
Why are you raining on her parade?

56
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,866
I've been loyal to you for so many...

57
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:36,600
You!

58
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:43,117
Stop barking.

59
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,010
Wait.

60
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,778
Okay, everyone raise your glass.

61
00:05:50,778 --> 00:05:55,510
Let's congratulate Senior Director Go Ah In on her promotion, cheers!

62
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:58,678
 Congratulations! 

63
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:00,877
 - Good work. 
 - Good job. 

64
00:06:00,878 --> 00:06:02,978
 Good work. 

65
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:11,954
Creative Director Go, there's something I've always wanted to ask you.

66
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,637
What is it?

67
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:16,692
You were the only one to ever receive a perfect score on the employment exam. Right?

68
00:06:16,693 --> 00:06:19,959
I heard about that, too.

69
00:06:21,326 --> 00:06:23,593
How did you do it?

70
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,326
Oh, that...

71
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,793
   

72
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,300
   

73
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:47,293
 Excuse me. 

74
00:06:47,293 --> 00:06:50,138
 Are you saying I must write 100% identically to this? 

75
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:52,772
 Yes, voice, aim, and content. 

76
00:06:52,773 --> 00:06:56,639
 How identical they are to those of the author determines your score. 

77
00:07:18,173 --> 00:07:20,739
 You have five minutes left. 

78
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,360
   

79
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,505
   

80
00:07:40,506 --> 00:07:42,639
   

81
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,139
 Are you giving up? 

82
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:14,158
 You hadn't written a single line until just now. 

83
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:17,010
 Isn't a single line enough? 

84
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:30,318
 So? What did you write? 

85
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:32,517
   

86
00:08:32,518 --> 00:08:36,151
"To be continued next week."

87
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:38,617
Whoa!

88
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,383
- Amazing. 
 - That's right.

89
00:08:40,384 --> 00:08:44,084
That's 100% identical to what the author wants.

90
00:08:44,084 --> 00:08:48,284
Wow, how did you think of that in such a short amount of time?

91
00:08:51,818 --> 00:08:56,018
People might think you were the one who got promoted.

92
00:08:56,984 --> 00:08:58,984
I'm glad.

93
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:08,251
Hope didn't turn out to be a delusion.

94
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:10,651
Congratulations.

95
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,683
Department Head Han.

96
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:31,484
Yes.

97
00:09:34,084 --> 00:09:37,084
I'm the one who should thank you. Goodnight.

98
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:44,915
- Get home safe. 
 - Please take her safely.

99
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,920
   

100
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,315
   

101
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,443
It's a nice world.

102
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:34,979
I should enjoy it for as long as I can.

103
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,779
   

104
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,040
   

105
00:11:13,045 --> 00:11:15,745
   

106

♫  To my love and one and all  ♫

107

115
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,811
 Good evening, viewers. 

116
00:11:57,812 --> 00:12:01,744
 Please welcome the Woman Leader of Our Time, VC Communications' first female executive, 

117
00:12:01,745 --> 00:12:05,445
 Senior Director Go Ah In. 

118
00:12:06,212 --> 00:12:07,779
 Welcome. 

119
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,945
 - Hello. 
 - Hello. 

120
00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:19,345
I heard you're from a poor family and a graduate of a university outside Seoul.

121
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:23,399
I'm not from a poor family. I didn't even have a family.

122
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,065
What do you mean by that?

123
00:12:25,066 --> 00:12:27,799
I moved in with my aunt's family when I was seven years old

124
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,299
and grew up walking on eggshells.

125
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,865
 You must be strong. Your past can't be easy to talk about. 

126
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,232
It wasn't so bad.

127
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:38,866
Your aunt must have been a nice person.

128
00:12:38,866 --> 00:12:41,400
No, she was the exact opposite.

129
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,965
But a meal shared with people, even if you feel unwelcome,

130
00:12:44,966 --> 00:12:50,133
is more delicious and nutritious than a bowl of soggy ramen eaten by yourself.

131
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,666
Ma'am!  Give us one more bottle of soju.

132
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:03,399
 What should you do to become the best in advertising? 

133
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,200
Ma'am! I said I want a bottle of soju.

134
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,166
Of course. It's coming.

135
00:13:10,691 --> 00:13:11,990
- What are you doing? 
 - What?

136
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:15,825
The customer is asking for a bottle of soju.

137
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:19,463
- Are you here to watch TV?! 
 - Sorry.

138
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:29,255
 You can work for an ad agency 

139
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:32,956
 and make advertisements without doing that, of course, 

140
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:37,123
 but you can't become the best in the industry. 

141
00:13:43,191 --> 00:13:47,324
I'll do that. I will tell her.

142
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:54,692
I have good news.

143
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:55,891
I know already.

144
00:13:55,892 --> 00:13:58,424
Really? What is it?

145
00:13:58,425 --> 00:13:59,924
I'm being summoned back to Korea, right?

146
00:13:59,925 --> 00:14:02,157
To start working at the ad agency.

147
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:06,758
And my position will probably be... a senior director, no?

148
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,557
Did you talk to someone at the secretary's office?

149
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,392
- No! 
 - Then how did you know?

150
00:14:13,066 --> 00:14:14,725
   

151
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,893
They've put out the red carpet to welcome me back.

152
00:14:18,893 --> 00:14:22,486
It wouldn't look good if the chairman's daughter is the first female executive in the group, would it?

153
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:25,920
The media would have a field day.

154
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,401
But if we put someone from a humble background on the cover,

155
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,834
it would help improve the company's image

156
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:33,768
and make it easier for me to come to work. It's a win-win, right?

157
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:39,835
True. It's a very clever trick, and it's cold-hearted.

158
00:14:41,235 --> 00:14:44,068
It's not cold-hearted. It's extremely warm-hearted.

159
00:14:44,068 --> 00:14:47,013
If it weren't for me, this woman couldn't have become an executive.

160
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:50,060
You're very quick when it comes to stuff like this.

161
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,359
What about other stuff? What am I slow with?

162
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,293
Prep work, reviewing, keeping up with the classwork, and...?

163
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:58,926
Deputy Section Head Park, those are not my responsibilities.

164
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:00,860
Then, what is your responsibility?

165
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,169
Making decisions.

166
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,569
Things you do based on intuition.

167
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:05,678
   

168
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:08,701
Senior Director Choi, good work.

169
00:15:08,701 --> 00:15:10,848
Thank you, sir.

170
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:16,844
You are meticulous at what you do. I think I can rely on you with big projects.

171
00:15:16,852 --> 00:15:18,686
Just leave them to me.

172
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:21,251
Help out my Hanna when she comes to work.

173
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,519
Yes. You don't need to worry.

174
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,686
I'd like to have lunch with you if it wasn't for a prior engagement.

175
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:30,952
We can do it next time you're free, sir.

176
00:15:30,952 --> 00:15:33,719
Okay. I'll see you again.

177
00:15:33,719 --> 00:15:38,252
Yes, sir. I'll be waiting to hear from you again.

178
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:56,285
It'll be smooth sailing for you from now on.

179
00:15:56,286 --> 00:16:00,119
Thanks. I owe it all... Just a moment.

180
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,145
Oh... What a killjoy.

181
00:16:04,145 --> 00:16:06,060
Who is it?

182
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:08,760
The old man.

183
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:19,627
You made the decision without consulting me.

184
00:16:19,627 --> 00:16:26,559
Is it right for someone in my position to learn about an executive promotion on the intranet?

185
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,160
The decision was made after communicating with the secretary's office.

186
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,460
And the decision came directly from the chairman.

187
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,694
I'm sure someone from the inside made the recommendation.

188
00:16:37,694 --> 00:16:42,857
Why does that matter? It was always going to turn out this way.

189
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:55,310
All I wish for you is to enjoy your stay while it lasts, so I showed my utmost courtesy.

190
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,081
But if that made you feel uncomfortable, I apologize.

191
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:10,748
Please be more careful in the future.

192
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:16,381
Then, I'll be going.

193
00:17:26,481 --> 00:17:29,481
How about a cup of tea in my office?

194
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:39,348
It's a little late, but congratulations on your promotion.

195
00:17:39,348 --> 00:17:43,414
You were so busy with your interviews and stuff.

196
00:17:43,414 --> 00:17:45,147
I owe it all to you.

197
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,613
I've heard that a lot from you, but this time, you sound sincere.

198
00:17:48,614 --> 00:17:51,648
Because I am sincere this time.

199
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:56,013
You know the chairman's head secretary and I went to the same university, don't you?

200
00:17:56,014 --> 00:17:59,248
I recommended you.

201
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,580
Now that you're an executive, you should work like one.

202
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:06,181
What do you mean by that?

203
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:10,214
CD Go, I mean, Senior Director Go,

204
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,148
your telecommunication company ideas, hand them over to Creative Director Kwon.

205
00:18:14,881 --> 00:18:17,680
You're the Chief Creative Officer now.

206
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:21,407
Even if CD Kwon's team does it, it'll be in your portfolio.

207
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:24,581
So who cares who does it? Am I wrong?

208
00:18:25,748 --> 00:18:30,714
The account is a little too big for Department Head Han.

209
00:18:33,848 --> 00:18:36,047
You are right.

210
00:18:36,047 --> 00:18:38,814
I'll tell him to hand them over.

211
00:18:40,481 --> 00:18:41,573
I have high expectations for you.

212
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:44,748
Be a pioneer for others.

213
00:18:46,648 --> 00:18:49,381
Thank you for everything.

214
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:18,247
You summoned us?

215
00:19:18,248 --> 00:19:19,513
It's not anything big.

216
00:19:19,514 --> 00:19:23,348
Transfer all the telecommunication company ideas onto this and give them back to me.

217
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:25,480
Oh, are we doing the telecommunication company ad campaign?

218
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,280
I knew it! Now that we have an executive as our immediate boss, we're advancing.

219
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:32,448
I'll be handing them over to Creative Director Kwon.

220
00:19:32,448 --> 00:19:35,047
What? Why?

221
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,514
Why are we giving our precious baby to someone else?

222
00:19:38,514 --> 00:19:39,751
Who told you to do that?

223
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:41,981
Go and tell Senior Director Go. Our ideas are...

224
00:19:41,981 --> 00:19:44,681
It's Senior Director Go's order.

225
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,513
 Give them to him. 

226
00:19:51,514 --> 00:19:55,047
 If I do it, I can do a better job than Creative Director Kwon... 

227
00:19:55,048 --> 00:20:01,105
 I know, but to our client, experience is just as important as talent. 

228
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:10,836
EunJeong, put it together and hand them over.

229
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:12,930
But...

230
00:20:23,104 --> 00:20:25,637
Take it.

231
00:20:25,637 --> 00:20:29,271
It's just that I know how hard you worked on this...

232
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:36,505
People at the bottom like us do what the people above tell us to do.

233
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:40,271
Thank you, Eun Jeong.

234
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:43,570
- This wasn't so bad. 
 - What do you mean?

235
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:47,370
If you had taken it gladly, I would've felt a little hurt, but you hesitated.

236
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,371
You're crafty.

237
00:20:52,073 --> 00:20:54,939
Let's grab a drink sometime.

238
00:20:54,939 --> 00:20:57,739
The person who suggested is buying!

239
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:06,639
I'm so annoyed. I should move to another company or something.

240
00:21:08,239 --> 00:21:09,106
What's this?

241
00:21:09,107 --> 00:21:13,339
CD Go's team's ideas for the telecommunication company.

242
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,406
Let me call you back.

243
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:19,139
Is this a consolation prize?

244
00:21:21,273 --> 00:21:24,839
How dare you take this and...

245
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:28,673
   

246
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,573
Yes. You can tell me over the phone.

247
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,139
I'll be right there.

248
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,398
   

249
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,206
 Yes. 

250
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,706
Sit down.

251
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:03,137
I hear you're thinking of moving to a new company.

252
00:22:03,137 --> 00:22:06,991
You should be working for the NSA, not at an ad agency.

253
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:12,443
Ms. Kang Hanna is returning to Korea.

254
00:22:12,443 --> 00:22:13,943
What?

255
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:16,776
You expect me to go to the airport and greet a celebrity now?

256
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,542
What are you talking about?

257
00:22:18,543 --> 00:22:23,176
Isn't Kang Hanna that actress from that TV drama?

258
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:24,609
Oh, you...

259
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:27,576
You don't even know the name of the chairman's daughter?

260
00:22:29,943 --> 00:22:34,476
 She's coming to work here soon. You know what that means, don't you? 

261
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:45,876
- Are you finished? 
 - Yes. We should get to the airport.

262
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:50,409
I'm finally going back to my motherland.

263
00:22:52,295 --> 00:22:56,695
People might think you're fighting for independence.

264
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:59,995
I am fighting for independence!

265
00:22:59,995 --> 00:23:03,661
An MBA is a requirement for acquiring my independence.

266
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:08,603
In order to get what I want,

267
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:11,389
I need independence.

268
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:35,195
Ma'am, here is the wine you requested.

269
00:23:43,195 --> 00:23:45,328
Ms. Kang Hanna...

270
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:51,161
I'm sorry. Let me put the macadamia nuts in a dish.

271
00:23:51,161 --> 00:23:52,895
Stop!

272
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:56,327
Why would you put them in a dish?

273
00:23:56,328 --> 00:23:59,994
Well, for special guests, like company owners...

274
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:01,861
So, it's special treatment for conglomerate owners?

275
00:24:01,861 --> 00:24:05,295
No, I mean... there was a big issue in the past with...

276
00:24:05,295 --> 00:24:08,695
Aha! The nuts!

277
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,528
Thank you.

278
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,428
This is how you bait the trolls.

279
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:44,566
Stay tuned, sloppy attention-mongers, the queen is on her way.

280
00:25:05,763 --> 00:25:09,362
It's been more than ten years but stewardesses are still having a hard time,

281
00:25:09,363 --> 00:25:11,729
if you have less money than me, don't try to abuse your power.

282
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,230
No! Take it all down!

283
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,260
     

284
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,862
You almost caused the plane to redirect!

285
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:35,762
Reporters have Kang Hanna's social media account bookmarked.

286
00:25:35,763 --> 00:25:39,437
It's my job to prevent problems before they arise.

287
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:41,539
And...

288
00:25:42,193 --> 00:25:44,393
You should walk.

289
00:25:44,393 --> 00:25:48,364
We developed all this technology to help make our lives comfortable, so why should I walk?

290
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:50,364
Walking is so disgusting.

291
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,164
You're not a child. Aren't you embarrassed that people might see you?

292
00:25:53,165 --> 00:25:57,731
Not at all. Why should I care what others think? I do what I want.

293
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:03,231
Mr. Kim.

294
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:07,998
It's been a long time.

295
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:10,331
The one person whose opinion she cares about is here.

296
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:13,665
Oh! What brings the head secretary all the way to the airport?

297
00:26:13,665 --> 00:26:15,731
I had to come of course.

298
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:18,098
Does this mean you're on my side now?

299
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:21,998
I'm on the chairman's side.

300
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,031
I knew it. You've got a good sense of insurance.

301
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:28,965
Of all the subsidiary companies, you could head the insurance company in the future!

302
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,565
Is that a proposal?

303
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:31,997
Of course not!

304
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:36,098
I wouldn't dare.

305
00:26:36,865 --> 00:26:41,131
I'm not greedy. Goodbye.

306
00:26:43,622 --> 00:26:46,120
You're not greedy?

307
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,820
Yeah, right.

308
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,760
     

309
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:56,497
Where to, sir?

310
00:26:56,498 --> 00:26:57,498
The ad agency.

311
00:26:57,499 --> 00:26:59,231
   

312
00:27:08,698 --> 00:27:10,064
   

313
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:12,431
   

314
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,931
   

315
00:27:23,265 --> 00:27:27,597
Hello, I'm Jeong Su Jeong, your secretary.

316
00:27:27,598 --> 00:27:29,364
It's nice to meet you.

317
00:27:29,365 --> 00:27:30,365
Okay.

318
00:27:30,366 --> 00:27:33,965
Let me know if you need anything.

319
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:49,698
 Your promotion is just the beginning! 

320
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:52,664
 If you become CEO, you get another point. 

321
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:56,331
 You now have the four conditions men like. 

322
00:28:01,231 --> 00:28:02,698
   

323
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:09,565
Congratulations.

324
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:13,065
I'm Kim Tae Wan, the head secretary at headquarters.

325
00:28:14,231 --> 00:28:17,031
These are from the chairman.

326
00:28:18,331 --> 00:28:19,497
The chairman?

327
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,330
Normally, he doesn't send gifts to anyone promoted below the president level.

328
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:25,998
But you're a very special case.

329
00:28:26,598 --> 00:28:30,798
I'll try my best not to disappoint him.

330
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:33,331
I'm glad to hear that.

331
00:28:33,331 --> 00:28:34,998
Excuse me?

332
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:42,998
Yes, sir. I'm with her. I will.

333
00:28:43,665 --> 00:28:45,698
It's the chairman.

334
00:28:50,498 --> 00:28:52,598
Hello, sir.

335
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:55,465
Senior Director Go, congratulations.

336
00:28:56,231 --> 00:28:59,798
I will do my best so I do not burden you in any way.

337
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,465
You are now the face of my group.

338
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:07,310
   

339
00:29:08,131 --> 00:29:10,564
"A girl crush for the woman who broke the glass ceiling.

340
00:29:10,565 --> 00:29:13,197
The company that focuses on talent, and not education level.

341
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:16,831
The essence of the company's brand image as a women-friendly group.

342
00:29:16,831 --> 00:29:20,998
You're an expert in this industry, so you must understand, right?"

343
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:24,530
Yes, sir. I won't forget what you said.

344
00:29:24,531 --> 00:29:27,530
"Pay attention to every detail, from your makeup to your outfits,

345
00:29:27,531 --> 00:29:31,931
as if you are the model of my company and not just a senior director."

346
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:35,970
The model?

347
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:39,556
Yes, I won't forget.

348
00:29:39,556 --> 00:29:42,397
"Good. Just accept it all.

349
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,565
I have high hopes for you. Goodbye."

350
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:59,323
Isn't this going a little overboard with compliments? It's not like Mr. Kim.

351
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:04,737
Why did you come straight here instead of going home or meeting your friends?

352
00:30:04,737 --> 00:30:07,831
When do I start? Tomorrow? The day after?

353
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:10,931
Hey, you need to take it slow.

354
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:12,131
Slow? Why?

355
00:30:12,132 --> 00:30:16,199
Just sit tight until I get things sorted out.

356
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:19,665
What is there to sort out?

357
00:30:20,765 --> 00:30:25,699
Oh, since I'm here anyway, have you made your decision?

358
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:32,332
It looks like Senior Director Choi hasn't told you yet.

359
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:36,879
What are you talking about?

360
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:48,879
Will you be taking a university professor position or a small ad agency's CEO position?

361
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:57,646
Oh... Senior Director Choi. He never wraps things up.

362
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:07,479
 Why should I tell her that? 

363
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:10,713
 The line of command should be strict in a company. 

364
00:31:10,713 --> 00:31:12,978
 Just give it to her straight. Don't beat around the bush. 

365
00:31:12,979 --> 00:31:15,612
 It shouldn't come from another senior director. 

366
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,745
 You're like the chairman's proxy, 

367
00:31:17,746 --> 00:31:20,712
 so if it comes from your mouth, she won't have any choice but to accept. 

368
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,812
 Oh, but I can't handle it when women cry. 

369
00:31:23,813 --> 00:31:26,278
 - I'm actually worse at it than you. 
 - No, you're not. 

370
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,713
 It's because I have a daughter. 

371
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,612
An executive position is always temporary.

372
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:57,446
Exactly one year is your term, so think it over and let me know.

373
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:01,813
Whichever you choose from the two, I will make it happen.

374
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:08,413
But I just talked to the chairman and...

375
00:32:11,046 --> 00:32:13,346
Oh, I'm disappointed.

376
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:17,713
You're more naive than I had expected.

377
00:32:18,513 --> 00:32:20,979
What do you mean by...

378
00:32:21,879 --> 00:32:24,046
Just accept it all.

379
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,113
 Good. Just accept it all. 

380
00:32:30,113 --> 00:32:32,213
"I have high hopes for you."

381
00:32:32,213 --> 00:32:34,379
 I have high hopes for you. 

382
00:32:41,146 --> 00:32:43,413
   

383
00:32:44,613 --> 00:32:47,346
 I have high hopes for you. 

384
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:49,746
 Just accept it all. 

385
00:33:17,479 --> 00:33:20,812
Department Head, I mean, Creative Director Han.

386
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:23,046
What's with you?

387
00:33:23,046 --> 00:33:27,046
I'm not a creative director yet. What is it?

388
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,913
Should I send this to the client as it is?

389
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:32,874
Senior Director Go was in charge of this when she was a creative director,

390
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:34,940
so I'll check with her first.

391
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,674
Oh, yes. See you when you return.

392
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:37,973
You look happy these days.

393
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,007
- Oh, yes. I'll keep working hard. 
 - Okay.

394
00:33:55,907 --> 00:33:59,274
Yes, I think she's on her way there.

395
00:34:03,763 --> 00:34:07,163
Okay.

396
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:09,729
She's coming here?

397
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,529
3, 2,

398
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:17,429
1, ding.

399
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,860
   

400
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:23,663
Oh, Ms. Chief of Production, welcome.

401
00:34:23,663 --> 00:34:26,701
Creative Director Kwon, give us some privacy.

402
00:34:26,701 --> 00:34:28,428
Just tell me.

403
00:34:28,428 --> 00:34:31,561
I'm sure it's about work.

404
00:34:32,428 --> 00:34:36,928
I'm all ears, Senior Director.

405
00:34:41,294 --> 00:34:43,628
Is it true?

406
00:34:43,628 --> 00:34:45,661
Is what true?

407
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:49,294
Is it true?

408
00:34:50,428 --> 00:34:52,493
You need to spell it out.

409
00:34:52,494 --> 00:34:56,861
I didn't know you could beat around the bush, too.

410
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:03,593
People make mistakes when they lose their temper.

411
00:35:03,594 --> 00:35:07,928
Let's talk after you regain your composure.

412
00:35:14,561 --> 00:35:20,694
In about... one year, you'll be calm, won't you?

413
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:25,128
One year would be perfect!

414
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:28,728
Do you think you won?

415
00:35:28,728 --> 00:35:30,528
No.

416
00:35:30,528 --> 00:35:32,993
I never fought with you.

417
00:35:32,994 --> 00:35:37,261
You're the one who had an imaginary fight with me.

418
00:35:49,361 --> 00:35:53,361
You got the executive position you dreamed of. What more do you want?

419
00:35:54,894 --> 00:36:00,128
You know better than anyone that you don't qualify to be an executive.

420
00:36:01,028 --> 00:36:04,728
Why are you so greedy?

421
00:36:08,461 --> 00:36:10,893
Don't try to climb up to where others are.

422
00:36:10,894 --> 00:36:17,161
If you do, it will only bring you misery and pain.

423
00:36:25,128 --> 00:36:27,928
Please look after me for the next year.

424
00:36:27,928 --> 00:36:30,527
I will use the idea you gave me

425
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:33,694
for the telecommunication company ad campaign and do a good job.

426
00:38:01,161 --> 00:38:03,761
Vehicle 1008, pull over.

427
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:06,261
Vehicle 1008, pull over ahead.

428
00:38:24,828 --> 00:38:29,128
 It's a nice world. I should enjoy it for as long as I can. 

429
00:38:51,894 --> 00:38:54,228
You are the owner of vehicle 1008, right?

430
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:57,828
You ran a red light, so we followed you.

431
00:38:57,828 --> 00:39:00,693
Ma'am, are you okay?

432
00:39:00,694 --> 00:39:02,994
Are you looking for something?

433
00:39:09,494 --> 00:39:12,861
Where is it? Where is it?

434
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,128
Are you all right? Should I call 911?

435
00:39:39,061 --> 00:39:44,061
 Mom, you're not leaving me, are you? 

436
00:39:45,528 --> 00:39:50,893
 Your mother took my brother away and now you're trying to outdo my real daughter. 

437
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:05,861
 I won't run away. 

438
00:40:40,961 --> 00:40:43,594
I won't run away.

439
00:40:45,728 --> 00:40:48,228
I won't run away.

440
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:53,394
I won't run.

441
00:41:43,894 --> 00:41:46,293
You're still here?

442
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:49,528
I thought you might want to hear this.

443
00:41:49,528 --> 00:41:51,494
What is it?

444
00:41:51,494 --> 00:41:54,128
It's about Senior Director Go Ah In.

445
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,528
   

446
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:40,461
 I recommended you. 

447
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:57,261
 I have high expectations for you. Be a pioneer for others. 

448
00:42:57,261 --> 00:43:00,861
 You're more naive than I had expected. 

449
00:43:05,694 --> 00:43:10,794
 Exactly one year... is your term. 

450
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:14,093
 - Just accept it all. 
 - Just accept it all. 

451
00:43:14,094 --> 00:43:17,061
 - I have high hopes for you. 
 - I have high hopes for you. 

452
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:26,228
 Don't try to climb up to where others are. 

453
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:31,494
 If you do, it will only bring you misery and pain. 

454
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:49,300
♫  Even if I stretch out my hand  ♫

455
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:54,310
♫  A place that can't be reached  ♫

456
00:43:54,310 --> 00:44:00,870
♫  There is far away, a shining light  ♫

457
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:10,200
♫  Grab me with both hands  ♫

458
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:19,100
♫  I might lose you as you get farther away  ♫

459
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:28,880
♫  You, you are at the end of this road  ♫

460
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,120
♫  An unknown somewhere far away  ♫

461
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:47,070
♫  Oh, I'll protect you somehow  ♫

462
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:56,100
♫  Don't lose the most important thing  ♫

463
00:44:56,100 --> 00:45:00,110
♫  Stay there  ♫

464
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:26,861
Everyone must be hoping for me to run away.

465
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:51,340
Oh, really?

466
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,920
- Today, I heard they were having... 
 - Really?

467
00:45:59,828 --> 00:46:01,528
Department Head Han.

468
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:06,560
If it's personal, I'm not interested. If it's about work, I'm interested.

469
00:46:06,561 --> 00:46:08,661
Which is it?

470
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,860
I hear it's only for one year.

471
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:16,927
They promoted her to use her as the face of the company.

472
00:46:16,928 --> 00:46:20,760
To use her to show that VC Group is woman-friendly.

473
00:46:20,761 --> 00:46:23,493
I knew it. I thought maybe Senior Director Choi had lost his mind.

474
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:24,228
Senior Director Choi?

475
00:46:24,229 --> 00:46:26,128
- What are they talking about? 
 - I thought it was actually something good.

476
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:28,627
- What was? 
 - If I also worked hard,

477
00:46:28,628 --> 00:46:32,593
I thought I could also become an executive.

478
00:46:32,594 --> 00:46:35,293
- You can't. 
 - Why not?

479
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,794
They have to choose someone with a nice face.

480
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,127
Hey, seriously.

481
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:41,528
What are they saying?

482
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:48,380
I think so, too.

483
00:46:50,428 --> 00:46:53,528
Finish your coffee and come back. I'll see you later.

484
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:00,693
Is the senior director in?

485
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,294
Yes.

486
00:47:32,694 --> 00:47:34,694
You heard?

487
00:47:36,461 --> 00:47:41,128
What? Do you have something to say to me, too?

488
00:47:47,728 --> 00:47:50,061
You think you made a mistake by siding with me?

489
00:47:50,061 --> 00:47:55,028
You regret it, don't you? Thinking I'm finished here, no?

490
00:47:57,894 --> 00:47:59,594
What?

491
00:48:01,161 --> 00:48:04,894
Do you want to go to Senior Director Choi, get down on your knees, and kiss his ass?

492
00:48:11,428 --> 00:48:13,894
You did a good job bandaging your hand.

493
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:21,294
It's not easy to tend to your own wounds.

494
00:48:23,161 --> 00:48:25,494
You're amazing.

495
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:29,761
It couldn't have been easy for you to come in today.

496
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:36,528
I'll go and talk to him.

497
00:48:39,028 --> 00:48:41,228
There's a limit.

498
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:45,994
There's something called a line.

499
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:48,028
Don't.

500
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:52,427
At companies, when someone wins, someone else loses. I know that.

501
00:48:52,428 --> 00:48:55,893
- I'm not a child. But still, this is... 
 - Don't do it.

502
00:48:55,893 --> 00:48:58,628
I'm going to go see Senior Director Choi...

503
00:48:59,894 --> 00:49:02,494
and also cross the line myself.

504
00:49:02,494 --> 00:49:04,628
I said, don't do it!

505
00:49:06,594 --> 00:49:11,861
If you get involved, you'll only make me look like a joke. Don't you know?

506
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:22,628
When it rains, I have to get wet.

507
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,828
You may leave.

508
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:48,260
   

509
00:50:16,494 --> 00:50:18,861
How can you eat that at a time like this?

510
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:20,561
It's good.

511
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:23,494
You should be having wine and premium beef and gathering up your strength, not...

512
00:50:23,494 --> 00:50:25,328
For now, this is perfect for me.

513
00:50:25,328 --> 00:50:27,661
How can you say such a thing?

514
00:50:27,661 --> 00:50:30,027
You're the CCO, so you must have a company credit card with a high limit.

515
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:32,528
And your salary must be even higher.

516
00:50:38,928 --> 00:50:41,228
It's because I keep forgetting.

517
00:50:44,428 --> 00:50:49,828
About what kind of person I am and where I'm from.

518
00:50:58,361 --> 00:51:01,328
Put it behind you.

519
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:05,494
And don't go against Senior Director Choi.

520
00:51:05,494 --> 00:51:13,260
Of all my subordinates, you are the most talented, and you hold the highest position.

521
00:51:13,761 --> 00:51:17,060
And being a university professor or the CEO of a small ad agency isn't such a bad thing.

522
00:51:17,061 --> 00:51:22,428
Just be the chief of production for a year. That's a big enough success.

523
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:28,561
Big enough...

524
00:51:29,594 --> 00:51:33,728
Is that because of my poor background?

525
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:36,961
Don't twist my words.

526
00:51:39,661 --> 00:51:44,394
Do you think I lived like this just to give up after ending up here?

527
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:49,093
Do you think I don't know what people call me behind my back? A nutcase who only cares about her career and money?

528
00:51:49,093 --> 00:51:51,160
How dare others decide my limits?

529
00:51:51,161 --> 00:51:54,328
What right does Senior Director Choi have to decide my future?

530
00:52:02,194 --> 00:52:07,728
Ah In, you can't beat Senior Director Choi inside the company.

531
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:12,460
If you go up against him, you'll end up like me! You saw it yourself.

532
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,261
You saw what happened to me when he and I became enemies!

533
00:52:16,494 --> 00:52:19,194
   

534
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,400
   

535
00:52:36,161 --> 00:52:38,994
You don't have a lot of stuff to pack.

536
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:44,861
Hey! How can you all be so heartless?

537
00:52:44,861 --> 00:52:47,528
Now that he's leaving, you don't care about him anymore?

538
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:51,328
You should help him pack.

539
00:52:55,361 --> 00:52:58,961
Now that you lost your job, they're turning their backs on you.

540
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:04,827
Since we began working here together, I should be more considerate. Would you like my help?

541
00:53:04,827 --> 00:53:06,027
Get lost.

542
00:53:06,028 --> 00:53:09,094
Jeong Seok, working in advertising

543
00:53:09,094 --> 00:53:12,528
isn't really a lifetime gig, is it?

544
00:53:12,528 --> 00:53:16,827
Isn't it great? You can spend time with your family

545
00:53:16,828 --> 00:53:19,728
and catch up on reading at home.

546
00:53:20,828 --> 00:53:24,328
I wish I could take time off like you, too.

547
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:30,527
I'm jealous.

548
00:53:30,528 --> 00:53:32,628
You piece of trash!

549
00:53:32,628 --> 00:53:36,828
Hey, Choi Chang Soo! What you did to me...

550
00:53:36,828 --> 00:53:39,261
Let go! Let go!

551
00:53:39,261 --> 00:53:42,294
Let go!

552
00:53:42,294 --> 00:53:44,894
Choi Chang Soo,

553
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:49,894
you bastard! This isn't over! This isn't!

554
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:54,161
This isn't over? It pretty much looks like it is.

555
00:53:54,161 --> 00:53:56,094
What are you waiting for?

556
00:53:56,094 --> 00:53:58,828
Clear that useless thing out of this building.

557
00:53:58,828 --> 00:54:02,827
Hey, useless? Useless thing?

558
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:05,594
I'm useless?

559
00:54:06,261 --> 00:54:09,528
Let go of me.

560
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:32,594
Do you know when people become the most docile?

561
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:38,061
I'm not sure. When they have lost?

562
00:54:39,094 --> 00:54:42,628
You're right. Only then can you survive.

563
00:54:44,128 --> 00:54:47,128
Running away is embarrassing,

564
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:50,993
but it's a necessity for survival.

565
00:54:50,993 --> 00:54:57,161
But there are those who become even more vicious when they lose.

566
00:54:57,828 --> 00:55:01,461
And they were the ones who made history.

567
00:55:04,861 --> 00:55:10,028
That's what I'm going to do. Make history.

568
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:43,461
   
   

569
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,227
Go to Human Resources and bring me the Creative Teams' personnel files.

570
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:52,528
What? Personnel files?

571
00:55:52,528 --> 00:55:54,561
And a copy of the company bylaws.

572
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,161
Yes, ma'am...

573
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:04,361
What is it?

574
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:08,594
Senior Director Go wants me to bring her Production Team's personnel files.

575
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:11,494
Give them to her.

576
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:13,361
And the company bylaws, too...

577
00:56:13,361 --> 00:56:15,261
Bylaws?

578
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:19,127
Give them to her.

579
00:56:19,128 --> 00:56:21,294
 Yes, sir. 

580
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:27,861
Now that she's a senior director, she needs to promote her people.

581
00:56:28,961 --> 00:56:32,961
I'll let her have that much.

582
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:43,894
 If you have to go up against him, use the power Choi Chang Soo gave you to do it. 

583
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:46,294
 What power? 

584
00:56:46,294 --> 00:56:48,928
 The same power he used against me. 

585
00:56:55,728 --> 00:56:58,294
 The ultimate power an executive possesses. 

586
00:56:58,928 --> 00:57:01,194
 That's the only way. 

587
00:57:08,394 --> 00:57:10,228
Department Head Han, come to my office.

588
00:57:10,228 --> 00:57:12,061
Yes.

589
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:21,094
Eun Jeong, do you have a minute?

590
00:57:21,094 --> 00:57:21,861
Yes.

591
00:57:21,862 --> 00:57:27,428
While I talk to Senior Director Go, keep her secretary busy.

592
00:57:27,428 --> 00:57:28,928
What for?

593
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:35,261
The walls have ears. I'm trying to plug those ears.

594
00:57:45,294 --> 00:57:47,828
Hello.

595
00:57:47,828 --> 00:57:52,928
We never said hello. I'm Cho Eun Jeong, a copywriter.

596
00:57:52,928 --> 00:57:54,293
- Oh... 
 - Yes.

597
00:57:54,294 --> 00:57:58,194
- Hello. 
 - My name is Jeong Su Jeong.

598
00:57:58,194 --> 00:58:01,761
- Department Head Han. 
 - Yes.

599
00:58:01,761 --> 00:58:03,828
The rain has stopped.

600
00:58:05,028 --> 00:58:09,061
Let's cross the line.

601
00:58:19,261 --> 00:58:23,428
 Don't go home after work. Wait for me. There's someone I have to meet. 

602
00:58:47,544 --> 00:58:51,344
I hope we can work well together in the future.

603
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:06,310
This champagne is from the chairman.

604
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:08,243
Senior Director Go has changed.

605
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,043
Her stance isn't like it used to be.

606
00:59:10,044 --> 00:59:13,510
I'm not sure if we're worthy of this.

607
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:22,844
Whatever the unresolved feelings may be, let's put them all behind us.

608
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,910
So neat.

609
00:59:39,177 --> 00:59:43,877
Ah In, isn't it nice to be friendly?

610
00:59:43,877 --> 00:59:45,209
So true.

611
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,410
This is how you should socialize.

612
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:52,977
I hope you can start fresh at work, starting tomorrow.

613
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:58,010
As long as you do well, we can do that.

614
00:59:58,010 --> 01:00:00,577
I'll get going first then.

615
01:00:05,244 --> 01:00:07,910
Wow, she's changed.

616
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,844
Hey, let's get another drink at someplace nice.

617
01:00:10,844 --> 01:00:14,210
Shall we, the next Chief Creative Officer?

618
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:15,910
Just a second.

619
01:00:16,544 --> 01:00:19,644
Hi, Director Jang.

620
01:00:20,677 --> 01:00:22,877
Yes, Creative Director Kwon.

621
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:28,877
Okay. I'll be right there.

622
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:42,377
Hello, Creative Director Kwon.

623
01:00:42,377 --> 01:00:44,776
- Have a drink! 
 - He's here!

624
01:00:44,777 --> 01:00:47,243
- Why didn't you answer your phone? 
 - Sorry, sorry.

625
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:50,410
Let me make you a drink.

626
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,776
On days like this, we need Director Jang!

627
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,210
I'm going to drink a lot.

628
01:00:56,210 --> 01:00:59,243
- Okay, are you ready? 
 - Yes.

629
01:00:59,244 --> 01:01:02,209
Okay, we'll go around and say the name of the person we love.

630
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:06,543
- All together. 
  - Three, two, one. 

631
01:01:06,544 --> 01:01:08,477
Ring.

632
01:01:08,477 --> 01:01:12,177
Creative Director Kwon, I love you!

633
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,409
So, how much will it be?

634
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:20,577
It's a little more than usual.

635
01:01:21,777 --> 01:01:23,977
Here.

636
01:01:25,444 --> 01:01:27,444
Cheer up.

637
01:01:30,444 --> 01:01:33,510
How much longer must I keep this up?

638
01:01:38,544 --> 01:01:43,177
Hello, sir. Right now?

639
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:50,144
So, you can process it right away. Right?

640
01:01:50,144 --> 01:01:54,344
If that's what you want, I have no other choice.

641
01:01:56,970 --> 01:01:58,730
   

642
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:06,344
I wonder if they finally realize who the chief of production is.

643
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,610
What? Is our client complaining again?

644
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:26,644
You haven't checked the intranet yet?

645
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:29,810
Why? What is it this time?

646
01:02:36,710 --> 01:02:39,810
   

647
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,144
   

648
01:02:48,477 --> 01:02:50,277
What the heck is this?

649
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,277
Hey, what is this?

650
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,510
Go Ah In, you crazy bitch...

651
01:03:04,444 --> 01:03:05,509
What?

652
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:09,744
I didn't sign off on that! Let me find out.

653
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:27,480


654
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:32,760
   

655
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:58,777
 I hope you can start fresh at work, starting tomorrow. 

656
01:03:58,777 --> 01:04:01,509
Words aren't enough. We need to act.

657
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,544
Does Senior Director Choi know?

658
01:04:03,544 --> 01:04:05,444
Let's go!

659
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,230
   

660
01:04:34,544 --> 01:04:38,610
They should be here by now.

661
01:04:42,244 --> 01:04:47,010
   

662
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:53,500
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

663
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:59,920
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

664
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,870
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

665
01:05:04,877 --> 01:05:08,176
 I'm the Chief Creative Officer, why should I care what the Creative Directors think? 

666
01:05:08,177 --> 01:05:09,309
 This is beyond common sense. 

667
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:12,976
 My job is to fight the stereotypes of common sense. 

668
01:05:12,977 --> 01:05:14,644
 Isn't it customary? 

669
01:05:14,644 --> 01:05:17,076
 Should I fire you in the customary way you like, then? 

670
01:05:17,077 --> 01:05:20,509
 Could you succeed in this tough world in your right mind? 

671
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,709
 You need to act on instinct, that's what a real businessman does. 

672
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:27,144
 Do they say it's cruel when a lion preys on a deer? 

673
01:05:27,144 --> 01:05:29,377
 Even if it's now, please stop. 

674
01:05:29,377 --> 01:05:32,410
 We can announce a decision to dismiss an executive director. 

675
01:05:32,410 --> 01:05:34,276
 Please call the executive meeting. 

676
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:37,877
 If you step down on your own, of course I'd be thankful. 

677
01:05:37,877 --> 01:05:43,930
 The decision has been approved by the chairman.
