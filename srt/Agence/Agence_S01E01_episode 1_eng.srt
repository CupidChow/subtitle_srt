1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:10,100


2
00:00:54,938 --> 00:00:58,138
 I've been waiting. 

3
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:30,472
 What is it? Are you surprised because I'm different from other girls? 

4
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:44,471
 Go beyond being the first and be the best. 

5
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,872
 Maintain grace despite being desperate. 

6
00:01:47,872 --> 00:01:52,005
 Give up from time to time for self-preservation. 

7
00:02:02,738 --> 00:02:05,638
 Why should others decide my limits? 

8
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:08,671
 Her story of success grabs the world's attention. 

9
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:12,305
 Female warrior training RPG game: FIGHTER QUEEN. 

10
00:02:12,972 --> 00:02:15,605
 Download now. 

11
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,590
   

12
00:02:24,038 --> 00:02:27,438
If you don't have any questions, that's it for my presentation.

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,272
As expected, Go Ah In is on another level.

14
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,130
   

15
00:02:31,138 --> 00:02:33,405
 You worked hard. 

16
00:02:36,472 --> 00:02:39,505
I didn't want to do this advertisement with you.

17
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:40,654
That's weird.

18
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:42,904
Both my company and I are the best in the industry.

19
00:02:42,905 --> 00:02:44,305
That's why.

20
00:02:44,305 --> 00:02:46,672
I'm into hero stories.

21
00:02:46,672 --> 00:02:49,138
The stories where the weak become the strong.

22
00:02:49,138 --> 00:02:53,004
The No. 1 winning again and running an ad campaign that's worth tens of millions of dollars.

23
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,271
It's not touching.

24
00:02:55,272 --> 00:02:57,938
It may not be touching, but it's profitable.

25
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:05,716
True. I think I figured out why they are going with you.

26
00:03:07,372 --> 00:03:12,104
I just gave you a hint about the presentation results, but you don't seem to be that excited.

27
00:03:12,104 --> 00:03:13,972
- That's because I'm used to it. 
 - About what?

28
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:16,205
Winning.

29
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,938
You're very cold-hearted.

30
00:03:17,938 --> 00:03:19,504
I'll interpret that as being level-headed.

31
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:22,472
Doesn't showing excitement make things more exciting?

32
00:03:22,472 --> 00:03:25,004
Sir, when you show excitement when good things happen,

33
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:28,005
lamenting when bad things happen becomes a habit.

34
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:30,505
I'm sure you know that better than I do, no?

35
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:35,838
Let's have dinner.

36
00:03:35,838 --> 00:03:38,005
I'll be waiting for your call.

37
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,930
   

38
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,570
   

39
00:03:47,572 --> 00:03:49,638
   

40
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,238
- What did he say? 
 - Let's get ready for it to air.

41
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,838
Yes!

42
00:04:02,138 --> 00:04:04,904
- Aren't you happy? 
 - Let's go.

43
00:04:24,072 --> 00:04:30,305
   

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,370
   

45
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:34,970
   

46
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,204
   

47
00:04:37,205 --> 00:04:38,738
   

48
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,905
Thank you.

49
00:04:42,505 --> 00:04:45,638
Yes, I'll call you again.

50
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:56,205
Just how big is Go Ah In's head going to become...

51
00:04:56,205 --> 00:04:58,438
She got it?

52
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,472
Damn it...

53
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:03,004
It is both impactful and time appropriate.

54
00:05:03,005 --> 00:05:06,138
Who cares? It's misandry. 
  (Anyone with a prejudice against men) 

55
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:09,938
Why is that misandry? Are you a prince?

56
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:13,172
To become so furious about beheading a white horse?

57
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:19,605
CD Go, I knew it!

58
00:05:19,605 --> 00:05:23,472
I knew you could do it the moment I saw your draft proposal.

59
00:05:23,472 --> 00:05:25,405
But I remember you rejecting it.

60
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:28,905
It was just an opinion to help you improve your work.

61
00:05:28,905 --> 00:05:30,238
You got the results already?

62
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,238
Their executive director and I went to the same university.

63
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,304
The information I gave you worked, right?

64
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:39,272
Yes. I owe it all to you.

65
00:05:42,372 --> 00:05:44,372
Good job.

66
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,972
Since I'm doing a good job, what if I did a little more of it?

67
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,371
I heard the annual telecommunication company presentation is coming up.

68
00:05:50,372 --> 00:05:56,145
Don't you think I should do the telecommunication company presentation, too?

69
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:57,538
What do you think?

70
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,638
Hey!

71
00:06:08,772 --> 00:06:13,772
But CD Kwon has always worked on that.

72
00:06:13,772 --> 00:06:17,972
You know that telecommunication company jobs come with a large payout but they are easy.

73
00:06:17,972 --> 00:06:21,537
Then, when are you going to give me an easy client with a large payout?

74
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,105
Easy doesn't go well with Go Ah In.

75
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:32,838
Get prime Korean beef.

76
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:39,038
I have to run.

77
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:48,305
CD Go, congratulations.

78
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:49,871
Congratulations.

79
00:06:49,872 --> 00:06:52,538
- Congrats. 
 - Congratulations.

80
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,771
- As if she owns the place... 
 - Like the world revolves around her.

81
00:06:56,771 --> 00:07:00,972
Let her be. She doesn't have much time left anyway.

82
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:07,972
The CCO position has been vacant for several months now, and one of us will get promoted.

83
00:07:07,972 --> 00:07:12,905
That means someone here has to work under them.

84
00:07:12,905 --> 00:07:14,137
True.

85
00:07:14,138 --> 00:07:15,404
It's a last-ditch effort.

86
00:07:15,405 --> 00:07:21,004
It's customary for you to leave if your colleague or subordinate gets promoted to an executive position.

87
00:07:21,004 --> 00:07:25,972
I started working here with Go Ah In, and the rest started after me.

88
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:30,438
So that must mean one of us will become the chief of production, right?

89
00:07:38,138 --> 00:07:40,105
Probably...

90
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,980
   

91
00:07:56,205 --> 00:08:00,472
I'm Jo Eun Jeong, and it's my first day as a copywriter.

92
00:08:00,472 --> 00:08:02,538
You're a copywriter on Creative Director Go Ah In's team, right?

93
00:08:02,538 --> 00:08:04,738
Why are you here?

94
00:08:04,738 --> 00:08:07,872
What? Uh...

95
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:11,737
CD Go called me, and...

96
00:08:11,738 --> 00:08:17,038
If you want to stay alive, run away. CD Go is...

97
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:27,072
   

98
00:08:35,772 --> 00:08:37,337
Hello.

99
00:08:37,337 --> 00:08:40,105
Hi, let's make this work.

100
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,972
Yes, ma'am!

101
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:46,905
Hello.

102
00:09:06,805 --> 00:09:08,037
You've worked hard.

103
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,104
When do you start your new job?

104
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:12,171
Two weeks from now.

105
00:09:12,172 --> 00:09:14,638
I talked to the creative director there.

106
00:09:17,338 --> 00:09:18,637
Thank you.

107
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,238
Don't say something you don't mean. Go.

108
00:09:29,872 --> 00:09:32,505
I need to say one thing before I go.

109
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:37,938
You're a hypocrite.

110
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:45,704
You pretend to be a humanist in the ads you make, but the truth is

111
00:09:45,705 --> 00:09:47,971
you are a sociopath who's crazy about your own success

112
00:09:47,972 --> 00:09:52,972
and you use your own team members as mere tools!

113
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:04,805
How long did you work with me?

114
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:05,805
A year.

115
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:09,038
For a whole year, all you did was spew gibberish,

116
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:12,072
and you chose your last day to say something insightful.

117
00:10:13,138 --> 00:10:16,272
Good. You should be like this at your new job.

118
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:35,738
Creative Director Go, since it's Eun Jeong's first day, why don't we go out and eat together?

119
00:10:35,738 --> 00:10:39,738
Wouldn't having pork amongst yourselves be more enjoyable than having prime beef with me?

120
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,805
I'm off.

121
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:46,238
Goodbye.

122
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,500
♫  Four walls up late and the radios buzzing  ♫

123
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:11,400
♫  It's keeping me awake, maybe I should say something  ♫

124
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:21,020
♫  'Cause I can't read you anymore, we've forgotten 
 what we're together for  ♫

125
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:29,380
♫  Don't say we're falling apart. 'Cause now we're running in circles,  and searching for purpose  ♫

126
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:37,550
♫  Are you just protecting your heart, have we gone 
 cold on the surface  ♫

127
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,270
♫  Don't say we're falling apart  ♫

128
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:46,205
I don't get the trends these days.

129
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:55,370
♫  Don't say we're falling apart. 'Cause now we're running in circles,  and searching for purpose  ♫

130
00:11:55,372 --> 00:11:58,038
- Were you waiting for me? 
 - No.

131
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:00,872
Evening counseling.

132
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,772
Why can't you work like it's work?

133
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,738
What do I look like I'm doing?

134
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:07,605
Fighting a war.

135
00:12:09,472 --> 00:12:11,271
If I lose, I die, so it is a war.

136
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,105
You won't die, even if you don't become a board member.

137
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:17,138
Yes, I will die if I see those who are inferior get ahead of me.

138
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:21,438
Depression, anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and insomnia.

139
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:23,737
You don't have any hobbies and you don't date.

140
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:27,371
Is success worth giving up all the joys you can experience as a human being?

141
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,472
To me, it's worth it.

142
00:12:29,472 --> 00:12:31,472
Then, what about you?

143
00:12:32,438 --> 00:12:38,105
You use yourself as a tool for success because success has become your goal.

144
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:43,038
So what does that make you as a human being?

145
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:55,672
I'm tired. Stop with the psychoanalyzing and give me my medication.

146
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,780
   

147
00:13:08,438 --> 00:13:11,672
I'm giving these to you because you said it's an important time for you...

148
00:13:11,672 --> 00:13:14,138
This isn't just any kind of medication.

149
00:13:19,638 --> 00:13:22,972
Oh, it's beautiful, just beautiful.

150
00:13:22,972 --> 00:13:25,672
If it's pretty, you should protect it, not eat it up.

151
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:29,431
What are you talking about? I must become one with these lovely things.

152
00:13:29,431 --> 00:13:30,704
I am you, and you are me.

153
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:34,038
Wow, copywriters say the craziest things.

154
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:40,204
It's an occupational hazard. I want to take a break, but I can't stop blurting out phrases like those.

155
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:43,438
What else can I do but shut myself up with meat?

156
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,771
You should talk to Creative Director Go like you're talking now.

157
00:13:46,772 --> 00:13:47,972
Are you crazy?

158
00:13:47,972 --> 00:13:51,654
You can only do it because you worked with her for ten years. Wait, no.

159
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,305
he feels the most uncomfortable in her presence.

160
00:13:54,838 --> 00:13:56,738
That's true.

161
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,490
   

162
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,460
   

163
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:44,370
So, General Manager, what is Creative Director Go like?

164
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:47,472
She's like an elephant.

165
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:51,371
No way. I've heard things. She's not an herbivore.

166
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:58,371
There's an Indian saying that goes, "When the elephant passes, a path is made."

167
00:14:58,371 --> 00:15:05,671
Whatever Creative Director Go does, every other creative director in this field copies.

168
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:07,638
And she's not exactly like the rumors.

169
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:09,372
Which rumor?

170
00:15:09,938 --> 00:15:13,572
Oh... the "money-ciopath" one?

171
00:15:15,672 --> 00:15:20,605
Eun Jeong, you don't know why Copywriter Hong left the company, do you?

172
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,360
   

173
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,210
   

174
00:15:40,305 --> 00:15:41,504
 How long have you been doing this? 

175
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,338
 Uh... it's been eight years. 

176
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,738
 Do you want to continue doing this? 

177
00:15:44,738 --> 00:15:48,605
 Yes, I like writing ad copies. 

178
00:15:48,605 --> 00:15:51,105
 Really? You like writing ad copies? 

179
00:15:51,105 --> 00:15:55,072
 Yes. It was my dream since I was young. 

180
00:15:55,072 --> 00:15:58,338
 Then you've taken the wrong path ever since you were young. 

181
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:06,372
 A person should have a job they are good at, not a job they like. 

182
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:12,005
 Sometimes, hope can turn into a delusion. 

183
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,404
 - Copywriter Hong. 
 - Yes. 

184
00:16:15,404 --> 00:16:18,905
 Stop trying and find yourself another job. 

185
00:16:20,238 --> 00:16:22,305
Hey, hey. Wait, wait.

186
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:25,805
Here. You're in shock.

187
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:28,238
It's understandable.

188
00:16:29,638 --> 00:16:32,005
What do you think you're doing?

189
00:16:35,572 --> 00:16:39,504
Eun Jeong, Copywriter Hong was pretty bad at her job.

190
00:16:39,505 --> 00:16:43,371
Right. The creative director was a little harsh, but...

191
00:16:43,372 --> 00:16:47,672
I mean, what are you doing while we have such quality beef in front of us?

192
00:16:47,672 --> 00:16:52,971
This is Korean beef we're talking about. Where are your manners?

193
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,570
   

194
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,710
   

195
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:30,338
 This isn't just any kind of medication. It's a last resort. 

196
00:17:30,338 --> 00:17:35,138
 If you can help it, don't take it, and when you do, never after drinking! 

197
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,290
   

198
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:42,438
There are so many people who say no to me.

199
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,905
You're the first to arrive, yet again.

200
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:45,905
You're the first one to arrive again.

201
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,772
Won't you please say hi to me?

202
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,605
Are you coming home tonight or tomorrow?

203
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,605
Last night was the first office outing, so I really had no choice.

204
00:20:02,605 --> 00:20:06,172
I'll come home early tonight. I promise.

205
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:11,271
I'm serious! I promise!

206
00:20:11,272 --> 00:20:14,104
You shouldn't make promises you can't keep.

207
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:15,605
Says who?

208
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,638
Grandmother.

209
00:20:18,238 --> 00:20:22,638
Of faith, hope, and love, the greatest is faith.

210
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:27,572
Yes, yes, you can have faith in me. I'll come home on time tonight.

211
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:30,038
Should we have pizza tonight with mom?

212
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:35,472
Okay! Tonight, I will keep my promise, I'm serious.

213
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,772
You're cute. My son.

214
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:47,372
I'll be back later, bye.

215
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,805
Hello.

216
00:21:17,305 --> 00:21:20,238
Sorry, sorry.

217
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:22,371
I'm sorry, but just until the bus starts moving...

218
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:24,672
You can stay.

219
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:26,871
But it'll be uncomfortable for you...

220
00:21:26,872 --> 00:21:28,371
If I cared about comfort, I would take a cab.

221
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:31,705
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:21:41,938 --> 00:21:45,904
There's something I have to do. Don't mind me.

223
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,938
Oh, my.

224
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:08,238
Who did you drink with last night?

225
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:10,137
I had a drink with Director Jang.

226
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:11,437
From which production company?

227
00:22:11,438 --> 00:22:14,271
I'm doing the telecommunication company presentation with Director Jang.

228
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,205
Where?

229
00:22:15,206 --> 00:22:18,671
Remember the room salon in Nonhyeon that I took you to last time?

230
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,172
You've been a busy boy, getting free drinks everywhere.

231
00:22:22,172 --> 00:22:27,104
We do all the work, but the production company makes all the money with only a few days of light filming.

232
00:22:27,104 --> 00:22:29,105
So this is nothing...

233
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:32,438
Don't overdo it. People might talk.

234
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:36,338
What could they do? We're the ones who hire them.

235
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:41,005
So, why did you want to see me so early in the morning?

236
00:22:42,872 --> 00:22:48,172
Senior Director. Sir!  Can we please talk about...

237
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:56,805
Hello, sir.

238
00:22:56,805 --> 00:22:59,772
Hi, CD Go. You're at the office, right?

239
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:03,605
Yes. But it's early, what's the occasion?

240
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:08,038
It's good news. Do you have plans for lunch?

241
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,805
I don't.

242
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,505
Let's have lunch with CD Kwon later.

243
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:19,938
With Creative Director Kwon?

244
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,472
Okay.

245
00:23:30,172 --> 00:23:36,204
If I am going to quit, I need to quit cold turkey, but it's not easy. Right?

246
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:38,405
Sir, sir, sir.

247
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:44,272
If I go up against Creative Director Go one-on-one... I could beat her.

248
00:23:44,272 --> 00:23:49,337
- Even if she ranks number one in terms of presentation success, I... 
 - Hey, CD Kwon.

249
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:51,272
Yes, sir!

250
00:23:51,272 --> 00:23:54,072
Have you seen anyone use a saw to put a nail in the wall?

251
00:23:54,738 --> 00:23:57,171
Once the sawing is finished,

252
00:23:57,172 --> 00:24:01,905
you can use a hammer to hang your nameplate on the wall.

253
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,438
Welcome, take a seat.

254
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,571
Is Chinese food okay? I ordered a course meal.

255
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:29,572
Yes. What is this about?

256
00:24:29,572 --> 00:24:33,438
Let's eat first. We can talk about work after.

257
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:49,071
You want to do an in-house bidding for the telecommunication company presentation?

258
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:53,338
Yes, with the senior director position as the prize.

259
00:24:55,738 --> 00:25:02,005
Wouldn't it look better for the CD who's in charge of the biggest account to get promoted?

260
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:06,172
That is what I wanted, but...

261
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:10,238
Senior Director.

262
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:16,438
I mean, that's an exceptional idea.

263
00:25:17,205 --> 00:25:21,238
If the decision is made based on merit, no one will complain.

264
00:25:24,738 --> 00:25:26,338
 You're smiling? 

265
00:25:26,838 --> 00:25:30,705
 When you could lose your account and the senior director position? You smile? 

266
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:40,838
Well, it looks like you two agree.

267
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:42,138
Okay!

268
00:25:42,138 --> 00:25:44,804
If you've finished eating, let's go back.

269
00:25:44,805 --> 00:25:46,305
Okay.

270
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:03,305
Of all teams, why Creative Director Go's team?

271
00:26:03,305 --> 00:26:06,471
Why? Are you saying I'm no match for her?

272
00:26:06,472 --> 00:26:11,837
Even the rumors about Creative Director Go's involvement in the presentation will make other agencies drop out.

273
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,337
To the opponent, she's like a disaster.

274
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:15,972
Unless we play a trick...

275
00:26:15,972 --> 00:26:20,838
Hey! Copywriter Bae, enough with all that negativity.

276
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:23,605
You're as dumb as you look.

277
00:26:25,372 --> 00:26:27,605
Don't you ever look in the mirror?

278
00:26:27,605 --> 00:26:29,737
How many more times must I tell you that appearance is important in this industry?

279
00:26:29,738 --> 00:26:31,371
A copywriter only has to write good ad copies.

280
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:33,004
Why should I have to worry about my appearance...

281
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:38,405
How can someone in advertising say such a thing? Isn't design just as important as function?

282
00:26:38,405 --> 00:26:39,338
Creative Director Kwon, please calm down.

283
00:26:39,338 --> 00:26:41,538
Zip it.

284
00:26:42,672 --> 00:26:46,437
Haven't you thought about why you're still a copywriter when everyone who started after you already became CDs?

285
00:26:46,437 --> 00:26:50,672
Haven't you ever thought about why our clients love Go Ah In so much?

286
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,305
Prepare for the bidding.

287
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,238
Really? Senior Director Choi?

288
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,938
Yes.

289
00:27:11,772 --> 00:27:14,738
We have to win this presentation, don't we?

290
00:27:14,738 --> 00:27:18,838
We'll have to get a taste to find out if it's honey or poison.

291
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,772
Perhaps this is...

292
00:27:21,772 --> 00:27:24,638
A presentation just for show.

293
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:28,838
Outside presentations can't be fixed, but...

294
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:31,705
Senior Director Choi picks the winner for the in-house bidding...

295
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:33,638
Right.

296
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,905
So it's a checkmate...

297
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,672
Let's think about that after we win the presentation.

298
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:45,772
Even if we do win, do you think it's possible?

299
00:27:45,772 --> 00:27:48,305
You're not one of Senior Director Choi's people.

300
00:27:49,706 --> 00:27:55,638
And for a woman to join the board of directors...

301
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:59,605
Let's not jump the gun.

302
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:02,872
Tell the team members.

303
00:28:02,872 --> 00:28:04,805
I will.

304
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:16,137
Nice. 5 minutes until my escape.

305
00:28:16,137 --> 00:28:18,072
Do you have plans?

306
00:28:18,072 --> 00:28:20,238
I have to entertain my son.

307
00:28:20,805 --> 00:28:22,737
I'm on the verge of getting fired.

308
00:28:22,738 --> 00:28:26,738
If kids were allowed to divorce their parents, my son would.

309
00:28:26,738 --> 00:28:28,538
Go home. Why wait 5 minutes?

310
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:32,538
In that case... Goodnight!

311
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:36,205
Awesome.

312
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:38,972
   

313
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,301
Hello, Assistant Manager Ahn...

314
00:28:51,334 --> 00:28:53,400
 Hello, I need the printed ad copy by tomorrow. 

315
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:55,300
I can send it by tomorrow evening...

316
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:57,333
 No, send it by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. 

317
00:28:57,334 --> 00:28:59,801
 We're going to have a meeting at that time. 

318
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:13,234
 Okay! Tonight, I will keep my promise, I'm serious. 

319
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:30,634
I wonder how it feels to work for a regular company, not an ad agency.

320
00:29:30,634 --> 00:29:34,934
I wish I could be the client at least once before I die...

321
00:29:49,273 --> 00:29:50,940
Whoa, how old is this?

322
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,205
30.

323
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:54,240
This is too much.

324
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:57,839
Did we ever learn about moderation?

325
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,940
We learned to always go for first place when we do something.

326
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,472
Are things going well?

327
00:30:02,473 --> 00:30:05,773
I'll send you the list soon.

328
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:12,140
You know that the current CEO is just waiting to retire.

329
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,806
Shouldn't you think about getting prepared?

330
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,873
I'm not completely unprepared.

331
00:30:17,873 --> 00:30:21,640
We're talking about someone who'll be the face of the company for a while.

332
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:26,439
Someone who has a touching story, is talented, fits the zeitgeist of today,

333
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,705
and is easy on the eyes on top of that. Right?

334
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:33,539
Hurry up. You should take the agency's top office one day.

335
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,106
Give me a few days.

336
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,506
The chairman has been asking when it will be decided.

337
00:30:37,506 --> 00:30:42,940
He's worried about his reckless daughter he sent to America.

338
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,706
Don't worry about it and drink. It'll be over in a few days.

339
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:57,873
 Okay, guys. So the deadline for your paper is next week. 

340
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:01,039
 And don't forget to upload for peer review. 

341
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
 That's it for today. 

342
00:31:02,041 --> 00:31:03,505
Okay. Got it.

343
00:31:03,506 --> 00:31:04,440
Bye.

344
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,540
 See you tomorrow. 

345
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:17,706
Gosh, when am I going to write this paper?

346
00:31:18,506 --> 00:31:20,640
It's this week's paper.

347
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,540
It's all written.

348
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,339
- Why! 
 - It's not a good time to post that.

349
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,806
Why? Because it makes me look way too smart?

350
00:31:42,806 --> 00:31:44,973
No, because it makes you look way too weird.

351
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:48,606
You finished your paper one minute after the lecture? That's a little...

352
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:51,273
You're right. When should I post it, then?

353
00:31:51,273 --> 00:31:53,740
I'll tell you when that time is right.

354
00:31:55,006 --> 00:31:56,605
Deputy Park, where are you going?

355
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:58,373
I have errands to run.

356
00:31:58,373 --> 00:32:00,305
All your errands have to do with me, don't they?

357
00:32:00,306 --> 00:32:02,272
Even servants have personal errands to run.

358
00:32:02,273 --> 00:32:06,472
Are you still mad at me? Because of what I said the other night after I drank?

359
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:16,173
 You're a servant, a servant! Servant! 

360
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:22,840
 You're my servant. Deputy Park is my servant. 

361
00:32:27,273 --> 00:32:29,073
 Servant. 

362
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,740
I'm not mad.

363
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,572
A man shouldn't be petty.

364
00:32:35,573 --> 00:32:40,005
Saying a man should be this way or that is gender-role stereotyping.

365
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:41,205
Which means you're mad.

366
00:32:41,206 --> 00:32:45,272
And they say if you're going to be a servant, do it for a rich man.

367
00:32:45,273 --> 00:32:50,999
I'm a servant of the owner of one of the biggest conglomerates in Korea, so I should be grateful.

368
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:53,040
Lady Hanna,

369
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:59,040
your servant will be back after running some errands.

370
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,706
Get me some ice cream. Mint chocolate.

371
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:13,140
Talk about a second-rate troll.

372
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,606
If it were me...

373
00:33:15,606 --> 00:33:16,805
I brought your ice cream.

374
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:19,006
Oh, yeah!

375
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,906
Deputy Park!

376
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:32,140
That's mint chocolate.

377
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,973
You're asking for it. Come out right now!

378
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:40,406
Come out, Deputy Park. I said come out.

379
00:33:40,406 --> 00:33:42,606
 Come out. 

380
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,380
♫  In time, I become a lost child  ♫

381
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:11,540
♫  I don't want to wake up, a blue dream that resembles you  ♫

382
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,330
♫  Wake me up, turn off the alarm, I'm more comfortable in my dreams, I just wanna be with you again  ♫

383
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:24,580
♫  It's okay to be a grown-up child, the reality is so cold, my love  ♫

384
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:32,900
♫  A dull day, I just stay blank, I want to fall asleep again  ♫

385
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:39,520
♫  Turn it off, will you turn off the alarm? I'm going back  ♫

386
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,250
♫  To my love and one and all  ♫

387
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,100
♫  A dazzling morning  ♫

388
00:34:48,106 --> 00:34:50,173
 What time is our meeting? 

389
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:53,206
 Let's have one now. Put them up. 

390
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,740
♫  You're my everlasting dream  ♫

391
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,420
♫  Don't wake me up, I'm gonna stay with you forever  ♫

392
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,190
♫  You and I in my dream  ♫

393
00:35:10,873 --> 00:35:15,273
 Rather than getting rebuked for mediocre work... 

394
00:35:21,873 --> 00:35:25,440
Jeong Woo. Thank you.

395
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:32,306
Hello. You're here.

396
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:36,906
These are the competitors' ad copies,

397
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:42,030
and these are the telecommunication company ads CD Kwon made.

398
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,990
   

399
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,773
They fulfilled their artistic dreams with their client's money.

400
00:35:48,773 --> 00:35:54,573
If you look here, these are the rough drafts for the direction we came up with.

401
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:58,090
  ] [The relationship between me and the earth. Communication that connects the world.] 

402
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,440
   
   

403
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,073
   

404
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:15,673
These are all useless.

405
00:36:16,473 --> 00:36:18,940
Don't you know how important this presentation is?

406
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,505
Well, that's why we went with the future of telecommunication, 5G and ICT.

407
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:27,273
Are you making a promo video for a CES event in Las Vegas?

408
00:36:27,273 --> 00:36:30,006
Who uses those technologies? Isn't it the people?

409
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:31,873
The technologies the company has?

410
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,640
Why do the consumers have to watch all that bragging?

411
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,240
Huh? But that's similar to the idea I wanted to put up...

412
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,772
Kwon's team is Senior Director Choi's favorite, so we can't beat them by a narrow margin.

413
00:36:41,772 --> 00:36:43,473
We must leave them awestruck for the senior director...

414
00:36:43,473 --> 00:36:45,806
We'll give it another try.

415
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,840
We'll have a meeting at this time every day starting tomorrow.

416
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,673
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

417
00:36:54,673 --> 00:36:56,673
Don't even think about going home until the bidding is over.

418
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,573
Yes.

419
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,773
Excuse me!

420
00:37:07,806 --> 00:37:10,340
I mean, Creative Director...

421
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:17,770
   

422
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,740
Elaborate.

423
00:37:29,073 --> 00:37:32,673
Yes. Uh... Well...

424
00:37:35,406 --> 00:37:41,339
The value of technology's existence depends on the people's need for it, and the proof...

425
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:45,073
Leave the adverbs and adjectives out and stick to nouns and objects.

426
00:37:51,673 --> 00:37:54,506
Future technology? Telecommunication revolution?

427
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:58,540
I think stuff like that is complete crap.

428
00:38:00,506 --> 00:38:05,373
Do machines make calls? People make calls.

429
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:07,872
So, telecommunication in the future is,

430
00:38:07,873 --> 00:38:11,506
I mean, it would be a better world,

431
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:14,273
so, the era... of people...

432
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,373
- Department Head Han. 
 - Yes.

433
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,406
I think we'll be able to go home.

434
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,773
We'll come up with proposals.

435
00:38:30,773 --> 00:38:31,973
They are strictly confidential.

436
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:35,973
Of course. We'll cover the wall and shred all the printouts.

437
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,880
   

438
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:52,330
   

439
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:58,830
   

440
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,640
- Department Head Han! 
 - Yes?

441
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,706
Don't shred them. Tape them up there.

442
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:07,805
Here?

443
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:09,973
Yes, up on that wall.

444
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:48,306
Hello, have a seat.

445
00:39:51,106 --> 00:39:52,605
I didn't know what you like,

446
00:39:52,606 --> 00:39:56,873
so I chose the most expensive restaurant and I ordered the most expensive dish.

447
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:58,740
That works.

448
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,905
Does it?

449
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:02,573
It's hard to show your preference with expensive things.

450
00:40:02,573 --> 00:40:04,705
If you react positively, you risk appearing materialistic,

451
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:07,173
and if you react negatively, you risk appearing unsophisticated.

452
00:40:07,173 --> 00:40:11,172
Can I enjoy this food with the assurance that I made the right choice?

453
00:40:11,173 --> 00:40:13,772
Let me thank you in advance for how delicious the food will be.

454
00:40:13,773 --> 00:40:19,640
I prefer appearing materialistic over appearing unsophisticated.

455
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,006
Creative Director Go, may I ask you a personal question?

456
00:40:30,673 --> 00:40:34,673
I'm not married, I don't have a boyfriend, and I live alone.

457
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:36,573
Oh!

458
00:40:37,506 --> 00:40:41,940
I hear men love those three conditions, and I can see you like them too.

459
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,406
May I ask why you're still single?

460
00:40:46,406 --> 00:40:49,673
Because I also happen to have the three conditions men can't stand.

461
00:40:49,673 --> 00:40:50,872
And they are?

462
00:40:50,873 --> 00:40:55,173
Smart, cold-hearted, and a workaholic.

463
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:59,206
To me, those sound attractive.

464
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:01,340
Perhaps because we're of similar sorts, no?

465
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,906
Let me cut to the chase.

466
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:09,106
Yes.

467
00:41:09,106 --> 00:41:12,106
Do you like working for an ad agency?

468
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:21,773
Why do you need me?

469
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:24,372
A smart, cold-hearted workaholic.

470
00:41:24,373 --> 00:41:28,206
Those three conditions are perfect for a marketing executive.

471
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:30,573
I like advertising because it's fierce.

472
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:34,405
Then, why don't I make my company fierce for you?

473
00:41:34,406 --> 00:41:36,906
In terms of both work and salary.

474
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:45,561
I think making ads is the most enjoyable thing one can do with clothes on.

475
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,306
Then...

476
00:41:48,307 --> 00:41:51,639
What is the most enjoyable thing one can do without clothes on?

477
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,073
Isn't that what you were about to ask?

478
00:41:57,606 --> 00:41:59,006
I'm off.

479
00:41:59,006 --> 00:42:00,673
Okay.

480
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,689
The enjoyable thing one can do without clothes on, I'm going to do it tonight.

481
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,006
If you want to take part, come.

482
00:42:13,006 --> 00:42:16,839
There are lots of places we can do it together. I'll text you the address.

483
00:42:41,673 --> 00:42:43,740
   

484
00:42:49,106 --> 00:42:52,110
She sure has a creative way of turning someone down.

485
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,290
   

486
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,640
   

487
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,673
Damn it...

488
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:30,640
   

489
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,106
   

490
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,540
- Hey! 
- Whoa.

491
00:43:50,606 --> 00:43:55,706
What are you doing here at this hour?

492
00:43:55,706 --> 00:44:00,306
I'm playing golf with a client.

493
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:02,273
What are you doing here?

494
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:05,540
Well...

495
00:44:06,206 --> 00:44:10,673
So diligent. All illegal activities are so diligent.

496
00:44:10,673 --> 00:44:14,173
What do you mean, illegal?

497
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,889
If you know your enemy and yourself, you can win a hundred battles.

498
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,940
Those are the basics of war strategy.

499
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,639
Leave. Go Ah In will be here soon.

500
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,006
Got it.

501
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,140
Enjoy your golf.

502
00:44:28,973 --> 00:44:32,940
What a fool.

503
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,073
If only Go Ah In were my underclassman.

504
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:06,080
   

505
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,673
Put some tape at the bottom of the door.

506
00:45:16,273 --> 00:45:19,606
We need to know if a little thief cat stops by, don't we?

507
00:45:56,206 --> 00:46:00,740
The cat ran off with the poisoned meat.

508
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:03,440
It's going to make him sick.

509
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,940
   

510
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,506
Develop this one.

511
00:46:10,173 --> 00:46:12,506
Did you write this?

512
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:15,740
It's like I have to do everything for this team.

513
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,506
The octopus place? After that?

514
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,406
I'm going to head out after a meeting.

515
00:46:26,406 --> 00:46:29,006
Goodbye.

516
00:46:31,673 --> 00:46:33,805
Everyone knows that the senior director's position is riding on this bidding...

517
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:35,539
He's so irresponsible.

518
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:38,673
He may be irresponsible, but he's got support.

519
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:41,640
Why does Senior Director Choi support Creative Director Kwon

520
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,906
instead of Creative Director Go, who is actually talented?

521
00:46:43,906 --> 00:46:45,471
Because she is talented.

522
00:46:45,472 --> 00:46:47,305
If Creative Director Go becomes a senior director,

523
00:46:47,306 --> 00:46:51,673
Senior Director Choi wouldn't be able to maintain his control over the production teams.

524
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,906
Oh, my.

525
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,572
You're going home already? Lucky you.

526
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:16,173
It's all about efficiency. I don't waste energy like you.

527
00:47:16,173 --> 00:47:21,206
CD Kwon, of everyone who began with me here, you're my favorite.

528
00:47:21,206 --> 00:47:25,340
You haven't changed a bit. You were and always will be...

529
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,706
(a fool.)

530
00:47:27,706 --> 00:47:30,006
Hey! Go Ah In!

531
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:36,540
You'll like me even more when I become a senior director.

532
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,606
Creative Director Go, you should take a course on how to be a better person.

533
00:47:40,606 --> 00:47:46,340
That is, if you manage to stay at this company.

534
00:47:50,406 --> 00:47:52,873
You're talking like it's going to be you.

535
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:56,740
Why? Is that what Senior Director Choi told you?

536
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,640
I'm not falling for that, you with your psychic eyes!

537
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:29,773
She's the only decent member on that team.

538
00:48:32,473 --> 00:48:34,240
Creative Director, we're finished.

539
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,939
The bidding is at 11:00 today, right?

540
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,440
Yes.

541
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,273
Eun Jeong, is the final version ready?

542
00:48:39,273 --> 00:48:42,573
Let me check for typos one last time. Just once.

543
00:48:42,573 --> 00:48:45,206
Send them to me and go home.

544
00:48:45,206 --> 00:48:47,573
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

545
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,972
I'll be back after taking a shower.

546
00:48:53,973 --> 00:48:56,040
Creative Director, see you later.

547
00:49:13,506 --> 00:49:17,173
Can we really leave everything up to her and leave?

548
00:49:17,173 --> 00:49:20,040
She's the kind of person who has to do everything herself.

549
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:25,440
To her, it's not over until it's over. Especially for this project.

550
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,373
She's going to keep tweaking the ad copy until the very end.

551
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:33,773
Right, so you should feel burdened.

552
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:36,173
Kidding.

553
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:23,080
   

554
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:39,873
We're closed.

555
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,090
   

556
00:51:03,846 --> 00:51:06,228
I'm sure you did a great job.

557
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:08,731
The problem isn't this, is it?

558
00:51:09,949 --> 00:51:13,549
If I were Chang Soo, I wouldn't make you the CCO.

559
00:51:14,883 --> 00:51:16,783
I wouldn't, either.

560
00:51:22,649 --> 00:51:27,183
Instead of coming here, why didn't you go to a church and pray?

561
00:51:27,183 --> 00:51:29,149
You're right.

562
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,823
How do you like the slogan?

563
00:51:33,823 --> 00:51:35,461
It's good. It has depth,

564
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:37,729
and it goes well with the sentiment of the times.

565
00:51:37,729 --> 00:51:40,229
It has potential for a great ad campaign.

566
00:51:41,896 --> 00:51:43,996
That's all I needed.

567
00:51:44,896 --> 00:51:46,127
Isn't the bidding in the morning?

568
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:49,362
Why did you come here instead of getting some sleep?

569
00:51:49,362 --> 00:51:51,162
I know.

570
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:54,762
I just...

571
00:51:57,096 --> 00:51:58,396
wanted confirmation.

572
00:51:58,396 --> 00:52:00,329
On what?

573
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:06,462
This might be my last project at VC Communications,

574
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:10,429
so I didn't want people to say that I was pushed out for lack of ability.

575
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:12,929
Goodnight.

576
00:52:23,896 --> 00:52:27,362
It's not ability that gets you promoted...

577
00:52:29,362 --> 00:52:31,562
   

578
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,929
Did you come up with anything good?

579
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:48,796
Why do you care?

580
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:04,562
Take your seats.

581
00:53:08,129 --> 00:53:09,561
Let's begin.

582
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:11,729
We'll go first.

583
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:14,096
That's unexpected.

584
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:17,862
I can't avoid it, so I'd rather go first.

585
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:20,096
Okay.

586
00:53:20,096 --> 00:53:24,229
That would be better for you, wouldn't it?

587
00:53:29,462 --> 00:53:32,761
Technology, future, ICT, the 4th Industrial Revolution.

588
00:53:32,762 --> 00:53:36,429
All of these are in the palm of your hand.

589
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:38,895
Work, Home, Leisure.

590
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:43,296
All parts of life can come together as one.

591
00:53:43,296 --> 00:53:44,929
Isn't that what we discarded?

592
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:47,362
It is. We almost brought the same one.

593
00:53:47,362 --> 00:53:50,293
You can enjoy it.

594
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:55,445
My team's campaign will use the superiority of technology as USP and launch the ad campaign.

595
00:54:00,162 --> 00:54:02,462
 Creative Director, someone tried to break into our meeting room. 

596
00:54:02,462 --> 00:54:03,629
 I know. 

597
00:54:03,629 --> 00:54:08,896
 Was it Creative Director Kwon? 

598
00:54:08,896 --> 00:54:10,662
 Yes. 

599
00:54:10,662 --> 00:54:12,162
 How did you know? 

600
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:15,829
 When you grow up feeling unwelcome, you learn to read people. 

601
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:21,762
 What would happen if Kwon and I presented similar ideas? 

602
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:26,262
 It would be easier for Senior Director Choi to side with him. 

603
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,329
 So I left them up on the wall for him to steal. 

604
00:54:29,962 --> 00:54:32,561
 We needed to bring something completely different 

605
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:36,896
 and show how good we are to stop Senior Director Choi's meddling. 

606
00:54:40,629 --> 00:54:42,562
That's it.

607
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,162
- That was nice. 
 - Thank you.

608
00:55:01,162 --> 00:55:03,129
Next is Go's team.

609
00:55:03,129 --> 00:55:07,762
I believe Creative Director Go's direction should be similar.

610
00:55:10,829 --> 00:55:13,196
Why do you think that?

611
00:55:14,229 --> 00:55:14,929
What?

612
00:55:14,930 --> 00:55:17,720
You seem convinced.

613
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,050
Have you been inside my head?

614
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,506
Or...

615
00:55:21,507 --> 00:55:24,407
perhaps you were inside my team's meeting room.

616
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:26,989
That's ridiculous.

617
00:55:26,989 --> 00:55:29,722
And how could I get into a locked meeting room?

618
00:55:29,722 --> 00:55:32,889
I wonder how you know our meeting room was locked...

619
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:37,522
Meeting rooms are usually locked...

620
00:55:38,189 --> 00:55:43,622
I paid to install a digital lock on the door of my team's meeting room.

621
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:49,089
I was the only one to do so of all the production teams.

622
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:02,056
That's enough. Sir, we'll start.

623
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:04,456
Go ahead.

624
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:08,122
You're up next, CD Go.

625
00:56:08,122 --> 00:56:12,581
Technology, future, ICT, and the 4th Industrial Revolution.

626
00:56:12,582 --> 00:56:14,922
They are nice...

627
00:56:14,922 --> 00:56:19,473
But a consumer told me that they are all crap.

628
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:25,255
It is the age of micro-target marketing,

629
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:30,289
so do you feel attracted to the metadiscourse

630
00:56:30,289 --> 00:56:32,756
that isn't useful for you?

631
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,989
It's about the people in the end.

632
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:37,188
Therefore, we would like to make a declaration.

633
00:56:37,189 --> 00:56:40,055
We would like to open an age that never existed,

634
00:56:40,056 --> 00:56:43,122
even in all the revolutions, from the first to the fourth.

635
00:56:43,122 --> 00:56:44,222
And this is how.

636
00:56:44,222 --> 00:56:47,956
   

637
00:56:47,956 --> 00:56:52,456
This is our idea for the future of telecommunication.

638
00:57:13,422 --> 00:57:15,522
Thank you for that.

639
00:57:15,522 --> 00:57:18,622
Creative Director Go, wow, that was great!

640
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:27,788
Thank you. I'm asking out of concern, but...

641
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:30,022
That will never happen.

642
00:57:33,022 --> 00:57:37,389
We can't have two teams with completely opposite ideas work together.

643
00:57:37,389 --> 00:57:41,156
I feel the same way.

644
00:57:42,622 --> 00:57:45,689
The CEO and I give you our word.

645
00:57:45,689 --> 00:57:47,689
Thank you.

646
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:14,856
What's the result?

647
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:18,722
We went with this person.

648
00:58:18,722 --> 00:58:21,188
It's a good quality carpet. Nice color.

649
00:58:21,189 --> 00:58:22,556
I chose it carefully.

650
00:58:22,556 --> 00:58:26,889
Good. Call the US and have Hanna come back.

651
00:58:26,889 --> 00:58:28,722
Yes, sir.

652
00:58:33,556 --> 00:58:36,722
   

653
00:58:37,456 --> 00:58:39,156
What happened?

654
00:58:39,156 --> 00:58:40,538
The new senior director has been decided.

655
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:43,189
We went with the creative director you recommended.

656
00:58:43,189 --> 00:58:45,656
Yes, perfect.

657
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:48,121
But isn't this a huge flaw?

658
00:58:48,122 --> 00:58:49,621
   

659
00:58:49,622 --> 00:58:51,889
 How is that a flaw? 

660
00:58:51,889 --> 00:58:53,722
It lowers the status of our company.

661
00:58:53,722 --> 00:58:55,789
This age calls for a hero.

662
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:59,921
When someone climbs up from the bottom, people will identify with them and go wild.

663
00:58:59,922 --> 00:59:03,122
True. The press will eat it up.

664
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,372
And that senior director position won't last forever.

665
00:59:05,372 --> 00:59:06,856
When are you making the announcement?

666
00:59:06,856 --> 00:59:08,055
This afternoon.

667
00:59:08,056 --> 00:59:11,322
Did you tell the chairman about me?

668
00:59:11,322 --> 00:59:16,121
I've been extra cautious. Rumors can hurt us.

669
00:59:16,122 --> 00:59:18,156
Okay.

670
00:59:18,156 --> 00:59:20,056
Good work.

671
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:31,889
   

672
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:35,922
At the Cannes Advertising Festival, that ad...

673
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:45,222
What is it?

674
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:50,188
Whoa!

675
00:59:50,189 --> 00:59:52,289
Unbelievable!

676
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:10,321
What's wrong?

677
01:00:10,322 --> 01:00:15,089
Creative Director, you made it!!!

678
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,221
What is it?

679
01:00:16,222 --> 01:00:18,517
Did we win the telecommunication company ad?

680
01:00:27,856 --> 01:00:30,188
   

681
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:34,756
   

682
01:00:45,489 --> 01:00:47,756
Creative Director Go has been promoted!

683
01:00:47,756 --> 01:00:50,722
Don't say creative director. She's the CCO now!

684
01:00:50,722 --> 01:00:52,888
 - Congratulations. 
 - Congrats. 

685
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:55,289
Congratulations.

686
01:00:56,022 --> 01:00:57,855
 - Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations. 

687
01:00:57,856 --> 01:01:01,356
 - Congratulations, Senior Director. 
 - Congratulations, Senior Director. 

688
01:01:02,289 --> 01:01:04,256
Damn it...

689
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:12,222
Congratulations on your promotion, Senior Director.

690
01:01:12,222 --> 01:01:15,322
 Congratulations, Senior Director! 

691
01:01:16,989 --> 01:01:19,256
 Congratulations. 

692
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,440
   

693
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:45,089
Enjoy it while it lasts.

694
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:23,456


695
01:02:23,456 --> 01:02:26,022
   

696
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:37,456
   

697
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:44,790
♫  Since I was left alone, in the dark  ♫

698
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:51,100
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

699
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:55,420
♫  I have pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

700
01:02:55,422 --> 01:02:58,522
 Now that you're an executive, you should work like one. 

701
01:02:58,522 --> 01:03:00,321
 It was all thanks to you. 

702
01:03:00,322 --> 01:03:03,289
 Pay attention to every detail of your makeup and your outfits. 

703
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:06,688
 Think of yourself as the model of the company and not just a senior director. 

704
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:08,722
 What do you mean? 

705
01:03:08,722 --> 01:03:11,889
 Go Ah In is more naive than I had expected. 

706
01:03:11,889 --> 01:03:14,989
 - I hear it's only for one year. 
 - I knew it. 

707
01:03:14,989 --> 01:03:18,189
 Help out my Hanna when she comes to work. 

708
01:03:18,189 --> 01:03:22,289
 Do you think I gave up everything just to end up here? 

709
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:24,956
 Use the power Senior Director Choi gave you to fight. 

710
01:03:24,956 --> 01:03:28,855
 This is fun. You've been stepped on and are wriggling. 

711
01:03:28,856 --> 01:03:30,622
 What power? 

712
01:03:30,622 --> 01:03:33,322
 The ultimate power an executive possesses. 

713
01:03:34,089 --> 01:03:35,922
 The rain has stopped. 

714
01:03:35,922 --> 01:03:39,400
 Let's cross the line. 

715
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:44,540
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
