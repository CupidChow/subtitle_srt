1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960


2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:11,043
 Whatever our unresolved feelings may be, let's put them all behind us. 

3
00:00:11,043 --> 00:00:15,815
 I hope you can start fresh at work, starting tomorrow. 

4
00:00:15,815 --> 00:00:18,484
Words aren't enough. We need to act.

5
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,186
Does Senior Director Choi know?

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,888
Let's just go first!

7
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,084
They should be here by now.

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:01,961
Hey! Go Ah In!

9
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:03,529
What's going on?

10
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:05,198
Are you out of your mind?

11
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:07,967
Ah, so loud.

12
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,306
I guess it's time for me to take action.

13
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,997
   

14
00:01:30,997 --> 00:01:33,159
How can you do this?

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,761
Senior Director Choi, you need to calm down.

16
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:39,833
How can you do this without consulting me once?

17
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:44,237
Must I get your approval to do my job?

18
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,244
No...

19
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:51,077
That's not what I mean... Why...

20
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:56,579
Not everyone who works at an ad agency has a creative job.

21
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,354
The HR Team has no choice but to follow the manual.

22
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,937
 Personnel Management Article 8. 

23
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:23,376
 The Chief Creative Officer has personnel authority over the creative team members. 

24
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,154
I understand what you're saying.

25
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:38,324
But this is too big a change all at once.

26
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,394
Aren't customs just as important as authority at work?

27
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:46,965
Personnel authority over the production team lies with the CCO. Am I correct?

28
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:48,534
Yes.

29
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:51,437
You're right, but this goes against common sense!

30
00:02:51,437 --> 00:02:54,640
It's my job to break the stereotypes of common sense.

31
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,911
My job is to maintain and practice common sense.

32
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,318
If you take this action right after your promotion, there will be opposition.

33
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,789
Opposition...

34
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:16,128
Have you been turning a blind eye because you're afraid of that?

35
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,102
My job title in English is...

36
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,408
Chief Creative Officer (CCO).

37
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:30,310
   

38
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,248
I'll start by getting creative with my team, I trust that you'll follow the manual.

39
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,252
According to the customs.

40
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,780
   

41
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,828
But this is...

42
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:01,708
I apologize for raising my voice.

43
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:06,312
I'd appreciate it if you'd consult me next time.

44
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,480
All right, Senior Director Choi. If it's within my authority.

45
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:22,962
I exercised the authority I possess as the senior director.

46
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:24,296
Is there a problem with that?

47
00:04:24,296 --> 00:04:28,501
Go Ah In, do you think you can call all the shots?

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,808
It's a great copy, don't you think?

49
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,096
Lead,

50
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,146
follow,

51
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,821
   

52
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,685
...or clear out.

53
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,792
Choose one of the three.

54
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,860
Hey! Go Ah In!

55
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,463
Who's breaking the corporate rules?

56
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:34,333
A team leader yelling at the CCO.

57
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:40,254
Getting served at room salons on account of giving projects to partner companies.

58
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,046
Oh, it's about that?

59
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,613
Do you have evidence?

60
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:53,419
Yes. Do you have proof?

61
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:56,088
Who drank anything for free?

62
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,662
 Director, don't you agree with me? 

63
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,998
 Yes. I know what you're saying... 

64
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,734
 He's scared of the aftermath. 

65
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,937
 CD... I mean, Senior Director. 

66
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,340
 It's late, but congratulations on your promotion. 

67
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:19,679
 I'm the CCO, why should you care about the creative directors? 

68
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:21,714
 Well... 

69
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,749
 Because it's only for a year? 

70
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:29,188
 Since I'll be a professor or running a small ad agency in a year? 

71
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,326
 Do you think I'll make a better professor 

72
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:37,796
 or CEO of a small ad agency? 

73
00:06:37,796 --> 00:06:39,899
 I really didn't mean that... 

74
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,202
 You think I can teach students with this temper? 

75
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,872
 Let's say that the rumors are true. 

76
00:06:46,872 --> 00:06:51,244
 And a year later, I take up the small agency CEO post. 

77
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:54,146
 If the CEO of that small ad agency gives you all the work, 

78
00:06:54,146 --> 00:06:58,284
 wouldn't it be a breeze for you to buy a building in Gangnam? 

79
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,261
 Whether you'll work dirty with them while buying them drinks 

80
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:11,597
 or whether you'll work cleanly with me, you do the math and decide. 

81
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,057
 Where are all of our entertainment expense receipts? 

82
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,630
You certainly enjoyed yourselves honestly and regularly.

83
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:48,760
You certainly enjoyed yourselves honestly and regularly.

84
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:56,375
There are customs! Customs!

85
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,276
Customs...

86
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,981
Why must I follow your customs?

87
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:08,254
If you're not happy about the transfer, shall I make another offer?

88
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,851
Your drink bills have been added to the production cost and reported to the company.

89
00:08:13,851 --> 00:08:16,261
Should I send them to the audit team

90
00:08:16,261 --> 00:08:21,634
and fire you in the customary way that you like?

91
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,416
   

92
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,649
Yes, sir.

93
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,320
Where are you?

94
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,723
That place.

95
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,092
Where's that place?

96
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,195
Go Ah In...

97
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,530
What are you doing there?

98
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,200
Leave now!

99
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,702
We were just...

100
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:00,739
Leave before you make things worse!

101
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,350
This is fun.

102
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:10,280
She squirms when she's been stepped on.

103
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,565
Hey.

104
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,706
There's never a free drink in this world.

105
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:38,477
The hangover lasts, doesn't it?

106
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:05,904
Take out the trash, please.

107
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,890
   

108
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:34,364
There's so much trash to sort out. Right?

109
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,469
Pardon?

110
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:43,942
Are you going to let her get away with this?

111
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,979
It was just a couple of drinks...

112
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:56,655
 If I keep them here, I'll go under as well... 

113
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:59,091
Watch your step.

114
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:01,794
One wrong move and the game's over.

115
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:08,802
- First... CD Kim, CD Joo. 
 - Yes.

116
00:11:08,802 --> 00:11:10,770
Go to the Chinese branch.

117
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,804
Pardon?

118
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:14,907
But, Sir!

119
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,975
Is there another way?

120
00:11:16,975 --> 00:11:20,112
She exercised her power according to the rules.

121
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,948
But, Senior!

122
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,131
Aren't you ashamed?

123
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:28,612
You want to work under your team members?

124
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,059
It'll be a year at the longest. You know that.

125
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:36,761
- Get packing. 
 - Right now?

126
00:11:36,761 --> 00:11:39,238
I'll put you on leave. Don't come to the office.

127
00:11:39,238 --> 00:11:41,066
Opportunities...

128
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:45,070
come to those who are alive.

129
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,217
I can finally breathe.

130
00:12:33,953 --> 00:12:37,055
What are you smiling about?

131
00:12:37,055 --> 00:12:38,631
 Good riddance, don't you think? 

132
00:12:38,631 --> 00:12:40,460
 What a relief. Good riddance. 

133
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,529
 It's all thanks to Senior Director Go. 

134
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:45,731
 This is nice. This should've happened sooner. 

135
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:50,889
Well, after grinding my soul into the copy only to work with firms that will entertain the CD,

136
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,859
and the quality of the ad sucks... Imagine!

137
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,641
Then, what should we do?

138
00:12:55,641 --> 00:12:58,944
Shall we celebrate with pretty prime beef and some drinks?

139
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,247
Nope. I have to spend some time with my son.

140
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:07,052
Then, what about tuna belly with premium soju?

141
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,523
Don't even mention it! Bad boy!

142
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:14,620
What to do, then? The SD's expediency fund

143
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,429
came to our team this month and there's a lot left...

144
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:21,365
- Until when? 
 - We have to spend it by today.

145
00:13:21,365 --> 00:13:24,903
As an office worker, it's wrong to leave team funds unused...

146
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,507
So, we've decided to eat out with the project team.

147
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,576
- You haven't met them yet. 
 - That's right.

148
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:32,277
Come on.

149
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,280
In that case, I'm in!

150
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,800
But I'll go all in in the first round and go home and pass out. So, don't stop me. Okay?

151
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,590
- Okay! 
 - Let's go!

152
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:48,060
Hang on.

153
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,763
Yes, Mother.

154
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,832
What?

155
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,539
 Ah Ji got into a fight at school and wants you to come. 

156
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:10,048
Kid, where's your mom? When is she coming?

157
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:13,049
- He doesn't have a mom. 
 - No! I have a mom!

158
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:14,320
No, you don't!

159
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,857
She never came once to the talent show or sports day.

160
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,084
- If you have a mom, where is... 
 - Right here!

161
00:14:25,131 --> 00:14:27,899
I'm his mom! Of course, he has a mom!

162
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,370
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but first...

163
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,839
Please. Do you think I can calm down in this situation?

164
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:37,342
No, I mean... your shoes...

165
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,494
Oh my...

166
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,829
Gosh, really...

167
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:23,424
Hey, why is a kindergartner walking like a teenager?

168
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:27,326
If you're going to rebel, do it like a kindergartner.

169
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:41,240
 The light is green. You may cross. 

170
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,422
My goodness!

171
00:15:57,422 --> 00:16:00,459
Who did this to our pup's face?

172
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,629
You had a fight? Did you win or lose?

173
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,898
- Hey! Hey! 
 - Ah Ji, let's have a talk.

174
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,501
Ah Ji, let's have a talk.

175
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,670
Let's have a talk.

176
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:17,143
No, go away! I don't have a mom! You aren't my mom.

177
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:22,148
You're an ad mom. Go away. Go away!

178
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:34,226
Ah Ji, please open the door.

179
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,896
- Ah Ji... 
 - Here, let me.

180
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,601
Ah i, please open the door.

181
00:16:41,602 --> 00:16:45,137
It's Grandma! Grandma! Grandma!

182
00:16:53,312 --> 00:16:55,213
Ah Ji...

183
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,664
Aren't you going to join us?

184
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,733
They're all asking for you.

185
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,402
We miss you!

186
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:22,340
 Jo Eun Jeong! Jo Eun Jeong! Jo Eun Jeong! Jo Eun Jeong! 

187
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,375
 Hurry up! 

188
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,609
You have to go out again?

189
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,579
 Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! Hurry up! 

190
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:49,801
I don't watch soap operas.

191
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,804
This and that about women...

192
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:56,741
Problems with in-laws, fussing over children.

193
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,211
I have no patience for that.

194
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,814
I know.

195
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,322
Children grow up fast.

196
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:15,594
Later, he'll want to hang out with friends, not you.

197
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,745
Think about it.

198
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:35,447
You, me, and Ah Ji. This is hard on everyone.

199
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,287
Until when are going you to keep working overtime, even on weekends?

200
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:43,088
Grinding your health.

201
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,890
It's not like you're fighting for the country...

202
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:56,768
Eun Jeong, I think you have to decide.

203
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,962
Two years of kindergarten.

204
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:14,052
Six years of elementary school.

205
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,595
Six years of middle and high school.

206
00:19:16,595 --> 00:19:20,561
Private lessons, academies, exam retakes.

207
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,861
Four years of college...

208
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:31,736
If you quit after ten years of working, you can't even break even.

209
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:39,878
Is staying single the only way to succeed?

210
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:00,695
   

211
00:20:25,811 --> 00:20:28,870
   

212
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:40,372
Shall I start recruiting my side now?

213
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:45,376
It's going to get a bit noisy.

214
00:21:01,187 --> 00:21:02,293
What happened?

215
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,163
No way...

216
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:07,832
Why? Is there bad news?

217
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:17,842
This is an idol star's social media... What about it?

218
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:21,613
Look! Look at it!

219
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,686
I've looked.

220
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:31,856
I had more followers than her until yesterday.

221
00:21:31,856 --> 00:21:37,228
But she topped me after releasing one song!

222
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,837
Ah... What a big deal.

223
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,841
This won't do.

224
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:02,487
I have no choice. I need something potent...

225
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,856
Buy me some yogurt. Our company's.

226
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:06,591
Why?

227
00:22:23,662 --> 00:22:24,944
   
   

228
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:31,583
Hi, guys! I'm going to do a hidden camera prank today.

229
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:37,422
One of your biggest curiosities. Ta-da!

230
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,492
Do rich people lick the top of the yogurt lid?

231
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:43,528
Yes or no? Let's find out!

232
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:49,536
   
   

233
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:50,803
   
   

234
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:52,878
   
   

235
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:53,867
   

236
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,541
   
   

237
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,842
- Good morning, Dad! 
 - Morning.

238
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,583
Dad, have this.

239
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,353
What's this formality?

240
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,355
Come on.

241
00:23:11,178 --> 00:23:13,525
Oh, it's been a while.

242
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,866
You really enjoyed this as a child.

243
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,810
Ta-da!

244
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,679
Guys, you saw it. Right?

245
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:41,017
Even my dad who owns a yogurt company licks the lid!

246
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:44,856
Dad, say hi.

247
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,558
To who?

248
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,026
The masses.

249
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:51,329
What? I don't know any "masses."

250
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,065
What are you...

251
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:56,167
Who?

252
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,569
The general public.

253
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:02,741
Ah... Hello. I'm Kang Yong Ho.

254
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,778
Guys, don't get in a fix doing YOLO stuff.

255
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:08,747
Be nice to each other! Bye!

256
00:24:10,142 --> 00:24:12,111
   

257
00:24:12,111 --> 00:24:13,531
   

258
00:24:13,531 --> 00:24:17,456
You! You made me a clown in front of everyone...

259
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,458
Confiscate her phone!

260
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,027
- Deputy Park! 
 - Yes!

261
00:24:23,027 --> 00:24:26,364
- Run! Run! 
 - Hey, Kang Hanna!

262
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,566
Deputy Park, you!

263
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:29,935
I apologize, Chairman.

264
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,303
That girl...

265
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:37,942
Nevermind. Even I can't control her, so how could you?

266
00:24:38,611 --> 00:24:40,579
I'll take my leave.

267
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,381
- You. 
 - Yes.

268
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:45,150
Are you hanging in there? Do you want a promotion?

269
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,554
Hurry up! Dad will talk until your ears bleed!

270
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:53,758
- Listen. 
 - Yes, sir.

271
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:57,896
I'm telling you. She's going to get in trouble.

272
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:58,997
Yes.

273
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,601
Make sure she doesn't hurt herself, at least not physically.

274
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:05,303
There's nothing we can do about this.

275
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:13,724
That crazy... Who does she get it from?

276
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:16,514
Who does she get it from?

277
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,349
After me.

278
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,864
What nice weather.

279
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,999
Give me a warning before you start trouble.

280
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,870
Trouble? This was all strictly planned!

281
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,606
Look.

282
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:50,415
That turned the tables in one go! How refreshing.

283
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:55,153
This is great.

284
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,563
When I said I'd do business with Americans,

285
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,900
everyone said I was crazy.

286
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,169
Crazy Kang. That's my nickname.

287
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:13,771
You must eat.

288
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:18,709
Can you succeed in this tough world in your right mind?

289
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,413
Yong Ho, you still don't know?

290
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,514
What are you talking about?

291
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,685
Business. Do you still do business with your head?

292
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,087
Then, what should I do it with?

293
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,523
Your instinct. Intuition.

294
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,527
That's what makes a true businessman.

295
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,770
Sir, please take a look at this.

296
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:45,871
What is it?

297
00:26:45,871 --> 00:26:48,393
   

298
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,042
   

299
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:53,912
They're nice things to say, but it's just kids talking...

300
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:58,981
Thanks to Ms. Kang, our new fridge sales have gone up by 3%.

301
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:02,951
- Really? 
 - Yes, on the global level.

302
00:27:02,951 --> 00:27:06,257
Global? What kind of power does that girl have?

303
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,360
She's a major influencer on social media.

304
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,196
Take a look at this.

305
00:27:11,196 --> 00:27:14,533
   

306
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:18,169
   

307
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:24,675
The sales of this yogurt will also go up significantly.

308
00:27:24,675 --> 00:27:26,644
When does she start work at the agency?

309
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,680
Within a few days.

310
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,253
I thought she'd be useless, but she's good at something after all.

311
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:44,495
Senior Director Choi's right hand is still on the creative team.

312
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,932
Yes. CD Kwon is still here.

313
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:50,735
When do the others return from the Chinese office?

314
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:54,405
Probably not while Senior Director Go is around.

315
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:58,509
Then, she must be appointing three new CDs.

316
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,778
Probably.

317
00:28:00,778 --> 00:28:02,246
Did she tell you guys anything?

318
00:28:02,246 --> 00:28:05,216
No, not us...

319
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,119
She talks to him.

320
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,530
   

321
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,433
You should eat a proper meal.

322
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:25,903
I'm not used to eating a proper meal.

323
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,073
Let's put in some overtime today.

324
00:28:29,073 --> 00:28:32,310
- Overtime? 
 - Look behind you.

325
00:28:34,727 --> 00:28:37,960
   

326
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,421
What are you planning to do?

327
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,724
I'll show them.

328
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,128
Show them what?

329
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:54,498
I'll show those with pipe dreams what reality is like.

330
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,601
You can't do this!

331
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,769
Why not?

332
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,870
You can't.

333
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,339
Anyone can see that they're the next CDs.

334
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:04,174
There's enough commotion as it is...

335
00:29:04,174 --> 00:29:05,776
So much hoo-ha, right?

336
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:08,533
You can't handle this if you do this now.

337
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:10,615
The production team will be split in two.

338
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,584
That's why I'm doing it.

339
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,552
Pardon?

340
00:29:14,552 --> 00:29:16,988
To split the team in two.

341
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,825
Right now, Senior Director Choi has it all.

342
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:24,895
If I can't have everything, I should get at least half.

343
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:48,600
♫  When the world turns its back  ♫

344
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,820
♫  Tell me I'm on your side  ♫

345
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:09,100
♫  When an anxious tomorrow hurts you, tell it  ♫ 
    

346
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:15,100
♫  To me  ♫ 
    

347
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,600
♫  When you're having a hard time  ♫

348
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:28,200
♫  Tell me there is someone who knows me  ♫

349
00:31:30,143 --> 00:31:35,826
How did she grow up so well? On her own...

350
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:45,250
♫  I know everything but there are times when I don't  ♫

351
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,740
♫  Don't give up always be happy  ♫

352
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:58,349
It's my fault. It's my fault.

353
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,980
   

354
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,957
He can't do it?

355
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:23,141
All of them can't do it? Then, who can?

356
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:27,478
His skills are not top-notch, but he's a great person.

357
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:29,214
That's why...

358
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:33,010
When you can't have enough on your side,

359
00:32:33,011 --> 00:32:36,321
why are you making more enemies?

360
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:40,191
My side? Who's on my side at this place?

361
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:45,063
Humans are simple. They side with the powerful.

362
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,430
Not everyone's like that.

363
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:51,202
They are all like that. You'll find out.

364
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,920
   

365
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,751
Next.

366
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,755
Next!

367
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,226
Ah Ji, I'm going to work.

368
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:19,564
What's this?

369
00:33:23,902 --> 00:33:25,870
I'm going.

370
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:28,606
I'm really going.

371
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:45,589
Aren't you going to give me a kiss?

372
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,629
I'll see you when I get back.

373
00:34:33,065 --> 00:34:34,880
   

374
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,044
Hold on.

375
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:46,150
If you fail, what will you do?

376
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:51,221
The sword's the most dangerous when it's inside its sheath.

377
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,757
If you slash a neck, but nothing happens...

378
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,660
What then? How will you control them?

379
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,800
And now? Are they under my control now?

380
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:10,008
Everyone knows that my post is for one year.

381
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,878
Will anything I say matter to Senior Director Choi's

382
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:17,715
department heads who have the same open recruitment background?

383
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,585
Do you think I can get anything done with them around?

384
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:25,589
You said that the production team will be split in two.

385
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,859
Yes.

386
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,461
If I push these people aside, there'll be new positions to fill.

387
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,564
What if I promote non-open recruitment people?

388
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,369
They will all be on my side.

389
00:35:39,158 --> 00:35:41,478
Divide and rule.

390
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,225
If you can't have everything, make sure you at least get half.

391
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:49,213
Isn't that too cruel?

392
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,550
Only a dictator would do something like that.

393
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:55,186
Do they say it's cruel when a lion preys on a deer?

394
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:57,955
You do what you have to do to survive.

395
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:06,765
If that's the case... Okay.

396
00:36:06,765 --> 00:36:11,001
Let's say you convince the execs, which won't be easy.

397
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,204
What if the CEO says no?

398
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,906
That won't happen.

399
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:19,977
I'll make a proposal that he can't refuse.

400
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,674
   

401
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,560
 Take a day's leave and go home. 

402
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,263
 I can only do this with peace of mind if you're not around. 

403
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:55,579
- Sir! 
 - Morning.

404
00:36:57,248 --> 00:37:00,851
Were you up all night? Did something happen?

405
00:37:00,852 --> 00:37:03,787
No... It's about to happen.

406
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,275
   

407
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,335
What the hell!

408
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,674
They are telling us to quit?

409
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,443
They're picking a fight now, aren't they?

410
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,650
   

411
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:38,222
They think we'll keep quiet? I won't let this one slide.

412
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,831
A personnel evaluation? It's not the evaluation season.

413
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:53,104
And only for department heads who were selected through open recruitment.

414
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,441
Sir, Senior Director Go is out of her mind.

415
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:58,842
Hang on, let me check.

416
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:07,117
   

417
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:11,088
What is this?

418
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,564
You were about to call me, right?

419
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,905
Impossible.

420
00:38:28,707 --> 00:38:33,278
You're working creatively all of a sudden.

421
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,448
It's only been a few days and you do a personnel evaluation?

422
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:41,319
But doesn't the CCO evaluate the production team personnel?

423
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,254
Or must I report first to the Chief Project Officer?

424
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:50,427
Please sign off on the personnel evaluation.

425
00:38:50,427 --> 00:38:53,465
Let's hear it first. Why are you suddenly picking on

426
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:56,901
only department heads who were selected through open recruitment?

427
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,969
You know why.

428
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,438
They're useless!

429
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,472
You can't do this just for that reason!

430
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,974
Isn't that what a company does?

431
00:39:03,975 --> 00:39:06,478
I won't sign off on this one.

432
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,545
- Really? 
 - Really.

433
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:11,474
Then...

434
00:39:12,822 --> 00:39:16,319
Please call an executive meeting.

435
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:18,322
An executive meeting?

436
00:39:20,176 --> 00:39:23,094
You think they'll give you their approval?

437
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:26,498
- Should I give you a piece of advice? 
 - Go ahead.

438
00:39:26,498 --> 00:39:29,199
Everyone except the financial director who's from an accounting firm

439
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,003
was selected through open recruitment. You know that.

440
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,407
Don't take this any further.

441
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:41,445
We could propose to dismiss you instead.

442
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:47,851
Please call an executive meeting.

443
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:58,562
Under the CEO's order, we'll convene an executive meeting.

444
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:06,003
If you step down on your own, of course I'd be thankful.

445
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:14,379
Call an executive meeting under the CEO.

446
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,882
No.

447
00:40:15,882 --> 00:40:17,768
Now.

448
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:19,717
Immediately.

449
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:49,049
 There is an executive meeting in 10 minutes. 

450
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:50,814
All right.

451
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:09,720
   

452
00:41:11,736 --> 00:41:12,704
   

453
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,173
 What's with this meeting all of a sudden? 

454
00:41:17,578 --> 00:41:18,576
   

455
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:32,123
Let's get started.

456
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,448
Why did we become the target...

457
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,678
Let's go get lunch.

458
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,814
Talk about tension.

459
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,783
I understand...

460
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,918
Why are you so down?

461
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,221
Did the client ask for a revision?

462
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:08,058
What is it?

463
00:42:09,394 --> 00:42:12,863
Nothing. You'll find out soon enough.

464
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,801
What?

465
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:21,605
What's this?

466
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,741
The previous CD reassignment...

467
00:42:24,741 --> 00:42:27,778
I understand that. I'll be honest.

468
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,015
We all just turned a blind eye to the problem. Agree?

469
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:33,183
We just let it slide by.

470
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:35,585
Well, I'm partly glad that they're finally out.

471
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,189
I agree.

472
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:40,023
But this time it's not right.

473
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:44,465
If we look down on the open recruitment staff, who will show loyalty to the company?

474
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:47,664
Loyalty...

475
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,502
- That's the problem. 
 - What?

476
00:42:52,502 --> 00:42:57,708
Work demands competence, not loyalty.

477
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,513
Because of open recruitment, or someone's support,

478
00:43:02,513 --> 00:43:08,028
they mess up and still get promoted, which is why the company has come to this!

479
00:43:08,028 --> 00:43:09,954
Come to this?

480
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:11,655
We are the best in the industry.

481
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,325
Your words are too harsh.

482
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:16,293
Too harsh?

483
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:23,900
Department Head Cha Seong Woo.

484
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,141
   

485
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:36,046
Send this to me by tomorrow.

486
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,049
What is it? Our client's wedding invitation.

487
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:41,084
But I'm busy with something else...

488
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,566
And you...

489
00:43:43,566 --> 00:43:45,188
These are pre-wedding photos.

490
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:49,426
Edit them nicely like beauty posters.

491
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,742
Why do I have to do that?

492
00:43:51,742 --> 00:43:56,266
The client is getting married. You can't do that much?

493
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,802
Hello, Director!

494
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:01,872
How are you doing with the wedding prep?

495
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,108
Not at all. Yes.

496
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:09,212
He's incompetent, but needs to win over the client

497
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,916
so he orders his team to do all kinds of dirty work.

498
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,118
And so...

499
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,358
   

500
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:23,460
 Yes, I can come tomorrow. 

501
00:44:24,262 --> 00:44:26,510
Isn't this why our copywriters and art directors

502
00:44:26,511 --> 00:44:30,800
that we invested money and time into are all quitting?

503
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,740
   

504
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,030
   

505
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,627
Okay. Next...

506
00:44:38,356 --> 00:44:39,536
Department Head Eun Soo Yeon.

507
00:44:39,537 --> 00:44:42,479
I'll take care of that.

508
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:46,315
Don't take care of it.

509
00:44:46,315 --> 00:44:50,821
Because as the CCO, I'll take care of it.

510
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,498
He should have known better than to make a fuss.

511
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:07,967
Department Head Eun's office politics forced another department head to move to our rival company.

512
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:10,007
Remember?

513
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:12,109
It wasn't entirely her fault...

514
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:13,543
This year alone

515
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:18,482
the PT billing we lost to our former worker's team

516
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:21,651
amounts to about 35 billion won.

517
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:30,096
Eun Soo Yeon whom you all love so much tossed away 35 billion won to office politics.

518
00:45:30,096 --> 00:45:32,463
Isn't that an exaggeration?

519
00:45:32,463 --> 00:45:34,964
An exaggeration?

520
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:38,912
Not including our affiliates, don't you know that we are losing our clients?

521
00:45:38,912 --> 00:45:41,504
That's because companies are struggling right now.

522
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,274
Am I the only one who knows

523
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:45,742
that the VC Communications has become one lousy mess?

524
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,978
Must I say more?

525
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:57,687
Even so, what you've done...

526
00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,056
I'll resign.

527
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,333
I'll bet on boosting revenue by 50% within 6 months.

528
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:14,070
If I fail to deliver, I'll take responsibility and step down.

529
00:46:26,551 --> 00:46:30,220
Are you crazy? Why are you quitting?

530
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,921
Say something. Anything. Why are you suddenly quitting?

531
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:37,460
Are you ill? Or... Say something.

532
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:40,864
Can't you see I'm eating?

533
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:46,136
I didn't make the decision overnight.

534
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:47,738
I think it's time.

535
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,673
Why? Because of your son?

536
00:46:49,674 --> 00:46:52,409
I can't make him motherless any longer.

537
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,377
But it's good to have a successful mom.

538
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:58,515
For children, the best mom is one who never leaves their side.

539
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:01,485
I have no appetite.

540
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:03,988
See? See?

541
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,856
Since you decided to quit, you've lost your appetite

542
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:08,625
and can only eat two bowls of rice.

543
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:11,861
Right? It's like there's a thorn in my mouth.

544
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:15,006
Let's go get something sweet for positive thinking.

545
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:19,470
Get up. Let's go.

546
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,843
Senior Director, let's think a bit positively.

547
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:33,850
I think everyone here is a little mistaken.

548
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:39,889
I don't have parents, didn't go to a Seoul university, and was born poor.

549
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:45,061
That's why you made me the face of the company.

550
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,863
Isn't that so?

551
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,304
Think positively?

552
00:47:54,304 --> 00:47:58,008
That's an attitude for those who have a lot.

553
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,310
Like all of you.

554
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:04,745
Types like me who have nothing to lose don't think positively.

555
00:48:04,745 --> 00:48:07,584
We think monetarily.

556
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:14,424
I'll show you the results in numbers.

557
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,028
But if you still wish to stop me...

558
00:48:19,029 --> 00:48:23,700
How about it? Bet your positions like me!

559
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,102
What are you scared of?

560
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,990
But if I succeed,

561
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:37,517
who will step down?

562
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:50,727
Senior Director Choi, will you bet your seat?

563
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,466
How about it? Senior Director Choi?

564
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:02,639
Will you bet your position on my failure?

565
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:08,410
   

566
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:22,604
No one else?

567
00:49:23,873 --> 00:49:31,496
Then, let me tell you first. If you want to stop me, bet your position.

568
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:43,646
I'm for it.

569
00:49:45,216 --> 00:49:46,850
Isn't it clear?

570
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:52,285
The newly appointed CCO gave exact figures for the revenue increase and the deadline,

571
00:49:52,285 --> 00:49:55,659
and promised to resign should she fail.

572
00:49:55,659 --> 00:50:02,263
I'm someone who only looks at numbers, so I like that it's straightforward.

573
00:50:02,263 --> 00:50:04,134
How about it?

574
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,650
Senior Director Go.

575
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:21,518
Yes.

576
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:24,921
Will you take responsibility for what you've said?

577
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:27,891
Yes.

578
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:30,994
Sir, I don't think she can take responsibility alone...

579
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:32,762
Go ahead.

580
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:39,369
I give my approval. As the CEO.

581
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,675
Thank you. Then, I'll get going first.

582
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,486
All right, shall we...

583
00:51:33,872 --> 00:51:35,692
Off! Off!

584
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,775
   

585
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:45,268
You've won.

586
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,739
Not won, I've survived.

587
00:51:49,739 --> 00:51:51,675
Are you getting off work now?

588
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,476
 Yes. 

589
00:51:53,476 --> 00:51:56,613
Take some days off and rest up.

590
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,048
I'll rest in my grave.

591
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:01,451
Let's prepare for the Woowon Group from tomorrow.

592
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:05,054
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

593
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,826
 Department Head Han, do you think you'll be safe? 

594
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,161
 I didn't know you were this kind of person. 

595
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:14,964
 I'll see how far you and Go Ah In go. 

596
00:52:14,964 --> 00:52:18,501
How far will you go?

597
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:22,872
How long will you fight?

598
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:43,326
Cool down. Laser beams are about to shoot out of your eyes

599
00:52:45,924 --> 00:52:48,998
Look!  This meat is undercooked.

600
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,867
Father, should I cook it a little more?

601
00:52:50,868 --> 00:52:54,404
It will be too chewy. My teeth are bad.

602
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:57,407
Grandpa, should I chew it for you?

603
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,976
That social media thing on your phone?

604
00:52:59,976 --> 00:53:02,812
Don't bite others with that.

605
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:08,151
Forgive her. That's her charm.

606
00:53:08,151 --> 00:53:09,753
What do you do for fun these days?

607
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,856
Oh, I'm having a blast with my friends!

608
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:17,293
I don't buy friendship like you do.

609
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:20,597
It's good that you have a lot of friends.

610
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:25,301
I only work, so I don't have time to make friends.

611
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:29,739
You lack friends because of your character, not time.

612
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:34,010
Hey, Kang Hanna, you keep talking trash...

613
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,051
I'm sorry.

614
00:53:44,491 --> 00:53:47,991
I'm not worried about the two who will get married,

615
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,892
but about the relationship between the sisters-in-law.

616
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:53,062
They went to the same elementary, middle, and high schools.

617
00:53:53,062 --> 00:53:55,298
- Same university as well? 
 - No, different universities.

618
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:59,135
For university, we could choose where we wanted to go.

619
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:01,972
Choose? You went according to your grades.

620
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,573
What about you?

621
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,208
Hey, settle down.

622
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,543
They fight because they know each other.

623
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:08,178
They're on the same level.

624
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:12,982
Keep fighting. Whoever wins is on my side.

625
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,890
Eldest son.

626
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:22,625
Yes.

627
00:54:22,625 --> 00:54:25,528
Eat up if you want to fight.

628
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,363
Yes.

629
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:37,506
When should we set the wedding?

630
00:54:37,506 --> 00:54:40,377
- They must tie the knot soon. 
 - Yes.

631
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:44,580
Stand on my side with your share of our company.

632
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:49,486
And if you side with me with your share of our company...

633
00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:51,254
Yes.

634
00:54:51,254 --> 00:54:54,191
There are too many things interfering with the administration.

635
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:55,858
Sir.

636
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:00,897
What?

637
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,701
Here?

638
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:09,505
A warrant has been issued for violating the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act.

639
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:11,540
Come with us.

640
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:15,745
Did it have to be at this time?

641
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:18,114
At this place?

642
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:23,920
You're here to humiliate me!

643
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,158
Is there a separate place and time for official duties?

644
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:36,532
Sir, I think you must go for now.

645
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:42,071
I apologize for the interruption.

646
00:55:42,071 --> 00:55:43,873
This must cause quite a headache.

647
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:47,677
I'll do what I can to help.

648
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,890
   

649
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:07,063
What should we do?

650
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:12,067
You know how recklessly Senior Director Go works.

651
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:14,004
How do we keep face...

652
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,773
Who will treat us as their seniors now?

653
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,176
We can't even object because she's right...

654
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:22,145
I...

655
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,984
will sort it out.

656
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:35,191
And why are you all so naive?

657
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:38,127
Do you think she's doing this for the company?

658
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:41,530
She's doing it to make her own team.

659
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:44,000
What do you mean?

660
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:47,236
It's divide and rule.

661
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:53,109
Shall I start recruiting my side now?

662
00:56:55,045 --> 00:56:59,599
Her intention is to create opposing sides internally and make one-half hers for sure.

663
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,119
You knew all that and still let this happen?

664
00:57:05,056 --> 00:57:11,060
Why are you letting a nobody pull the strings?

665
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:15,131
Go Ah In will fade soon enough.

666
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:23,072
Do you think I'm not capable of doing that much?

667
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:34,684
Then, we will leave it up to you.

668
00:57:34,684 --> 00:57:36,986
Please sort it out.

669
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:45,597
In any case, I apologize for causing concern.

670
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:02,702
Damn.

671
00:58:02,702 --> 00:58:06,282
I hate fish with a lot of bones.

672
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:11,487
How do I go about deboning this?

673
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,964
Is the Senior Director in?

674
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:24,634
She just left.

675
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,704
But...

676
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:34,076
She said that you should read that.

677
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:40,990
   

678
00:58:43,795 --> 00:58:45,388
What the heck is this?

679
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:49,726
 The person waiting thinks about the flaws of the person who made them wait. 

680
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:54,664
 I waited a while for you to show your skills, but saw only flaws. 

681
00:58:54,664 --> 00:58:56,465
 Goodbye. 

682
00:58:57,275 --> 00:58:59,135
Senior Director.

683
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,606
She just left.

684
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,540
   

685
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,780
A great copy.

686
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:17,787
I'll get this copy confirmed.

687
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,436
Senior Director Go, are you leaving now?

688
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:47,450
Is this a joke? Having fun?

689
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:52,229
You're worked up.

690
00:59:52,229 --> 00:59:55,625
A person makes mistakes when they're worked up.

691
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:59,261
Shall we talk later when you've calmed down?

692
00:59:59,261 --> 01:00:01,931
 A person makes mistakes when they're worked up. 

693
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:06,135
 Let's talk later when you've calmed down. 

694
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:15,044
You want to cross the line? Are you asking for it?

695
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:18,415
I didn't know you could lose your cool at work.

696
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:21,284
I plan on it when you're around.

697
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:23,853
All right, keep it up.

698
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,654
What the...

699
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:29,592
Ah, I almost forgot. What should I do?

700
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:35,064
While trying to climb up to where you are,

701
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:39,502
instead of suffering through misery and pain,

702
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,875
I hurt my hand.

703
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:49,011
What should I do?

704
01:00:49,011 --> 01:00:51,948
There's a wound on this pretty palm.

705
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:54,116
Put some ointment on it.

706
01:00:54,918 --> 01:00:58,053
A wound heals fast,

707
01:00:58,053 --> 01:01:02,925
but it takes time for a scar to fade.

708
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:06,629
Like... about a year?

709
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:17,106
I have to look at this ugly thing every day until then.

710
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:21,810
For that long? Just get over it.

711
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:26,582
How can I get over it? I was smart enough to climb up this high.

712
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:35,425
When a rainstorm blows, you find out

713
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:40,827
the difference between a flower that grew delicately in a greenhouse and a wild flower that grew on the street.

714
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,600
What?

715
01:01:43,601 --> 01:01:45,868
Wait for it.

716
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:51,440
I'll blow a rainstorm into your delicate mind.

717
01:01:54,370 --> 01:02:01,340


718
01:02:03,407 --> 01:02:08,390
   

719
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:16,010
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

720
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:22,370
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

721
01:02:22,370 --> 01:02:27,340
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

722
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,680
 They are taking action. 

723
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,382
 It's a resolution to dismiss you. 

724
01:02:33,383 --> 01:02:34,617
 Do you like my card? 

725
01:02:34,618 --> 01:02:37,353
 Lame. Really lame. 

726
01:02:37,353 --> 01:02:40,690
 Someone on another level will take care of it. 

727
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:44,526
 Kang Hanna might look easy, but don't underestimate her. 

728
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,528
 We must give her a proper welcome. 

729
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:47,730
 They're going to explode... 

730
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:48,764
 You can't do that. 

731
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,532
 Senior Director Choi doesn't seem to know. 

732
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,234
 That... crazy... 

733
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:57,740
 There are storms strong enough to knock down greenhouses. 

734
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:02,410
♫
