1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:11,140


2
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,941
   

3
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,043
People would go see the minister if his dog died,

4
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:20,046
but they wouldn't show up if the minister died.

5
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,625
Thank you, Dad.

6
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:37,762
I thought I'd be getting married in a shabby wedding hall with no guests.

7
00:01:37,762 --> 00:01:39,766
Your dad hasn't lost his touch yet.

8
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:43,203
Thank you for taking care of all of this.

9
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,004
You should be good to him. This is all thanks to him.

10
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:49,409
We're colleagues. It's nothing.

11
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,578
What you're doing now is enough.

12
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:58,466
- Oh, congratulations, Ji Woo! 
 - Congrats!

13
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,193
Hey!

14
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:02,088
I'm so jealous. This place is beautiful!

15
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,157
Ji Woo, we'll be outside.

16
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:06,426
- Hello! 
 - Hello.

17
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,395
- Let's take a picture. 
 - Sit down!

18
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:12,898
Okay, look over here!

19
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:14,800
You look beautiful.

20
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,470
One more.

21
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,519
   

22
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,771
   

23
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,865
   

24
00:02:49,717 --> 00:02:50,730
   

25
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:52,746
   

26
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,566
   

27
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,555
Let's stick to the plan.

28
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,056
Sure.

29
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:14,193
Would I have agreed to help without a plan?

30
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,840
Senior?

31
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,343
Oh, you're here.

32
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,947
Senior Director Go, welcome.

33
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:59,818
Now, the bridal march. Here comes the bride!

34
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:49,952
Where's the senior director?

35
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:52,359
Huh?

36
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,561
What? Is she not here yet?

37
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:58,130
It's not that. Look over there.

38
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,772
Their expressions are the opposite of one another.

39
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:11,310
Thank you for coming here today to celebrate these two in holy matrimony.

40
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,413
I'd like to welcome the guests.

41
00:05:14,413 --> 00:05:17,650
I only wish these two happiness.

42
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,485
What do you think you're doing?

43
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,687
What do you mean?

44
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:24,256
Why are you using Senior Jeong Seok in our fight?

45
00:05:24,256 --> 00:05:26,192
I'm not using him.

46
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,727
We needed another executive on the creative team.

47
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,630
I offered my idea to the vice-president and he approved.

48
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,500
I offered it to Jeong Seok, and he accepted it.

49
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,937
Is there a problem?

50
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,107
Take a look.

51
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:49,315
When was the last time you saw him make that expression?

52
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:54,687
What do you take him for?

53
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,288
What?

54
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,106
You said I was using Jeong Seok.

55
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,363
What about you?

56
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:08,501
To you, he's merely someone who should work at a shabby dive bar.

57
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,568
What are you talking about?

58
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:14,673
He's someone you can go to whenever you need him. Right?

59
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:22,147
Yeah, I'm using Jeong Seok right now.

60
00:06:22,147 --> 00:06:29,422
But I gave him something he earnestly craved.

61
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,725
What about you?

62
00:06:34,961 --> 00:06:39,899
After all the time you've been using him, what did you give him?

63
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,404
Is that any reason to bring him into this?

64
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,205
Isn't there a line you shouldn't cross?

65
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,707
A line I shouldn't cross?

66
00:06:48,707 --> 00:06:52,645
Weren't you the one that dragged Kang Hanna into our fight?

67
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:56,282
- How can you compare the two? 
 - You said you'd bring the storm.

68
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,152
 You learn during a storm. 

69
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,296
 There's a difference between a flower that grew delicately in a greenhouse 

70
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:06,025
 and a wild flower that grew on the street. 

71
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,661
 - What? 
 - Wait for it. 

72
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:13,432
 I'll make sure to bring the storm down on your delicate mental state. 

73
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:17,903
Why are you so quiet these days?

74
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:23,676
Weren't we at war?

75
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:29,448
Why are you so peaceful by yourself?

76
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,620
Did you think you already won?

77
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,161
We'll get to today's highlight. The bride and groom march!

78
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,631
Everyone, please rise and congratulate the new husband and wife!

79
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,734
Here comes the bride and groom!

80
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:57,977
It seems I owe you an apology.

81
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:05,918
If I seemed peaceful as if the war had ended,

82
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,954
that wouldn't be polite to my opponent.

83
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,557
Of course.

84
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:18,371
Even if we are at war, we should do so with courtesy.

85
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,390
 (Thank you) 

86
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:47,760
Of course. It's not over until it's over.

87
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:56,002
   

88
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:08,080
Wait! Aren't you going to eat?

89
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,950
- What? 
 - Just let her go.

90
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,018
Did something happen?

91
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:15,955
I'm sure we'll find out if something happened.

92
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,798
 Episode 14] 

93
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,164
Are you leaving without eating breakfast?

94
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,301
You haven't eaten since yesterday.

95
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:33,772
Did you drink?

96
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,241
I drank yesterday.

97
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,411
Who are you?

98
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:44,183
I'm Senior Director Kang's secretary as of today.

99
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:48,253
What? Where did Deputy Park go?

100
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,433
Han Soo.

101
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,002
Yes, Grandfather?

102
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,825
Eat up.

103
00:10:04,825 --> 00:10:07,406
You can't fight on an empty stomach.

104
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,787
I found out this morning.

105
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,189
Then, was he pressured to resign?

106
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,392
No, he turned in his letter of resignation on his own.

107
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:28,928
He refused everything the vice-president had offered him.

108
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:30,596
What offer?

109
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,740
Really? He refused that?

110
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,107
Yes.

111
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,544
Was his resignation processed?

112
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:48,347
No, not yet.

113
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,016
- Don't process it yet. 
 - Yes, sir.

114
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:08,500
Huh! Mr. Yoo!

115
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:12,437
Eun Jeong, thanks for coming to the wedding.

116
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,684
Oh, no problem.

117
00:11:13,684 --> 00:11:17,076
But what brings you here this early?

118
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,179
Well, I came because of work.

119
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,381
Work? What work?

120
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,018
Did someone run out on their tab?

121
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:29,755
Do people still drink on credit these days?

122
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,058
Sir?

123
00:11:33,058 --> 00:11:34,293
Hey.

124
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,428
Are you coming to work?

125
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,198
Yeah.

126
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,166
Did you talk this over with the senior director?

127
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,434
Of course. But not with the senior director that you're referring to.

128
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:46,205
A different senior director.

129
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,709
That's a very awkward combination.

130
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:52,545
Awkward combinations create creativity.

131
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,647
We can't be afraid of something like that.

132
00:11:56,616 --> 00:11:59,251
Isn't that how I taught you before?

133
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,355
I look forward to working with you.

134
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:06,091
You're not disappointed that we'll be seeing more of each other. Right?

135
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:07,630
No.

136
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,070
   

137
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:31,783
It seems Yoo Jeong Seok came here to work.

138
00:12:31,783 --> 00:12:34,393
The insurance project was well-received, how are they going to extend the campaign?

139
00:12:34,393 --> 00:12:37,123
No, tell me what's going on.

140
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,826
Which projects haven't gone into shooting yet?

141
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,031
Can't you hear me? Aren't you going to work?

142
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:49,668
I'll organize it and report back to you.

143
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,538
- Mr. Han? 
 - Yes?

144
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,641
In order to get in the way of my work from inside the creative team,

145
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,343
Senior Director Choi brought Jeong Seok into this.

146
00:12:58,344 --> 00:13:02,214
Do you want to waste your time fighting over that?

147
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,084
No, I understand what you're saying.

148
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:10,386
Increasing sales by 50%. If we just figure that out, the rest will fall into place.

149
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:13,725
Organize what the team will be working on in advance.

150
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,861
What should the standard be?

151
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:17,282
Speed.

152
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:19,131
Speed is our top priority right now.

153
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, Ma'am.

154
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:35,013
Would you like to eat before we go?

155
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,100
 I want you to continue to like me. Because I'm going to keep liking you. 

156
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:03,122
 You could end up losing everything. 

157
00:14:03,122 --> 00:14:04,645
 You need to know when to give up. 

158
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:07,546
 I'm going to create that type of society. 

159
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:11,517
 Even if that will cost you everything that you have? 

160
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:16,176
 Without you, there's no one in the world who's on my side. 

161
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,435
I was told that you liked this restaurant.

162
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,692
Just go.

163
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:34,473
- One more thing. 
 - Yes?

164
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,609
I hate this place.

165
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,773
What?

166
00:15:41,773 --> 00:15:43,809
Father, that's enough.

167
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,444
What are you talking about?

168
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,081
Stop meddling in my daughter and son's lives.

169
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,218
When did I ever meddle?

170
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,287
You're doing it now!

171
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:59,325
Are you not satisfied with how you controlled my life?

172
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:02,227
Do you have to control my children's lives as well?

173
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,696
Will that make you feel better?

174
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:09,635
It seems you're very mistaken.

175
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,737
Why are Han Soo and Hanna fighting?

176
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,974
Because you're making them compete against each other.

177
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:17,375
Then, why are they competing?

178
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:21,413
Isn't it because they want to be the chairman of my company, VC Group?

179
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,348
How can you say this only involves your children?

180
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,817
It's about who becomes the successor to the company I built!

181
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,687
It doesn't matter. You're ruining them!

182
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:30,455
- Yong Ho. 
 - Yes?

183
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:36,428
You, Han Soo, and Hanna are all the same. Rather than being family,

184
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,398
you're the first servants who get paid at my company.

185
00:16:40,398 --> 00:16:43,702
Leave everything and go if you don't like it.

186
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:55,514
Make plans with Chairman Woo Won.

187
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,249
Yes, sir.

188
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,785
That's all you need to do at the board meeting.

189
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,954
Okay, and the rest?

190
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:07,092
I'll take care of the rest. You're in charge internally.

191
00:17:08,995 --> 00:17:10,495
Yes?

192
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:18,169
It's been so long!

193
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,122
You too.

194
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,080
I heard you've been through a lot.

195
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,611
I hope you can take control.

196
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:26,838
Go Ah In.

197
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,782
She can't be controlled.

198
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,852
She hasn't changed since she first started the company.

199
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:38,218
That's right. Go Ah In has changed!

200
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:39,858
She has? How?

201
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:42,862
She was even having a company dinner with her team the other day!

202
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,863
That's nothing.

203
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,965
You think?

204
00:17:46,965 --> 00:17:48,533
Still.

205
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:51,471
She even took her secretary to a dinner.

206
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,939
Secretary? Who?

207
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,620
- Are you talking about Mr. Park? 
 - No.

208
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,478
Her. Go Ah In's secretary.

209
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:13,025
You don't say.

210
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:19,431
I have something else to add to the meeting.

211
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:48,190
   

212
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,107
- The chairman's daughter? 
 - Yeah.

213
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:18,022
I see you have a new secretary, Senior Director Kang. 
 - Yes.

214
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,726
Are you just now getting to work?

215
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,782
You must have a lot of free time on your hands. You pay attention to the smallest things.

216
00:19:24,782 --> 00:19:28,834
I'm just telling you to care about your presence at work.

217
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,470
Is it because you have no work to do?

218
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:33,605
What?

219
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:35,181
What do you do these days?

220
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:38,877
What advertisers are you in charge of?

221
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:47,724
Employees who don't care about not having any are those who lack presence at work.

222
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,289
Don't you think so?

223
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,114
- What do you think you're doing? 
 - He's right.

224
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,732
Lack of presence at work is a mess.

225
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:01,533
Right?

226
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,335
You're right.

227
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,870
The chief project officer doesn't work. He just goes back and forth to headquarters every day.

228
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,542
How can the company work properly?

229
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:16,281
That's why I called for this board meeting.

230
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,185
To make sure this company works properly.

231
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,070
   

232
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,496
I think we can take care of this one quickly.

233
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:33,698
Let's pair it up with a planning office that's good with off-the-wall things.

234
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:35,300
I'll try to wrap it up quickly.

235
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,535
Okay. This one's in fashion.

236
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:38,735
I'll take care of that one.

237
00:20:38,735 --> 00:20:40,205
Just write a one-line copy for me.

238
00:20:40,205 --> 00:20:41,906
Then this one.

239
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,943
I'll take care of the internet finance and insurance ones.

240
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,978
Okay, and I'll take care of the rest.

241
00:20:47,978 --> 00:20:51,683
I knew it! It's great that our team is so in sync!

242
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,271
Things are going smoothly!

243
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:56,521
Of course. I hate being on a team of people who can't understand.

244
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:59,858
It takes more time to persuade them and get them to understand things.

245
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:00,693
Right?

246
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:04,131
We have less than a month to increase sales by 50%.

247
00:21:04,131 --> 00:21:05,797
Let's figure it out quickly.

248
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:08,433
Then we can have another company dinner!

249
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,435
Yeah!

250
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:16,307
I suggest disbanding the TF team.

251
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,688
I'm aware that the TF team was created for the Woowon Group presentation.

252
00:21:29,688 --> 00:21:31,589
Is that correct?

253
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,026
Yes.

254
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:38,351
But... what's your reason for maintaining it?

255
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:44,065
Not to mention, you have three CDs on one team. I wonder if that's efficient.

256
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:46,238
Because work is progressing fine.

257
00:21:46,238 --> 00:21:50,707
Putting together employees who aren't in sync would be less efficient.

258
00:21:50,707 --> 00:21:54,289
No. That's a short-sighted way of thinking.

259
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:59,449
While CDs try to get in sync with new team members, there's bound to be conflict.

260
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:03,155
Advertisements are based on personal taste after all.

261
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:11,000
After all, isn’t that a kind of growth time that enhances workability?

262
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,701
Can you go into more detail?

263
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,136
Advertising is a type of persuasion.

264
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:23,674
The starting point for learning how to persuade is the conference room.

265
00:22:23,674 --> 00:22:28,513
Finding a team member internally who has a different opinion, logic, or strategy.

266
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:31,950
They must learn to persuade someone creatively.

267
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:39,257
Isn't that the only way they'll be able to persuade the advertisers and consumers?

268
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:46,898
Putting employees together just because they're comfortable

269
00:22:46,898 --> 00:22:50,802
weakens the company's growth.

270
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,773
What's your opinion on this, Senior Director Go?

271
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,308
I'm sure she feels the same way as me.

272
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:03,411
That's how I learned and that's how I taught her in the past.

273
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,484
Aren't I right?

274
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:21,633
Then we'll disband the TF team as Senior Director Yoo said.

275
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,402
Oh, there's one more thing.

276
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,637
Go ahead.

277
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,673
It's about the executive directors' secretaries.

278
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:32,377
I request that we cancel all of their contracts.

279
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,115
The industry isn't doing that great.

280
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:42,420
There's no need to keep secretaries when they don't do as they're told.

281
00:23:44,682 --> 00:23:46,067
Why?

282
00:23:46,067 --> 00:23:50,795
Do you want to be the only one who uses a secretary?

283
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:57,836
Oh, Senior Director Hanna is an exception.

284
00:23:57,836 --> 00:24:03,828
She's different from us. She'd rather work comfortably.

285
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:41,332
   

286
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:49,954
 Oh, Senior Director Hanna is an exception. 

287
00:24:49,954 --> 00:24:54,926
 She's different from us. She'd rather work comfortably. 

288
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:59,264
Since you've lost your weakness, you should be getting stronger.

289
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,000
How can you get weaker?

290
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,909
 Thanks. 

291
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:14,579
 What are you doing? 

292
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,615
 I'm heading home for my mom's cooking. 

293
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,983
 Eat up and come back to work! 

294
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,552
 Your letter of resignation hasn't been processed yet. 

295
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:30,495
My heart's already back there.

296
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:45,410
- Come see me. 
 - Okay.

297
00:26:02,068 --> 00:26:05,096
Human Resources will call you soon.

298
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,848
What?

299
00:26:06,848 --> 00:26:08,066
Why?

300
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:10,935
It was decided at the board meeting.

301
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:18,610
Other than the CEO's, all the secretaries will be fired.

302
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,617
I think Senior Director Choi figured it out.

303
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,460
I'm sorry.

304
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:42,567
I'll go and pack my things.

305
00:26:42,567 --> 00:26:45,203
Is that all you have to say?

306
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:49,574
"Take responsibility."

307
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:52,042
"Help me find another job."

308
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,112
Why can't you say these things?

309
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,065
If you go because they tell you to, what will you do for a job?

310
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:05,990
If there was a way, I'm sure you would've done it already.

311
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:10,962
I can get a part-time job and look for a new job.

312
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:14,746
Just wait a little while.

313
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:17,968
I'll find another way.

314
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:20,772
Thank you for everything.

315
00:27:46,749 --> 00:27:49,434
We're just moving next door but I don't want to go.

316
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:51,202
Me too.

317
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:56,774
Why do you think the company tries to make their employees not want to come to work?

318
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:02,180
What are they thinking?

319
00:28:06,974 --> 00:28:09,220
Eun Jeong?

320
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,723
Soo Jeong, what's that?

321
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:27,154
Even if you're forced to resign, shouldn't they tell you a few months in advance?

322
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:29,240
I'm just a contract employee.

323
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,077
Also, I got another month's salary.

324
00:28:33,077 --> 00:28:35,780
It's my severance pay.

325
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:38,882
- I'll grab you a taxi. 
 - No.

326
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:40,751
Give that to me. I can just take the subway.

327
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:43,554
No, I'll grab a taxi for you.

328
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,891
See you again, Soo Jeong.

329
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,494
We'll look for another job at a different company for you.

330
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:52,497
- Yeah, we'll look into it. 
 - We will.

331
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,228
Thank you for that.

332
00:28:55,229 --> 00:28:57,335
Bye!

333
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,937
Bye.

334
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:08,614
What?

335
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:11,877
How can she take the subway with all her stuff? She needs to take a taxi.

336
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:15,419
She's doing that because she can't afford it.

337
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,956
So this is how they're going to play it?

338
00:29:18,956 --> 00:29:21,125
Did they think I'd take this sitting down?

339
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:23,327
What? Do you have a plan?

340
00:29:23,327 --> 00:29:24,762
We need to fight back just as hard.

341
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:26,669
No.

342
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:31,066
I don't know what you're thinking right now, but don't do that.

343
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,378
Look at your phone.

344
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,709
His name was Yoo Jeong Seok, right?

345
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:48,085
It's not Yoo Jeon Seok or Ryu Jeong Seok, right?

346
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,655
It is, but why?

347
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:54,692
Because there can't be a single error!

348
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:25,003
   

349
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,760
I'll write it 99 times.

350
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:32,630
He could die if I write it 100 times.

351
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,382
It's all pointless.

352
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,690
♫  When the world turns its back  ♫

353
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:12,100
♫  Tell me, "I'm on your side"  ♫

354
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:15,038
There's no betrayal.

355
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:17,190
The person who trusted another is at fault.

356
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,790
♫  When an anxious tomorrow hurts you, tell it  ♫

357
00:31:21,794 --> 00:31:27,218
Humans are just beasts who live for their own interests in the end.

358
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,560
♫  When you're having a hard time  ♫

359
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:47,610
♫  Tell me there is someone who knows me  ♫

360
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:56,430
♫  Love yourself and believe myself  ♫

361
00:31:56,430 --> 00:32:03,740
♫  I know everything but there are times when I don't  ♫

362
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:13,890
♫  Don't give up, always be happy  ♫

363
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:16,233
Round and round I went.

364
00:32:19,351 --> 00:32:22,139
I'm back to where I started.

365
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,864
Are you leaving without having breakfast?

366
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,101
- Yeah, I can't be a second late! 
 - Why?

367
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:53,438
Starting today, I can't show any flaws at work.

368
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,908
If you don't want to show them any flaws, shouldn't you just stay home?

369
00:32:57,908 --> 00:32:59,942
Oh! My phone!

370
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,197
Goodness!

371
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:17,342
Ah Ji, what's wrong? Oh! A kiss?

372
00:33:17,342 --> 00:33:22,567
No. Mom, pull yourself together.

373
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,339
Bye.

374
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,344
What did you put in your mom's bag?

375
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,046
A copy.

376
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,692
Ugh, I really don't want to move.

377
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,894
We have no choice.

378
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:14,185
CD Eun Jeong?

379
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,921
- Yeah? 
 - What is this?

380
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,732
Huh? What's this doing here?

381
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:45,149
Yes, I see now.

382
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,653
No wonder I couldn't sleep well last night.

383
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:51,722
Don't tell me you wrote it 100 times.

384
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:53,590
Excuse me?

385
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,927
I'd die if you did. You know that, right?

386
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:59,396
Yes, that's why I wrote it 99 times.

387
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:04,435
I'm sorry.

388
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,340
I should speak to Senior Director Go.

389
00:35:09,341 --> 00:35:15,559
No, no. No.

390
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:22,139
I'm screwed.

391
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,738
Yes?

392
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:35,065
I don't think I've formally said hello yet.

393
00:35:35,065 --> 00:35:38,302
You're right. Take a seat.

394
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,859
I think you're very lucky.

395
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:06,497
There aren't that many loyal employees like that these days.

396
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:11,501
Even though I don't recognize the handwriting,

397
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,505
I know for sure who wrote it.

398
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,477
Are you not curious about anything about me?

399
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,913
I don't have the time to be curious.

400
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:27,885
I don't even have the time to figure out how to handle this.

401
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:31,452
True, I bet you're busy with a variety of things.

402
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,291
Do you understand my decision?

403
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,167
I do.

404
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:39,163
Because the benefits can clearly be seen.

405
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:43,300
However, I can't accept it.

406
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,771
It seemed as if your secretary left the company.

407
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:49,874
Must be nice.

408
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,409
You got someone who's not involved in this fired.

409
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,225
When you fish,

410
00:36:54,226 --> 00:36:57,781
there are times when unexpected fish surface.

411
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:01,519
But that can't stop you from fishing.

412
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,621
What do you want to say?

413
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:06,121
Shall I congratulate you on joining the company again?

414
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:09,560
Or did you want me to tell you that I was okay?

415
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,898
The guilt you're feeling in your heart.

416
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,002
Did you come here to try to shake it off?

417
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:29,980
Senior Director Go, don't believe only what you see.

418
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:34,418
Don't look at the fishing rod, look at the bait.

419
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:39,991
Yes, I'll be watching very closely!

420
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:55,409
It would've been nice if we saw one another yesterday.

421
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:58,279
I have plans.

422
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:02,313
It's fine. I was urgent in reaching out.

423
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:04,515
Can I ask why?

424
00:38:04,516 --> 00:38:05,949
You were going to appoint Han Soo as the vice-chairman

425
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,755
after the kids got married, but I want you to change it.

426
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,126
Change it in what way?

427
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,563
I want you to appoint him first and the marriage can come after.

428
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,233
By chance, are you doing this because of me?

429
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:25,669
Are you afraid I'll be incarcerated again after a second trial?

430
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:29,006
No, it's over a family matter.

431
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:31,298
We're a family now.

432
00:38:31,298 --> 00:38:34,912
Shouldn't I know as well?

433
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:41,619
That's true. I think you should know, too.

434
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:48,124
Did the meeting go well? Why wouldn't it?

435
00:38:48,124 --> 00:38:49,927
It's a good thing for his son-in-law.

436
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:52,031
- Shall I take you to headquarters? 
 - Yeah.

437
00:38:52,031 --> 00:38:55,133
No. Let's stop by the agency.

438
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,862
Do you want to tell Senior Director Kang?

439
00:38:57,862 --> 00:39:03,974
No. I want to see Hanna's face before I tell Han Soo.

440
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,843
Yes, sir.

441
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:16,254
What are you doing here? You didn't even call.

442
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:19,456
This is my company. Why do I have to call?

443
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:27,431
Wow, this couch is comfy!

444
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:30,200
Yeah, it sure is.

445
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,704
Are you busy?

446
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,274
I'm working hard to look busy.

447
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,407
Is working fun?

448
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:39,345
I'm working hard to make it look like it's fun.

449
00:39:39,345 --> 00:39:42,575
- And Mr. Park? 
 - I'm working hard to forget...

450
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,104
I told you to live a simple life,

451
00:39:45,112 --> 00:39:47,405
but you're working so hard.

452
00:39:47,405 --> 00:39:50,120
What is this? Did you come here to upset me?

453
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,057
I didn't process Mr. Park's letter of resignation.

454
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,638
Stop reading books that don't suit you.

455
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:01,332
Live like yourself.

456
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:03,401
I took care of the rest.

457
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,569
What did you do?

458
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:07,805
There's something like that.

459
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:16,447
Father, thank you.

460
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:18,116
I'll do my best.

461
00:40:18,116 --> 00:40:20,584
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

462
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:30,028
- But, Han Soo? 
 - Yes?

463
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:33,727
How do you feel about making another vice-chairman position?

464
00:40:33,728 --> 00:40:35,866
So you two can do it together.

465
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:37,635
What?

466
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,752
I'll just make another position

467
00:40:39,752 --> 00:40:41,605
and you and Hanna can do it together.

468
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:45,876
What has she done?

469
00:40:46,511 --> 00:40:49,647
You told me ever since I was young.

470
00:40:49,647 --> 00:40:51,882
"Give it up."

471
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:55,152
You said I'd be the chairman of VC Group.

472
00:40:55,152 --> 00:41:00,540
My dream as a boy, the major I wanted to study,

473
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,160
and the person I wanted to marry.

474
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,989
You said I'd be the chairman of VC Group,

475
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:08,733
so I've endured and given everything up until now!

476
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:12,093
- She hasn't given up anything! 
 - What I just said.

477
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:14,238
Just forget I said it.

478
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:17,074
It'll proceed the way it's supposed to.

479
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:18,443
Make sure word doesn't get out.

480
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:21,879
Especially, to your grandfather.

481
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:24,581
Do you understand what I'm saying?

482
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,944
I understand.

483
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:31,388
I'm sorry I raised my voice.

484
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,326
The shareholder's meeting will be next week.

485
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,563
Thank you.

486
00:41:43,268 --> 00:41:45,202
I'm leaving.

487
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:07,024
Now, there's just one thing left to take care of.

488
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,597
Can you make a reservation at a restaurant for me?

489
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,034
 Let's meet at 7:00. 

490
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,180
 There are some things we need to handle. 

491
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,792
You should've started eating.

492
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,629
I'm not someone who's starving.

493
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:47,731
Of course.

494
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,301
Someone who does work for me would have no reason to starve. Right?

495
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:52,436
Work?

496
00:42:52,437 --> 00:42:55,412
Take over the work that Senior Director Choi was doing for me.

497
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:57,886
My social media management.

498
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,546
Do I look like someone who would do something like that?

499
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:08,051
Oh, that's right. You can't see me at all, can you?

500
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:09,554
I see you.

501
00:43:09,555 --> 00:43:11,822
That's a pretty outfit.

502
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,596
You hired someone for the creative team without even consulting me.

503
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,299
- Who? 
 - Senior Director Yoo Jeong Seok.

504
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:24,935
Do I look like someone who needs to consult others?

505
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,957
Of course.

506
00:43:26,957 --> 00:43:32,001
Authority over the creative team is held by the chief creative officer.

507
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:42,085
This is why a table shouldn't be shared for too long.

508
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:50,373
Just do what you're told, take what you're paid, and live a life being a little more entitled than others.

509
00:43:50,373 --> 00:43:52,396
Why do you keep forgetting your place?

510
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,398
Why does someone that great need someone like me?

511
00:43:55,399 --> 00:43:57,168
I did need you. Up until now.

512
00:43:57,168 --> 00:43:59,679
But I don't anymore.

513
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,341
I need capable men before becoming the king.

514
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:09,111
Once I become king, I just need obedient servants.

515
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:19,222
Now I know why Senior Director Hanna hates you.

516
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,559
You do whatever you want.

517
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:26,129
I'm going to do whatever I want now, too.

518
00:44:26,129 --> 00:44:28,165
You'll regret it.

519
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:35,155
Who?

520
00:44:35,155 --> 00:44:37,304
Me?

521
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:41,678
The person who loses the most normally regrets more.

522
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,282
Who do you think has the most to lose?

523
00:45:00,298 --> 00:45:01,765
Hey.

524
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,233
Congratulations!

525
00:45:03,234 --> 00:45:05,169
My dad told me.

526
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,971
I was going to call you.

527
00:45:08,873 --> 00:45:12,376
- Why? 
 - Take care of something for me.

528
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,545
Why would you suddenly stop the ad?

529
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,865
I'll call you back.

530
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,409
   

531
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,829
Did something happen at headquarters?

532
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:34,765
You're going to stop the ads?

533
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:35,967
Yeah.

534
00:45:35,968 --> 00:45:38,968
Just until Go Ah In leaves the company.

535
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:41,105
How are you going to handle that?

536
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,340
What are you talking about?

537
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,309
You are interfering with company business as the chief project officer.

538
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:52,916
Go Ah In and the vice-president went at it yesterday.

539
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,303
He's angry.

540
00:45:54,304 --> 00:45:58,855
He used his personal connections to stop all the ads.

541
00:46:01,828 --> 00:46:05,228
Senior Director Yoo, thank you.

542
00:46:05,228 --> 00:46:06,330
For what?

543
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:11,067
This is the result of you breaking Go Ah In's composure.

544
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:33,111
Sir?

545
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:36,893
Did you have to go this far?

546
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:38,628
I understood you when you re-entered the company.

547
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,610
I thought I would do the same as well.

548
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:43,333
- But this? 
 - Are you not busy?

549
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:49,684
Instead of trying to argue with me, shouldn't you try to clean up the mess that's been made?

550
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:55,242
The vice-president from headquarters did this. He used his personal connections.

551
00:46:58,115 --> 00:46:59,794
You know, right?

552
00:46:59,794 --> 00:47:04,354
There's only one person at VC Communications

553
00:47:04,355 --> 00:47:06,523
who can fix this problem.

554
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:17,622
What are you doing? Get back to work!

555
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,155
Ma'am,

556
00:47:23,156 --> 00:47:26,843
the vice-president has cut off all ads for the agency.

557
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:27,611
Why?

558
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:30,947
He did it after he met with Senior Director Go.

559
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:34,918
It's been a while since I heard good news.

560
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:41,905
Mr. Hwang! You can't suddenly cut off the ads like this.

561
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:48,164
If Vice-President Kim Seo Jeong asked you to do this,

562
00:47:48,165 --> 00:47:50,100
I guess you had no choice.

563
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,535
Okay, I'm hanging up now.

564
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,873
You were right.

565
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:59,743
But Jeong Seok was the one that told you?

566
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:02,679
Yes, he said there was only one way to solve this.

567
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,289
And here she is.

568
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,694
I'm here for give and take.

569
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:24,634
Are you feeling more like yourself now?

570
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:29,005
As soon as I heard your relationship with Han Soo went sour.

571
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:48,491
You can use me.

572
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,210
The email from the advertiser before.

573
00:48:51,211 --> 00:48:53,763
You used me and settled things.

574
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:59,269
I know, too.

575
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:02,839
That there's not a single thing for me to do at this company.

576
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:07,177
All I have for myself is my background as Chairman Kang Yong Ho's daughter.

577
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:09,746
That's the only thing I have.

578
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:13,149
But the only way to fix this problem

579
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,651
is my background.

580
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:17,921
That's the only way.

581
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:26,529
I think you'll be able to workwithout asking questions now.

582
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:29,098
Is it a deal?

583
00:49:29,098 --> 00:49:33,436
I think one particular person will be very disappointed.

584
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:34,405
Who?

585
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:35,257
Someone.

586
00:49:35,258 --> 00:49:37,874
Someone who likes old-fashioned cream bread.

587
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:44,080
I think that's a problem I can fix, too.

588
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:23,119
Since we're going to do this, let's keep it clean.

589
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,790
Of course.

590
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,904
What shall we start with first?

591
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,641
We need to make a wish come true.

592
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,720
I heard you cut off all ads with our agency.

593
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,563
They're just ads. We can do them if we need

594
00:50:59,564 --> 00:51:02,025
and we can also cut them off if we don't need them.

595
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:03,593
Whose needs?

596
00:51:03,593 --> 00:51:05,428
Kang Han Soo's needs?

597
00:51:05,428 --> 00:51:06,625
What's going on?

598
00:51:06,626 --> 00:51:08,631
You did it because Han Soo asked you to?

599
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,895
She'll roll over and wag her tail with one single look from Han Soo.

600
00:51:11,896 --> 00:51:13,837
Hey, Kang Hanna!

601
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:17,516
Did you see that? She's enraged because I'm right!

602
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:20,443
I don't know if someone like her would ever keep her promise.

603
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,064
Promise?

604
00:51:22,064 --> 00:51:25,348
- What? 
 - You don't remember?

605
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:26,450
 Do you want to bet? 

606
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,305
 Yeah, sure! 

607
00:51:28,306 --> 00:51:29,253
 What do you want to bet on? 

608
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:30,563
 The loser will grant a wish. 

609
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:31,455
 Any wish. 

610
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:33,790
 You don't have to if you're not confident in winning. 

611
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,593
 One wish. Any wish. 

612
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:48,614
My wish is to recommence all of the ads you cut off right away.

613
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:50,802
I can't do that.

614
00:51:50,802 --> 00:51:52,976
Not right now.

615
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:54,297
Forget it.

616
00:51:54,298 --> 00:51:57,080
What power could you ever have?

617
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:01,618
But you can't even decide whether or not you want to do an ad at your own company.

618
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,719
How does that make you a vice-president?

619
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,988
I'll do it!

620
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:14,163
Hey, don't get called out by Han Soo so he can chew you out.

621
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:15,365
Just pretend like you didn't hear anything.

622
00:52:15,366 --> 00:52:16,633
What do you take me for?!

623
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:18,868
Then prove it.

624
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:29,446
   

625
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:34,076
Mr. Hwang?

626
00:52:34,077 --> 00:52:38,555
Recommence all the ads I canceled for VC communications.

627
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,724
Right now!

628
00:52:46,063 --> 00:52:47,982
I got the call from Woowon.

629
00:52:47,983 --> 00:52:49,365
Great job.

630
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,268
But the other side isn't that easy.

631
00:52:53,037 --> 00:52:54,538
I'm sure.

632
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,073
I'll keep trying.

633
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:59,542
Okay, try your best.

634
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:02,111
How much is left now?

635
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:05,448
We just need to fill 30 billion more in billing.

636
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:11,446
Is there a company that's not a conglomerate that can spend 30 billion won on marketing right now?

637
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:17,293
Shall we start the competing presentation now?

638
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,329
Maybe gather a few small advertisers.

639
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,031
If we start the presentation now, it'll take at least a month to execute.

640
00:53:24,031 --> 00:53:26,102
Is there any point in that?

641
00:53:26,971 --> 00:53:30,797
We have to persuade the existing advertisers. There's no other way.

642
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:35,429
Then shall I look into foreign companies? Domestic companies will be impossible.

643
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:38,514
Do we have any from our past advertisers?

644
00:53:44,488 --> 00:53:46,789
Yes, this is Go Ah In.

645
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:50,994
I'm available for a meeting now.

646
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,163
I'll be right there.

647
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,094
Who was that?

648
00:53:57,968 --> 00:54:00,770
When one door closes, another opens.

649
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:05,230
   

650
00:54:10,848 --> 00:54:14,417
The interest? It's expensive.

651
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,118
Then what was I supposed to do?

652
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,155
There's no other place that would lend me money.

653
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:27,497
I bet they'll spend a lot on ads.

654
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:37,879
Has it been three years? We were going to let VC Communications do our ads back then, too.

655
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:42,835
Did you? I don't remember that.

656
00:54:42,835 --> 00:54:45,041
I told them not to do it.

657
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:47,751
Because I'm sure you would've rejected it.

658
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:51,687
There are no other advertisers who spend as much as we do and get disrespected.

659
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:56,892
Even big models don't make ads for the secondary financial sector.

660
00:54:56,892 --> 00:55:00,397
Tell me why you wanted to see me.

661
00:55:00,434 --> 00:55:02,379
Senior Director Go,

662
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,602
does money have a nationality?

663
00:55:06,325 --> 00:55:07,771
It does.

664
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,739
Then what about color?

665
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,374
It has color.

666
00:55:11,374 --> 00:55:14,577
Then what about value?

667
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:21,183
Money is just money.

668
00:55:21,183 --> 00:55:23,553
They say our money comes from Japan.

669
00:55:23,554 --> 00:55:27,991
Many people say we are loan sharks sucking the nation's blood,

670
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:33,096
but they're the ones who come looking for Human&amp;Money when they're in need.

671
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:39,568
The problem is your image.

672
00:55:39,568 --> 00:55:43,840
What you want is to create a positive image for Human&amp;Money.

673
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:48,745
So more people can come here and take out loans. Right?

674
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,649
I knew you'd understand.

675
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:58,217
I heard the rumors on the streets. People said you were mad about money.

676
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:01,810
That still holds true.

677
00:56:01,811 --> 00:56:03,927
I like money.

678
00:56:03,927 --> 00:56:06,696
30 billion, with no presentation.

679
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:10,767
I'll make the deposit immediately if you say you'll do it.

680
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,396
Yeah.

681
00:56:18,483 --> 00:56:21,344
It's an offer that's difficult to refuse.

682
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:36,066
   

683
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,905
This is a little sudden.

684
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:54,043
I wasn't able to increase the sales by 50% in six months.

685
00:56:54,043 --> 00:56:56,846
I'll resign as promised.

686
00:56:56,846 --> 00:56:59,649
Don't you still have about three weeks left?

687
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:02,251
Supplies from the big conglomerates have been cut off.

688
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:05,988
It's impossible for me to fill that within three weeks.

689
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,996
Do you want to tell me how unfair this is?

690
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,704
"The vice-president of headquarters interfered."

691
00:57:16,705 --> 00:57:18,935
"I was almost there and I lost everything."

692
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:23,773
If you say that, don't you think the internal staff will acknowledge it?

693
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:29,092
It doesn't matter what others say.

694
00:57:29,092 --> 00:57:32,121
I can't acknowledge it.

695
00:57:32,121 --> 00:57:34,322
I should take responsibility for what I said.

696
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:36,329
As an adult.

697
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:46,196
Things got more comfortable at work once I lost my power.

698
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:49,451
There's nothing to worry about. There's no conflict.

699
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:51,839
However,

700
00:57:53,446 --> 00:57:55,595
this is the first time in 10 years

701
00:57:55,596 --> 00:57:59,742
that I'm ashamed of not having any power.

702
00:58:01,545 --> 00:58:04,947
I know you tried to take care of me in many ways.

703
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:10,353
Thank you for everything.

704
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:27,024
   

705
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:31,440
I still had work to do.

706
00:58:32,963 --> 00:58:33,949
   

707
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:48,691
That was a nice rest.

708
00:59:05,776 --> 00:59:08,377
It's been a long time since I called.

709
00:59:10,514 --> 00:59:12,748
She refused?

710
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:18,973
Wait. Can I call you back after I look into this?

711
00:59:20,824 --> 00:59:25,512
What are you talking about? She turned down Human&amp;Money?

712
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:30,271
If she refused, that means she's going to resign from the company!

713
00:59:32,336 --> 00:59:35,071
Mr. Han, get me a box.

714
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,943
A box?

715
01:00:00,731 --> 01:00:01,864
Where's my box?

716
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:04,367
What are you doing right now?

717
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,068
What do you think? I'm packing my things.

718
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,971
But why are you packing your things?

719
01:00:08,971 --> 01:00:11,240
Because I have to keep my promise.

720
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,654
Why wouldn't you take the ad coming in? Why would you resign from the company?

721
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:19,015
Because I'm the best.

722
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:27,089
As you live, there are times when you shouldn't do something

723
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:29,959
because you're the best at it.

724
01:00:51,842 --> 01:00:55,104
   

725
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:03,410


726
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:20,670
♫  I wear that dress to cover this scar  ♫

727
01:01:20,676 --> 01:01:21,482
 I won't do it! 

728
01:01:21,483 --> 01:01:23,179
 It's the pride of an advertiser. 

729
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,247
 You have to survive first. 

730
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:26,849
 I'd like to see 

731
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:28,617
 how far Go Ah In will go. 

732
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,663
 No, Senior Director Go! Why would you resign? 

733
01:01:30,663 --> 01:01:32,054
 That old bastard! 

734
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,490
 Where do you get off telling me what to do? 

735
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:35,477
 I'll teach you. 

736
01:01:35,478 --> 01:01:39,062
 I'll show you how VC Group turned into a big conglomerate. 

737
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:41,564
 Why would I meet someone who left me because they disliked me? 

738
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:44,300
 The three of us have a common enemy. 

739
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:48,070
 This is what we have prepared. 

740
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:52,125
 Right when you think it's over, that's when you make a mistake. 

741
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,135
 Wait. 

742
01:01:54,135 --> 01:01:56,964
 They'll make a mistake.
