1
00:00:01,095 --> 00:00:04,070
You're going to test them?

2
00:00:06,158 --> 00:00:07,639
Yeah.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:11,010
In terms of skills, aren't they the best in the industry?

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,266
Not that.

5
00:00:13,266 --> 00:00:16,282
The test my grandfather suggested.

6
00:00:16,282 --> 00:00:18,650
What's that?

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:22,489
 Give them a project that you wouldn't be able to manage. 

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:24,049
 If they succeed, keep them on your side. 

9
00:00:24,049 --> 00:00:27,832
 If they can't, it's goodbye forever. 

10
00:00:27,832 --> 00:00:32,497
If I make them scratch my back, I'll find out who's on my side

11
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:34,805
and who will have to go.

12
00:00:36,105 --> 00:00:39,585
Are you thinking of joining hands with the winner?

13
00:00:39,586 --> 00:00:41,145
Of course.

14
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:44,844
Could I ever become a tycoon standing beside a loser?

15
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:48,014
I doubt she wants to meet us to give us encouragement.

16
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:50,063
Does she want a piece of the pie because it involves

17
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,952
the family's future in-laws?

18
00:00:54,032 --> 00:00:59,288
Well, even Kang Hanna has to show some results to the chairman.

19
00:00:59,288 --> 00:01:02,262
We're always the same.

20
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:06,545
The winning side is our side.

21
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:15,344
Rather than being nervous and not knowing anything, it'll be better to find out beforehand and handle things.

22
00:01:15,344 --> 00:01:20,012
- Sir. Go as fast as you can. 
 - Yes, ma'am.

23
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:26,234
   

24
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:28,526
   

25
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:35,110


26
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:42,332
Welcome. How was your meeting?

27
00:01:42,332 --> 00:01:45,338
I guess you didn't come with Mr. Choi.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,107
I thought he'd be more comfortable if we came separately.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,744
Oh, is that so?

30
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:55,448
Go ahead and tell me what you want to say.

31
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,250
I have a tight schedule.

32
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:01,120
I'll start once Mr. Choi gets here.

33
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:09,670
I also have something to discuss with you regarding the upcoming presentation.

34
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,497
Something to discuss? With me?

35
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,262
Oh, I'm so honored.

36
00:02:15,262 --> 00:02:19,356
There's a lot more riding on this presentation, isn't there?

37
00:02:19,356 --> 00:02:20,462
That's right.

38
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:25,724
If things go wrong, you'll be humiliated.

39
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:30,449
 I prepared so much to promote my first day at work. 

40
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,252
 I did an interview with all the reporters. 

41
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:37,289
 But someone said it was planned with the intention of humiliating me! 

42
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,083
Of course! It won't just be that.

43
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:52,214
Won't it be difficult for me to continue working here if things go wrong?

44
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,643
I hope you can help a lot.

45
00:03:06,842 --> 00:03:12,184
Now, I know you're all busy. I'll get to the point.

46
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:17,734
The project and creative teams will prepare for the Woowon Group presentation separately.

47
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,335
Each of you. Separately.

48
00:03:34,247 --> 00:03:36,826
Which team will we be working with for this presentation?

49
00:03:36,826 --> 00:03:39,365
Probably with Mr. Jeong's team.

50
00:03:39,365 --> 00:03:42,974
Yeah, since they are corporate PR specialists.

51
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:45,224
Have you prepared the market research data for Woowon Group's advertisers?

52
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,818
Yes, it's all finished.

53
00:03:46,818 --> 00:03:48,861
What about the keywords collected from the company's portal site?

54
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:49,740
They've been sent.

55
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,500
This reminds me of tenderloin, sirloin, and chuck flap tail!

56
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,269
Just thinking about it is reassuring.

57
00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:01,322
Right? But as the production team, we're the rump roast.

58
00:04:01,322 --> 00:04:03,809
I'm so excited!

59
00:04:03,809 --> 00:04:07,710
I only worked on trivial things at the last company I was with.

60
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,682
I wondered when I'd work on something big...

61
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:14,520
I finally get to work on a 30 billion won corporate PR presentation!

62
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,701
Did you transfer to this team to work on something big?

63
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:21,858
Of course. Hard work reflects the employee's portfolio!

64
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,730
- But why is it 30 billion won? 
 - Isn't it 30 billion?

65
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,355
It's 300 billion!

66
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:31,567
If we win this corporate PR ad then we get all of Woowon Group's advertisements.

67
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,673
300 billion?

68
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:36,512
The planning team needs to decide their direction quickly.

69
00:04:36,513 --> 00:04:39,078
That's the only way the production team can start.

70
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,016
Then, how about we hold a meeting with the planning team first?

71
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:46,555
We can't do that. No way. Never.

72
00:04:46,555 --> 00:04:49,588
Why not? Seo Jeong and I are best friends.

73
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,624
Woowon Group is a prospective in-law.

74
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:54,593
Shouldn't the company try its very best?

75
00:04:54,593 --> 00:04:57,363
That's why I'm saying we can't do this.

76
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,957
Advertisements need both planning and production.

77
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:00,840
Both parts must come to agreements in the process.

78
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:05,569
How could a plane fly if you take off one of its wings?

79
00:05:06,787 --> 00:05:10,943
A rocket can fly without wings.

80
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:18,317
 Mr. Park is so calm about this. 

81
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:22,988
 That means this isn't an accident, it was planned. 

82
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:27,090
It just doesn't make sense for two teams from one company to bid separately.

83
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,312
Has this been discussed with Woowon Group?

84
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:31,850
Yes, it has.

85
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,834
Wait. How could you not even discuss this with us?

86
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:39,046
We'll get two different directions if we split planning and production.

87
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:42,909
Then won't there be a higher chance of getting a better ad?

88
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:45,844
The more the merrier!

89
00:05:49,068 --> 00:05:51,117
Senior Director Kang?

90
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:53,353
Yes?

91
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,023
I'd like to take back what I said before.

92
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,682
What was that?

93
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:03,556
When I said not to assign work and cause trouble when you don't know anything at all.

94
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:12,788
I guess you know something after all. Even though you still cause trouble.

95
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,780
You don't have to part your hair with a comb. You can do it with a knife, too.

96
00:06:25,122 --> 00:06:29,221
If this is the trouble you want, I welcome it.

97
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,300
   

98
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,957
Senior Director Go, you should stop a child from running rampant.

99
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,208
How could you join her?

100
00:06:49,208 --> 00:06:53,412
How can we stop a daughter of a CEO in our nation?

101
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:08,294
Can you handle it?

102
00:07:08,294 --> 00:07:11,690
Is it possible to do without the project team?

103
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,566
Are you scared?

104
00:07:14,662 --> 00:07:19,037
The CEO position is yours as long as you maintain the status quo.

105
00:07:19,037 --> 00:07:22,575
Are you scared that you'll lose it now that you're competing against me?

106
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:30,760
If another agency happens to take this deal, you and I are both on the chopping block.

107
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,717
So?

108
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:37,190
Senior Director Go, we need to think of a plan to survive together.

109
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,483
Why do you want to die together?

110
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,196
Survive together?

111
00:07:44,196 --> 00:07:46,666
When did you start thinking that way?

112
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:50,803
I leave the company and you become the CEO.

113
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,472
Isn't that all you were thinking about before?

114
00:07:55,718 --> 00:08:01,978
If I fail to increase company sales by 50%, I would've been really sad to leave alone.

115
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:06,045
This is great. It looks like I got a buddy on my way to hell.

116
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,802
I made just one mistake in my career of 25 years.

117
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:26,372
I think it was you, Go Ah In.

118
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,176
Promoting you and making you an executive.

119
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:34,211
Just one mistake? I've seen a couple.

120
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:41,920
I should clean up the mess I made, right?

121
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:46,592
Going up! All alone.

122
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:01,277
Get everyone to the meeting room. Right now!

123
00:09:08,808 --> 00:09:10,483
Are you confident?

124
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:13,401
You're doing this during such a critical moment.

125
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,527
I'm sure there's a reason.

126
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:18,310
Everyone is saying not to get into corporate PR right now.

127
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,354
Is there a reason you're being so adamant about this?

128
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:26,198
Ma'am, under these particular conditions, don't we need a particular prescription?

129
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:29,267
You think that's what this is? It's an unusual prescription!

130
00:09:29,267 --> 00:09:31,433
You should do what's possible!

131
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:35,190
I'll manage it and make sure there are no problems.

132
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,145
You know the saying, "A cornered stone meets the mason's chisel."

133
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,346
Get it specially done.

134
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,690
   

135
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:59,332
What was Woowon Group thinking when they did this?

136
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,824
They should be laying low. Why are they making such a scene?

137
00:10:02,824 --> 00:10:06,905
Shall we call someone at Woowon and tell them to stop this?

138
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:10,974
Seo Jeong is against this as well. Shall we do as Han Soo says?

139
00:10:10,974 --> 00:10:13,913
This isn't something that an advertising company can do.

140
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,227
I mean, they're not just selling a mere object.

141
00:10:16,227 --> 00:10:20,852
It will be difficult, but if it works, it could be the best solution.

142
00:10:20,852 --> 00:10:22,481
What solution?

143
00:10:22,527 --> 00:10:25,190
They're trying to create public opinion.

144
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,260
They want to open the waterways?

145
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:30,596
The law will grant him bail.

146
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:34,438
Once the public opinion is made, it'll be possible.

147
00:10:34,438 --> 00:10:37,337
Issues with the law should be handled by legal professionals. Ads can't help...

148
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:39,589
- Han Soo. 
 - Yes?

149
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,943
How many ways do you think there are to get from Busan to Seoul?

150
00:10:44,943 --> 00:10:49,018
You only thought about the expressway. Did you not think of anything else?

151
00:10:49,018 --> 00:10:51,597
A business is about paving ways that don't exist.

152
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:55,153
Why do you only go down paths that other people follow?

153
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:59,088
Han Soo, let's not rely on it too much.

154
00:10:59,088 --> 00:11:01,727
Just think of it as one possible solution.

155
00:11:02,831 --> 00:11:04,730
Okay.

156
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:06,996
What's she doing?

157
00:11:06,996 --> 00:11:08,496
Who are you speaking of?

158
00:11:08,496 --> 00:11:10,230
That female servant.

159
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,972
The one who told Hanna to ask about things at work.

160
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:21,307
 The chairman is very interested in this presentation. 

161
00:11:21,307 --> 00:11:25,692
 Okay. But I don't know what the results will be like. 

162
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,181
 What do you mean? 

163
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,353
 Senior Director Kang split up the project and creative teams. 

164
00:11:29,353 --> 00:11:31,990
 She wants us to work separately. 

165
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:35,001
  Director Kang? 

166
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:38,126
 Well, you both are very skilled. 

167
00:11:38,126 --> 00:11:39,581
 This is an important project. 

168
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:41,601
 know. 

169
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:44,002
 We'll be observing with great interest. 

170
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,939
 Thank you. 

171
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:54,017
 Shall I try meeting her? 

172
00:11:54,017 --> 00:11:55,728
What will you do if you meet her?

173
00:11:55,728 --> 00:12:00,375
I could actively offer my support, or I could promise her the new seat as CEO.

174
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:05,457
What would you do if I said I'd make you the next CEO?

175
00:12:07,962 --> 00:12:10,682
Would you be able to focus on work?

176
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:14,282
Humans aren't that type of beast.

177
00:12:14,282 --> 00:12:17,570
They get excited when promised something and they make mistakes.

178
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,370
They do.

179
00:12:22,946 --> 00:12:24,776
- Mr. Kim? 
 - Yes, sir.

180
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:25,812
You call her.

181
00:12:25,812 --> 00:12:27,095
What shall I say?

182
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:31,049
Just tell her that we'll be watching over her with great interest.

183
00:12:32,353 --> 00:12:33,518
Would that be enough?

184
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:38,293
They'll be rewarded if they do well, and they'll know they'll have to resign if they fail.

185
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:40,749
They're smart.

186
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,272
- That's all you need to say. 
 - Yes, sir.

187
00:12:43,272 --> 00:12:46,374
Hanna can take care of the rest.

188
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,200
Hanna?

189
00:13:01,093 --> 00:13:02,648
What's happening?

190
00:13:03,358 --> 00:13:07,522
Did he talk it over with Hanna beforehand?

191
00:13:07,522 --> 00:13:11,623
What problems will his mini-me cause this time?

192
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:18,463
You only think of the bare minimum.

193
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,066
What are you talking about?

194
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,668
The maximum is scoring points if things go well.

195
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:25,371
Do you think things can go well if we put those two together?

196
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:26,374
They'll split.

197
00:13:26,421 --> 00:13:30,198
On the other hand, we put them up against one another and they'll work with passion.

198
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:32,163
This has a better chance of success.

199
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:36,048
And the loser gets kicked out?

200
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,726
What if another agency wins?

201
00:13:42,726 --> 00:13:45,824
Your career is on the line, too.

202
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,659
It'll put a small scratch on my career.

203
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,521
But it'll be a chance for me to stick it to Han Soo and Seo Jeong, too.

204
00:13:51,522 --> 00:13:53,439
So it's not all bad!

205
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:56,968
Whether I win or lose, I gain something.

206
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:59,706
So let's just sit back, relax, and watch.

207
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,006
And after that...

208
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,046
Yes?

209
00:14:03,046 --> 00:14:08,413
I'll show them what happens if you mess with me.

210
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:10,582
Who?

211
00:14:11,326 --> 00:14:13,090
Anyone.

212
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,720
   

213
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:16,689
 Yes, sir? 

214
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:20,656
Ask the marketing team leader to find out who's in charge of the Woowon project.

215
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:24,520
 - Which part?  
 - All of it. Everything.

216
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,750
   

217
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:34,540
It seems like Grandfather and Hanna are up to something.

218
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,078
Come in.

219
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:54,427
I figured you'd be worried, so I came.

220
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:55,481
Worried about what?

221
00:14:55,482 --> 00:14:59,715
It's clear that Senior Director Hanna will get attention if she pulls this off.

222
00:14:59,715 --> 00:15:01,433
You can't stand to see that.

223
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,810
And you can't bring yourself to screw this up

224
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:08,108
because that'll affect your chance of becoming the next vice-chairman.

225
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,856
- So? 
 - You have to give and take.

226
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:11,877
What if I don't want to?

227
00:15:11,878 --> 00:15:14,246
You know what will happen if the chairman of Woowon doesn't come out.

228
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,946
Right?

229
00:15:16,786 --> 00:15:20,973
If you get involved in this, how will Hanna react?

230
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:26,346
The Hanna that I know, she'll try to ruin things.

231
00:15:26,346 --> 00:15:29,838
Are you telling me to walk on eggshells around Hanna as I work?

232
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:54,068
Yes, Father.

233
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:56,288
Do as he says.

234
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:58,450
Still...

235
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:01,495
The chairman needs to come out for you to become vice-chairman.

236
00:16:01,495 --> 00:16:03,226
Don't you know that?

237
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,565
I understand.

238
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,876
   

239
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,380
It's not like we're sure it's even possible.

240
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:21,513
It's just one solution.

241
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:24,851
That's true. What can an ad do?

242
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,218
I should get going.

243
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,865
But... who is it?

244
00:16:29,865 --> 00:16:31,723
Who was the executive that spoke harshly to Hanna?

245
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,459
Oh, her. She's very unique.

246
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:37,466
Tell her I'd like to sit down for a meal.

247
00:16:37,466 --> 00:16:39,880
The enemy of my enemy is my friend?

248
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,435
I mean, it's my duty as the vice-president of headquarters.

249
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:47,305
How about you see her if she wins this presentation?

250
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:53,599
Oh, isn't it time for you to help me with my work?

251
00:16:53,599 --> 00:16:56,481
Can't you see that I'm helping you now?

252
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,910
   

253
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,226
He wants to feel things out first?

254
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:13,298
We'll see what happens after I become the vice-chairman.

255
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,020
     

256
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,280
   

257
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:38,758
Why are we doing this? Why?

258
00:17:44,818 --> 00:17:49,591
I am so sorry. I was feeling stifled...

259
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:56,308
People these days can mix peanut butter and pizza together.

260
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,512
How can they ask planning and production to work separately?

261
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:00,780
- This is... 
 - Whoa... Stop.

262
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,950
Eun Jeong, calm down.

263
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,220
   

264
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:16,035
Here's one for you, too.

265
00:18:23,722 --> 00:18:25,191
Is this good?

266
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,402
Excuse me?

267
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:28,174
Well...

268
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:32,495
It's the only meat we can eat while we have meetings.

269
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:39,131
That's right.

270
00:18:39,131 --> 00:18:43,788
The best choice depends on the situation.

271
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,625
Take a look.

272
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:51,397
These are all directions to make good corporate PR.

273
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:54,239
But is that the goal?

274
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:58,169
Are those the values that Woowon Group wants right now?

275
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,140
Aren't those our usual practices?

276
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:08,869
Routine messages that say this is what corporate PR is.

277
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,023
We need to give the advertiser what they want.

278
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:21,393
Isn't that what makes us an agency?

279
00:19:22,616 --> 00:19:28,433
Do you think this is what Woowon Group wants right now?

280
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:32,247
   

281
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:37,230
"Woowon Group will create the nation we want."

282
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,144
It's good.

283
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,144
It sounds good, too.

284
00:19:44,144 --> 00:19:46,175
It's the direction we discussed internally and decided to go with.

285
00:19:46,175 --> 00:19:47,292
It's nice.

286
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:51,261
The copy is relevant and very straightforward.

287
00:19:51,261 --> 00:19:55,894
Like the past corporate PR work that we've done, it's humanistic.

288
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,198
Also, this is much bigger...

289
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,363
No, not the direction.

290
00:20:02,363 --> 00:20:04,113
The wording.

291
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,964
 That's the purpose of this presentation. 

292
00:20:14,152 --> 00:20:16,424
 You want us to achieve this with an ad? 

293
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,483
 That would be the best solution. 

294
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,085
 Did you tell Go Ah In about this? 

295
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,020
 Of course not! 

296
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,925
 Form the public opinion. 

297
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:29,294
 Oh, and the grand chairman is asking for Senior Director Go. 

298
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:30,471
 The grand chairman? 

299
00:20:30,472 --> 00:20:33,999
 Chang Soo, if you lose this presentation... 

300
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,811
your CEO position will be at risk.

301
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:45,391
"What we want."

302
00:20:45,391 --> 00:20:46,935
That's good.

303
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:52,449
But "we" shouldn't be the consumers, it should be Woowon.

304
00:20:52,449 --> 00:20:54,686
Are you saying we should do this in the maker's voice?

305
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,489
Yes, the owner's voice to be more exact.

306
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,883
What do you mean?

307
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:01,192
The wording is great.

308
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,310
   

309
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:06,765
That's the goal of this presentation.

310
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,591
This is what Chairman Kim Woo Won...

311
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,442
wants.

312
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:15,574
The chairman of Woowon wants bail.

313
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,475
What?

314
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,981
Are you joking?

315
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,450
Eun Jeong, why did you come up with this?

316
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,628
Because it's for corporate PR.

317
00:21:28,628 --> 00:21:32,358
I thought it should be hopeful and humanistic...

318
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,193
No, not the superficial reason. The real reason.

319
00:21:36,792 --> 00:21:39,030
It's okay. Go on.

320
00:21:40,503 --> 00:21:43,066
Because there's a negative issue.

321
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:47,137
They need to increase the budget for ads that attract friendly media coverage.

322
00:21:47,137 --> 00:21:49,860
That's why they're choosing a corporate PR ad.

323
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,709
And what's the biggest contradiction in what you just said?

324
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:54,946
If that were the case, they would just increase the number existing ads.

325
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,383
Why would they start a new corporate PR campaign with all the risks?

326
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:00,485
- Media criticism won't change... 
 - That's right.

327
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:08,993
Now, aren't you all running away?

328
00:22:08,993 --> 00:22:13,231
You know what the advertiser wants, but you don't know how to do it.

329
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,772
- For starters... 
 - Yes?

330
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,673
Let's think from this point of view.

331
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,644
Try to make personal interest look like public interest.

332
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:27,338
A way to generate a public opinion.

333
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,860
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

334
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,480
Okay.

335
00:22:31,482 --> 00:22:33,152
But, Senior Director?

336
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:36,891
Can an ad achieve that?

337
00:22:36,891 --> 00:22:40,291
Can an ad prevent global warming?

338
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:42,761
Can an ad solve the refugee problem?

339
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,463
Then, why do it?

340
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:48,733
All we need to do is plant awareness and create public opinion.

341
00:22:50,277 --> 00:22:52,470
That's our territory.

342
00:22:53,191 --> 00:22:55,640
Starting tomorrow, we'll have a meeting every hour.

343
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,405
Yes, ma'am...

344
00:22:58,699 --> 00:23:00,712
Wait!

345
00:23:01,362 --> 00:23:04,047
Give us a tip before you go.

346
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:06,254
We're at a loss.

347
00:23:09,363 --> 00:23:10,522
Become a shaman.

348
00:23:10,523 --> 00:23:13,045
Someone who can read the advertiser's mind.

349
00:23:14,081 --> 00:23:16,628
How do we read their minds?

350
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:20,298
I don't know. Shake a bell or something.

351
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:43,121
I completely, seriously, really...

352
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,605
have no idea.

353
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:47,150
Me either.

354
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:52,497
I've never been at such a loss with a presentation before.

355
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:55,999
- What about you, Jang Woo? 
 - I never know anything.

356
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,354
Write your copies quickly. I'll polish the final result and it'll be incredible!

357
00:24:00,354 --> 00:24:03,883
Jang Woo is so carefree, right?

358
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:06,077
You'll live such a long life.

359
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:09,213
Do you think the project team is doing well?

360
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,749
Of course.

361
00:24:13,222 --> 00:24:14,419
Hello.

362
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,187
I bet this is tough.

363
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,199
You have to plan without a project team.

364
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,430
You feel lost, don't you?

365
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,756
Oh, I mean...

366
00:24:20,756 --> 00:24:25,040
- We just came to a decision on the concept, slogan, and key copy. 
 - Already?

367
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,466
We have planning and production all together.

368
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,501
Come on, duh?

369
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:34,605
Mr. Kwon, do you have the concept?

370
00:24:37,902 --> 00:24:39,677
Work hard.

371
00:24:58,706 --> 00:25:00,586
To what do I owe the pleasure?

372
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,620
You're out front?

373
00:25:13,339 --> 00:25:15,180
How many cups of coffee have you had today?

374
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,915
Does anyone count?

375
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:20,985
What about water? Do you ever drink it?

376
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,987
Do you want some water?

377
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,456
Did you come here to get me to drink some water?

378
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:33,798
I'm leaving if you have nothing to say.

379
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,441
It wouldn't be good for anyone to see us together like this while we compete.

380
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:38,160
So what?

381
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,139
We compete all the time on presentations.

382
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,775
The size of this one is unmatched.

383
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:45,310
That's right.

384
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:50,348
I'll come out and say it.

385
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,005
When have you not?

386
00:25:53,972 --> 00:25:57,488
What's the goal of this presentation?

387
00:25:57,488 --> 00:26:00,742
Are you insane? That's the same as telling you everything.

388
00:26:02,251 --> 00:26:04,829
Okay! I'm done!

389
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:07,599
That means you know why you're doing this.

390
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,234
That's enough for me.

391
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:13,816
I thought the advertiser was just being foolish.

392
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:17,742
Since the reason is a clear corporate PR ad.

393
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:26,584
Did you want to see a competing executive just to say that?

394
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:29,954
Let's go. Didn't you say you were busy?

395
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,788
I'll pay for the coffee.

396
00:26:48,713 --> 00:26:51,275
The old days were much better.

397
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:57,048
It was nice to smoke right after lighting it, right?

398
00:26:59,174 --> 00:27:01,386
Can you lose this on purpose?

399
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:09,494
If we win this presentation, all 30 company employees

400
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:12,130
will be able to survive off that.

401
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,259
In the past, independent agencies like oursused to be able to make a living.

402
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,473
But these days if you're not affiliated with a big conglomerate,

403
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:26,844
then it's pretty much mission impossible in our nation's advertising industry.

404
00:27:26,844 --> 00:27:29,714
- Senior. 
 - Forget it!

405
00:27:29,714 --> 00:27:31,449
Forget I said anything.

406
00:27:31,455 --> 00:27:34,385
How can I do that when I already heard it?

407
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:42,493
I started my own company to stop being a servant.

408
00:27:43,929 --> 00:27:46,864
But now I'm a slave to financial debt.

409
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:49,601
Did you take out a private loan?

410
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,669
What do you take me for?

411
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:56,607
Wait, I'm confused since I took out so many.

412
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:58,119
Are you messing with me right now?

413
00:27:58,119 --> 00:27:59,603
Hey!

414
00:28:01,877 --> 00:28:04,182
Never leave your company.

415
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,386
Your skills, capabilities, and industry reputation?

416
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:09,221
Don't put your faith in that.

417
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:12,190
Stay and serve until they kick you out.

418
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,992
You know what it's like in the Korean advertisement industry.

419
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:20,531
It's not a place you can figure out with your skills alone.

420
00:28:21,847 --> 00:28:23,935
Are things that bad at your company?

421
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:26,436
Maybe it'll go belly up.

422
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,180
Besides that, I must be getting old.

423
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,242
I'm going on about nonsense.

424
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,711
This is so embarrassing.

425
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,517
Thanks for coming out. See you later.

426
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:54,532
Are you driving?

427
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,000
No, go ahead.

428
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:59,370
Well, we just ran into Kwon Woo Cheol.

429
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,607
It seems they already decided on their copy.

430
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,075
Okay.

431
00:29:09,075 --> 00:29:11,463
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
  - Okay. 

432
00:29:20,314 --> 00:29:22,493
I've got bigger fish to fry.

433
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:27,632
If things go wrong, VC Group will hold a new record.

434
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,702
The shortest term for an executive.

435
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:41,338
What are you doing? Pour me a glass.

436
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,114
Who are you to ask me to pour you a glass?

437
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:50,822
Can't Party B ask Party A to pour her a drink?

438
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,758
Not to mention, I'm going to be your sister-in-law soon.

439
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,127
You two fight relentlessly.

440
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,429
Relations between Korea and Japan are even good sometimes, too.

441
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,865
Let's try to get along every once in a while, please?

442
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:04,035
Said the descendant of a pro-Japanese group.

443
00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:07,171
Hey! Where do you get off?

444
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,174
Your grandfather donated planes to the Government-General of Joseon.

445
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:13,410
That's how his business became a conglomerate!

446
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,781
- Then what about your grandfather? 
 - Kang Hanna!

447
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,283
You're always widening your range when you're at a disadvantage.

448
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,785
Just pour her a glass.

449
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:34,599
True, I guess I could pour the advertiser a drink.

450
00:31:00,624 --> 00:31:01,727
Why are you laughing?

451
00:31:01,727 --> 00:31:05,523
That's how you pour alcohol during a memorial service.

452
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:06,695
Why you...

453
00:31:06,695 --> 00:31:08,334
Drink up.

454
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:11,372
I poured it with respect towards my late ancestors.

455
00:31:11,372 --> 00:31:14,061
I swear... Hey!

456
00:31:14,061 --> 00:31:15,661
What?!

457
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,817
I should endure it since I'm Party A.

458
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,552
Sure, Senior Director Kang.

459
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,256
Make sure you're just as creative in preparing the presentation.

460
00:31:32,777 --> 00:31:35,166
Of course. We are the best in the industry.

461
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:37,756
You're the best but the CPO and CCO are enemies.

462
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,730
Is that why you asked them to work separately?

463
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,208
It's a service. Buy one, get one free.

464
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:44,804
- Can you win this presentation if they work separately? 
 - Of course.

465
00:31:44,804 --> 00:31:48,230
- Do you want to bet? 
 - Yeah, sure! What do you want to bet on?

466
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,340
The loser will grant a wish. Any wish.

467
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,877
What do you think?

468
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:58,949
You don't have to if you're not confident in winning.

469
00:32:00,467 --> 00:32:03,421
One wish. Any wish.

470
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:16,484
She never thinks over her profits and losses.

471
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:19,047
She just does it.

472
00:32:21,259 --> 00:32:23,079
Don't you dare change your mind later!

473
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:26,378
Hey, I'm sorry to call so late.

474
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:29,447
I need some information from Woowon Group.

475
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:33,651
From someone close to them.

476
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:38,430
   

477
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,864
Work should get easier if you have more experience under your belt.

478
00:32:49,864 --> 00:32:52,822
Why does the ad industry get harder?

479
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:55,790
It's hard to deliver the message if it's too vague.

480
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,042
If it's too clear, then it could bring on public backlash.

481
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,999
Public opinion.

482
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:04,038
The moment the public finds out that this is a campaign for Chairman Woo Won

483
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:06,256
there will opposition.

484
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,988
This isn't something you can do, Ah In.

485
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:14,240
What are you talking about? I'm the best in the industry.

486
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,161
Oh, sure. Of course.

487
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,718
But something like this?

488
00:33:17,718 --> 00:33:21,765
Copywriters who are whimsy and unexpected are good for something like this.

489
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:24,668
- Think outside the box? 
 - That's right.

490
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:28,655
It's almost like a cow catching a mouse as it steps backwards.

491
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:32,677
Anyway, you need to think of something unexpected.

492
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,380
That's not something that's possible for logical people like us.

493
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,951
Then what shall I do?

494
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,457
This is what I can give you.

495
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:48,528
It's all I got.

496
00:33:51,088 --> 00:33:52,031
What is it?

497
00:33:52,031 --> 00:33:55,630
A list of freelance copywriters who are good at coming up with whimsical ideas.

498
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,779
Call them!

499
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,775
You're going to need a lot of cows walking backwards, if you want to catch something.

500
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,360
Someone whimsical.

501
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,010
We have one on our team.

502
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,008
This is a 300 billion won project.

503
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,078
I can sleep when I'm dead.

504
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:51,388
How do I read the mind of the advertiser?

505
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:59,023
   

506
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,771
 Become a shaman. 

507
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,373
 Someone who can read the advertiser's mind. 

508
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,311
 Shake a bell or something. 

509
00:35:17,851 --> 00:35:19,682
   

510
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,259
   

511
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:28,026
Am I crazy? Have I lost it?

512
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:32,329
I should just die! Just die!

513
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:49,713
I need to show them something killer.

514
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:06,110
What are you doing? Don't just stare at her. Wake her up.

515
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,433
She should eat breakfast before going to work.

516
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:12,561
Mom!

517
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:14,472
Yeah?

518
00:36:16,535 --> 00:36:18,843
You should sleep in a bed.

519
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:24,010
I just fell asleep.

520
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,182
Mom.

521
00:36:27,182 --> 00:36:28,582
Yeah?

522
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,400
What's that?

523
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,622
   

524
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:37,528
Did you stay up all night doing this?

525
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:43,367
If this is what you do at work, I can do it for you.

526
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,460
   

527
00:36:55,535 --> 00:36:59,596
I mean, do you think copies are just written out of nowhere?

528
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:03,421
Creativity comes from doing something else like this.

529
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:09,226
Forget it!

530
00:37:21,974 --> 00:37:23,682
- Good morning, Dad! 
 - Hey.

531
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:26,785
Can you get me a salad?

532
00:37:26,785 --> 00:37:29,150
How is your Woowon project?

533
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:32,282
Why is the chairman worried about such trivial matters?

534
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:34,419
You call this trivial? In this situation?

535
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,952
Don't worry. I'm going to do well and win.

536
00:37:36,952 --> 00:37:39,180
No matter what!

537
00:37:40,937 --> 00:37:42,732
- What's with you now? 
 - What?

538
00:37:42,733 --> 00:37:46,003
Why would you do well? Let your employees do it!

539
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:48,599
Your brother's concerned about it, too.

540
00:37:49,374 --> 00:37:53,237
Why would Han Soo be involved in the agency?

541
00:37:58,023 --> 00:38:00,904
Who said he was involved? I said he was concerned.

542
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,637
Tell him not to be before I ruin everything on purpose!

543
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:07,622
I want you to just watch, too.

544
00:38:07,622 --> 00:38:10,512
No! I'm going to do a good job!

545
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:12,356
Why would the referee jump into the game?

546
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:15,980
Why am I the referee? I'm a player.

547
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,599
I'm fighting for the championship.

548
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,241
You're not a player.

549
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:20,964
Be the referee and then get married.

550
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,034
Don't cause a fuss for the family.

551
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:24,507
Why can't I be a player?!

552
00:38:24,508 --> 00:38:27,807
Brother can, but I can't? Why not?

553
00:38:28,659 --> 00:38:30,641
- Hanna... 
  - What?

554
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,938
Do you think being a chairman is that great?

555
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:38,235
I don't want you to get battered up as a player, but just be happy...

556
00:38:38,235 --> 00:38:40,151
No! I'd rather die!

557
00:38:40,152 --> 00:38:42,153
Whether I win or lose, I'm going to see this to the end.

558
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,910
Hey! I'm saying this for your sake—

559
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,090
I can't hear you! Blah, blah, blah!

560
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:48,659
I can't hear you at all!

561
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,066
Mr. Park?

562
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,330
Yes!

563
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,360
Let's go. My ears are bleeding.

564
00:39:01,182 --> 00:39:02,867
You do whatever you want.

565
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,362
I'll do whatever I want!

566
00:39:04,362 --> 00:39:05,522
Hey.

567
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:09,553
I was only thinking of you. Why are you getting angry?

568
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:13,018
- Dad, just remember one thing. 
 - What?

569
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:15,085
Your daughter's the best when you get old.

570
00:39:15,085 --> 00:39:17,274
You're going to regret it if you keep going at this rate.

571
00:39:17,275 --> 00:39:19,020
Regret what?

572
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:24,708
Do you think Han Soo will look after you when you're all weak and old?

573
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:27,554
If you're mean to me like this, then later...

574
00:39:27,554 --> 00:39:30,567
- Later what? 
 - Later!

575
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,007
You're going to die alone as a rich old man!

576
00:39:37,745 --> 00:39:41,088
Hey! How could you curse your father like that?

577
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:52,786
If Hanna gets involved she could ruin the plan.

578
00:40:17,644 --> 00:40:19,860
- I don't want it. 
 - Eat it.

579
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,910
Do you think I could stomach that right now?

580
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:27,041
Of course, just chew and swallow.

581
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,926
Mr. Park!

582
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:31,952
My trainer told me something during a workout.

583
00:40:31,952 --> 00:40:34,776
Third-rate players only think about the offense when they attack,

584
00:40:34,776 --> 00:40:37,008
and they only think about defense when they're defending.

585
00:40:37,008 --> 00:40:40,189
But top players think about defense when they attack,

586
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:43,974
and they think about attacking when they're defending.

587
00:40:45,877 --> 00:40:49,731
- So? 
 - Should you only be thinking about defense if you want to come in first?

588
00:40:49,731 --> 00:40:53,776
Now that you've put up your defense, you need to think about your attack.

589
00:41:02,499 --> 00:41:04,795
Eat this and cheer up.

590
00:41:20,573 --> 00:41:22,746
We'll get going.

591
00:41:30,188 --> 00:41:33,061
Kang Han Soo and Kim Seo Jeong.

592
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:35,310
They keep trying to make their way in.

593
00:41:35,311 --> 00:41:38,396
I can't just watch from the sideline, can I?

594
00:41:38,396 --> 00:41:40,530
You're right.

595
00:41:41,394 --> 00:41:43,733
What will you do?

596
00:41:43,733 --> 00:41:47,798
I should make a winner instead of waiting for one.

597
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:49,207
You'll make one?

598
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:53,243
I need to show them that I'm in control and that I can shake things up.

599
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,449
Shall we buy off Executive Director Hwang from Woowon?

600
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:02,753
Yeah, bad idea, right?

601
00:42:03,637 --> 00:42:06,957
Hmm... I'm sure there's a way.

602
00:42:08,269 --> 00:42:09,641
   

603
00:42:11,316 --> 00:42:15,532
I think there might just be a way.

604
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,968
If you had to pick one between

605
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:20,442
Senior Director Choi and Senior Director Go,

606
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:23,573
who would you pick?

607
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,000
   

608
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,586
I'm sure they worked late last night.

609
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:39,290
Look at all the battle food. They're risking their lives.

610
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:41,725
The planning team is chaotic, too.

611
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:45,295
- What's wrong? 
 - Five minutes until the meeting!

612
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,796
Already?!

613
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:49,866
Print it. She wants to see the keywords.

614
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,020
   

615
00:42:59,558 --> 00:43:00,540
It's all done.

616
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,830
I've got it.

617
00:43:01,835 --> 00:43:04,147
Hurry up!

618
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,722
Didn't I say the meeting would be at 10:00 a.m.?

619
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:15,759
How many times do I have to tell you? 10:05 a.m. isn't 10:00 a.m.!

620
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,219
We're sorry.

621
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:19,530
Hurry up.

622
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:21,898
We're sorry.

623
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,573
Let's do this.

624
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:31,660
   

625
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,280
♫  In time, I was like a lost child  ♫

626
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:47,300
♫  I don't want to wake up from a blue dream that resembles you  ♫

627
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,390
♫  How the day passes by  ♫

628
00:43:53,397 --> 00:43:55,030
Again in an hour.

629
00:43:55,030 --> 00:44:01,120
♫  When morning comes, I'll find you again  ♫

630
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:08,450
♫  A dull day, I just stay in a daze, I want to fall asleep again  ♫

631
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,090
♫  Turn it off. Will you turn off the alarm? 
 I'm going back  ♫

632
00:44:13,096 --> 00:44:15,190
Again in an hour.

633
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:20,660
♫  To my love and one and all  ♫

634
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,060
♫  A dazzling morning  ♫

635
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:28,660
♫  I want to meet you in a dream  ♫

636
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:34,300
♫  You're my everlasting dream  ♫

637
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,169
♫  Don't wake me up  ♫

638
00:44:37,169 --> 00:44:39,910
Again in an hour.

639
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:42,813
Um, Ma'am...

640
00:44:44,279 --> 00:44:46,417
What about lunch?

641
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,019
Can you think about eating at a time like this?

642
00:45:07,437 --> 00:45:10,930
Yeah. Of course. I could eat! A lot too!

643
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:12,342
Yeah, me too.

644
00:45:12,343 --> 00:45:14,211
Me too.

645
00:45:15,261 --> 00:45:16,513
Let's go eat.

646
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:19,616
How could she make us feel so bad for wanting to eat?

647
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,085
350,000 won.

648
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:23,954
As the youngest, I'll give you a tip since I manage the team expenses.

649
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:27,157
That's the maximum amount we can spend on today's lunch.

650
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:28,291
With what money?

651
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:31,361
We're a TF team, so that's how much we got for our budget.

652
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:34,352
Then how about some Korean beef?

653
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:42,672
How about some beef tartare while we wait for the beef to cook?

654
00:45:47,326 --> 00:45:50,080
True, we'll be the ones missing out if we don't eat. Right?

655
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,449
- Of course. 
 - Absolutely.

656
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:56,419
Let's go! Let's eat our feelings away with beef!

657
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:57,721
Let's go!

658
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,910
Let's do it!

659
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,620
Let's eat!

660
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,968
Don't get annoyed.

661
00:46:12,637 --> 00:46:16,272
Those who are unskilled get annoyed with their team members.

662
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,209
My prescription ran out.

663
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:54,177
So?

664
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:57,848
What do you mean? I came for a new prescription.

665
00:47:00,183 --> 00:47:02,687
I'll write you a referral, so find a new doctor.

666
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,326
   

667
00:47:04,326 --> 00:47:07,358
What kind of doctor doesn't write a prescription for a patient?

668
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:09,693
It's been ten years already...

669
00:47:11,214 --> 00:47:13,897
Wow, I can't believe I'm saying this to you again.

670
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:17,301
This is a psychiatric hospital, and I'm a consultant.

671
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:20,633
Prescriptions are given as a means for treatment through counseling.

672
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:22,740
They're only used for emergency symptoms.

673
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,343
They shouldn't be taken several times a day and with alcohol like you do.

674
00:47:27,343 --> 00:47:29,112
Just this once.

675
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:31,714
I've heard that before, too.

676
00:47:36,013 --> 00:47:37,944
I have a presentation in a week.

677
00:47:37,944 --> 00:47:40,157
It's the most important presentation of my life.

678
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,631
It decides whether I'll survive the company or not.

679
00:47:42,632 --> 00:47:47,164
Yeah, go and say that to a different hospital.

680
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,099
Just until then.

681
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:52,068
I'll listen to you after that.

682
00:47:59,116 --> 00:48:01,111
I'm falling for it again.

683
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:05,649
Fine, I'll fall for it. However, you can't take alcohol with it!

684
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:09,352
Answer me!

685
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,723
Okay.

686
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,335
Why did you buy four drinks?

687
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,737
This is yours.

688
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:28,792
This is mine.

689
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:30,892
What about the rest?

690
00:48:30,892 --> 00:48:33,476
They're for Senior Director Choi and Senior Director Go.

691
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:37,314
Take this coffee and ask them to talk.

692
00:48:38,056 --> 00:48:40,117
Decide after I see them?

693
00:48:40,117 --> 00:48:45,254
Check to see who's ringing the alarm.

694
00:48:45,254 --> 00:48:47,057
Okay.

695
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:49,693
Yes?

696
00:48:51,672 --> 00:48:53,963
Do you have a second?

697
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:59,110
Yes.

698
00:48:59,110 --> 00:49:01,088
It's fine.

699
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:05,175
Thank you so much. Please, sit over here.

700
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,977
Thanks.

701
00:49:14,183 --> 00:49:15,845
How are the preparations for the presentation going?

702
00:49:15,846 --> 00:49:21,191
We've decided on the concept and a key copy already.

703
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,392
Already?

704
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:26,896
Shouldn't your future in-law be released?

705
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:31,326
What are you saying?

706
00:49:31,326 --> 00:49:34,692
I heard about this presentation's goal.

707
00:49:34,692 --> 00:49:37,129
I hear the chairman and the vice-president

708
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,519
are very interested in this presentation.

709
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,116
Oh, the vice-president?

710
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:51,121
Why do you think the project team is in charge of planning?

711
00:49:51,121 --> 00:49:53,657
Planning is the key to advertisements.

712
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,459
That includes obtaining information, too.

713
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:58,454
That's good.

714
00:49:58,455 --> 00:50:00,364
Then I guess you're not lacking anything.

715
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:03,400
Nothing. We're planning everything perfectly.

716
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,902
I see.

717
00:50:04,902 --> 00:50:08,304
I'll show you good results.

718
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:18,350
   

719
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,000
   

720
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,743
Are you busy?

721
00:50:49,585 --> 00:50:50,713
What brings you here?

722
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,516
I was just curious as to how it was going.

723
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:56,953
Are you lacking anything?

724
00:50:58,524 --> 00:51:00,456
I am.

725
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:01,895
What is it?

726
00:51:01,896 --> 00:51:04,169
Why don't you tell me?

727
00:51:05,388 --> 00:51:07,163
Time.

728
00:51:08,223 --> 00:51:12,669
If you have nothing to say, can you leave and not waste my time?

729
00:51:14,384 --> 00:51:18,074
You have such a nasty temper.

730
00:51:19,942 --> 00:51:24,546
I take that back. You have a horrible personality.

731
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:27,050
I bet you don't have any friends.

732
00:51:43,915 --> 00:51:45,102
Yeah, so? Did you look into it?

733
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:48,605
Well, I don't really understand it.

734
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,708
I organized everything I heard and sent it to your email.

735
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:54,911
Yeah, okay. Great job. I'm hanging up now.

736
00:52:01,002 --> 00:52:03,386
He's right.

737
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:06,656
This conversation is one that only experts could understand.

738
00:52:19,529 --> 00:52:21,738
Did you make the call?

739
00:52:21,738 --> 00:52:25,675
Yes, this is the information from Woowon Group.

740
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,690
Did you make a decision?

741
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,548
Yeah.

742
00:52:42,548 --> 00:52:44,265
Who?

743
00:52:48,681 --> 00:52:51,403
So, I understand what you're saying.

744
00:52:51,404 --> 00:52:57,068
But how could all the copywriters abandon us and work only with the project team?

745
00:52:57,068 --> 00:52:58,142
This is uncomfortable.

746
00:52:58,143 --> 00:52:59,864
We're in a difficult position, too.

747
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:03,611
For now, I'll discuss this with Senior Director Go and get back to you.

748
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:05,115
Sir.

749
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,710
Go ahead.

750
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,120
I know it may be hard, but can you handle things internally?

751
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,491
We get it. We all used to work for an agency, too.

752
00:53:13,502 --> 00:53:15,792
We'll be in touch.

753
00:53:22,051 --> 00:53:25,759
The CCO sent him. Can we send him away like that?

754
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:37,880
What happened with the freelance copywriters?

755
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,884
We got our hands on all of them.

756
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,052
Really?

757
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:47,975
I bet it was hard for them to join hands with us and abandon the creative team.

758
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:52,094
I said one thing to them.

759
00:53:54,997 --> 00:53:56,605
 Of course. 

760
00:53:56,606 --> 00:54:01,915
 I'm sure you're scared of the CCO as freelance copywriters. 

761
00:54:02,632 --> 00:54:07,176
 But I think you're all forgetting one thing. 

762
00:54:07,176 --> 00:54:08,878
 What do you mean? 

763
00:54:09,484 --> 00:54:12,815
 Don't you know who the next CEO of VC communications will be? 

764
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,854
 Make your decision. 

765
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:20,619
 Are you going to work with the next CEO? 

766
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:26,128
 Or with the CCO who will be leaving the company soon? 

767
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,574
How many did you get?

768
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:39,877
I got 11 of them.

769
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:41,779
They're some good copywriters that are known in the industry.

770
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,179
How much do they charge?

771
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,514
About three million won per project.

772
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:47,348
The former creative directors charge five million won.

773
00:54:47,348 --> 00:54:50,020
Pay them double.

774
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,654
Our budget can't cover that.

775
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:56,258
We can liquidate the other costs with the production costs.

776
00:54:56,258 --> 00:55:01,164
Their loyalty shouldn't come for free.

777
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:06,736
Okay. I'll get ready for tomorrow's meeting.

778
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,518
I'm sorry.

779
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,957
Shall we meet other freelance copywriters?

780
00:55:28,957 --> 00:55:30,460
Forget it.

781
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,450
 Still, maybe... 

782
00:55:31,451 --> 00:55:35,064
They don't want to work with someone who has an expiration date.

783
00:55:37,532 --> 00:55:39,669
Great job. You can head back.

784
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,704
Yes.

785
00:55:57,644 --> 00:56:00,623
 Did you make a decision? 

786
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:02,058
 Yeah. 

787
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:04,393
 Who? 

788
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:08,538
 If I have one piece of meat and I give it to the beast that's hungrier, 

789
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:12,201
 won't that beast be more grateful to their owner? 

790
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:14,470
 That's effective. 

791
00:56:16,974 --> 00:56:21,208
 Throw it... Give it to the hungrier beast. 

792
00:56:44,374 --> 00:56:47,537
The hungrier beast.

793
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:56,679
What brings you here, Deputy Park?

794
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:01,594
This is a conversation from a couple of days ago.

795
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:05,187
It's between Executive Director Hwang and the head secretary at Woowon.

796
00:57:18,916 --> 00:57:22,905
I thought it could be of help to you.

797
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:26,575
How did you get this?

798
00:57:28,247 --> 00:57:32,348
 Pros can make the message. 

799
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:37,653
 I hear that person is very interested in Yeouido. 

800
00:57:37,653 --> 00:57:40,868
 Let's clear the path. Use public opinion. 

801
00:57:40,869 --> 00:57:43,092
 Is it possible? 

802
00:57:44,363 --> 00:57:47,763
 Isn't our nation one where miracles happen frequently? 

803
00:57:49,128 --> 00:57:53,403
Words spoken from someone's mouth always reach someone's ear.

804
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:57,974
Birds hear things during the day and rats hear things at night.

805
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:04,798
As long as you reward the birds and rats well, they'll sing for the right price.

806
00:58:10,088 --> 00:58:13,143
Thank you. It was very helpful.

807
00:58:13,143 --> 00:58:16,058
I should get going.

808
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:22,765
Mr. Park?

809
00:58:24,497 --> 00:58:26,069
Yes?

810
00:58:26,662 --> 00:58:27,903
But why did you...

811
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:32,241
Why did I give it to you and not Senior Director Choi?

812
00:58:33,001 --> 00:58:36,779
I'm just doing as you said before.

813
00:58:38,637 --> 00:58:40,617
Give and take.

814
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:42,970
   

815
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:47,822
It's good timing and a good message, but it feels like you are using her.

816
00:58:47,822 --> 00:58:52,077
Not using... Give and take would be more appropriate.

817
00:58:52,077 --> 00:58:55,531
Isn't that what our relationship is based on?

818
00:58:57,376 --> 00:59:00,603
Okay. Then what can I give you?

819
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:03,673
You can win this presentation.

820
00:59:04,608 --> 00:59:09,111
I wouldn't call that give and take. That's a win-win.

821
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:10,909
That's true.

822
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:15,082
This is a presentation that you have to win.

823
00:59:15,082 --> 00:59:16,989
Then let's say you owe me.

824
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:19,789
I'm sure it'll come in handy soon.

825
00:59:21,126 --> 00:59:23,860
Who will you use it for?

826
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,829
Will it be for yourself?

827
00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:29,165
Or will it be for Senior Director Kang Hanna?

828
00:59:32,164 --> 00:59:35,538
For the hungrier person?

829
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,610
If you'll excuse me.

830
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:09,770
First, I'm sure you all heard, but this is a very important presentation.

831
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:12,295
The most important.

832
01:00:14,787 --> 01:00:19,148
Let's restrict access of the copywriters getting into the building.

833
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,718
Let's make sure they can't work with them if they won't work with us.

834
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:31,227
I lost one thing, but I gained another.

835
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:35,331
Didn't you say the planning team decided their direction?

836
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:39,668
Yes, I heard they decided the day that they received the OT.

837
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:42,386
We just have to make sure they follow through

838
01:00:42,387 --> 01:00:46,075
with the production with the direction they've decided on.

839
01:00:48,593 --> 01:00:52,748
Do you think the project team decided on the wrong concept?

840
01:00:53,369 --> 01:00:55,352
Did you see their direction?

841
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,987
No, I didn't have to, but I know.

842
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,222
How?

843
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:07,296
Isn't an ad just a love letter to a target audience?

844
01:01:08,023 --> 01:01:09,865
That's right.

845
01:01:11,394 --> 01:01:14,737
What's the point of writing a number of letters?

846
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,540
When you don't know who you're sending them to.

847
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:26,415
    
 This is an ad for just one person.

848
01:01:26,415 --> 01:01:29,683
We have to captivate the heart of that one person

849
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:32,930
that can make this a nation where miracles happen frequently.

850
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:35,280
   
   

851
01:01:38,715 --> 01:01:41,097
I should pray.

852
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,365
Pray for what?

853
01:02:00,814 --> 01:02:06,702
I need to pray that Senior Director Choi doesn't know what I know until this presentation is over.

854
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:15,690


855
01:02:18,764 --> 01:02:23,870
   

856
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:31,900
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

857
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:38,230
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

858
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:43,890
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

859
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:48,365
 Powerful messages create another issue. 

860
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:51,270
 Choi Chang Soo is stable but so predictable. 

861
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:55,038
 This sounds like something they'd say during the planning team meeting. 

862
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:57,941
 Go Ah In is unstable but useful. 

863
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,009
 Start over. 

864
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:02,545
 At this rate, we'll have to go into the presentation empty-handed. 

865
01:03:02,545 --> 01:03:06,448
 Senior Director Go is human. I'm sure she's scared. 

866
01:03:06,448 --> 01:03:09,219
 Go Ah In hasn't decided on their direction yet. 

867
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:11,683
 Go Ah In hates these types of proposals. 

868
01:03:11,684 --> 01:03:13,356
 The long and boring ones. 

869
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:16,159
 Can I assume that you lost, Senior Director Go? 

870
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:18,261
 We need to make a miracle. 

871
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:20,153
 I can't leave her beside Hanna. 

872
01:03:20,154 --> 01:03:21,597
 What will you give me? 

873
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:25,567
 Turn a crisis into an opportunity. 

874
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:31,590
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
