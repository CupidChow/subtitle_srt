1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:11,950


2
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,754
 Just work. Make ads. 

3
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:24,824
 Besides that, avoid stressful situations. 

4
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,765
   

5
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,881
This is Go Ah In.

6
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,619
Have you been well, sir?

7
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,224
Let's meet quietly.

8
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:02,328
It'll take me about 30 minutes if I leave now.

9
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:07,333
May I start thinking about your weaknesses if it takes you longer than 30 minutes?

10
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:15,504
 The person who waits thinks about the weaknesses of the person that makes them wait. 

11
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,215
I can't complain if you do.

12
00:01:22,215 --> 00:01:25,184
Of course, that's how it should be.

13
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,656
 Also, don't come empty-handed today. 

14
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,725
 Then what shall I bring? 

15
00:01:31,725 --> 00:01:34,060
 Have I misjudged you? 

16
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,262
 Bring what you want. 

17
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,720
This could be the most stressful situation that I've ever been in.

18
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:04,790
But I've never avoided it before.

19
00:02:14,369 --> 00:02:18,639
   

20
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,942
I guess you're a good driver.

21
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:27,614
I came here as fast as I could without breaking the law.

22
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:28,515
   

23
00:02:28,516 --> 00:02:32,251
So, what did you bring?

24
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:38,956
Back when you were working as chairman, I heard that you used to call the VC Groups' marathon meetings

25
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:41,727
cream bun meetings.

26
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,934
And that you always ate this bread whenever the meetings ran long.

27
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:51,571
Do you sleep at night?

28
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:55,375
If you know all of that, do you even have time to sleep?

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,511
Do you have time to sleep, sir?

30
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,281
Wanting to sleep when others sleep and play while others play

31
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,717
but become more successful than others would make me a thief.

32
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,955
No matter how much I look at you, the Kang family's blood runs in you.

33
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,724
Are you sure you're last name is Go?

34
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,229
Do you want me to teach you something?

35
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:18,131
Go ahead.

36
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,701
This is what I like.

37
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,403
But people bring me something from a bakery.

38
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,738
Why do you think they do that?

39
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:32,578
Because it's more polite to gift something that's more expensive?

40
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,730
How is that polite? It's greed.

41
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:42,919
It's not what the other person wants, they just bring something they can show off.

42
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:48,157
If they do that, they think they can get what they want from the other person.

43
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,431
I see.

44
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,601
Remember what I tell you.

45
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,571
Find out what your opponent wants, and focus on that one thing.

46
00:04:00,571 --> 00:04:03,643
Then the rest will sort itself out.

47
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:07,980
Thank you. I won't forget.

48
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:19,022
Since I taught you something, it's your turn to teach me something.

49
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,227
Do you think there's anything that I can teach you?

50
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,462
There is.

51
00:04:23,462 --> 00:04:25,565
What's that?

52
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:33,205
Who's hand will you hold, Kang Han Soo's or Kang Hanna's?

53
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,799
Why are you being like this?

54
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,801
What?

55
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,270
You don't normally eat meat in the mornings or alcohol.

56
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:07,540
I'm going to start eating as much meat and drinking as much alcohol as I want now.

57
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,943
Why?

58
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,778
Because I'm a warrior going to battle.

59
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:19,883
Just eat salad as you normally do. Just go with the flow.

60
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:25,955
I made up my mind. So you just need to follow my decision.

61
00:05:25,955 --> 00:05:28,961
Why do I feel so uneasy about this?

62
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:34,849
Starting today, we're going to be creative like agency employees.

63
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,736
Pardon?

64
00:05:36,737 --> 00:05:42,971
We're going to be creative. Social order, customs, or whatever flow society has created.

65
00:05:42,971 --> 00:05:47,411
Whatever it is, I'm going to ignore it all. We're just going to do it!

66
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:50,116
Do what?

67
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:50,984
Why are you going towards the cliff?

68
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:55,502
Quiet. So on that note, I want you to continue to like me.

69
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:59,959
Because I'm going to keep liking you.

70
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,000
You could end up losing everything.

71
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:11,437
You need to know when to give up.

72
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:14,440
I'm going to create that type of society.

73
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:18,845
Even if that will cost you everything that you have?

74
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:23,383
Without you, there's no one in the world who's on my side.

75
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,954
So just do as I say!

76
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:49,238
 Kang Hanna's pictures. Has he seen them or not? 

77
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,881
Who will I pick?

78
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,851
I won't answer that.

79
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,752
Why? Is it hard?

80
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,554
No.

81
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:02,088
Then?

82
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:07,160
What you really want to hear isn't what I think.

83
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,696
You only want me to follow your orders.

84
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:21,807
It finally feels like I'm having a real conversation with someone.

85
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,114
Senior Director Go.

86
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,316
Yes?

87
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:33,286
I don't want you to pick either one of them.

88
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,088
For what reason?

89
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,193
The same reason that you're sitting in front of me now.

90
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:44,397
The strength to withstand extremely stressful situations without crumbling.

91
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,566
That's what you need to become a chairman.

92
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:50,070
So don't take sides.

93
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,473
Becomes a stress factor for both Kang Han Soo and Kang Hanna.

94
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,478
Yes, sir. I'll do as you say.

95
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,582
Of course, as you should.

96
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:07,119
Then, may I ask you a question too?

97
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,921
Go ahead.

98
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,593
If I make a wrong step, I could become the public enemy.

99
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:17,330
What do I gain from this choice?

100
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,634
Do I look like a thief?

101
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:25,204
Do you think I don't know what you want?

102
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,027
What's going on? Why did you want to see me first?

103
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:58,505
I want you to cancel Senior Director Choi's transfer.

104
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,606
You must've liked the loot.

105
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:03,242
Something like that deserves a little praise.

106
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:06,812
Is it game over?

107
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,715
I don't know.

108
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:13,452
Do you finally want to stand on my side now?

109
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:16,088
I've always been on your side deep down.

110
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,992
Then relay a message for me.

111
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:21,861
You won't speak with Senior Director Choi yourself?

112
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:26,499
It's just, our positions are just so far from each other.

113
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:31,704
Tell him not to make it obvious at work.

114
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:32,972
You want to make the issue bigger?

115
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,041
This is just the start.

116
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:40,210
I need to water it, walk it, and see it grow. It needs to bear fruit.

117
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,115
Will it work?

118
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:45,484
You have to make it work.

119
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:47,920
That's what you're paid for.

120
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:55,194
Also, I want you to encourage Deputy Park.

121
00:09:55,194 --> 00:09:59,699
So you want to make sure he doesn't run away scared?

122
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,836
Yes, sir.

123
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,250
Now, we need to watch it grow.

124
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,551
Shall we water it?

125
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:34,701
Deputy Park, I heard you used to be a boxer.

126
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:38,171
That you were a rising star who even came in first during a national competition.

127
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,007
Yeah, until my second year of high school.

128
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,944
Oh, that's too bad.

129
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:46,245
Why did you quit?

130
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,348
Because I became aware.

131
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,852
I wasn't good enough to be a world champion.

132
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:57,190
You haven't given up, have you?

133
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,494
Excuse me? Given up what?

134
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:05,097
Champions aren't just inside the ring.

135
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,738
I heard we went to the same college.

136
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:13,773
That's right.

137
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,508
Oh.

138
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:19,011
Did you start your studies late because of your boxing?

139
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,960
Wow!

140
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:26,419
You were able to achieve something that everyone said would be impossible.

141
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,755
I've got good stamina.

142
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:31,090
That's not something that can be done on stamina alone.

143
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:34,126
It can only be done with will and faith.

144
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:41,764
You don't seem like the type to quit something before you start.

145
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:50,608
They say that people who have made miracles happen have the power to do it again.

146
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:54,714
I can't wait. Good luck to you.

147
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,492
Hey, did you see the pictures I sent you?

148
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,563
Yeah, okay.

149
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:13,699
Of course. Why would I be obvious?

150
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,236
Okay. Sure.

151
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,310
He wouldn't be able to figure it out on that alone.

152
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,017
The opposing team is cheering me on.

153
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:34,020
That means they know something. If that's the case...

154
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,895
This means that I've become Kang Hanna's weakness.

155
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:52,200
   

156
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,780
   

157
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,648
Ma'am?

158
00:13:01,648 --> 00:13:05,784
Did something happen this morning by any chance?

159
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,554
Like what?

160
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:13,225
Yeah, I was annoyed so I yelled a little!

161
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,195
Not that.

162
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,162
Then what?

163
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:20,601
Was the vice-president friendlier than usual

164
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:25,072
or did the chairman say something he normally wouldn't?

165
00:13:25,072 --> 00:13:29,041
Nope. I didn't even see him before I left.

166
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:32,212
Why?

167
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:36,649
There were people who said things to me that they normally wouldn't.

168
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,484
For example?

169
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,021
Support?

170
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,259
That trick seems very high.

171
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:47,194
Right?

172
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:50,696
Treating someone differently than you normally would

173
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:54,201
is proof that something out of the ordinary happened.

174
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,636
Including you.

175
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:00,374
Okay, I'll look into it.

176
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:02,575
So will I.

177
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:05,211
I'll see if anyone else tries to offer their support to me.

178
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,480
If they do?

179
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,882
The people who don't support us are on our side.

180
00:14:14,988 --> 00:14:20,059
So you want me to guarantee that?

181
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,295
Go Ah In could go back on her word.

182
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:25,698
I just need your promise.

183
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:31,935
What if someone tries to get in the way and sales don't increase by fifty percent within six months?

184
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:34,974
Are you talking about me?

185
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:37,945
It's natural for you to get in the way.

186
00:14:37,945 --> 00:14:41,647
Since there's only one seat as CEO of the agency.

187
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:47,019
Then, who do you think will get in the way?

188
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:50,089
Someone from headquarters could.

189
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,494
Okay.

190
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:59,265
If Senior Director Go fails to increase sales by fifty percent,

191
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,169
I will promise to give disciplinary action as the CEO.

192
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:06,273
Thank you, Sir.

193
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:13,709
However, excluding you, only on the premise that she doesn't fail due to someone else.

194
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,272
I mean, we're going to do all of this without having to do a presentation?

195
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,141
Do you want to split it up?

196
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:43,510
- I'm against that. 
 - Why?

197
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,846
Work should be done together. That makes it much more fun.

198
00:15:46,847 --> 00:15:49,683
I feel the same way.

199
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:51,552
Okay, then do that.

200
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:55,690
First, let's start with the insurance company ad. As for the rest...

201
00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:00,460
I'll touch back with you after I adjust the schedule with the advertisers.

202
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,863
Oh, about the insurance company ad.

203
00:16:03,864 --> 00:16:07,133
They normally go on about happiness and hope.

204
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:11,137
- The typical and obvious ones. 
 - Rather than something typical and obvious,

205
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,559
we'll go with something they can grab

206
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,648
or that's beneficial for the customer.

207
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:19,812
Or we'll just go with something that makes them really cry.

208
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,681
It really feels like we're in sync now.

209
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:22,949
Of course!

210
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:27,087
The six-month mark for the fifty percent sales increase is coming.

211
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:30,324
People might think you made that promise.

212
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,392
As they should.

213
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,328
Our team shares a common fate.

214
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,801
You all go through so much hard work because of me.

215
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:41,934
As we should.

216
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:44,871
You made us creative directors.

217
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:51,411
I was just wondering.

218
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:54,146
Can I ask you a question?

219
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,114
What?

220
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:59,285
Are we allowed to eat on a day like today?

221
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:02,889
Yeah. You should eat as much as you want.

222
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,323
Shall we have lunch together?

223
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,993
Yes! Then I'll make reservations at a nice place.

224
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,495
No.

225
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,529
Why not?

226
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:11,731
Because you're going to pick a BBQ place.

227
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:13,833
I don't want the smell of grilled meat on my clothes all day.

228
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,268
Then you can boil it!

229
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,502
Boiled meat is worse!

230
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:19,239
Are you insane? Why would you boil meat?

231
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:22,341
I meant your clothes, Jang Woo!

232
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:28,549
Yes?

233
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,052
Ma'am, are you free right now?

234
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,390
I'll see you at my office.

235
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:37,924
Yes, Ma'am.

236
00:17:40,461 --> 00:17:44,697
It seems you'll all be having lunch without me today.

237
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:55,842
We have the trump card!

238
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:58,211
It's a waste to use it on such a small scale.

239
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:01,080
Yeah, but we can't bring the other teams.

240
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,817
It'd be great if we bring one more person and make it a party of five.

241
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:09,388
Yeah. We could use two grills and match the cooking speed.

242
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,062
Hello.

243
00:18:15,062 --> 00:18:16,329
Are you going to eat lunch?

244
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:19,366
Yeah, we're going to eat meat. Korean beef!

245
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:21,534
Oh, really?

246
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:24,037
I almost forgot. How's your forehead?

247
00:18:24,037 --> 00:18:26,539
Oh, it's fine.

248
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,009
I'm sorry about that little incident.

249
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,744
No, it was nice.

250
00:18:31,745 --> 00:18:34,013
It was proof that you worked hard while sacrificing your sleep.

251
00:18:34,013 --> 00:18:37,885
If that's the case, I'm relieved to hear that.

252
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:41,221
But have you had lunch yet?

253
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,223
No, not yet.

254
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:47,026
Then, do you want to join us for some beef?

255
00:18:48,495 --> 00:18:51,899
We were hoping that one more person would join us.

256
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,634
Oh, beef?

257
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,002
I'm sick of even just hearing the word.

258
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:59,639
Enjoy your lunch.

259
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:09,148
Wow, she's so different.

260
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,650
In what way?

261
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,418
She said she's sick of beef.

262
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,521
Rich people can even get sick of beef.

263
00:19:15,522 --> 00:19:18,092
- You're much more different. 
 - How so?

264
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:21,796
- How could you ask her to join us for lunch? 
 - Why not?

265
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:23,829
It'd be so uncomfortable. How could we eat?

266
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,398
What's uncomfortable?

267
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:26,465
She's rich.

268
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:31,034
Oh, come on. Why would that be uncomfortable? Eating together would be reassuring!

269
00:19:31,034 --> 00:19:34,440
Do you know who the most uncomfortable person you can eat beef with is?

270
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,708
Who?

271
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:38,978
Someone who eats more than me.

272
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:41,781
You said it'd be nice if there was one more person.

273
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,483
But why does that person have to be her?

274
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:47,453
Oh, that's right! There's one more person on our team!

275
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:59,233
Is someone inside?

276
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,967
Well.

277
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,305
Deputy Park?

278
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07,073
Yes, Sir.

279
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:18,718
Okay, don't tell her I stopped by.

280
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,920
Yes, Sir.

281
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:30,029
It seems Go Ah In is going to grab hands with Kang Hanna.

282
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,966
That's good for me.

283
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:50,350
This is difficult.

284
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,353
What is?

285
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:56,756
It's almost like the time between dog and wolf.

286
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,592
It's hard to distinguish between friend and foe.

287
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:01,995
There's nothing as clear as black and white in this world.

288
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:09,501
Then I'll come right out and ask.

289
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:15,638
Since yesterday, did you learn anything new?

290
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:30,320
Since I am indebted to you, it wouldn't be polite of me to lie, would it?

291
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,862
I know that the two of you paid a visit to the district ward office.

292
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:47,370
I'd like to make it as if that never happened.

293
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,342
What do you think?

294
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,947
Do you think it's possible?

295
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:58,185
Someone who's never had anything taken from them before.

296
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:00,587
Will that person be able to give up?

297
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:04,057
I should try. I have no choice.

298
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,364
You're busy and I took up your time. Have a great day.

299
00:22:17,871 --> 00:22:19,672
Deputy Park?

300
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:26,613
Can I give you some personal advice?

301
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,548
Of course.

302
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:32,285
Just because it's a weakness, it doesn't mean you have to get rid of it.

303
00:22:34,121 --> 00:22:36,156
Do you really think so?

304
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:40,194
Your strengths are used to imprint yourself on others

305
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:44,298
and weaknesses are used to make yourself loved by others.

306
00:22:44,298 --> 00:22:49,834
If you don't hide it,but reveal it well, people might cheer you on.

307
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:55,809
By chance, are you cheering me on right now?

308
00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:00,013
Do I look like someone who would cheer others on?

309
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:18,964
I don't see benefits on their side

310
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:21,200
but I can't help but feel a soft spot for them.

311
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,350
I'm happy to see you.

312
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:41,420
You're happy to see me? That's unexpected.

313
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,455
Of course, I'm happy.

314
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,992
We don't have much time left together.

315
00:23:47,027 --> 00:23:50,798
I guess you're slow in obtaining your information.

316
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:52,232
What do you mean?

317
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:56,035
I even heard that you cheered on Deputy Park.

318
00:23:59,807 --> 00:24:01,674
Working at a company is hard.

319
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,578
I was only offering my support.

320
00:24:03,578 --> 00:24:08,314
I see. It seemed as if company life was too much for you, too.

321
00:24:08,315 --> 00:24:09,949
I offered you some of my support.

322
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:13,252
Well? Did you like it?

323
00:24:14,488 --> 00:24:18,825
Yes, I really do.

324
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:28,301
All right. Have a nice day.

325
00:24:43,383 --> 00:24:47,538
Of course, we thought of you!

326
00:24:47,538 --> 00:24:50,224
Come on! You're the youngest on the TF team.

327
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:53,292
We're glad you came. We needed one more person.

328
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:56,029
But I wouldn't say I'm on the team.

329
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,598
Stop that! What are you saying?

330
00:24:57,598 --> 00:25:01,201
You're the senior director's assistant. That means we're a team, doesn't it?

331
00:25:01,201 --> 00:25:05,270
Of course, we work under one roof.

332
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,374
Now, let's eat! The tastiest meat is meat paid for with a company card!

333
00:25:20,621 --> 00:25:24,657
What's wrong? You don't like meat?

334
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:29,194
Oh, no. Don't worry about me. Enjoy.

335
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,498
What is this? Are you on a diet?

336
00:25:31,498 --> 00:25:34,667
Are you trying to be prettier than you are now?

337
00:25:50,284 --> 00:25:52,652
Thank you.

338
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:02,529
I see. That's what it was.

339
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:05,664
Huh? What?

340
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:10,067
You don't eat the meat that I gave you, but you'll eat the one that Jang Woo gives you.

341
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:11,171
It's not that!

342
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:13,594
It's so obvious. She doesn't eat meat that's not fully cooked.

343
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:17,941
Right? That was obvious to you. Right? It was only obvious to Jang Woo!

344
00:26:17,941 --> 00:26:20,680
Don't just eat meat. Eat the wraps, too.

345
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:24,929
What? My mom gave up on trying to make me eat my greens, so why would you try?

346
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:28,021
Don't worry about them and eat up.

347
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,523
This is our daily life. We're used to it.

348
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:36,996
We'll be at the coffee shop.

349
00:26:38,165 --> 00:26:40,333
Thank you.

350
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,950
I'd like to pay.

351
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:46,900
   

352
00:26:46,907 --> 00:26:50,109
I'll keep my word!

353
00:26:51,845 --> 00:26:55,181
What's the point? We reek already!

354
00:26:55,182 --> 00:26:58,585
Not that. The promise I made before.

355
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:01,687
 By chance? 

356
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:03,556
 - I've never had a girlfriend. 
 - What? 

357
00:27:03,556 --> 00:27:05,291
 Why aren't you embarrassed about it? 

358
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,393
 Because I'm not. 

359
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:11,531
 Let's figure this problem out before I resign. 

360
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,835
I'll make the move first.

361
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:17,436
No, no, no.

362
00:27:17,437 --> 00:27:20,060
Why? You don't want to?

363
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,975
Don't do it?

364
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,747
I don't want to make it uncomfortable for Soo Jeong.

365
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:30,818
I'll make sure to be smooth.

366
00:27:30,818 --> 00:27:34,120
Just trust the love cupid!

367
00:27:36,924 --> 00:27:39,025
Do you trust me?

368
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:42,529
Yes.

369
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:12,925
What brings you here?

370
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:17,797
I felt the CPO and CCO weren't seeing each other enough.

371
00:28:17,798 --> 00:28:20,801
It's not like we have anything to say. What's the point in meeting?

372
00:28:20,801 --> 00:28:22,569
Others think differently.

373
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:24,403
I guess you live by other people's thoughts.

374
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,239
I live by my own thoughts.

375
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:28,574
That's why people call you single-minded.

376
00:28:28,575 --> 00:28:30,843
Does it matter if I'm single-minded or not?

377
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:34,180
I just need to keep my word, don't I?

378
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,651
Speaking of which, I'm here over that matter.

379
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:43,256
I heard you received a lot of requests from advertisers.

380
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:45,291
Why? Are you jealous?

381
00:28:45,292 --> 00:28:47,593
There's nothing bad about it. It'll raise company sales, too.

382
00:28:47,594 --> 00:28:49,896
That means my bonus will go up as well.

383
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:55,435
I don't need to hear your nonsense. Just get to the point.

384
00:28:57,504 --> 00:29:01,474
You're going to resign from the company if you can't increase sales by fifty percent.

385
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,544
Wasn't that your promise?

386
00:29:11,285 --> 00:29:15,188
Did you come here just to confirm that?

387
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,526
You're the type to go back on your word depending on your personal gain.

388
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:25,798
I'm the type of person that takes responsibility for what I said.

389
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:51,257
I, Go Ah In,

390
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:54,794
promise to resign from the company

391
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,064
if I can't raise company sales by fifty percent in six months.

392
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,242
I'm not sure if I recorded it well.

393
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:12,712
Well? Do you want to check it here now?

394
00:30:22,456 --> 00:30:24,190
It's more than enough.

395
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,335
   

396
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:42,475
Why is he calling out of the blue like this?

397
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:47,715
What is it?

398
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:50,516
Let's have dinner if you have time.

399
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,518
Dinner? With me?

400
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:56,223
Yeah, the chairman of Woowon was able to get out because of you.

401
00:30:56,223 --> 00:30:59,125
I didn't even get a chance to thank you.

402
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,897
Okay, let's have dinner.

403
00:31:04,898 --> 00:31:07,767
I'll see you at 7:00. I'll send you the address.

404
00:31:20,614 --> 00:31:22,415
I got a call from the secretary's office.

405
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,851
I heard you're having dinner with your brother.

406
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:29,755
Han Soo said he wants to buy me dinner to thank me.

407
00:31:30,858 --> 00:31:33,092
Is he cheering me on, too?

408
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,540
You came?

409
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,041
Why did you bring that?

410
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,410
That? Am I a dog or something?

411
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,413
Were you not?

412
00:31:57,718 --> 00:32:01,785
I'm just kidding. Who eats with a dog at the same table?

413
00:32:07,461 --> 00:32:10,930
Your reservation was for four people. Are you waiting on one more person?

414
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:14,233
No, everyone in the party is here.

415
00:32:18,805 --> 00:32:20,573
Deputy Park?

416
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,744
Sit down.

417
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:43,930
Let's have a drink.

418
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:54,574
You can just call a driver.

419
00:32:54,574 --> 00:32:56,509
Right?

420
00:32:57,377 --> 00:33:00,046
Deputy Park doesn't drink.

421
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:05,651
Do you not drink at all? Or are you not drinking?

422
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,221
Both.

423
00:33:08,222 --> 00:33:09,956
I've never drank before.

424
00:33:09,957 --> 00:33:12,358
Wow, you don't drink or smoke.

425
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:15,127
You're smart, talented, and healthy.

426
00:33:15,128 --> 00:33:17,830
You're even handsome.

427
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,967
Wouldn't you call someone like him husband material?

428
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:25,976
That's true. You should cut down on drinking, too.

429
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,875
It's in our genetics.

430
00:33:30,277 --> 00:33:33,977
Of course. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

431
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:13,786
The main dish is out, so go ahead.

432
00:34:13,786 --> 00:34:15,555
What?

433
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:19,392
You asked to see me because you have something to say.

434
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:21,928
You must not have learned this yet.

435
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,497
What?

436
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:29,435
The important business talk should be done before the main dish arrives.

437
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,405
I already said everything.

438
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:56,562
Is this necessary?

439
00:34:56,563 --> 00:35:00,099
You're the eldest son. Everyone knows you'll be the next chairman.

440
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,370
Not to mention, my dad has shares in VC Group.

441
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,005
Zero.

442
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,341
I need a zero percent chance.

443
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:12,779
You know how much I hate unexpected results.

444
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:17,850
There's already a zero percent chance that Hanna will become vice-chairman.

445
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,555
Hanna and Deputy Park's relationship needs to be a sure thing.

446
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:26,959
Only then will there be absolutely no chance of Hanna becoming the next vice-chairman.

447
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:31,497
I'll grow one side...

448
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,701
and I'll crush the other.

449
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:40,873
This is why I like you.

450
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:09,836
Ma'am.

451
00:36:12,773 --> 00:36:14,874
Let's talk tomorrow.

452
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,099
Why do I keep staring at a tree I can't climb?

453
00:36:43,003 --> 00:36:45,171
I should go home.

454
00:37:13,734 --> 00:37:16,870
 I, Go Ah In, promise to resign from the company 

455
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,306
 if I can't raise company sales by fifty percent in six months. 

456
00:37:21,108 --> 00:37:23,142
 It's more than enough. 

457
00:37:27,948 --> 00:37:31,951
I need to work if I want to take responsibility for what I said.

458
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:51,737
But I need to sleep if I want to work.

459
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:54,674
I could sleep if I drink alcohol.

460
00:37:56,143 --> 00:37:59,612
 Anxiety disorders can improve only when the frontal lobe is activated. 

461
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:03,249
 Do you think I'd tell you to have sex if it wasn't for your own good? 

462
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,819
 Stimulation! Physical stimulation! 

463
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:11,958
Yeah, my body will rot after I die.

464
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:15,628
Let's give it some physical stimulation.

465
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,040
♫  Four walls up late, and the radios buzzing  ♫

466
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:40,780
♫  It's keeping me awake, maybe I should say something  ♫

467
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:51,180
♫  Why I'm I always sitting in the firing line? 
 Don't know when it started but you're switching sides  ♫

468
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:58,470
♫  Left it all too late, maybe I should say nothing  ♫

469
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:03,170
♫  'Cause I can't read you anymore  ♫

470
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:06,012
Activating the frontal lobe is hard.

471
00:39:06,012 --> 00:39:08,160
I might die of a heart attack first.

472
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,900
♫  Don't say we're falling apart, 
 'cause now we're running in circles and searching for purpose  ♫

473
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:42,949
 What are your side effects? 

474
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:46,953
 Did you walk around the neighborhood while you were sleeping? 

475
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:35,701
How do people sleep every day?

476
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:50,360
   

477
00:41:56,016 --> 00:41:58,417
Today is your first day as the cleaning lady. Right?

478
00:41:58,418 --> 00:41:59,452
Yes.

479
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,686
Have you ever done this type of work before?

480
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,121
Yes.

481
00:42:02,122 --> 00:42:05,157
You'll be in charge of the executive offices so it'll be similar.

482
00:42:05,158 --> 00:42:08,262
Let's go. You can change your clothes and I'll explain everything to you.

483
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,365
I was wondering.

484
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:16,335
Is this the type of place you can only work at if you were smart as a child?

485
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:19,672
Of course. It's not for everyone.

486
00:42:38,959 --> 00:42:42,094
Ma'am, you're here early again.

487
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:58,611
Did you hurt your leg?

488
00:42:58,611 --> 00:43:00,947
No, it's just a cramp.

489
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:12,224
This is the new cleaning lady. She'll be in charge of your office.

490
00:43:12,224 --> 00:43:14,294
I hope you'll work hard.

491
00:43:14,294 --> 00:43:15,962
Yes, Ma'am.

492
00:43:42,189 --> 00:43:44,324
Is there no meat?

493
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:46,859
Just eat what's on the table.

494
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:55,501
Father, about Deputy Park.

495
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:58,337
I'm thinking of promoting him.

496
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:00,974
Deputy Park?

497
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:04,477
Yeah, he does deserve it.

498
00:44:04,477 --> 00:44:08,548
Hey, you couldn't give me enough money to be her secretary.

499
00:44:08,548 --> 00:44:09,782
Then, is he a department head now?

500
00:44:09,782 --> 00:44:13,319
No, I want to make him an executive.

501
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,054
Director.

502
00:44:18,392 --> 00:44:19,826
Isn't it a little early to make him an executive?

503
00:44:19,826 --> 00:44:21,494
What's early about it?

504
00:44:21,494 --> 00:44:23,663
Give him the position if he's capable.

505
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:27,266
Then I'll give the instructions to human resources.

506
00:44:31,405 --> 00:44:34,006
Vice-President Kang Han Soo?

507
00:44:34,641 --> 00:44:36,776
I bet you couldn't sleep last night.

508
00:44:36,776 --> 00:44:38,312
Since you were busy racking your brain.

509
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:41,850
Nope. I slept great.

510
00:44:51,592 --> 00:44:53,759
Congratulations.

511
00:44:53,759 --> 00:44:58,364
Accept it. It's not a bad thing for you.

512
00:44:58,364 --> 00:45:00,967
Others couldn't dream of it.

513
00:45:03,937 --> 00:45:07,540
Mr. Kim, thanks for cheering me on.

514
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:21,555
Tell me.

515
00:45:21,555 --> 00:45:23,123
Pardon?

516
00:45:37,771 --> 00:45:39,773
You didn't report this to me?

517
00:45:39,773 --> 00:45:41,641
I'm sorry.

518
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:47,113
Since when has Han Soo known?

519
00:45:47,113 --> 00:45:48,514
Only a few days.

520
00:45:48,514 --> 00:45:51,618
A few days?

521
00:45:51,618 --> 00:45:55,021
A day? Or two? Three days?

522
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:56,189
No. The thing is...

523
00:45:56,189 --> 00:46:00,993
Do I need to imagine the scenario for myself before you report it to me?

524
00:46:00,993 --> 00:46:03,563
 Is this how you handle work? 

525
00:46:04,631 --> 00:46:08,267
 It seems they're starting to make their moves. 

526
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:21,447
Try to win holding onto that deadweight.

527
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,290
   

528
00:46:36,396 --> 00:46:38,964
   

529
00:46:44,505 --> 00:46:46,072
Yes, Sir.

530
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:48,341
Let's meet right now.

531
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:51,478
Yes, sir. I'll be right there.

532
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:54,714
But what is this about?

533
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,189
He could at least tell me why he wants to see me!

534
00:47:04,759 --> 00:47:07,690
   

535
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:15,330
   

536
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:17,936
 - Hey, I wanted to ask you something.  
 - What is it?

537
00:47:17,936 --> 00:47:21,290
The vice-president asked to see me. Did something happen?

538
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,009
He called you himself?

539
00:47:23,009 --> 00:47:24,544
 Yeah. 

540
00:47:25,612 --> 00:47:27,614
I don't think it'll be bad.

541
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:30,449
 It could be over with Plan A. 

542
00:47:33,053 --> 00:47:34,888
Not yet.

543
00:47:34,888 --> 00:47:39,025
Kang Han Soo likes Go Ah In more than he likes me.

544
00:47:39,025 --> 00:47:40,193
Are you going to just leave her alone?

545
00:47:40,193 --> 00:47:44,330
It's not time yet, but I'm making preparations.

546
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,099
Tell me what you've prepared.

547
00:47:46,099 --> 00:47:48,668
There's a saying for the condition of happiness.

548
00:47:48,668 --> 00:47:52,806
What about the condition of happiness for people who are terminally ill?

549
00:47:52,806 --> 00:47:56,009
A concept around the happiness I lost.

550
00:47:56,009 --> 00:47:58,544
A review of lost happiness?

551
00:47:58,544 --> 00:48:01,080
I have a similar direction.

552
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:03,249
Mine's called, "Your Dream Foundation."

553
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:05,117
It's a type of organization that makes dreams come true

554
00:48:05,118 --> 00:48:08,221
for patients who have been diagnosed to be terminally ill.

555
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:10,623
It could have a heavy approach if it's organized right.

556
00:48:10,623 --> 00:48:12,458
What about you, Eun Jeong?

557
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,994
I found an idea.

558
00:48:14,995 --> 00:48:18,431
It's based on the idea of reuniting people with their late loved ones through VR.

559
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,999
That's not bad. Jang Woo?

560
00:48:19,999 --> 00:48:23,369
Oh, well, that wasn't the direction I took.

561
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:29,375
Ma'am, you have a guest.

562
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:33,179
A guest? Who?

563
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:43,556
Hello. I'm Go Ah In.

564
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:50,396
What brings a busy prosecutor like you here?

565
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:52,198
Have you eaten?

566
00:48:52,198 --> 00:48:53,633
No, not yet.

567
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,701
So you save time by not eating.

568
00:48:55,701 --> 00:49:01,373
You must've stayed up all day and night to think about how to screw me over.

569
00:49:01,373 --> 00:49:04,375
What do you mean? I was just doing my job.

570
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:06,212
That's true.

571
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:08,948
Chairman Kim Woo Won will be sentenced to three years in prison,

572
00:49:08,948 --> 00:49:11,517
and released on a five-year suspended sentence anyway.

573
00:49:11,517 --> 00:49:13,052
I don't find that a waste.

574
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:16,556
The problem is, the promotion I was supposed to get but didn't is a waste.

575
00:49:16,556 --> 00:49:20,259
Shouldn't you discuss that with Mr. Bae of the legal team at headquarters?

576
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:22,829
That'll be much quicker.

577
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,798
I'm not here to discuss anything.

578
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:28,701
Then why are you here?

579
00:49:28,701 --> 00:49:31,070
You are the one who prevented my goal.

580
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:34,140
I came because I wanted to see your face.

581
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:42,114
Well, since I saw it, I'll be leaving now.

582
00:49:42,114 --> 00:49:46,519
Good luck, and don't commit crimes.

583
00:49:47,387 --> 00:49:50,656
I'll see you again soon.

584
00:49:52,726 --> 00:49:54,527
Oh, I almost forgot!

585
00:49:55,262 --> 00:49:58,698
Are your parents still in good health?

586
00:50:00,033 --> 00:50:01,601
 Her parents are still alive. 

587
00:50:01,601 --> 00:50:05,437
 Her father is missing, so we're still looking. 

588
00:50:05,437 --> 00:50:09,709
 And her mother's residence is unknown. 

589
00:50:10,744 --> 00:50:14,347
 She's changed jobs continuously for the past 35 years. 

590
00:50:14,347 --> 00:50:16,416
 Yet she has never registered her address? 

591
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:18,117
 She was probably scared. 

592
00:50:18,117 --> 00:50:19,319
 Of what? 

593
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,888
 There are cases like this among those 

594
00:50:21,888 --> 00:50:23,890
 who run away from home due to domestic violence. 

595
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,959
 It's different these days, but in the past 

596
00:50:26,959 --> 00:50:29,629
 it was easy to find someone if they registered their address. 

597
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:34,331
 That means she's been running away for 35 years? 

598
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:35,835
 Yes. 

599
00:50:37,104 --> 00:50:40,039
 This gives me so much motivation. 

600
00:50:40,774 --> 00:50:43,876
 She lives in anxiety and fear. 

601
00:50:43,876 --> 00:50:46,779
 Could you imagine how much she misses her daughter? 

602
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:51,451
 In a situation like this, a family can be like a ball and chain. 

603
00:50:51,451 --> 00:50:54,620
 I have to make sure they meet. 

604
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:57,223
They should be healthy.

605
00:50:57,223 --> 00:50:59,726
Look how well their daughter is doing.

606
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:04,297
If I were them, I'd want to see you every day.

607
00:51:13,574 --> 00:51:17,143
Oh, thank you.

608
00:51:35,996 --> 00:51:37,797
Take a seat.

609
00:51:38,866 --> 00:51:40,400
Yes, Sir.

610
00:51:45,038 --> 00:51:47,740
Is there something you need me to do?

611
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,409
Do you have social media?

612
00:51:49,409 --> 00:51:52,812
I don't participate, but I watch a lot.

613
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:54,147
Why don't you do it yourself?

614
00:51:54,147 --> 00:51:59,382
Sir Alex Ferguson once said, "Social media is a waste of life."

615
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,921
Really? What do I do?

616
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:04,691
I called you to waste some of your life with me.

617
00:52:04,691 --> 00:52:07,727
We must participate in social media if it has clear goals and profits.

618
00:52:07,728 --> 00:52:08,662
Just like you do.

619
00:52:08,663 --> 00:52:11,531
True, I agree with you on that.

620
00:52:11,531 --> 00:52:13,566
Do you want to increase your followers?

621
00:52:13,566 --> 00:52:16,503
We also agree on that.

622
00:52:16,503 --> 00:52:20,140
Is Senior Director Hanna the standard?

623
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,008
There are two ways.

624
00:52:22,008 --> 00:52:23,076
Go on.

625
00:52:23,076 --> 00:52:24,510
There's a company.

626
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,280
We can pay them to increase our followers. It's like hiring people to write comments.

627
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,548
It's fast and reliable.

628
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:30,149
That's not right.

629
00:52:30,149 --> 00:52:33,717
Must I resort to something that petty just so I can beat Hanna?

630
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,321
I apologize.

631
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:38,691
I was trying to offer you the quickest solution.

632
00:52:38,691 --> 00:52:40,994
Sure, it's good to offer a variety of options.

633
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:44,664
After seeing you today, it seems we think on the same wavelength.

634
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:47,767
I'll call you myself from now on.

635
00:52:48,602 --> 00:52:50,603
Thank you.

636
00:52:50,603 --> 00:52:54,040
Also, I'd like to offer a suggestion.

637
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,275
Go ahead.

638
00:52:56,275 --> 00:53:00,978
I'd like to hire an executive for the agency's creative team.

639
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:04,050
You can take care of that however you want.

640
00:53:05,986 --> 00:53:07,720
Thank you.

641
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:19,198
This is all thanks to Kang Hanna for demoting me.

642
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:22,401
Things are working out much better.

643
00:53:25,404 --> 00:53:28,775
Do you have any employees in their twenties who are good with social media?

644
00:53:29,576 --> 00:53:32,645
Gather them all. I'll be right there.

645
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:38,951
It was canceled? By who?

646
00:53:38,951 --> 00:53:41,220
Who from human resources at headquarters?

647
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,423
Who would cancel the transfer I ordered?

648
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:48,328
Do you really think anyone from human resources could do that?

649
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:52,665
See the world for what it is.

650
00:53:52,665 --> 00:53:54,767
Do you think you can only see what you want to see?

651
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:57,103
How could you say I only see what I want to see?

652
00:53:57,103 --> 00:54:00,807
In reality, you can't change anything at VC Communications the way you want.

653
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:05,578
Can you only have the idea of wanting to change the world and society?

654
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,453
Attacking isn't everything.

655
00:54:16,223 --> 00:54:19,992
What's important about winning small battles?

656
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:24,130
Winning the war is what's important.

657
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,501
So what am I supposed to do?

658
00:54:27,501 --> 00:54:30,103
Lose. For now.

659
00:54:30,103 --> 00:54:32,371
To who?

660
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,523
He should be more precise! I never know what he's saying!

661
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,493
What did he say?

662
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:57,029
He said that Kang Han Soo canceled Senior Director Choi's transfer.

663
00:54:59,466 --> 00:55:02,735
Now we know who the informant was.

664
00:55:03,637 --> 00:55:07,273
He joined hands with Kang Han Soo to screw me over?

665
00:55:07,273 --> 00:55:10,376
This isn't screwing you over.

666
00:55:11,111 --> 00:55:14,414
Senior Director Choi can't stay seated and just let this happen to him.

667
00:55:14,414 --> 00:55:15,584
What are you doing?

668
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:18,051
Why do you seem like you're taking his side?

669
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:21,587
The person who's really on your side tells you things you don't want to hear.

670
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,596
Lose.

671
00:55:33,867 --> 00:55:36,202
Ugh, I hate losing!

672
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:37,637
Did the CEO tell you to lose?

673
00:55:37,637 --> 00:55:40,273
Yeah, he told me to lose!

674
00:55:40,273 --> 00:55:41,641
To who?

675
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:45,912
I'm sure it's Kang Han Soo!

676
00:55:45,912 --> 00:55:47,847
I don't think so.

677
00:55:47,847 --> 00:55:49,683
Then who?

678
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:52,419
Don't you think he was telling you to lose to yourself?

679
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:56,990
He's telling you not to be stubborn about changing the world or society.

680
00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:00,359
Forget it. I'm done talking about that.

681
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,168
He should tell me how. The way!

682
00:56:08,168 --> 00:56:11,337
All he does is sit there and play Go.

683
00:56:12,472 --> 00:56:14,307
That's right.

684
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:19,445
There was a rock!

685
00:56:19,445 --> 00:56:21,547
What?

686
00:56:21,547 --> 00:56:23,649
It's there. A big rock.

687
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,885
Ulsanbawi Rock.

688
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:32,792
I need to put on a performance.

689
00:56:33,794 --> 00:56:36,462
I can't lose.

690
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:39,131
But I can pretend like I did.

691
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:16,769
How did she succeed on her own like this?

692
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:30,900
   

693
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:46,330
   

694
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:55,000
   

695
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,710
Is she cleaning already?

696
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:18,531
Thank you for growing up so well.

697
00:58:18,531 --> 00:58:22,001
Thank you for growing up all on your own.

698
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:23,936
Thank you, Ah In.

699
00:58:23,936 --> 00:58:26,539
My sweet daughter, thank you.

700
00:58:34,081 --> 00:58:36,282
No.

701
00:58:36,282 --> 00:58:37,117
Excuse me?

702
00:58:37,118 --> 00:58:39,686
No, it's not what you think.

703
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:43,923
Why would you call the senior director your daughter?

704
00:58:43,923 --> 00:58:47,260
I just said it. I didn't mean anything by it.

705
00:58:56,036 --> 00:59:00,006
Please pretend like you didn't hear me. Just this once.

706
00:59:00,006 --> 00:59:04,309
How can I pretend like I didn't hear that?

707
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:08,314
I'm going to call security. You can talk to them.

708
00:59:08,314 --> 00:59:10,449
The truth is...

709
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:15,388
I am her mother.

710
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:54,561
I'm sorry.

711
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:58,064
I know it's shameless of me to ask.

712
00:59:58,064 --> 01:00:01,001
Then you should tell her.

713
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:03,603
No, please. Don't say anything.

714
01:00:03,603 --> 01:00:06,473
It's just for one month.

715
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:09,208
No, just one week.

716
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,577
Just let me see her up close.

717
01:00:11,577 --> 01:00:14,514
Then I'll quietly disappear.

718
01:00:15,149 --> 01:00:17,299
I'll make sure Ah In doesn't find out.

719
01:00:17,299 --> 01:00:20,152
I'll just clean and disappear.

720
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,562
Please, this once.

721
01:00:29,562 --> 01:00:33,966
I beg of you. Please.

722
01:00:44,411 --> 01:00:46,379
What are you doing?

723
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:07,930


724
01:01:09,572 --> 01:01:15,920
   

725
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:22,580
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

726
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:28,880
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

727
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:34,140
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

728
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,840
♫  So I will make my road  ♫

729
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,134
 I think Senior Director Choi knows. 

730
01:01:41,134 --> 01:01:44,371
 I have a plan I want to propose to you. 

731
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:48,741
 It's been so long. Has it been 35 years? 

732
01:01:48,741 --> 01:01:52,044
 I just wanted to see you once. 

733
01:01:52,846 --> 01:01:54,380
 Do you have to do this? 

734
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,284
 Well? Are you happy now that you see me? 

735
01:01:58,284 --> 01:02:03,189
 The fact that I'm alive is a nuisance. 

736
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:06,420
 You should be living the good life after you ran away and abandoned your daughter! 

737
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:09,350
 What the hell is wrong with your house? 

738
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,950
 Ah In, I'm so sorry. 

739
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:15,930
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

740
01:02:15,930 --> 01:02:20,160
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
