1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,640
 Hey, homeless kid! Are you sleeping? 

2
00:00:12,412 --> 00:00:15,114
 Wake up! You need to eat before school! 

3
00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:19,883
 - You're here. 
 - You didn't go home again? 

4
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,622
 Look at this appalling sight. 

5
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,291
 Hey, how many trees did you sacrifice last night? 

6
00:00:25,292 --> 00:00:27,760
 You said I couldn't be a good copywriter if I saved paper. 

7
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:31,665
 Well, do you actually have a home somewhere? 

8
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,700
 I do. I pay rent, too. 

9
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:40,440
 Eye boogers, drool, press marks... 

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,845
 Wait, I don't see any. That means you were only sleeping for 30 minutes. 

11
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:50,116
 I'm angry but I can't say anything as your superior. 

12
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,885
 It upsets you, doesn't it? 

13
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,087
 You know all too well. 

14
00:00:55,087 --> 00:00:59,690
 Okay, let's go and make you feel better! 

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:07,860


16
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,061
 Enjoy your meal. 

17
00:01:09,062 --> 00:01:11,537
 Thank you. 

18
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,743
 Oh, that's nice. 

19
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:23,721
 - What? You can't eat ox blood? 
 - No. 

20
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:24,551
 Then? 

21
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,053
 A full stomach makes me sleepy. 

22
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:32,391
 You'll deny yourself your basic needs while you work? 

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,162
 Hey! You earned a perfect score on the company's entrance exam. 

24
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:39,265
 You really don't know what's important. 

25
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:44,735
 If you keep working yourself like that, do you know what will happen to you? 

26
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:47,640
 What? 

27
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,210
 You'll become a chairman. 

28
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:52,845
 What? Isn't that a good thing? 

29
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,782
 Yeah, sure. It's great. Boss. 

30
00:01:55,782 --> 00:02:01,151
 But when you become the boss, tt also means this. 

31
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:08,461
 It means to die and be hidden. 

32
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:10,997
 To die and disappear. 

33
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:11,632
   

34
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:18,470
 You'll die and disappear from the industry before you become the boss of the company. 

35
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,906
 A person's insight. 

36
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:23,976
 A copywriter's job is to be able to read how people are feeling. 

37
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:29,345
 If that copywriter doesn't live like a normal person, could they read people's minds? 

38
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,097
 No. 

39
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:34,754
 You do ads to live, you don't live to do ads. 

40
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:36,835
 Eat for now. 

41
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:40,957
 If you keep working like that, the bill will come for sure one day. 

42
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:44,263
 What happens when the bill comes? 

43
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,501
 - I'll become the boss. 
 - That's right. 

44
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:54,640
 Still, we'll have to wait and see which interpretation will play out. 

45
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:21,402
   

46
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,874
 Excuse me? 

47
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:31,977
 Excuse me? 

48
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,785
Why are you sleeping here?

49
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,621
   

50
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,010
   

51
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:26,660
   

52
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,342
I saw her walking around in her pajamas a few times before.

53
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:47,580
She never slept on the bench before, so I didn't think much of it...

54
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,030
   

55
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,704
 However, you can't take alcohol with it! 

56
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,731
 Answer me! 

57
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,150
   

58
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,646
Why now?! Of all times...

59
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:40,590
   

60
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,720
   

61
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:43,802
   

62
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:47,514
   

63
00:06:57,006 --> 00:07:02,655
Yeah, the bill will always come around.

64
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,361
Since the bill is here...

65
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,499
I should check to see how much I owe.

66
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:28,013
I said we should get drinks tonight. What's the matter?

67
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,890
   

68
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:41,248
   

69
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:51,668
What now? Senior Director Go had dinner at the chairman's house.

70
00:07:51,668 --> 00:07:54,740
The grand chairman asked to see her, too.

71
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:58,577
You did this to yourself.

72
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,847
Who promotes their enemy?

73
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:02,982
Has this been approved?

74
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:07,053
I put it on hold for now. Hanna's going to flip when she finds out.

75
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,322
- I'll take responsibility. 
 - How?

76
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:14,293
Senior Director Hanna's going to join hands with Go Ah In.

77
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:20,129
Then won't Vice-President Kang Han Soo need one of his own inside the agency also?

78
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:22,150
I'm not sure.

79
00:08:22,924 --> 00:08:26,138
It seemed he was trying to get Go Ah In on his side.

80
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,641
We can just bring him some loot.

81
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:32,597
Loot...

82
00:08:32,597 --> 00:08:36,949
It's not bad, but we need something...

83
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,685
Oh!

84
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,294
 Please! 

85
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:56,635
 They're close. A little too close. 

86
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,205
How about that?

87
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,507
Is there something really there?

88
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,810
You never know what happens between a man and a woman.

89
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,714
They're in the same company. Shall I look into it?

90
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:12,718
What if...

91
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:15,855
What if there's something really going on between them?

92
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,024
That'll be the end of Kang Hanna.

93
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:21,226
The grand chairman would never accept that.

94
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:34,173
What?

95
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,684
Say it.

96
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,188
What?

97
00:09:48,189 --> 00:09:50,289
You're a workaholic and you didn't go to work.

98
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:53,258
Tell me why you came here so early.

99
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,931
I think I have to change my prescription.

100
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:04,869
Hey, Go Ah In! I told you! I told you not to take it with alcohol!

101
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:06,905
What are your side effects?

102
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:10,346
Did you walk around the neighborhood while you were sleeping?

103
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,648
- I should go. 
 - Where?

104
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:19,217
I need to get to work.

105
00:10:19,217 --> 00:10:22,488
You'll die like this. You could really die!

106
00:10:23,857 --> 00:10:26,492
I hate to see something happen to a patient as a doctor.

107
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:28,851
But if something happened to a friend...

108
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:31,876
Just lose! Lose to them!

109
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:35,434
Why do you keep burning the candle at both ends to win?

110
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:41,741
That's the only way I'll survive.

111
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,848
That's the only way I can survive.

112
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,723
I'm also scared.

113
00:10:58,723 --> 00:11:01,294
When I wake up...

114
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:04,964
I'm sleeping on a bench outside in my pajamas. I'm scared too!

115
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,074
I'm afraid I'll wake up at work.

116
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,384
That when I come to my senses, I'll be in the streets.

117
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:41,400
When I come to my senses, I might be on the roof of my apartment...

118
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:53,846
So, please!

119
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:02,721
Ah In, even if it's hard to be happy,

120
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:08,346
just live normally like others. Please?

121
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:13,465
Like others?

122
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:20,872
What other way is there besides this if I want to be treated like others?

123
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:25,110
Do you think I'm living like this because I want to?

124
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,747
You have to run away if you're weak.

125
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:32,051
- If I become weak... 
 - Do you think you're strong right now?

126
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:35,187
You're broken.

127
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,461
Who cares if you get promoted? You're so anxious that you can't sleep.

128
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,070
I'll change your prescription, so wait. Okay?

129
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:55,674
Okay.

130
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,950
Hey, are you insane? Where are you going?

131
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,340
The weather's nice.

132
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:35,547
The breeze is cool. It's clearing my head.

133
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,051
   

134
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,995
 I heard that you won a big presentation. 

135
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,698
 Will you be the chairman now? 

136
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:10,482
She's spacing out in the park in the middle of the week...

137
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:13,118
It doesn't suit her at all.

138
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,898
This is your favorite thing to do with your clothes on.

139
00:14:27,898 --> 00:14:30,102
Did something happen?

140
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:33,104
Work is always hard.

141
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:37,408
Rest if it's too hard.

142
00:14:37,408 --> 00:14:42,778
If work is hard, I have to ask for a raise.

143
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:48,087
How are you so good at being obnoxious?

144
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:53,713
I've got a pretty face, so I don't have to say pretty things.

145
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,331
What do you do when you're having a hard time?

146
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:04,236
I play the game I created.

147
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:07,742
Shall I try playing a game?

148
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:13,178
No. I mean, you're having a hard time because of the game you're playing at work.

149
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,580
In that case, stop trying to level up for now.

150
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,251
The best thing to do is log out for a moment.

151
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,654
What if my account gets deleted?

152
00:15:22,654 --> 00:15:26,124
Oh... In that case...

153
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:32,363
Welcome!

154
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:34,699
You can come to JH FACTORY anytime.

155
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,836
You can create a new high-level account!

156
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:39,971
I'm so reassured.

157
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:44,443
Is that for your employees?

158
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:49,814
No, I wanted to have a hearty lunch with you.

159
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:52,717
Eating a sandwich in the park on a sunny day.

160
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,687
It's like we're on a picnic. It's nice.

161
00:15:57,223 --> 00:15:59,525
I don't like picnics though.

162
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,095
You'll start liking them today.

163
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,697
You can't be on the fence about picnics.

164
00:16:05,698 --> 00:16:08,467
You have to like them! So!

165
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,338
That's why I brought a lot of sandwiches to make sure you'd love it.

166
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,113
That's nice.

167
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,683
Who? Me?

168
00:16:24,684 --> 00:16:28,053
No, the weather.

169
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:58,584
I mean, why wouldn't you eat this delicious mint?!

170
00:16:58,584 --> 00:17:03,154
How could you mix chocolate and toothpaste? They don't mix.

171
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:05,790
You have to mix different things to get synergy.

172
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,280
Your taste is tacky. Your shoes are tacky.

173
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,920
Where would you buy something like that?

174
00:17:10,928 --> 00:17:13,431
My mom bought them for me.

175
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:16,170
Oh! Your mother?

176
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,604
No wonder they looked so classic and stylish.

177
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,743
Mr. Park!

178
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:34,486
Now that I look again, it does seem like there's something between them.

179
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,558
Where are you?

180
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,365
Why did you call me?

181
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,136
Do a job for me.

182
00:17:51,137 --> 00:17:53,204
A job?

183
00:17:53,204 --> 00:17:54,539
What job?

184
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,944
It's not like I can produce results. I need some incentive.

185
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,680
Then go.

186
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,951
- What? 
 - Get out.

187
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,386
I can get someone else to do it.

188
00:18:10,203 --> 00:18:12,490
What is it?

189
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,996
It has to do with the vice-president.

190
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,398
Our company doesn't have a vice-president.

191
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:22,567
At the headquarters.

192
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,730
   

193
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,378
 Mint chocolate lovers take over the world! 

194
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:37,282
 Mint chocolate haters. Are you mad? Are you annoyed? 

195
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,521
Mint chocolate haters are the majority. Why start a fight with them?

196
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,123
All Hanna knows how to do is speak up.

197
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,492
She doesn't know how to assess the situation.

198
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,432
I bought the chocolate ice cream you asked for.

199
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,968
Which is the most popular on social media?

200
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,904
This is the most popular product with the general public.

201
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,681
I bought this from a famous and expensive ice cream shop.

202
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:05,143
Leave that here and get back to work.

203
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,570
   

204
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:22,427
This is no big deal! I just post something expensive.

205
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:26,765
It's only a matter of time before lazy bums come swarming to the comments section.

206
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,680
   

207
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,120
   

208
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:47,786
It's not like I can tap his room. How do I figure that out?

209
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:51,990
 That's why I'm saying synergy is important. 

210
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,060
 Different things need to be joined to get synergy. 

211
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,463
Once that occurs, it turns into harmony.

212
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

213
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:05,670
These days, you keep using words I've never heard you use before.

214
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,740
I'm reading books.

215
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:14,779
Synergy is nice. Harmony is nice, too.

216
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:16,634
You like it?

217
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,854
Then, do you want to go out with me?

218
00:20:22,854 --> 00:20:27,292
Two completely different things need to come together to create synergy.

219
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:32,664
Yeah, sure. Today will mark our anniversary.

220
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,862
Never mind.

221
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:39,671
Let's merge instead.

222
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,073
- Merge? 
 - Yeah.

223
00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:45,006
Marriage!

224
00:20:51,951 --> 00:20:54,386
You and me?

225
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,258
What do you know about me?

226
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,307
You're a rice soup addict.

227
00:21:02,307 --> 00:21:04,963
You wear the shoes your mom bought you.

228
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,600
You used to be a boxer, and...

229
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,604
And?

230
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,488
Well... You're good at your job.

231
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:32,924
Your appearance is okay, too.

232
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:35,894
I feel reassured when we're together.

233
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:02,954
Then let's go.

234
00:22:03,556 --> 00:22:06,024
Huh? Where?

235
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,992
To merge.

236
00:22:19,405 --> 00:22:24,109
This is a huge problem. It's impossible to figure out.

237
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,537
Gosh.

238
00:22:27,537 --> 00:22:31,015
I'd rather do the Woowon presentation all over again.

239
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,186
Maybe I should've gone to eat.

240
00:22:38,718 --> 00:22:40,659
You're here!

241
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,361
Why didn't you go out to eat?

242
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:47,232
Oh, I had some work to take care of...

243
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,767
I guess you want to become the chairman, too.

244
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,002
You work without eating.

245
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:54,472
Huh? What do you mean?

246
00:22:54,472 --> 00:22:56,507
There's a saying like that.

247
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:01,244
Thank you for this. But, Ma'am...

248
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,984
I'm only saying this because I think there's been a misunderstanding.

249
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:06,952
What misunderstanding?

250
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:10,755
I don't know where you heard this,

251
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:13,965
but I don't actually eat this much.

252
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:17,629
I would've quit my job and started an eating show if I could eat all of this.

253
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,165
- Eun Jeong? 
 - Yes?

254
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,333
Share it.

255
00:23:24,176 --> 00:23:28,106
Oh, I see...

256
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,975
I don't know if I can digest everything we just ate.

257
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:35,945
Yeah, I wasn't even that hungry, but it's not like we can't eat.

258
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:39,184
Lunch is just an excuse to come out for some fresh air.

259
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,053
Shall we exercise?

260
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:44,856
I signed up for a one-year gym membership on January 2nd.

261
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:46,591
Where was that?

262
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:48,826
It's across the street.

263
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:51,296
Ah, that's right! Yeah. We signed up together.

264
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,798
I went about five times.

265
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:56,068
You went five times? I went twice.

266
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,737
Maybe I should've skipped lunch like Eun Jeong.

267
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,439
I have some antacids in my desk. Do you want some?

268
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,109
Thanks. I have some, too.

269
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:09,685
Thanks. I have antacids, headache medicine, laxatives, cold medicine, nasal spray, and...

270
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:14,686
Everyone on the creative team at the agency has a little pharmacy in their desk drawer.

271
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:19,390
Oh! Should we buy Eun Jeong something to eat?

272
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:26,164
What did you buy?

273
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:28,666
A sandwich for Eun Jeong.

274
00:24:37,283 --> 00:24:39,677
Did you have lunch?

275
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,348
You know... It's not easy for a person to become like this.

276
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:46,017
She's a different breed from us.

277
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,952
How many did you eat?

278
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:51,289
It's just a little bread. It's appeasing my hunger.

279
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:54,992
But don't you think you're overdoing it?

280
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,061
Eat it. Senior Director Go bought it.

281
00:24:57,062 --> 00:25:01,333
- Help yourself. 
 - You eat it.

282
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,683
- Let's go. 
 - Where are we?

283
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,541
   

284
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:35,566
You wanted to get married. Let's sign the marriage license.

285
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:41,606
I'm going to be the son-in-law of VC Group. This is incredible!

286
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:44,942
Mr. Park, are you messing with me?

287
00:25:44,942 --> 00:25:48,112
No, I'm being serious.

288
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:56,087
Let's get our marriage license right now. Hurry up.

289
00:25:57,056 --> 00:26:00,358
No... Just, wait...

290
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:04,362
Miss, do you like me?

291
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:12,804
Well... I'm highly interested...

292
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:17,109
What about you? Do you like me?

293
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,244
Yes, I like you.

294
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:24,782
Everyone calls you a whacko...

295
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,783
What?

296
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:29,187
I like that about you. You're unpredictable.

297
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:33,325
You're scared of everything and you get lonely easily.

298
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:37,195
You act frantic because others might notice and that breaks my heart, too.

299
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,965
But it's strange.

300
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:46,404
Everyone keeps calling all of those traits your weaknesses.

301
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:49,574
But I feel that those are your strengths.

302
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:57,015
But you have one real flaw that covers all of that.

303
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,117
What is it?

304
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:02,200
You're a third-generation daughter of a rich conglomerate family.

305
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:08,726
You know that your future is over if you get caught with a servant. Right?

306
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:11,730
 Grandfather, what is it? 

307
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,565
 Hanna, did you buy your driver a gift? 

308
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:18,069
 Yeah, I bought it because it's his birthday. 

309
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,971
 Leave that here. 

310
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,506
 Huh? Why? 

311
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:23,574
 Affections will grow if you give gifts. 

312
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,443
 Isn't that a good thing? 

313
00:27:25,444 --> 00:27:30,148
 Affections lead to friendships, and then he'll want to be your equal. 

314
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:34,185
 When they think they're equals, they're the type to run at us with spears. 

315
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,921
 Those are servants. 

316
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:39,056
 Why would you give affection to servants? 

317
00:27:39,056 --> 00:27:41,492
 Give them money that has no feelings. 

318
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:45,396
 It wasn't that expensive... 

319
00:27:45,396 --> 00:27:47,698
 Did you not understand what I said?! 

320
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,102
 Okay. 

321
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,808
 Also! 

322
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:00,878
 Get a new driver! 

323
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:07,151
I can talk to my grandfather about that...

324
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:12,020
At that time, I'll be a servant that has relations with you and I'll be kicked out.

325
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,261
There is no synergy if we mix. We're poisonous to one another.

326
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:26,704
Mints should be with other mints. Chocolates should be with other chocolates.

327
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,370
   

328
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,086
Let's go if you're not going to sign the papers.

329
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:56,134
Do you really like me?

330
00:28:56,134 --> 00:29:01,105
Is my background really my biggest flaw to you?

331
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,008
Yes.

332
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:12,116
Then, that's okay.

333
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,621
I can take care of the rest.

334
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,357
Don't do it.

335
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,325
What does it matter to you?

336
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:26,597
Miss, do you know why they teach us at school that all jobs are equal?

337
00:29:26,597 --> 00:29:29,599
Because all jobs aren't equal.

338
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,603
That's why they teach us that they are.

339
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:36,107
Jobs, people, our ranks. There is no equality.

340
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,910
Even if society may look equal on the outside.

341
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,179
Society today isn't like that...

342
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,449
Don't try to fight with society.

343
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,996
If you want to gain something big,

344
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:50,755
you have to give up the small things.

345
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:57,908
If I can't even like who I please,

346
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,965
what's the point of having my status?!

347
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:04,135
It's one person. You can't like that one person.

348
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:08,306
Other than that, you can do whatever you please.

349
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,070
   

350
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,388
Are you coming?

351
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,950
It was true?

352
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:11,836
Senior Director Kang Hanna was enjoying her work life very much.

353
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,376
Our country's low birth rate is serious.

354
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:22,946
How can I separate such a young and passionate couple?

355
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:27,752
I should actively help.

356
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,658
How could this help us?

357
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,660
How did this help us? Well?

358
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:41,967
No, it's just... A CEO who communicates with the public is trendy these days.

359
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:47,205
They're arguing that this is misandry, and that this is misogyny.

360
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:51,189
It's all the rage on social media, I didn't know it was sexist...

361
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:54,012
Are you saying you posted it without knowing what it meant?

362
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:55,713
I apologize.

363
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,183
I felt reassured because I thought Hanna was getting her act together.

364
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:02,319
Why are you suddenly acting up more than her?

365
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,222
What happened with the news articles?

366
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,824
For now, I made sure they took down the articles from the social media post.

367
00:32:06,825 --> 00:32:10,394
But it's difficult to take care of the articles posted online.

368
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:15,399
We spend billions on trying to maintain the company's image.

369
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,736
All that money was wasted over this!

370
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,279
If they try to boycott us...

371
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:23,073
I'll maintain it to make sure it doesn't get that far.

372
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:26,310
The vice-president seat is yours if you just sit there, why would you ruin it?

373
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,913
- Father, it's just... 
 - Get out!

374
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:42,160
   

375
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:47,465
Already? Is something there?

376
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,134
Shall I request a meeting empty-handed?

377
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,502
Send it to me first.

378
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,222
I can't do that.

379
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:58,162
I should show it to the vice-president first.

380
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,059
Don't worry.

381
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:07,886
It's not a disadvantage to you.

382
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:11,489
The timing is perfect.

383
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:15,292
Hang up for now.

384
00:33:16,695 --> 00:33:21,528
That sly fox, he got lucky.

385
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:34,712
I swear... Kids these days are scary.

386
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:39,617
I don't know what they're talking about, but they're going on about discrimination.

387
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:43,254
Still, I think it's a good choice that you started social media.

388
00:33:46,124 --> 00:33:48,792
You want me to keep doing it after what happened?

389
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:52,463
Yes, it used to be popular for a chairman to live a seclusive life.

390
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,900
Isn't it more popular for a chairman to communicate with the public now?

391
00:33:55,901 --> 00:33:59,170
How can I when I feel like I'm walking through a minefield?

392
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:04,642
That's why I want to introduce you to someone who can detect mines.

393
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:08,913
Isn't this what advertisers specialize in?

394
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,715
Shouldn't you have someone on your side at the agency?

395
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,685
Wouldn't that be of help to you?

396
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,923
Who? Are you talking about Senior Director Go?

397
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:23,527
No, her competitor.

398
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,069
This is the new personnel appointment that Senior Director Hanna requested.

399
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:37,141
He's not on good terms with them, so you can trust him.

400
00:34:37,141 --> 00:34:42,613
Also, there's something he needs to show you.

401
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:46,284
- What is it? 
 - You should meet him yourself.

402
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,328
   

403
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:05,102
How long has it been since we left work on time?

404
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,864
This is when we should be getting off.

405
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:09,473
I totally agree!

406
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:14,712
True... We've been a slave to ads for so long!

407
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:23,651
- Aren't you going? 
 - After I show this to the senior director.

408
00:35:23,651 --> 00:35:29,359
That's why you're the right-hand man! This is how you succeed in the group!

409
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:32,596
This right hand will leave as soon as it shows her this.

410
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:36,267
As the senior director's nose hairs, I'm off.

411
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:37,601
The eyebrows will make her leave as well.

412
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:38,770
These nails are out as well.

413
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:41,819
What's with you? Be gone, internal organs.

414
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,375
- Yes, sir. 
 - Yes, sir.

415
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,645
- I want to be the heart. 
 - I'll be the lungs.

416
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,193
If that's the case...  You, you're the prostate.

417
00:35:50,193 --> 00:35:51,903
She doesn't have a prostate!

418
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:55,586
That's why you're the prostate. It's like you don't exist to her.

419
00:35:55,586 --> 00:35:57,021
 Come on! What are you talking about? 

420
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,924
 Who do you think makes our team look this good? 

421
00:36:14,493 --> 00:36:15,873
Aren't you going home?

422
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:18,409
I have some things to think over.

423
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:27,651
It's a list of new advertisers and film projects.

424
00:36:27,651 --> 00:36:33,320
- With no presentation? 
 - No, they're Woowon Group's quantity and recommendations from the CEO.

425
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,660
- Okay. 
 - I think we'll be able to fill about 60 to 70% if we do this.

426
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,733
Which is above a 50% sales increase.

427
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:45,536
That's good.

428
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,274
By chance, are you not feeling well?

429
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,144
It's just...

430
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:58,482
- Am I working too hard? 
 - What?

431
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:04,422
As you said, maybe I'm causing trouble when I can't even handle everything.

432
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,564
What?

433
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,599
This is a first.

434
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,737
Seeing you hesitate in front of your work like this.

435
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,707
Do I not look human to you?

436
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:25,089
Do you remember?

437
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:28,246
When I told you I couldn't keep working at an agency because I was too tired.

438
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,481
Do you remember what you said to me?

439
00:37:33,652 --> 00:37:38,589
 I don't think I can keep working at an agency. It's too hard. 

440
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,827
 - Is your family rich? 
 - What? 

441
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:48,132
 - Nope. 
 - Then are you a fool? 

442
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,335
 You get paid because it's hard. 

443
00:37:51,336 --> 00:37:54,972
 Do you think you'd get paid to work if it was comfortable and fun? 

444
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,675
 You'd have to pay like you would at an amusement park. 

445
00:37:58,675 --> 00:38:02,911
 Ask them for a raise if the work is hard. Why would you say you'd want to quit?! 

446
00:38:02,911 --> 00:38:07,518
 Then... is it hard for you. too? 

447
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:12,056
 Do I not look human to you? 

448
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:19,764
That gave me a lot of strength.

449
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,430
"Ah, so Go Ah In is also having a hard time.

450
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:27,030
Then, of course, I should too."

451
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:32,476
"If that's the case... I should keep working."

452
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,947
What a silly thing to give you strength.

453
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,461
What's this?

454
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:56,433
I thought you were having a hard time, so I'm going to raise your salary.

455
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,500
   

456
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:02,006
Do you want to take a few days off before we start?

457
00:39:03,374 --> 00:39:09,046
No, let's start. If I rest now, I may end up resting forever.

458
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:14,151
Rest today and let's start tomorrow.

459
00:39:16,014 --> 00:39:22,326
Okay. I should work since I got a raise.

460
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:24,328
I'll get it ready.

461
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:38,575
I don't want to answer this call today...

462
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:23,353
Miss, let's go.

463
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,329
- No! 
 - Excuse me?

464
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:36,567
I'm going to leave on my own. You can go.

465
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:14,605
You look like you have no energy after that presentation win.

466
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:17,007
I could say the same for you.

467
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,782
Why are you leaving alone? Where's your shadow?

468
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:28,419
We're in the middle of action and reaction.

469
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,460
Do you want to get a drink with me?

470
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:39,797
Just the two of us?

471
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:42,299
The shadow doesn't drink.

472
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,221
Next time.

473
00:41:46,222 --> 00:41:48,475
I have plans tonight.

474
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:23,006
Are you two going somewhere together?

475
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:29,179
True, I guess it wouldn't be strange for two winners to come together.

476
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,552
People would think that you won the presentation.

477
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:39,390
Oh, I'm the type to forget about past issues.

478
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:46,664
I've been given a bigger project than the Woowon presentation.

479
00:42:46,664 --> 00:42:50,934
A project? I doubt that...

480
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:53,704
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

481
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,643
That's what I want to say to you.

482
00:42:59,644 --> 00:43:04,615
I think you're mistaken.

483
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:09,419
Is that so? Why don't you tell me now?

484
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,956
I'm the type who loses sleep over things I'm curious about.

485
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,461
You'll know in due time.

486
00:43:17,462 --> 00:43:22,499
What's the point of losing sleep over knowing in advance?

487
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:37,915
Now that I see it, you two look good together.

488
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,785
See you tomorrow.

489
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:10,450
   

490
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:12,910
   

491
00:44:57,228 --> 00:45:00,431
   

492
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,761
Um... Excuse me?

493
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,877
Do you have any work?

494
00:45:13,878 --> 00:45:16,179
Yes, take a seat.

495
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:23,653
What type of work do you do?

496
00:45:23,654 --> 00:45:25,522
I work at a restaurant right now.

497
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:30,560
A restaurant? The kitchen? Serving? What did you do before?

498
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,398
Is there a job for me at the ad agency up the street?

499
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:41,803
We are in charge of that area too, but there's no cafeteria there, so there are only cleaning jobs.

500
00:45:41,803 --> 00:45:45,375
You won't get paid as much as you do working at a restaurant.

501
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:49,780
That's okay. As long as it's at the ad agency, I'll do any job.

502
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:54,117
If you don't mind.

503
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:06,497
Yeah, I'm almost there.

504
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,732
I don't think I can go.

505
00:46:08,733 --> 00:46:10,000
You can't?

506
00:46:10,001 --> 00:46:12,503
Being there is too much of a burden for me.

507
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,705
If I go there, I'll be saying that I'm on Kang Han Soo's side.

508
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:19,609
That's true. What kind of person is he?

509
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,344
The opposite of Kang Hanna.

510
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:28,918
He's the model student when it comes to logic, reasoning, figures, and data.

511
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,188
He could be easier to deal with.

512
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:37,060
I don't know. Sometimes he's easy and other times he's frustrating...

513
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:38,662
He has his pros and cons.

514
00:46:38,663 --> 00:46:42,598
 Good luck. He's your only lifeline. 

515
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:46,036
It's nice to be behind someone completely.

516
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:47,404
What are you talking about?

517
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:52,943
 It seemed as if Senior Director Kang and Senior Director Go had plans together. 

518
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:53,978
Really?

519
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:57,227
Go Ah In is good at her job, but she never could figure things out.

520
00:46:57,228 --> 00:47:02,252
She doesn't know which line will save her and which line is rotten.

521
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:09,326
Have a good meeting. Share the loot with me, too.

522
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,529
Of course. I'm hanging up now.

523
00:47:42,627 --> 00:47:43,761
Hello, it's been a while.

524
00:47:43,761 --> 00:47:46,963
I'm Choi Chang Soo, the chief project officer of VC Communications.

525
00:47:57,408 --> 00:48:00,344
What are you doing here, Senior Director Go?

526
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:02,712
I asked her to join us.

527
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:06,783
You weren't acting like yourself, Senior Director Choi.

528
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:10,221
I wondered what you were so happy about.

529
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:13,056
Now I know why.

530
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:25,902
First, what did you want to show me today?

531
00:48:28,439 --> 00:48:32,542
I think it might be uncomfortable with Senior Director Go here.

532
00:48:32,543 --> 00:48:35,945
- You said it had to do with Hanna. 
 - That's right.

533
00:48:35,945 --> 00:48:40,014
Then, why would she be uncomfortable? We should see it together. Right?

534
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:48,759
One of my employees took this photo by chance as he was passing by.

535
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:03,707
A bad hunch is never wrong.

536
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,409
Or maybe not?

537
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,515
Is it a good hunch?

538
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,977
- You're here? 
 - Yeah.

539
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:49,920
You're all grown up now. Look at you drinking.

540
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,876
This is nothing.

541
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:55,458
I've been drinking for a while now...

542
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,330
Of course, I know. Drinking is in your genes.

543
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:02,737
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

544
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:09,906
You drank just enough to tell me what's on your mind.

545
00:50:09,906 --> 00:50:13,344
It's strange. I'm so angry...

546
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,912
I'm so angry that it's driving me crazy.

547
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,980
But I don't know who I'm mad at.

548
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,850
What is this?

549
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,360
I don't see Mr. Park.

550
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:34,731
Ugh, come on! Don't beat around the bush!

551
00:50:34,735 --> 00:50:39,202
True, you've never once had to ask anyone for a favor.

552
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:42,005
You grew up without lacking anything.

553
00:50:45,676 --> 00:50:48,077
You're feeling shame.

554
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:53,484
It's not that you don't know, you just wish you didn't know.

555
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:55,652
That's not true! My grandfather is wrong!

556
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:58,288
Then wait until the grand chairman passes away.

557
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:01,225
That feels so...

558
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:04,628
Hanna, don't you think you're being conscious of society too?

559
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,632
Change it if you don't like it.

560
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,699
What?

561
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,669
Change yourself or change society.

562
00:51:13,669 --> 00:51:17,207
Normally, people change themselves though.

563
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:40,863
Will things be different if I change?

564
00:51:42,166 --> 00:51:44,501
Responsibility is fifty-fifty.

565
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:50,273
I'm off.

566
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:08,391
I don't know if these are good times or bad times for her.

567
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,950
   

568
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:31,627
Don't go to our destination right now. Can you take the long way and go slow?

569
00:52:31,627 --> 00:52:33,082
Excuse me?

570
00:52:34,552 --> 00:52:38,688
I'm just feeling frustrated and need the air.

571
00:52:38,688 --> 00:52:41,091
Yes, Miss.

572
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:50,860
♫  They say people don't change  ♫

573
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:57,380
♫  We changed at last  ♫

574
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,516
♫  People are not going anywhere  ♫

575
00:53:02,516 --> 00:53:04,948
What a stalker.

576
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,360
♫  I'm finally here  ♫

577
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:18,000
♫  You laugh and talk so well  ♫

578
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:24,033
Sir, can you just go to our destination as soon as possible now?

579
00:53:24,033 --> 00:53:26,636
Do you feel better now?

580
00:53:27,504 --> 00:53:30,773
No, I'm still feeling frustrated...

581
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,642
But you should get off work.

582
00:53:34,642 --> 00:53:36,446
It's late enough as it is.

583
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:38,620
♫  My own Neverland  ♫

584
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:44,000
♫  Saying no one understands what you're saying  ♫

585
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,250
♫  I want to become an adult  ♫

586
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,360
♫  My own Neverland  ♫

587
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,670
   

588
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,720
   

589
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:59,829
Just by looking at this situation, I should abandon Kang Hanna too.

590
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:04,066
 I'll cancel the new personnel appointment that Hanna requested. 

591
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,615
 Thank you. 

592
00:55:07,411 --> 00:55:10,940
 Also, if you send me everything you want to post on social media to me, 

593
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:15,145
 I'll make sure to weed out all the posts that could cause problems. 

594
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,708
 Sure. 

595
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:18,948
 If I want to get through the minefield... 

596
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:23,553
 I figured I'd need at least one person to detect the mines. 

597
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,464
 - Also... 
 - You may go. 

598
00:55:34,464 --> 00:55:35,299
 Excuse me? 

599
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,568
 I have to speak with her privately. 

600
00:55:40,537 --> 00:55:43,639
 Oh, I see... 

601
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,180
 Sir, until the next time we meet. 

602
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:57,420
 I'm sure I don't need to say more. 

603
00:55:57,421 --> 00:56:00,056
 Did you understand the situation? 

604
00:56:00,057 --> 00:56:04,327
 This story is so cliché that I understood it immediately. 

605
00:56:04,328 --> 00:56:07,730
 Can I take that as a positive answer? 

606
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:22,678
I can see the benefits if I join hands with him but my heart's not in it...

607
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:42,223
I can't drink.

608
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:46,936
I don't think I can sleep either...

609
00:56:55,546 --> 00:56:59,916
Let's prepare when Go Ah In has her guard down.

610
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:03,786
Do it quietly when she's on cloud nine.

611
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:08,191
Was your transfer to the Busan branch canceled?

612
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,225
Yeah.

613
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:10,359
What are you going to do now?

614
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:14,463
I have a plan. Depending on Plan A, I have Plan B and C too.

615
00:57:14,464 --> 00:57:18,768
That's a lot. Just pick one good one.

616
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,569
I need some insurance, too.

617
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:26,475
Still, Plan A is trying to gain Vice-President Kang Han Soo's favor.

618
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:32,848
True, if you do that, nothing else will matter.

619
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:35,618
I'll just prepare Plan B and Plan C.

620
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,521
What are they? Let's hear them first.

621
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:42,557
They're still in the planning stages. I'll tell you when they're ready. I need your help, too.

622
00:57:42,557 --> 00:57:47,964
Hey, it's not easy trying to make my friend the CEO of a subsidiary company.

623
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,745
I need your cooperation.

624
00:57:49,745 --> 00:57:51,734
Your friend needs to have a tight hold on the subsidiary company.

625
00:57:51,735 --> 00:57:56,672
That way you'll have a bigger voice at work.

626
00:57:58,876 --> 00:58:01,110
Let's drink.

627
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:23,532
Change yourself or change society.

628
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,469
I can feel it...

629
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:29,973
 Normally, people change themselves though. 

630
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:34,403
I'm starting to feel it.

631
00:58:34,403 --> 00:58:37,079
I know what I have to do.

632
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:14,283
Don't try to change. I won't change either.

633
00:59:16,355 --> 00:59:21,057
Wait and see. I'll show you who I am exactly.

634
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:24,366
Why would I have to change?!

635
00:59:24,366 --> 00:59:27,267
Society has to change!

636
00:59:30,267 --> 00:59:32,301
I'm different.

637
00:59:38,942 --> 00:59:40,536
 I'm different! 

638
00:59:40,537 --> 00:59:42,479
Oh, that scared me.

639
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:46,849
I thought she was becoming more mature. What's wrong with her?

640
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,285
Excuse me?

641
00:59:48,286 --> 00:59:50,419
Did something happen to her yesterday?

642
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,155
Did she meet Seo Jeong or something?

643
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:58,961
No, no. Something doesn't need to happen for her to act that way.

644
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:03,566
Oh, my. Who would ever marry her with that temper of hers?

645
01:00:03,567 --> 01:00:07,403
I'm sure he's out there. Every shoe comes in a pair.

646
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,905
Mr. Park, have you had breakfast?

647
01:00:10,807 --> 01:00:11,974
Yes, I did.

648
01:00:11,975 --> 01:00:15,942
Do you eat at your place or do you come here and eat?

649
01:00:15,942 --> 01:00:17,746
It depends on the situation.

650
01:00:17,747 --> 01:00:20,216
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

651
01:00:20,751 --> 01:00:25,755
Wouldn't it be nice if Mr. Park joined us for breakfast every morning?

652
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,690
Together?

653
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,626
We see him every day. He's like family.

654
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:33,529
We shouldn't make him eat separate from us, right?

655
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,198
Wouldn't you be uncomfortable?

656
01:00:35,198 --> 01:00:38,167
I'm fine. I'll do as I usually do.

657
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:42,338
Without change. Like I do now.

658
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:47,176
Well, if that's more comfortable for you.

659
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:52,515
It's best for a person to do what they want.

660
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:10,860
He's like family.

661
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,371
It's impossible...

662
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:23,946
He wants to bring Mr. Park in?

663
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:29,051
Guilty. There are no rules in fighting.

664
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,988
This is the first time Han Soo isn't like his father.

665
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,658
He treats work like work.

666
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,863
I should add wood to the fire while it's hot.

667
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,900
It's the way to keep it going strong and prevent it from dying out.

668
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:51,974
Send me a phone number.

669
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:23,639
This could be the most stressful situation that I've ever been in.

670
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,544
But I've never avoided it before.

671
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:39,585
I taught you something. You should teach me something in return.

672
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,527
- Is there something I could teach you? 
 - There is.

673
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:48,697
What is it?

674
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:57,573
Who's hand will you hold? Kang Han Soo or Kang Hanna?

675
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:15,800


676
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:24,667
   

677
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:32,660
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

678
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:39,160
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

679
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:44,790
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

680
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:48,940
♫  So I will make my road  ♫

681
01:03:48,947 --> 01:03:51,460
 Your parents are still alive. 

682
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,896
 This gives me so much motivation. 

683
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:57,099
 Find out what your opponent wants and focus on that one thing. 

684
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,268
 I called you to waste some of your life with me... 

685
01:03:59,269 --> 01:04:02,037
 Is Senior Director Kang Hanna the standard? 

686
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:05,200
 - Hanna and Mr. Park's relationship needs to be a sure thing.  
  - I'm sorry. 

687
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:08,444
 There is absolutely no chance of Hanna becoming the next vice-president. 

688
01:04:08,445 --> 01:04:11,213
 You joined hands with Kang Han Soo to screw me over? 

689
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:14,783
 This means that I've become Kang Hanna's weakness... 

690
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,585
 A friend or foe is hard to distinguish. 

691
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:20,022
 I could become the public enemy... 

692
01:04:20,624 --> 01:04:24,193
 What do I gain from this choice? 

693
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:32,960
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
