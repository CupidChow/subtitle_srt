 Let's ask Ah In to join in. 

8
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:44,745
 Leave her. She's full of herself because she's the top student. 

9
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:50,416
 She doesn't pay a cent to come to school, and she comes on a field trip... 

10
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:55,721
 She acts like a queen. A queen. 

11
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:57,681
 - But let's just all... 
 - Don't bother. 

12
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,394
 She'll only get mad if you interrupt her studies. 

13
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:05,200
 Dirt poor and full of herself. 

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,480
 Makes me sick. 

15
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:18,144
 Roses of Sharon have bloomed. 

16
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,714
 You! Hurry, hurry! 

17
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,985
 Roses of Sharon have bloomed. 

18
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,536
 Ah In. 

19
00:01:32,044 --> 00:01:33,830
 Want to eat together? 

20
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:45,839
 Do you want to eat this? Do you think we can share? 

21
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:50,341
 If you eat with me, it just means that I'll be eating your lunch. 

22
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,812
 No. I like fish cakes. 

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,936
 Why? Do you feel better about yourself when you help out a poor person? 

24
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,021
 - I just want to be your friend... 
 - Go. 

25
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:07,127
 - Charity food makes me sick. 
 - I didn't mean it that way. 

26
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,096
 I don't want to add yours to the list. 

27
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:20,206
 Hey, Go Ah In. 

28
00:02:20,206 --> 00:02:24,077
 Aren't you lonely? Don't you need friends? 

29
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,598
 But if we get close, 

30
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:48,432
 you might come to not like me. 

31
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,806
 You might leave me one day. 

32
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,776
 Won't I become too anxious about those fears? 

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,700
   

34
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,418
   

35
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:15,760
- I'll get going. 
 - If you keep fooling around,

36
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,065
I can't guarantee you a position a year from now!

37
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,772
Is that the only card you have?

38
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,673
- You little! 
 - Sir!

39
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,813
When a rainstorm blows, you find out

40
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,882
the difference between a flower that grew delicately in a greenhouse

41
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,418
and a wildflower that grew on the street.

42
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,954
- What? 
 - Wait for it.

43
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:47,593
I'll blow a rainstorm into your delicate mind.

44
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,880
   

45
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:10,215
 Breaking news. 

46
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,385
 The Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office Special Team 1 

47
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,053
 has arrested Chairman Kim Woo Won of Woowon Group 

48
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,090
 for violation of the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. 

49
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,558
 Currently, the Seoul Central District Court 

50
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,328
 is reviewing habeas corpus for Chairman Kim. 

51
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:25,230
 Prosecutors have found evidence that Woowon Group pocketed a considerable amount of funds overseas 

52
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,368
 under the guise of the company's remittance. 

53
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:31,728
 The channel for the remittance is... 

54
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,984
If the chairman is arrested, all ads will be stopped...

55
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:52,225
 Do you admit to making slush funds worth hundreds of billions of won? 

56
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:55,188
Do you have a secret account in the Cayman Islands?

57
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:59,697
They say you generated the funds by raising unit prices for affiliates. Is that true?

58
00:04:59,697 --> 00:05:04,770
My human rights have been violated today.

59
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,008
Hold up.

60
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,010
You can't stop him from talking.

61
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:14,147
Are you trying to violate human rights?

62
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:17,416
In the middle of a family meal, in front of my family,

63
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,719
I was dragged away.

64
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:21,687
Do you plead guilty to the charges?

65
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,055
Do you have anything else to say?

66
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,359
Do you admit to giving orders to evade taxes?

67
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:28,461
 Charges for rigging the unit prices and incurring losses for the company... 

68
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:31,498
Isn't there one smart person at that company?

69
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:35,365
They need to shut up, not cause a commotion!

70
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,106
I'll resign.

71
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:45,708
 I'll bet on boosting revenue by 50% within 6 months. If I fail to deliver, I'll take responsibility and step down. 

72
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:52,485
How do I patch this up?

73
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:58,024
It's going to be hard to boost revenue by 50%.

74
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,498
I'm almost there.

75
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:28,354
Your one positive trait among all the negative ones.

76
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:31,725
Your punctuality. But you are 30 minutes late!

77
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:35,061
Sorry. Something came up.

78
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:43,436
Still not eating properly or sleeping properly,

79
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:47,681
and you're probably drinking as you shouldn't be.

80
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:50,679
A person doesn't change easily.

81
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:53,821
A man? Are you seeing anyone?

82
00:06:53,822 --> 00:06:55,381
I don't have time for that.

83
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,417
You have to make time for that.

84
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,085
- You are not a cultural heritage. 
 - What's that supposed to mean?

85
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:04,622
"Don't come close, don't touch, stand behind the line and look."

86
00:07:04,622 --> 00:07:06,259
Loosen up!

87
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,930
Use it. Use that loveless body of yours.

88
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:12,499
Don't give me this sudden counseling.

89
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,968
It's because your doses are spiking.

90
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,709
I told you this is not a regular medication.

91
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,445
You think I'm talking crap?

92
00:07:26,747 --> 00:07:27,914
I'll take care of myself.

93
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:30,783
You can't and that's why you're like this.

94
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:36,689
There's only one way. Get to the root of the problem.

95
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,278
Don't talk about working less.

96
00:07:38,278 --> 00:07:40,994
No, that's not it.

97
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,463
Then what?

98
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:46,699
Forgive.

99
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:49,836
Who?

100
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,978
That woman?

101
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:16,795
It's costly, but what can I do?

102
00:08:16,795 --> 00:08:18,486
   

103
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:21,735
   

104
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:25,705
 I have to stake everything on work. 

105
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,269
 I've exchanged friends and love for ads. 

106
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:33,080
Now I can see her whenever I want to.

107
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,915
 Of course, even without all this, I can still make ads at a company and get paid. 

108
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:41,854
 However, I wouldn't be able to become the best in the industry. 

109
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,270
Forgive that woman who left her 7-year-old daughter?

110
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,771
The woman who told me to wait and that she'd be back soon,

111
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,741
and hasn't contacted me since, whether she's dead or alive.

112
00:09:03,444 --> 00:09:05,178
No.

113
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,115
Yourself.

114
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:17,156
That person inside you, crouching alone behind a shut door.

115
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,361
That person inside you who is so wrapped up in a complex

116
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:27,166
that she locks herself up like a hurt teenager

117
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,203
so that she doesn't get hurt if she opens up.

118
00:09:29,203 --> 00:09:35,538
The one that doesn't let anyone get close, but fears that people will leave her or forget her,

119
00:09:35,538 --> 00:09:37,996
so she clings to work and studying.

120
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,588
- Forgive her. 
 - Shut up!

121
00:09:48,622 --> 00:09:50,523
You've just crossed the line!

122
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,927
That's the only way you can be free from this.

123
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:58,564
Forgive. For yourself.

124
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,557
If you act like this, I won't come here anymore.

125
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:25,225
Don't come.

126
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:31,897
For real. I'm never coming back. I'll never see you again!

127
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:37,907
Don't come. I have enough patients in this crazy world.

128
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,583
So that hardboiled girl cries at times.

129
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:57,323
It's easier to forgive as you get older and weaker.

130
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,399
Forgive?

131
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:10,803
What's left for me if I forgive everything?

132
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,119
Song Ah Ji!

133
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:33,326
Mom's bought pizza. With an extra meat topping!

134
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:40,032
I told him you were buying pizza, but he said he wanted rice.

135
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:45,738
Why? Were you hungry?

136
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,380
Wow!

137
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:57,149
Look! Wow, doesn't it look delicious? Look at the meat.

138
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,520
I don't want it.

139
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:07,728
Look. This is your favorite sausage pizza.

140
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:10,830
- Looks delicious, right? 
 - I don't want it!

141
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:15,168
Ah Ji, don't ever do that with your food!

142
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,137
No. I don't want it.

143
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,406
You have to go to work to buy me pizza.

144
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:22,776
I'm just going to have rice from now on!

145
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,479
Ah Ji, that's no way to speak to your mom.

146
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,081
She's not my mom!

147
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12,967
Why did you come? You thief!

148
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:16,095
- How many bottles did she have? 
 - Five.

149
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:20,333
Is she doing a mukbang? She ate a lot of sides as well.

150
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,837
Why did you come? You thief!

151
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:27,908
You called me. Why am I a thief?

152
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,477
- You stole it! 
 - What?

153
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,614
My dream since I was in elementary school.

154
00:13:33,614 --> 00:13:37,917
My brilliant future, my great plans.

155
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,522
You said you'd take care of it.

156
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:45,192
- That you'd raise him if I had a child. 
 - Stop it! Are you mad?

157
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:50,600
It was because of you that I got married early and had a child!

158
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,446
Frankly, we did raise him alone.

159
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,172
Me and my mom...

160
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:03,544
Yes, I agree.

161
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:06,947
Do you think I want to make you quit work?

162
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:10,683
Who doesn't like a competent wife who makes big bucks?

163
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:23,229
You think people in this industry just want to write copies?

164
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:28,763
We're all hanging in there to become a CD one day!

165
00:14:28,763 --> 00:14:31,099
The situation...

166
00:14:31,099 --> 00:14:33,273
It's so frustrating!

167
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,491
 Family must be more important. Right? 

168
00:14:50,491 --> 00:14:52,191
 Right. 

169
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:59,539
Pizza... Yummy... Don't want it!

170
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:13,079
We work to live happily with our family.

171
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,417
Who lives to work?

172
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:18,452
I know someone like that.

173
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:20,888
No one's like that.

174
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:26,126
At our company. She's probably still working.

175
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:30,589
I keep stumbling backward,

176
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,097
but she's running ahead right in front of me,

177
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,006
doing what I've dreamed of...

178
00:15:52,746 --> 00:15:56,222
This is rough! Get me something soft!

179
00:16:09,503 --> 00:16:11,737
It sucks!

180
00:16:28,222 --> 00:16:30,189
Dad, good morning!

181
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:36,730
Why? What are you looking for?

182
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:39,232
Where's your phone?

183
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:43,903
Turn it off, now.

184
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:52,678
Why can't I be safe in my own house?

185
00:16:53,547 --> 00:16:57,518
Don't worry. I never do the same thing twice.

186
00:16:57,518 --> 00:16:59,019
I start work tomorrow.

187
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:03,524
Don't cause trouble or do anything at work.

188
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,494
No. I'm going to work super hard.

189
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,264
I'm not sending you there to work.

190
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:11,698
Then, why are you sending me there?

191
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,934
Because a grown-up daughter needs a profession.

192
00:17:22,643 --> 00:17:24,804
I'll take care of it.

193
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:27,046
I'm off. I'm a little busy.

194
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,284
Kang Hanna!

195
00:17:30,284 --> 00:17:33,020
Why are you busy? Just be idle. Okay?

196
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,455
No! I'm going to be busy.

197
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:44,497
What are Woowon Group's servants doing, letting the chairman get arrested?

198
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:48,234
- Chief Secretary? 
 - Yes.

199
00:17:50,104 --> 00:17:53,841
Does he retain his voting right if he receives a sentence?

200
00:17:53,841 --> 00:17:58,312
If it's a breach of trust and embezzlement... I'll check.

201
00:17:58,312 --> 00:18:01,280
Father, isn't there a way?

202
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,250
There is.

203
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,953
Could you tell...

204
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,654
How should I know?

205
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,720
Why do you give wages?

206
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,367
Pardon?

207
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:16,230
Why have you gathered all these smart people?

208
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:19,900
Call them and tell them to find a way.

209
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,102
I will look into it.

210
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:26,137
If those side servants aren't smart enough, at least you should be racking your big head.

211
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,775
I'll find a way.

212
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:29,475
Do it now!

213
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:39,853
Yong Ho.

214
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:41,321
Yes, Father.

215
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:44,758
Does worrying make your worries go away?

216
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,410
Why does the chairman worry?

217
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,162
You should make them worry.

218
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:53,067
Give all your worries to the servants you pay.

219
00:18:53,067 --> 00:18:55,935
Yes. Have you eaten?

220
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,140
The slave will skip breakfast.

221
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,377
Will you be okay? You drank a lot yesterday.

222
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:07,447
A wage slave is more scared of being late than being hungry.

223
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:22,428
Hold up!

224
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:28,768
Turn around. Now!

225
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,719
What's this?

226
00:19:45,719 --> 00:19:48,522
You can read Korean, can't you? Read it aloud.

227
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:53,794
"Please accept Deputy Section Head Jo Eun Jeong's resignation

228
00:19:53,794 --> 00:19:56,529
due to personal circumstances."

229
00:19:58,132 --> 00:20:00,133
A letter of resignation?

230
00:20:01,235 --> 00:20:04,951
Mom's no longer a wage slave. I'm going to quit.

231
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:06,239
- Really? 
 - Yeah!

232
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,540
- For real? 
 - Yes!

233
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:12,145
My mom's unemployed! She'll stay at home!

234
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:15,615
I'll tell everyone. I'm so happy!

235
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:19,385
Are you all right with this?

236
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,991
Well, I'll do freelance copywriting until Ah Ji starts school,

237
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:27,194
and then maybe go back to work...

238
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:29,129
If only it will work out like that...

239
00:20:29,129 --> 00:20:33,333
My mom will stay at home. Stay at home forever!

240
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:35,268
Ah Ji, calm down.

241
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:40,907
I can't. I'm so happy. I'm excited!

242
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:53,954
   

243
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:57,857
My life is so tough... so tough...

244
00:21:12,806 --> 00:21:16,209
You should have at least warned us!

245
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,278
Who asked you to stop Senior Director Go?

246
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,315
You think we will let this one pass?

247
00:21:21,315 --> 00:21:24,418
All we have to do is hang on for 6 months.

248
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,987
We have to chase her out before then.

249
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:29,188
You think there's no way?

250
00:21:29,189 --> 00:21:33,059
Wait. What do you mean 6 months?

251
00:21:38,198 --> 00:21:41,746
Did you say that you'll quit if you can't increase revenue by 50% within 6 months?

252
00:21:41,782 --> 00:21:43,237
Yes.

253
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:46,305
You were counting on Woowon Group's ads, weren't you?

254
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,642
Since their projects amount to more than 200 billion won per year.

255
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:49,676
Yes.

256
00:21:49,676 --> 00:21:51,278
Have you seen the news by chance?

257
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:52,979
Yes.

258
00:21:54,515 --> 00:21:55,883
What are you going to do?

259
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:58,986
First, try to increase the workload with existing clients.

260
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:03,721
That aside, send me a list of people to promote as department heads.

261
00:22:03,721 --> 00:22:06,459
I have to draw up a list of CDs.

262
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:07,728
Already?

263
00:22:07,728 --> 00:22:10,431
That way, I can control them internally.

264
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:12,832
What do you mean?

265
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,267
If I tell you to redo the copy, you just do it.

266
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:22,576
Don't ask! Okay?

267
00:22:22,576 --> 00:22:24,076
You're not a CD anymore.

268
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,879
Why do I need your confirmation for my copy?

269
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,848
What?

270
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:31,955
You may have worked here longer, but art is art and a copy is a copy. Am I wrong?

271
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,715
Can't you see that I'm filling in for the CD right now?

272
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,442
Exactly!

273
00:22:37,721 --> 00:22:40,194
So, I'll make revisions when the new CD comes.

274
00:22:40,194 --> 00:22:42,984
- Calm down. 
 - Come on.

275
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:45,278
- Let's stop here. 
 - This is driving me crazy.

276
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,168
- It's pointless. 
 - Let go.

277
00:22:48,168 --> 00:22:51,904
 If a film is a director's art, an ad is a CD's art. 

278
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,975
 Who will listen to department heads who can't become CDs? 

279
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:58,379
 I guess everyone has personal feelings. 

280
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:01,547
 New personnel appointment is the new rule. 

281
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,949
 Send me the list today. 

282
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,044
It's because you keep acting as if you are the CD.

283
00:23:07,044 --> 00:23:08,688
- Sir! 
 - Sir.

284
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,291
- Let go of me! 
 - Stop it.

285
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,027
She's really splitting the team in two.

286
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:19,766
Yes, yes.

287
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:26,873
Yes, I'll call again. Yes.

288
00:23:31,211 --> 00:23:34,815
Sir, aren't you going to do anything about Senior Director Go?

289
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,784
This isn't right!

290
00:23:36,784 --> 00:23:41,420
I know how you must be feeling,

291
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,091
but the CEO has already made the decision.

292
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:57,770
Well, it's not like there isn't any other way...

293
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,040
   

294
00:24:08,515 --> 00:24:09,570
   

295
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,188
Sir, hello. It's Go Ah In.

296
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:19,725
 Your call has been directed to the voicemail box. 

297
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:23,744
   

298
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:30,771
Sir, shall we meet up sometime?

299
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:34,841
 Let's do that next time. Next time. 

300
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:45,685
Hello. The latest ad got some good reviews.

301
00:24:45,686 --> 00:24:49,722
 Ah, I'm in a meeting. I'll call you again. 

302
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:55,962
What's happening?

303
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:59,565
They seem to be avoiding me intentionally.

304
00:25:05,476 --> 00:25:06,911
   

305
00:25:09,543 --> 00:25:11,245
 Hello. 

306
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:14,080
You were about to call me. Right?

307
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,689
I chose a cheap place so that you can say if you like it or not.

308
00:25:24,758 --> 00:25:26,459
I can see it's old.

309
00:25:26,459 --> 00:25:31,063
This used to be the company cafeteria when I started.

310
00:25:34,749 --> 00:25:36,903
I almost forgot your face.

311
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:39,006
That's why I came.

312
00:25:39,006 --> 00:25:41,408
Your girlfriend?

313
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:42,909
No.

314
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,977
- Good. 
 - What is?

315
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:50,647
She's sharp and coy, and pretty for sure, but her eyes are filled with greed.

316
00:25:50,647 --> 00:25:54,021
She doesn't have the face of a housewife raising kids.

317
00:25:54,021 --> 00:25:56,322
You must be a seer. I should pay you in return.

318
00:25:56,323 --> 00:26:01,424
It must be hard to live like a lion with the eyes of a scared rabbit.

319
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:06,065
And with that waist... Ants will call you their sis!

320
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:07,867
Eat some more.

321
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:11,736
- I'll eat up. 
 - Not you!

322
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,878
She's a bit fierce.

323
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:21,114
Try it. The food isn't fierce.

324
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:25,753
So, why did you suddenly want to see me?

325
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:29,969
Ah, Senior Director Choi Chang Soo?

326
00:26:29,969 --> 00:26:32,092
He came to our company.

327
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:33,693
He did?

328
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,190
   

329
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:40,334
 Cut down on the ad volume? 

330
00:26:40,334 --> 00:26:42,090
 Yes, that's right. 

331
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:47,203
 Now that there are major sports events, people's interests are on other things. 

332
00:26:47,203 --> 00:26:50,277
 Ads are less effective than normal. 

333
00:26:50,277 --> 00:26:52,880
 Ah... I see. 

334
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,885
 I suggest that you reduce investments in marketing this year. 

335
00:27:05,392 --> 00:27:08,896
That's why I phoned you immediately.

336
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:11,365
I figured that something was up.

337
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:14,734
I'm sorry for bothering you with our company affairs.

338
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,703
Not at all.

339
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:21,741
It gave me a reason to eat out with you.

340
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:25,512
However, how did you know?

341
00:27:25,512 --> 00:27:30,851
I heard that in your industry, the clients are gods.

342
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:32,152
Yes.

343
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:36,190
What lamb visits the god and asks him

344
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,224
to stop giving him his daily bread?

345
00:27:39,593 --> 00:27:44,695
There's a reason for words and actions that don't make sense.

346
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,467
Thank you.

347
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:50,169
Have I been of help?

348
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,772
Yes. A big help...

349
00:27:53,907 --> 00:27:57,243
- Excuse me. 
 - Go ahead.

350
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,249
 Where are you? 

351
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,053
I have a lunch appointment.

352
00:28:06,053 --> 00:28:08,421
You have to come in now. There's trouble.

353
00:28:14,635 --> 00:28:15,563
 Sign this. 

354
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:17,797
They're taking action.

355
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,933
 Do you think we'll just let this one pass? 

356
00:28:20,934 --> 00:28:24,338
I think it's being led by the heads who'll be transferred.

357
00:28:24,338 --> 00:28:25,771
And the others?

358
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:29,475
They must have signed it because of Senior Director Choi.

359
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:12,070
It's a resolution for your dismissal signed by the creative team.

360
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,520
   

361
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:27,067
What do you think you are doing?

362
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,335
What do you think they are doing?

363
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:41,514
Executing personnel appointment rights.

364
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,017
Do you think that an executive is a god?

365
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:47,620
Doing a personnel evaluation as you want to.

366
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:50,990
You pushed the staff to the edge.

367
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,459
Isn't that right?

368
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,627
- Well, yes. 
 - Yes.

369
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,169
Maybe you're only fit to be a CD?

370
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:06,272
Did I give you too large a position?

371
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,270
   

372
00:30:25,225 --> 00:30:29,362
You have made yourselves quite clear.

373
00:30:29,362 --> 00:30:33,399
What are you doing? You have work to do.

374
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:55,121
Come, let's get back to work.

375
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:21,514
Do you like my card?

376
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:27,186
Doesn't a year feel precious now?

377
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,125
Ah, what a waste.

378
00:31:32,125 --> 00:31:37,063
It was quite costly to redo the interior of the CCO office.

379
00:31:41,401 --> 00:31:43,069
Have a nice day.

380
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,720
Are you okay?

381
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,634
Did you see?

382
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:19,572
See what people are like? They're all like this!

383
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:21,608
They chase after their own profits.

384
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,810
That's not it.

385
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:27,346
It's because they are all scared.

386
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:30,683
Scared of you and Senior Director Choi.

387
00:32:31,485 --> 00:32:33,391
Yeah?

388
00:32:33,391 --> 00:32:35,522
Then, I'll show them who's scarier.

389
00:32:35,522 --> 00:32:38,124
- Senior Director... 
 - Leave.

390
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,828
I'll show them what is really scary from now on.

391
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,580
   

392
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:23,703
 Just one year. That's your term. 

393
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:28,408
 I have high expectations for you. Be a pioneer for others. 

394
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,811
 Do you like my card? 

395
00:33:43,757 --> 00:33:47,527
Ma'am, the CEO would like to see you.

396
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:02,308
I heard that there's been a commotion.

397
00:34:04,511 --> 00:34:07,380
I apologize for the trouble.

398
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:13,753
You must have been prepared when you threw a pebble in the pond.

399
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:23,963
Why? Wasn't this in your plan?

400
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:28,801
No, I expected it.

401
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:31,004
Is that so?

402
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:36,576
Then, should I just stand back and watch?

403
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:37,977
Yes.

404
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,284
Do you know?

405
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:49,088
Brothers don't fight if they are scared of their father.

406
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:55,962
Nothing brings people together like a common enemy.

407
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:02,035
It's better if there's a valid reason as well.

408
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:11,844
Thank you, sir. Please excuse me.

409
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:33,032
Know the standard procedures but forget them to find a way.

410
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:37,437
Why don't we go with such image cuts?

411
00:35:37,437 --> 00:35:39,872
Isn't it too tight?

412
00:35:43,444 --> 00:35:48,247
 Direct internal unrest against an external enemy. 

413
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,651
 And the ripple effect? 

414
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:55,021
We'll have to maximize CGs since we can't film abroad.

415
00:35:55,022 --> 00:35:56,923
We're planning to film it in local venues.

416
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:59,104
 A valid reason... 

417
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,464
 Even if there is one, can I handle it? 

418
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:13,573
 To prevent opposition... 

419
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:24,004
   

420
00:36:32,993 --> 00:36:36,656
   

421
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:42,769
She couldn't have chosen a better time.

422
00:36:42,769 --> 00:36:44,912
   

423
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:51,910
Direct internal unrest against an external enemy. And the ripple effect?

424
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:55,376
   

425
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,500
   

426
00:37:11,932 --> 00:37:14,568
"Ad Expert in One Week"?

427
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:17,237
Do people fall for these things?

428
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:19,205
Some of them do.

429
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:29,315
"Marketing Genius Kim's Secret Notes"?

430
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:31,284
Who goes around revealing all their secrets?

431
00:37:31,285 --> 00:37:33,586
It's just marketing.

432
00:37:34,388 --> 00:37:36,523
Lame. So lame.

433
00:37:36,523 --> 00:37:39,925
Trying to sell such clichés!

434
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,394
Don't you want to buy anything?

435
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:43,930
There's never a book worth buying.

436
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,464
Then, why did you come to the bookstore?

437
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:49,102
To check that there's nothing to buy.

438
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:52,438
This isn't important.

439
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:54,774
- Let's go. 
 - Where would you like to go?

440
00:37:54,775 --> 00:37:58,478
I start work tomorrow. I need to prepare the real stuff.

441
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,460
   

442
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:10,423
How about it? Do I look like a senior director?

443
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:14,627
No.

444
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:16,863
Okay!

445
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,202
How about this?

446
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:27,173
I look like a professional woman, right?

447
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:30,143
Not at all.

448
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:32,378
Okay.

449
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:45,258
I look like a competent exec of an ad agency. Right?

450
00:38:45,258 --> 00:38:46,427
No w?

451
00:38:46,427 --> 00:38:48,828
Why are you saying no to everything?

452
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,564
I did my research all night yesterday.

453
00:38:50,564 --> 00:38:52,899
Ad agency people all dress like this.

454
00:38:52,899 --> 00:38:55,169
Who dresses like that to an ad agency?

455
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:56,336
Emily.

456
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,704
Who's Emily?

457
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:00,006
From the TV series.

458
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:03,309
It's about an American working at an ad company in Paris.

459
00:39:03,309 --> 00:39:04,577
An American TV series?

460
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:08,180
It's quite popular. Haven't you watched it?

461
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,151
I guess I'll have to carry a gun. As a secretary-slash-bodyguard.

462
00:39:11,151 --> 00:39:15,788
Gosh, that's Ameri... ca.

463
00:39:16,957 --> 00:39:20,593
How should I know workwear when I've never worked?

464
00:39:20,594 --> 00:39:23,830
Wait. I'll try something else.

465
00:39:24,798 --> 00:39:27,066
Manager! You carry workwear?

466
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:29,669
Show me some of that. Hurry.

467
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:35,906
You might not look likean office worker,

468
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,944
but you look pretty in all of them.

469
00:39:40,347 --> 00:39:44,050
Yes, Senior Director. I'll bring it over right away.

470
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,786
Yes.

471
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,257
- Um... 
 - Yeah?

472
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:53,226
- Sir... 
 - What's up?

473
00:39:53,827 --> 00:39:55,661
I mean... well...

474
00:39:55,662 --> 00:39:57,964
If it's nothing serious, let's talk tomorrow.

475
00:39:57,964 --> 00:39:59,899
See you tomorrow. You should get going.

476
00:40:10,344 --> 00:40:12,344
   

477
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:18,451
It's quite serious, isn't it?

478
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,657
Honestly, you don't want to quit, do you?

479
00:40:23,657 --> 00:40:28,094
This company... it's hard to work and to even quit.

480
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,863
Think it over a little more.

481
00:40:29,863 --> 00:40:33,099
I've thought enough about it.

482
00:40:34,835 --> 00:40:37,470
- Jang Woo. 
 - Yes.

483
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,941
Be in a relationship, but don't get married.

484
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,570
Oh, I think both are hard for me.

485
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,553
Why both?

486
00:40:50,584 --> 00:40:52,351
- Are you... 
 - NGSB. 
  ("No Girlfriend Since Birth." Refers to the inability to get a girlfriend) 

487
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:55,121
What? You're not embarrassed admitting it?

488
00:40:55,122 --> 00:40:57,357
Because I'm not embarrassed.

489
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:04,390
Let's sort out this issue before I resign. Okay?

490
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,233
Okay, let's do that.

491
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,836
I'm off. See you tomorrow.

492
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:16,420
   

493
00:41:26,787 --> 00:41:28,922
Where's the secretary?

494
00:41:28,922 --> 00:41:30,289
I told her to go.

495
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:32,491
You knew all along?

496
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,261
That Senior Director Choi put her there?

497
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:39,131
I found out.

498
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:46,072
Because only one person

499
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:47,850
knows my whereabouts in real-time.

500
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,700
   

501
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,710
   

502
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:57,283
- Will you just keep...? 
 - Yes.

503
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:01,487
She'll come in handy one day. Let me see.

504
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:16,336
Done. The CD promotion list is also done. One left.

505
00:42:16,336 --> 00:42:20,473
What's next? If they hand in your dismissal resolution...

506
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:24,744
It will never pass.

507
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,245
Pardon?

508
00:42:26,246 --> 00:42:28,781
The skin is nearer than the shirt.

509
00:42:28,781 --> 00:42:32,452
Leave an example of an executive being fired by regular employees?

510
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:35,054
Just to get rid of me?

511
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:38,524
- Senior Director Choi and the execs aren't that stupid. 
 - Then, why...

512
00:42:38,524 --> 00:42:42,697
It's just a warning to keep a low profile.

513
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:46,666
Nevermind that... Do you have the email addresses of our clients?

514
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:50,436
Yes, but why?

515
00:42:52,539 --> 00:42:56,810
You're not going to bring our clients into this, are you?

516
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:01,712
I'll have to give some carrots to the creative team to make them withdraw the resolution.

517
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:02,983
You can't do that.

518
00:43:02,983 --> 00:43:06,553
Provoke the clients? That's on another level.

519
00:43:06,553 --> 00:43:10,056
Right? It's on another level.

520
00:43:10,124 --> 00:43:15,395
So, someone on another level will take care of it.

521
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:17,163
Who?

522
00:43:22,836 --> 00:43:26,339
The influencer princess who's joining us tomorrow.

523
00:43:30,811 --> 00:43:34,131
You don't need to worry. Someone else needs to worry.

524
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:36,082
Who?

525
00:43:36,082 --> 00:43:37,950
Senior Director Choi.

526
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:42,322
Our Senior Director Choi doesn't seem to know

527
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:47,393
that there are storms strong enough to knock down greenhouses.

528
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,835
Why is it so rowdy?

529
00:43:57,371 --> 00:44:00,766
She's a little tough, maybe because she has nothing to lose.

530
00:44:00,767 --> 00:44:05,011
You should've chosen a meek one. Why make it hard?

531
00:44:05,012 --> 00:44:09,415
I thought she'd be obedient if I chucked her something to look after.

532
00:44:11,985 --> 00:44:14,787
I took care of it. Don't worry.

533
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:20,393
Senior Director Hanna starts tomorrow.

534
00:44:20,393 --> 00:44:22,296
What type is she?

535
00:44:22,296 --> 00:44:23,863
Temperamental.

536
00:44:23,863 --> 00:44:27,633
She might be all smiles, but she's sly as a fox.

537
00:44:27,634 --> 00:44:31,438
She's still a rookie. I'll babysit her well.

538
00:44:31,438 --> 00:44:35,474
Kang Hanna might look easy, but don't underestimate her.

539
00:44:35,475 --> 00:44:38,846
She's a mini-version of the grand chairman.

540
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:41,047
Strong enough to push her brother out?

541
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:49,355
- Tell her to come in at around 1:00 p.m. tomorrow. 
 - Why?

542
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,825
We all need insurance in modern society.

543
00:44:51,825 --> 00:44:55,661
We'll give her a proper welcome.

544
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,160
   

545
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,400
   

546
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,750
   

547
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,869
Am I gong too far?

548
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:42,609
If Kang Hanna is more foolish than I think, she'll miss this.

549
00:45:51,532 --> 00:45:58,420
 Even my dad who owns a yogurt company licks the lid! 

550
00:46:01,161 --> 00:46:02,899
 It's not an addiction! 

551
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:05,999
 I've never worn anything but luxury brands. 

552
00:46:05,999 --> 00:46:10,370
 Yup, I love attention. I love attention and I love likes even more! 

553
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:14,040
 Guys, be attention-mongers! 

554
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,878
She knows how to make an issue and read public opinion.

555
00:46:18,878 --> 00:46:25,314
Acting like a spoiled brat on the outside but she's sly as a fox on the inside...

556
00:46:25,314 --> 00:46:30,562
 There will be a welcome reception for Senior Director Kang Hanna's first day at work at 1:00 p.m. in the lobby today. 

557
00:46:30,562 --> 00:46:33,995
 Please attend the eventand welcome her. 

558
00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:40,833
 It's an opportunity to give her a memorable welcome in front of everyone. 

559
00:46:45,739 --> 00:46:47,341
   

560
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:56,446
It won't be an easy day, Senior Director Choi.

561
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,219
Excuse me.

562
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:20,974
You only go in at 1:00 p.m.

563
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,298
I have to get in the habit.

564
00:47:24,298 --> 00:47:27,380
Going to work when others go to work.

565
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:30,783
What should I wear?

566
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:38,290
What would you like to wear?

567
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,618
Me?

568
00:47:40,592 --> 00:47:42,596
Nothing from here.

569
00:47:42,596 --> 00:47:45,698
Then, from where?

570
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:55,641
Here.

571
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:01,247
I have to make an impact on my first day.

572
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:07,420
Something like this or this, and bang!

573
00:48:08,455 --> 00:48:10,223
Slam it in their faces!

574
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,758
Then wear that.

575
00:48:12,758 --> 00:48:15,394
You said I have to dress like an office worker.

576
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:17,230
Senior Director.

577
00:48:18,999 --> 00:48:20,366
Me?

578
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:23,303
You're a senior director from today.

579
00:48:24,872 --> 00:48:25,839
That's right!

580
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:29,542
You look the best when you're yourself.

581
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:34,844
We can copy failure but we can't copy success.

582
00:48:34,844 --> 00:48:38,918
Be Kang Hanna from the beginning.

583
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,621
Should I?

584
00:48:43,791 --> 00:48:45,725
Grandpa!

585
00:48:46,727 --> 00:48:48,494
How do I look?

586
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:52,131
Are you going out?

587
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:55,468
Isn't it your first day at work today?

588
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:58,070
Yup. So I tried my best.

589
00:48:58,071 --> 00:49:02,308
Then, why aren't you dressed like the other employees?

590
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:05,044
Why should I wear servants' clothes?

591
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:09,630
I'll do it my way, sink or swim.

592
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:12,685
That's no way to talk on your first day!

593
00:49:13,787 --> 00:49:18,666
You're just like me, you will not sink.

594
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:24,731
Grandpa, just hang on and don't die yet.

595
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:26,832
What?

596
00:49:26,834 --> 00:49:31,137
I'll make you not just Korea's no. 1, but the world's... that's too much.

597
00:49:31,138 --> 00:49:33,773
Asia's no. 1.

598
00:49:33,773 --> 00:49:36,009
I like that ambition.

599
00:49:36,009 --> 00:49:38,411
- I'll be off. 
 - All right.

600
00:49:46,186 --> 00:49:51,558
If you fail, you're a crook. If you succeed, you're ambitious.

601
00:49:51,558 --> 00:49:55,293
It's the result that counts. Of course.

602
00:49:57,164 --> 00:50:00,833
She acts like a dolt, but she knows a few things.

603
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:26,225
It's peaceful for a change.

604
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,728
   

605
00:50:37,791 --> 00:50:40,428
   

606
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:51,217
I'll be there around lunch.

607
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:57,221
Print out a letter of withdrawal.

608
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,559
So that they can just sign it.

609
00:51:11,013 --> 00:51:14,120
What? 
    

610
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:16,476
What's going on?

611
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,616
Executive Director.

612
00:51:22,616 --> 00:51:24,718
What are you doing?

613
00:51:24,718 --> 00:51:26,652
Is this why you said we should cut down on the ad costs?

614
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:30,102
You tell us to cut down on marketing spending, and stab us in the back like this!

615
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:31,825
I would never do that.

616
00:51:31,825 --> 00:51:34,693
Who in their right mind would do that to their clients?

617
00:51:44,506 --> 00:51:48,341
- Is she in? 
 - She hasn't come in yet.

618
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:55,148
She starts trouble and doesn't even come to work?

619
00:51:57,618 --> 00:52:01,120
Call me as soon as she comes.

620
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,822
Yes.

621
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:11,864
Answer me properly.

622
00:52:11,864 --> 00:52:14,133
Yes, I will.

623
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,415
 Did you read the email? 

624
00:52:28,415 --> 00:52:33,220
 For real? She sent that email to the clients? 

625
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:36,689
 What's up? I'm on my way right now. 

626
00:52:36,689 --> 00:52:37,959
 Look. 

627
00:52:37,959 --> 00:52:41,261
 Wow, that's crazy! 

628
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:44,150
 I can't believe it! 

629
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:46,410
♫  ...from a blue dream that resembles you  ♫

630
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:52,770
♫  How the day passes by  ♫

631
00:52:52,773 --> 00:52:57,177
 As of today, VC Communications will not accept these two types of requests. 

632
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:58,844
 First. 

633
00:52:59,445 --> 00:53:02,201
 Requests to complete work assigned on Friday by the following Monday. 

634
00:53:02,202 --> 00:53:04,483
Getting off right on time today. Any plans for Friday night?

635
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,854
Going to get some sleep. What about you?

636
00:53:06,854 --> 00:53:08,494
I'll...

637
00:53:10,157 --> 00:53:11,124
Hello, sir.

638
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:15,322
Can you send me some new plans for our TVC?

639
00:53:15,322 --> 00:53:17,496
- By when... 
 - Why ask?

640
00:53:17,496 --> 00:53:21,600
We have a meeting on Monday morning, so by then.

641
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:28,020
♫  Turn it off. Will you turn off the alarm? 
 I'm going back  ♫

642
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:29,915
 Second. 

643
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:34,046
 Requests to do the client's personal work. 

644
00:53:34,046 --> 00:53:36,610
♫  A dazzling morning  ♫

645
00:53:36,617 --> 00:53:38,318
Yes, sir.

646
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:41,488
I sent you my son's essay homework.

647
00:53:41,488 --> 00:53:42,456
Pardon?

648
00:53:42,457 --> 00:53:45,391
Please polish it up nicely.

649
00:53:45,392 --> 00:53:48,594
Pardon? I don't think I should be writing...

650
00:53:48,595 --> 00:53:53,332
You're a copywriter! Get on with it!

00:53:53,332 --> 00:53:56,100
♫  You and I in my dream  ♫

652
00:53:56,103 --> 00:53:58,519
   

653
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,043
 We hope to change malpractices in the industry. 

654
00:54:04,778 --> 00:54:09,615
 We ask for our clients' understanding. - VC Communications 

655
00:54:11,352 --> 00:54:12,712
   

656
00:54:12,712 --> 00:54:14,320
We can finally rest on the weekends?

657
00:54:14,321 --> 00:54:18,006
 We can rest on the weekends! 

658
00:54:18,006 --> 00:54:20,859
 It's for real! 

659
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:24,464
Sir, they are going to explode...

660
00:54:25,232 --> 00:54:27,300
Can she handle this?

661
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:30,436
The staff is praising the senior director to the skies,

662
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,306
but the clients...

663
00:54:34,975 --> 00:54:38,746
See? I'm trying to stay perfectly still. I'm shaking...

664
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:40,381
Sir, what's this...

665
00:54:40,381 --> 00:54:44,451
What? A nuclear bomb? Praise to the skies? Got it.

666
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,986
Huh? How come you know it all?

667
00:54:46,986 --> 00:54:50,923
Because you texted each other on the way here. Predictable.

668
00:54:54,695 --> 00:54:59,227
Let's do what we can to help out the senior director.

669
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:00,934
Get signatures.

670
00:55:00,934 --> 00:55:03,369
What is it?

671
00:55:04,111 --> 00:55:06,494
   

672
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:13,312
Ah, so that's why.

673
00:55:13,312 --> 00:55:17,517
Directing internal unrest against an external enemy...

674
00:55:25,893 --> 00:55:31,063
It'll be a bit rowdy if I go now...

675
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:51,150
What do I do when I get there?

676
00:55:51,151 --> 00:55:55,254
The executives will be waiting for you in the lobby.

677
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:56,789
Yeah?

678
00:55:58,236 --> 00:56:04,063
Well, the first impression is important. It lasts forever.

679
00:56:09,503 --> 00:56:13,372
Are you nervous? You don't look well.

680
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:17,085
I have a bad feeling.

681
00:56:17,085 --> 00:56:21,280
Pardon? What kind of feeling?

682
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:28,221
Just a gut feeling... an alarm went off.

683
00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:43,256
I should get ready for the welcome.

684
00:56:54,075 --> 00:56:55,281
   

685
00:56:55,281 --> 00:56:56,316
   

686
00:57:00,988 --> 00:57:01,955
 Do we have to do this much? 

687
00:57:01,955 --> 00:57:04,625
 She's the chairman's daughter. 

688
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:06,852
 - I don't have time... 
 - What a bother. 

689
00:57:06,852 --> 00:57:08,343
 Yes, yes. That's good! 

690
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:10,097
 Good job. 

691
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,664
 Where are the flowers? 

692
00:57:11,665 --> 00:57:13,494
 Coming! 

693
00:57:13,494 --> 00:57:15,134
 Let's see. 

694
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,730
   

695
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:19,540
Good.

696
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:20,806
Should I get some champagne?

697
00:57:20,807 --> 00:57:21,908
- Champagne? 
 - Yes.

698
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:24,144
Why not have a car parade?

699
00:57:24,144 --> 00:57:29,315
Senior Director Choi, isn't this kind of thing a bit outdated?

700
00:57:29,315 --> 00:57:32,319
Where's Senior Director Go?

701
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,120
I'm here.

702
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:48,969
But, Senior Director Choi, why don't you look extremely happy?

703
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:51,337
Is there something bothering you?

704
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:55,175
Let's have a talk after this.

705
00:57:55,175 --> 00:57:58,377
You won't be in a state for a talk, then.

706
00:57:59,379 --> 00:58:01,347
She's coming.

707
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:14,310
   

708
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:23,110
   

709
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:39,480
 (Okay.) 

710
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:44,557
Excuse me...

711
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:47,328
   

712
00:58:47,328 --> 00:58:49,328
Do you agree?

713
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,035
Of course.

714
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:58,239
Give Senior Director Go my thanks.

715
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,959
Ah, I will.

716
00:59:27,701 --> 00:59:28,802
   

717
00:59:28,802 --> 00:59:29,836
   

718

719
00:59:44,384 --> 00:59:46,827
Did someone win a gold medal?

720
00:59:46,827 --> 00:59:49,227
Pardon?

721
00:59:49,227 --> 00:59:52,592
- No, it was just a joke. 
 - I see.

722
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:07,740
It's been a while.

723
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:10,910
I wouldn't recognize you on the street.

724
01:00:10,911 --> 01:00:13,781
I should address you formally now.

725
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:17,117
You used to stick my straw into banana milk for me.

726
01:00:17,117 --> 01:00:18,484
Just talk to me comfortably.

727
01:00:18,484 --> 01:00:20,873
I can't do that.

728
01:00:20,873 --> 01:00:23,889
We're now working together.

729
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:29,095
Let's get started. Let me introduce our staff.

730
01:00:33,388 --> 01:00:35,668
- Of course, I'll sign it. 
 - Fighting!

731
01:00:35,668 --> 01:00:37,738
We're on the senior director's side.

732
01:00:37,738 --> 01:00:40,006
Please tell her we're thankful.

733
01:00:40,641 --> 01:00:43,576
- Senior Director of Promotions. 
 - Welcome.

734
01:00:48,810 --> 01:00:50,830
Good job.

735
01:00:50,831 --> 01:00:54,453
- Senior Director of Media. 
 - Nice to meet you.

736
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:58,524
This is our Chief Project Officer.

737
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:09,703
I look forward to working with you.

738
01:01:09,703 --> 01:01:12,205
Yes, thank you.

739
01:01:14,341 --> 01:01:17,344
Senior Director of Human Resources.

742
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,049
And here...

743
01:01:23,049 --> 01:01:26,086
Yes, I already know.

744
01:01:26,086 --> 01:01:28,588
Senior Director Go Ah In, right?

745
01:01:30,924 --> 01:01:34,060
Nice to meet you. I'm Go Ah In.

746
01:01:38,332 --> 01:01:42,536
It's your first time. Right?

747
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:43,569
For what?

748
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:47,386
An ad agency... I mean,

749
01:01:47,386 --> 01:01:49,339
office life.

750
01:01:50,644 --> 01:01:52,645
Well, I did my MBA in the States...

751
01:01:52,646 --> 01:01:56,016
Then, since you have a lot to learn,

752
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:58,818
please feel free to ask about work.

753
01:01:59,787 --> 01:02:04,058
Don't start doing what you don't know and weren't asked to do

754
01:02:04,058 --> 01:02:06,959
and make trouble.

755
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:20,794

 You think I'm crossing the line? 

765
01:03:26,186 --> 01:03:28,441
 It takes a crazy one to know one. 

766
01:03:28,442 --> 01:03:30,877
 Keep an eye on that senior director. 

767

 I know something that will make a nice headline.

 There's nothing like a good beating to make one obedient.
