1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:03,630
   

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,773
 CD Kwon says he'll put this up in the lobby. 

3
00:00:08,642 --> 00:00:12,847
How nice of him to up the ante.

4
00:00:12,847 --> 00:00:14,568
- Yes. 
 - Yes, Senior Director.

5
00:00:14,569 --> 00:00:16,916
She's doing the interview now. Right?

6
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,050
She's almost done.

7
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:23,290
It'd be good to escort them when they leave.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,891
Senior Director Hanna should do it herself.

9
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:26,492
 Good job. 

10
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,728
Good job, everyone.

11
00:00:29,728 --> 00:00:33,032
Abolition of the clients' unreasonable requests.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,001
That was a great move.

13
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,503
I'll escort you.

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:42,276
Looks like Senior Director Choi

15
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:45,945
will incur the real king's wrath trying to fight me.

16
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:55,054
They should be here soon...

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,092
All we have to do is change ad agencies.

18
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:02,161
We can't do that because they are our affiliates.

19
00:01:02,162 --> 00:01:04,231
We can only give them a beating as we take them along.

20
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,430
    
    

21
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,569
You'll receive them in the lobby?

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,037
When the affiliates' marketing execs come,

23
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:14,540
shouldn't they know what the atmosphere is like?

24
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,300
   
   

25
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:23,316
Thank you for today's interview.

26
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,951
I had a great time as well.

27
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:27,190
You're a great talker.

28
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,760


29
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,430
Oh dear, our poor princess...

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,040
      
    

31
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,864
   

32
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:49,632
Why attack the clients?

33
00:01:49,632 --> 00:01:52,532
- What's happening? 
 - What's all this?

34
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,119
These jerks...

35
00:01:58,119 --> 00:01:59,987
   

36
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:01,854
 Those are good copies. 

37
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,155
   

38
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:05,725
 Hey! Get your cameras! Catch this on camera! 

39
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,894
Thank you for coming today.

40
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,765
Please show the guests the way out.

41
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:14,201
- Please follow us. This way. 
 - Please come this way.

42
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,136
Isn't that Senior Director Hanna, the chairman's daughter?

43
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,332
 - Right? 
 - Right. 

44
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,875
   

45
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,010
   

46
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,025
   

47
00:02:26,882 --> 00:02:30,330
   

48
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,654
Come on, show us a tantrum.

49
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,680
   

50
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:41,695
Hello. I'm CD Kwon Woo Cheol of the Creative Team.

51
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,098
Senior Director Choi told me that you'd be coming.

52
00:02:46,033 --> 00:02:48,534
Senior Director Kang Hanna

53
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,640
- How do you do? 
 - How do you do?

54
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:01,347
Senior Director, hello!

55
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,178
   

56
00:03:04,178 --> 00:03:07,987
Doesn't it make you mad?

57
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:12,258
Since there's a crazy executive attacking the clients,

58
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:14,827
I decided to set a good example

59
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:17,486
and show the entire staff what is happening.

60
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:20,566
Such an executive must be fired immediately...

61
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:28,441
 Please come this way. 

62
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,278
- Let's go. 
 - What are you doing? Show them the way.

63
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,615
Just once...

64
00:03:33,615 --> 00:03:35,675
This way. Hang on.

65
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:36,983
Show them the way.

66
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,385
 We need an explanation! 

67
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,326
- Who... 
 - Pardon?

68
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,269
Who?

69
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:00,307
Who gave you these orders?

70
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,384
Looks like someone's in hot water.

71
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,224
Yes, Go Ah In speaking.

72
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:24,431
Hello. I'm Woowon Group's Executive Director of Marketing Hwang Seok Woo.

73
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,866
Yes, hello.

74
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:29,456
I'll be direct.

75
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:32,316
Can we hold a meeting?

76
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:34,007
Yes, that's possible.

77
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:39,209
I'll have to know what it's about to prepare for the meeting in advance.

78
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:42,950
We're making plans to do a corporate PR ad for the Woowon Group.

79
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,083
A corporate PR ad?

80
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:47,054
Yes. The billing is 30 billion won.

81
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,857
The earlier the on-air date, the better.

82
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,625
 Do you have time tomorrow? 

83
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,894
Yes, I do.

84
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:57,563
Then, I'll schedule the meeting for 1:0 p.m. tomorrow.

85
00:04:57,564 --> 00:05:00,633
Five companies have been invited, including VC Communications.

86
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,203
 I'll explain in detail tomorrow. 

87
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:06,406
All right, I'll see you tomorrow.

88
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:14,046
I'll know if she's the real deal or not once we meet.

89
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:23,723
A large-scale corporate PR ad when the chairman is arrested?

90
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:31,164
Department Head Han, check Woowon Group's Executive Director Hwang's background.

91
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:40,394
   

92
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,444
   

93
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:48,581
What should we prepare for the meeting with the agencies tomorrow?

94
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:50,550
Nothing.

95
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,451
Pardon?

96
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,952
There's nothing for us to do

97
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:56,255
when they have to come up with a way that doesn't exist.

98
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,092
If we give them something, it will only create a bias in their heads.

99
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,860
I understand.

100
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,160
   
   

101
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,937
A third-rate person can only block messages.

102
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:14,640
If she's a real wiz, it will show in her work.

103
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,660
Have you checked?

104
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,480
   

105
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:25,351
Yes, I checked.

106
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:29,555
Executive Director Hwang was the president of the PR Association.

107
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,123
   

108
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,027
He's the best in the country in the field of risk management.

109
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:39,732
Last year, Woowon acquired Executive Director Hwang's

110
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,769
PR company for a considerable amount.

111
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:49,376
That means he's not a fool who knows nothing.

112
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:52,444
May I ask why you're curious?

113
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:54,381
Woowon Group is launching a corporate PR ad.

114
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,082
A corporate PR ad at this time?

115
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:58,986
As soon as possible for that matter. With a billing of 30 billion won.

116
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,053
That really doesn't make sense.

117
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:06,260
I know. When there's a negative issue, ad marketing stops.

118
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,761
That's the logic in the industry.

119
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:14,031
Then, maybe their plan is to maintain good relations with

120
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:17,905
the press by increasing advertising expenses.

121
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:21,307
Yes, there's that.

122
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:27,308
But, if that's their plan, they could just increase the current ad volume.

123
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:32,218
Why would they do a new corporate PR ad and send a new message?

124
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,821
That's true.

125
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:40,125
It'd be stupid to do a corporate PR ad at this stage,

126
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,220
   

127
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,564
but he's not stupid...

128
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,270
Senior Director, the CEO is asking for you.

129
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:07,353
 Who? Who gave the orders? 

130
00:08:11,425 --> 00:08:15,362
Why are you running to the office?

131
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:16,963
Is there an emergency?

132
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:19,298
Go Ah In, you!

133
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,234
Why are you doing what you don't normally do? Just live the way you've always have.

134
00:08:22,234 --> 00:08:23,903
What the heck are you saying?

135
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,407
Weak strong, strong weak.

136
00:08:26,407 --> 00:08:29,476
Weak to the strong, strong to the weak.

137
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:33,380
Isn't that your life philosophy and key to success?

138
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,018
Damn it! This is no time to bicker. Okay?

139
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,605
Going through puberty?

140
00:08:39,605 --> 00:08:42,922
Why pick a fight with the chairman's daughter?

141
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:44,824
You little...

142
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:48,863
- By any chance, are you copying me? 
 - What the...

143
00:08:48,863 --> 00:08:52,765
 Who was it? Call them here now! 

144
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,703
I'll talk to you later.

145
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,996
Senior Director Hanna, please calm down.

146
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,857
Do you think I can calm down?

147
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:23,459
I swallowed what happened on the first day at work as part of mental training. I let it slide!

148
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:30,267
But I prepared so hard for this interview to promote my first day at work,

149
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:35,756
and you intentionally and deliberately smeared it with your crap!

150
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:37,377
   

151
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:42,762
Senior Director, how would I...

152
00:09:42,763 --> 00:09:46,786
No! Is this how you work?

153
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,789
No. There must be a misunderstanding.

154
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:52,226
He said you gave him the orders.

155
00:09:52,226 --> 00:09:53,700
Pardon?

156
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,516
I said that Senior Director Choi...

157
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:01,134
You! Know your place!

158
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:09,509
He also said it was you who called the affiliates' marketing execs.

159
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,248
About that...

160
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,553
There was a meeting scheduled for today.

161
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:23,340
Considering the situation,

162
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,692
let's postpone the meeting to another day.

163
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,162
Yes. Then, I'll get going.

164
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,011
What's all this about?

165
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,679
Did Senior Director Hanna send the email?

166
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,415
Wasn't it sent by Senior Director Go Ah In?

167
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,320
It seems like Senior Director Hanna ordered it.

168
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,324
If we had complained as Senior Director Choi advised us to...

169
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,596
Let's just go. We'll get into bigger trouble if we stay.

170
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,366
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go.

171
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,804
- Who was it? 
 - Pardon?

172
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:14,073
Who gave you the orders?

173
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:17,211
What?

174
00:11:17,212 --> 00:11:19,255
There must have been someone who told you

175
00:11:19,256 --> 00:11:24,450
to screw me over in front of all the executives!

176
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:29,789
Why would I slander you?

177
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:34,360
Then, who were you slandering?

178
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,895
Pardon?

179
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:42,403
Was it my brother?

180
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,904
Pardon?

181
00:11:49,343 --> 00:11:54,694
Seeing as you can't say anything, I must be right. I'm right, aren't I?

182
00:11:54,694 --> 00:11:57,551
The best he can do is stick up those childish posters!

183
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:01,587
No, I do not know the vice-chairman at all.

184
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:06,424
Then, what do you have against me to give orders to do such a thing!?

185
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:13,733
 Kang Hanna, she's completely nuts. 

186
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:17,275
 Is there no other way? 

187
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:24,677
 I have to throw away the bad apple. 

188
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:34,821
To be honest, I don't know how to say this...

189
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:39,091
This incident was due to CD Kwon's personal grudge

190
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,528
- against the recent staff transfer. 
 - Sir!

191
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:49,969
I told him repeatedly not to do anything reckless.

192
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:01,481
Do you think I'll fall for that?

193
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,854
Deputy Park, no, Uncle!

194
00:13:10,124 --> 00:13:14,727
Fire him! Immediately!

195
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:26,172
I think I understand the situation.

196
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:27,807
Isn't that so?

197
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:32,813
In any case, I apologize on his behalf

198
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:37,150
for causing trouble at work.

199
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:58,004
First, you should return to your office and try to calm down.

200
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,038
No, now!

201
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:04,677
Senior Director Hanna, will you keep shouting at work?

202
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:27,106
Even you, Deputy Park? I'm going crazy.

203
00:14:27,106 --> 00:14:32,602
In a workplace, even anger must be shown strategically, after calculating.

204
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:35,975
Let's go. I'll tell you inside.

205
00:14:45,252 --> 00:14:47,053
The two of you...

206
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,828
It's all right for the two of you to compete.

207
00:14:55,829 --> 00:14:58,831
That's what happens at work.

208
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:05,171
But I will not forgive you if you use

209
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,840
Senior Director Hanna to fight.

210
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:16,813
Fighters must fight each other in the ring, not bring in the audience.

211
00:15:16,813 --> 00:15:18,985
I'll keep that in mind.

212
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,358
I apologize.

213
00:15:27,628 --> 00:15:29,896
- You may go. 
 - Yes.

214
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,281
 Yes, sir. 

215
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,819
Can you bring me some banana milk?

216
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:04,330
So, the target was Senior Director Go?

217
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,565
Most likely.

218
00:16:05,566 --> 00:16:09,869
Then, it was that Go Ah In who pulled a fast one on me?

219
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:14,307
I don't think so.

220
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,776
Why did you hesitate?

221
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,948
In any case, I got into the fight between the two of them?

222
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,750
Yes, it seems that way.

223
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:31,821
No matter how crazy this world is, this cannot happen!

224
00:16:31,821 --> 00:16:32,925
First, calm down...

225
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:35,095
How dare those lowly senior directors...

226
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:37,563
I'll show them!

227
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,899
- Move! 
 - You have to calm down first.

228
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:44,136
Does it look like I can calm down now?

229
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:51,077
Ouch.

230
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:52,845
Are you okay?

231
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:58,350
They're all dead meat.

232
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,361
What brings you here?

233
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:13,046
This is from the CEO.

234
00:17:23,491 --> 00:17:27,714
Don't you know that there's a line you can't cross?

235
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:31,350
Why bring Senior Director Hanna into this?

236
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,387
Isn't it you who crossed the line first?

237
00:17:39,593 --> 00:17:40,873
   

238
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:46,532
You must be busy. Good luck.

239
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:50,569
What a...

240
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,276
Yes, sir.

241
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,679
What have you done?

242
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,580
I also don't know how the situation...

243
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:03,916
This was Senior Director Hanna's doing?

244
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,819
- No, that's not... 
 - What do you mean it's not?

245
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,555
 If we had made a formal complaint, 

246
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:12,325
we would have been confronting the chairman's daughter.

247
00:18:12,326 --> 00:18:17,163
You must be out of your mind! I mean...

248
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,839
Are you using us to keep the CCO in check?

249
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,039
I would never...

250
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,677
You will pay for this one day.

251
00:18:58,105 --> 00:19:02,742
Ma'am, the CEO would like to send you this message.

252
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,144
What?

253
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:10,998
It's okay. Go ahead.

254
00:19:12,286 --> 00:19:17,290
"Hanna, should I stick the straw in for you?"

255
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:27,420
 I wouldn't recognize you on the street. 

256
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,103
 I should address you formally now. 

257
00:19:30,103 --> 00:19:33,507
 You used to stick the straw into the banana milk for me. 

258
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,907
 Just call me comfortably. 

259
00:19:34,908 --> 00:19:38,511
 Hanna, should I stick the straw in for you? 

260
00:19:48,489 --> 00:19:50,090
Yes!

261
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,292
Pardon?

262
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:58,498
Stick the straw in for me.

263
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,880
   

264
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:50,650
Deliver a message to the CEO.

265
00:20:56,824 --> 00:21:00,560
Senior Director Hanna asked me to deliver this message.

266
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,795
What did she say?

267
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:08,535
 Tell him I've become a real grown-up, 

268
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:15,141
 so he doesn't need to put the straw in for me anymore. 

269
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:29,188
I see. Thank you.

270
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:44,170
Looks like Hanna's real corporate life has begun.

271
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:51,680
   

272
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,350
Tell me everything.

273
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,053
Pardon? What?

274
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,931
You're hiding something.

275
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:07,378
Are you going to treat me like a kid as well?

276
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,734
From what I can gather,

277
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:20,169
I think that Senior Director Go knew what was happening and led you to the lobby.

278
00:22:21,175 --> 00:22:22,442
The executives of the affiliates?

279
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:27,811
I think Senior Director Choi called them because of the email that was sent to the clients.

280
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:29,537
Interesting.

281
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:33,423
It's reassuring that the executives are smart.

282
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:36,689
What are you planning to do?

283
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:39,228
I should have a fling.

284
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:41,827
- What? 
 - Choi Chang Soo, Go Ah In.

285
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:46,031
These lowly senior directors are trying to flirt with me.

286
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,534
If that's what they want, I should play along.

287
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,304
The wording might be inappropriate, but the meaning is appropriate.

288
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:56,509
Don't I have to show them what it's like to play hard to get?

289
00:22:58,273 --> 00:23:01,547
Corporate life is going to be quite fun.

290
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:06,450
It makes my heart race. Just thinking about keeping them hanging by a thread.

291
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:11,924
   

292
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,040
- Congratulations. 
 - Congrats on your promotion.

293
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,628
Thank you.

294
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,929
Department Heads, hurry up.

295
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:20,600
- Come over, everyone. 
 - We have to celebrate together. Hurry.

296
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,603
- Congratulations. 
 - Shall we have a party today?

297
00:23:22,603 --> 00:23:26,966
- Congratulations. 
 - Congratulations.

298
00:23:28,342 --> 00:23:31,577
Come, you two have to blow out the candles.

299
00:23:37,712 --> 00:23:40,452
Eun Jeong, you do it.

300
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,617
There's a proper order for everything. You should do it.

301
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:44,924
Ladies first.

302
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,692
Elders first.

303
00:23:47,692 --> 00:23:49,362
Just blow out the candles already. My arms hurt.

304
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:50,997
- Let's do it together. 
 - All right.

305
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,965
One, two, three!

306
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:57,537
Wait! One moment. Wait.

307
00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:04,444
CD Bae!

308
00:24:06,814 --> 00:24:07,723
Hurry up.

309
00:24:07,723 --> 00:24:09,482
That's right! There's one more person.

310
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:11,484
Hurry!

311
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,586
Hurry up!

312
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,157
All of you guys!

313
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:23,196
Congrats on becoming CDs. Department Heads as well.

314
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:26,766
One, two, three!

315
00:24:30,625 --> 00:24:33,740
- Congratulations! 
 - Congratulations.

316
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,908
- Congrats on becoming CDs. 
 - Congratulations.

317
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:44,784
Hang on. We didn't call the senior director.

318
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:48,387
The senior director doesn't attend this kind of event.

319
00:24:50,124 --> 00:24:53,125
- Why? 
 - What?

320
00:24:53,861 --> 00:24:56,509
Why doesn't she attend this kind of event?

321
00:24:56,509 --> 00:24:58,031
What's the reason?

322
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:01,901
The reason? I've never given it a thought.

323
00:25:01,901 --> 00:25:06,406
She just doesn't like sweet things and it feels like

324
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:09,142
she naturally wouldn't attend these events.

325
00:25:09,142 --> 00:25:11,310
How is that natural?

326
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,146
Look. Look carefully if you have eyes.

327
00:25:14,147 --> 00:25:17,617
Isn't it pretty? It looks delicious, too.

328
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:20,086
Who wouldn't like this?

329
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:23,256
Are you going to work with groundless facts?

330
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:28,561
I'll check for myself whether she really dislikes it or not.

331
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:34,334
She'll be busy working right now.

332
00:25:34,334 --> 00:25:36,669
It's a bit risky.

333
00:25:43,911 --> 00:25:47,147
- I've become a CD. 
 - Pardon?

334
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,081
Me.

335
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:52,672
Ah, congratulations. You didn't have to bring me...

336
00:25:52,672 --> 00:25:55,938
You're also on our team since you're the senior director's secretary.

337
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:59,025
- Is she in? 
 - Yes.

338
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:09,769
Even a contractor like me,

339
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:13,542
all together, our team...

340
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,240
   

341
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,747
Are you the CEO?

342
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,919
Pardon? Were you waiting for the CEO?

343
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,820
No.

344
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,756
Then?

345
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:34,391
Don't you have to be at least the CEO to enter without knocking?

346
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:36,511
Ah!

347
00:26:37,691 --> 00:26:40,744
I'm CD Jo Eun Jeong.

348
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,371
Have some cake.

349
00:26:44,371 --> 00:26:46,239
No thanks.

350
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:49,008
Then, eat it later, early in the morning.

351
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:53,446
Aren't you going to the Woowon Group tomorrow?

352
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:56,315
Then, you'll stay up all night doing research.

353
00:26:56,316 --> 00:26:59,986
So, wouldn't you need something sweet?

354
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,723
Rather than something sweet...

355
00:27:03,724 --> 00:27:05,157
Yes! Ma'am.

356
00:27:05,158 --> 00:27:07,794
I need alone time.

357
00:27:10,431 --> 00:27:12,565
No!

358
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:17,637
We have to do it together.

359
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:23,142
We're a team. Besides, it gets lonely to work alone.

360
00:27:25,546 --> 00:27:27,313
We?

361
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,716
You're feeling high since you've become a CD?

362
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:31,659
Of course.

363
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:34,820
When there's good news, you're high, and when there's bad news, you're down.

364
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:37,924
Isn't life like that?

365
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,094
Don't you get tired when you live like that?

366
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:43,830
How so?

367
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,767
Laughing, crying, being happy, being sad...

368
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:49,368
It's a waste of energy.

369
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,070
It's tiring.

370
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:56,840
But should we live without emotions so that we don't get tired or waste our energy?

371
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,046
Come on, humans aren't robots.

372
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:06,986
That's why we need such sweet things in life.

373
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,090
 Ah, yes, yes. I'm almost there. 

374
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,859
 Yes! 

375
00:28:20,254 --> 00:28:21,834
 Huh? 

376
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,130
 Excuse me. 

377
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,042
 Wait!  Are you okay? 

378
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,978
 Excuse me. 

379
00:28:31,978 --> 00:28:33,712
 119. 

380
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:38,117
 Pardon? 

381
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:44,190
 This? 

382
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,033
 Are you okay? 

383
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,637
 CD Go Ah In? 

384
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,920
   

385
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,688
If we only eat bitter things when life is already so bitter,

386
00:29:15,688 --> 00:29:18,591
where would we get the strength to carry on?

387
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:26,366
If you don't like sweet things... Ah!

388
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:31,537
At least have this later on.

389
00:29:32,172 --> 00:29:36,342
I actually detest this thing. Sugar-free candy.

390
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:40,180
I don't know why anyone would make candies without sugar,

391
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,516
but, anyway, this isn't sweet.

392
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:48,354
Then, I'll get going.

393
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,510
The more I see her, the more I can't decide

394
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,879
whether she's dumb or smart.

395
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,936
Did she get off work?

396
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,760
   

397
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,180
If I could see her face,

398
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,540
even just once...

399
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,620
Goodbye.

400
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,656
CD Eun Jeong!

401
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:58,357
Are you really going?

402
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,515
Are you just going to go on the day you became a CD?

403
00:31:00,515 --> 00:31:02,895
You think I want to go home?

404
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:05,732
Let's see how much money our team has left...

405
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:10,055
Away, away with the evil spirits, away!

406
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:12,705
- Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

407
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,946
Excuse me.

408
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:26,986
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

409
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:29,356
Yes, what is it?

410
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,123
Do you work here?

411
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,659
Yes, but why?

412
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:37,030
What time do people get off work here?

413
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,920
Ah... this place, um... There's no fixed time for that.

414
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,337
Pardon?

415
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:49,674
You don't get off work or have weekends at an ad agency. However, why do you ask?

416
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:54,814
Never mind, it's just that the lights are always on.

417
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:01,220
Then, what about people of high rank?

418
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,023
Like the executives?

419
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,966
That's case-by-case.

420
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:11,631
Ah, except for one person, all the high-ranking folks get off on time.

421
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:16,870
Is that exception Senior Director Go Ah In by chance?

422
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,040
Huh? How do you know our senior director?

423
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,272
Ah... I've seen her on TV.

424
00:32:25,272 --> 00:32:28,080
Well, thank you.

425
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,682
Sure.

426
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,570
♫  When the world turns its back  ♫

427
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:49,580
♫  Tell me I'm on your side  ♫

428
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,382
She's wearing herself out...

429
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:06,652
trying to cover for her parents as well.

430
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,544
It's my fault.

431
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,529
It's my fault.

432
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:24,740
♫  Tell me there is someone who knows me  ♫

433
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:34,340
♫  Love yourself and believe myself  ♫

434
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:41,540
♫  I know everything but there are times when I don't  ♫

435
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:50,610
♫  Don't give up, always be happy  ♫

436
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:57,610
♫  Even if I sit down when I am told to get up  ♫

437
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:19,088
No matter what the message is, it will be received negatively at this time.

438
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,267
 Sir, 

439
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,470
 can't we cover up the company's negative issues by delivering positive messages? 

440
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:35,374
 How? 

441
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:41,247
 Um... Youth, future, hope. 

442
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:46,382
 Can't we play some sounds of birds flying and add a few dreamy pictures to the scene? 

443
00:34:46,382 --> 00:34:49,723
 You really think people are that simple? 

444
00:34:49,723 --> 00:34:54,457
 It's the volume that matters, even if you agree on that one. 

445
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:59,030
 Why are you trying to turn down this huge client that others are dying to get hold of? 

446
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,368
 If we do this, our year-end performance-based rewards... 

447
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,630
 Cover it up? 

448
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,110
 Yes. 

449
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:18,344
 Okay, let's say this water is the negative issues 

450
00:35:18,345 --> 00:35:21,954
 and these tissues are ad volume or media expenses. 

451
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,158
 A billion won? 

452
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,328
 It's not enough. 

453
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:30,863
 2 billion, 3 billion... 

454
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,134
 Still not enough? 

455
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:38,071
 Then, 4 billion, 5 billion... 

456
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,706
 50 billion. 

457
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,889
 100 billion! 

458
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:48,181
 How's that? 

459
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,660
 You cleaned up all the water, didn't you? 

460
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,510
 Of course. 

461
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,487
 So, we can cover it up with volume. 

462
00:35:54,487 --> 00:35:59,522
 Right. But here's an important fact. 

463
00:35:59,522 --> 00:36:02,461
 This water will disappear by tomorrow anyway. 

464
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:04,997
 It dries up and disappears. 

465
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,235
 At that point... 

466
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,852
 Like this. 

467
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:20,410
 If we make a pretty message 

468
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,940
 and present it? 

469
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:29,055
 So, we should wait for the negative issues to die down 

470
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:32,358
 and plant a positive message with a small amount of money? 

471
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:36,190
 Would you spend an astronomical amount to create this dirty corporate image 

472
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,400
 or spend a little and create this lovely corporate image? 

473
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,006
 See which side is greener before lying down. 

474
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,977
 If you want to do this, do it alone. 

475
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:55,748
 I can't tell the client to waste their money like this. 

476
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,119
 Then. 

477
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:06,923
 What if they are willing to pay whatever it costs to cover up negative issues? 

478
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,044
 That method... 

479
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,052
 It's a secret. 

480
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,332
Once you get a taste of something sweet, it's hard to stop.

481
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:23,035
That's a bit better.

482
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,616
What on earth is better?

483
00:38:36,616 --> 00:38:41,654
At least the disposition of the assigned judge is better?

484
00:38:41,654 --> 00:38:47,059
Are you telling me to stay here and go to trial?

485
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,396
It will be difficult this time, sir.

486
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:51,531
Why?

487
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:54,734
Before, it would've been better to quickly go through the first trial...

488
00:38:54,734 --> 00:38:57,003
- Hey, legal officer. 
 - Yes.

489
00:38:57,003 --> 00:39:01,007
Cut the intro and get to the point.

490
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,643
Yes. After the first trial, we could wait for a presidential pardon

491
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:06,279
or a special pardon on National Liberation Day.

492
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:07,627
But the possibility of that these days...

493
00:39:07,627 --> 00:39:09,722
What about sick bail?

494
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,251
That won't be easy either, sir.

495
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:16,202
The moment you appear in a wheelchair in front of the press, netizens will mock you.

496
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:20,295
Then are you telling me to just complete my sentence?

497
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:24,096
- Sir. 
 - Why do you think I gave all that money to the law firm every year?

498
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:27,634
It was insurance for this kind of situation!

499
00:39:27,634 --> 00:39:29,502
But the prosecutor in charge is quite...

500
00:39:29,502 --> 00:39:32,138
I know he's a lunatic!

501
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,646
   

502
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:51,402
You can't come out unless the world turns upside down.

503
00:39:51,402 --> 00:39:56,419
   

504
00:39:56,419 --> 00:40:00,479
   

505
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,014
Beaten from above, ignored from below.

506
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,152
Damn. I won't be able to do this...

507
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:25,572
If Chairman Kang's side pulls the string a bit, won't that untangle the knot?

508
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:30,260
Their rights and interests are tied together, so he will probably act like this is his case.

509
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,233
He will act like this is his case, but it's not his case.

510
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,537
I hear that you have a meeting with the ad agencies.

511
00:40:37,537 --> 00:40:38,672
Yes.

512
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:41,708
Have you found a way?

513
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:46,143
This isn't a situation for finding a way, but for making one.

514
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:48,748
Will you be able to make a way?

515
00:40:48,748 --> 00:40:50,950
I cannot say.

516
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,977
I can only count on the possibility.

517
00:40:53,977 --> 00:40:56,589
Possibility?

518
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:01,657
To cover up negative articles, we have to increase ad expenses and spend money on the press.

519
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:02,762
Yes.

520
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:07,630
If we're going to spend money, we might as well spend it properly.

521
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,435
What do you mean?

522
00:41:09,435 --> 00:41:12,438
Anyone can block a negative message.

523
00:41:12,438 --> 00:41:16,042
A true expert creates a message.

524
00:41:16,042 --> 00:41:20,113
A message that can overturn public opinion.

525
00:41:20,113 --> 00:41:21,514
What kind of message is that?

526
00:41:21,514 --> 00:41:24,750
The agency people will come up with that.

527
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,654
We pay them a hefty sum to do that.

528
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:32,391
Do you think it's possible?

529
00:41:33,727 --> 00:41:37,063
Isn't this "a country where miracles often happen"?

530
00:42:27,514 --> 00:42:29,482
I'm not buying it.

531
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:32,217
 That's a pretty random thing to say. 

532
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:36,289
Aren't all ad people out to sell things anyway?

533
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:38,257
 Are you busy? 

534
00:42:39,493 --> 00:42:43,596
There are so many customers I might need to hire someone.

535
00:42:43,597 --> 00:42:46,933
 Don't lie through your teeth. 

536
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,520
   

537
00:42:58,479 --> 00:43:01,514
Why do you close so early?

538
00:43:01,514 --> 00:43:04,917
How can you get by if you do business like this?

539
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,943
The weather is nice. Shall we grab a drink somewhere?

540
00:43:15,943 --> 00:43:20,032
No, I have a meeting with a client in the morning.

541
00:43:28,776 --> 00:43:33,980
Beep-beep. The water's boiling.

542
00:43:34,748 --> 00:43:39,349
Just spit it out already. Why? Did you come to borrow money?

543
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,320
I'm dirt poor.

544
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,837
Senior,

545
00:43:45,717 --> 00:43:49,462
the Woowon Group is going to do a corporate PR ad,

546
00:43:49,462 --> 00:43:52,166
but I can't figure out why.

547
00:43:52,166 --> 00:43:56,870
Well, I can't figure it out either.

548
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,939
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

549
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:02,675
And I'm not in the moodto think about ads.

550
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,445
Just great...

551
00:44:06,446 --> 00:44:11,618
You won't die. Just give up if you can't do it.

552
00:44:11,618 --> 00:44:13,319
It's an important presentation.

553
00:44:13,319 --> 00:44:15,121
All presentations are important.

554
00:44:15,121 --> 00:44:18,791
It's over for me if I lose this. So, please...

555
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:36,906
They're swamped with negative issues now, so I can't understand why they're doing a PR ad at this time...

556
00:44:37,778 --> 00:44:41,448
Looks like I have another stray cat to feed.

557
00:44:41,448 --> 00:44:43,015
What?

558
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:48,849
Or is it a lion, not a cat?

559
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:51,824
Who? Me?

560
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:55,461
Is it fate?

561
00:44:58,298 --> 00:45:03,804
Tomorrow, tomorrow, okay, tomorrow! I'll look at the articles when I wake up.

562
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:06,172
I'll pay you. As a freelancer.

563
00:45:06,173 --> 00:45:08,700
Huh? You...

564
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,144
"Thank you, I'll buy you dinner."

565
00:45:11,144 --> 00:45:12,913
Shouldn't you say something like that?

566
00:45:12,913 --> 00:45:15,548
Just help me come up with the concept.

567
00:45:17,684 --> 00:45:20,587
You really haven't changed.

568
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:21,989
I'll call you.

569
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:26,326
It's cold. Go home and rest.

570
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:44,243
I heard she dealt you a blow.

571
00:45:45,479 --> 00:45:48,014
Are you going to remain beaten?

572
00:45:48,808 --> 00:45:51,161
Or will you get even?

573
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,421
Is there a way?

574
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:12,271
How can an ad agency do something even the legal team can't?

575
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:13,673
Why not?

576
00:46:13,673 --> 00:46:15,708
Don't you guys do political ads as well?

577
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:18,344
You join presidential camps during elections as well.

578
00:46:24,551 --> 00:46:28,921
Forget it. Just drink up.

579
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:36,363
Chang Soo, this order came directly from the Grand Chairman.

580
00:46:36,363 --> 00:46:41,434
If you sort this out, you'll be in a different league.

581
00:46:45,830 --> 00:46:48,390
   

582
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:51,030
   

583
00:47:00,721 --> 00:47:02,856
When do you go to Woowon?

584
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:05,124
Soon.

585
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:12,261
I'll be forming a TF team with CD Won Hee, so study up while I'm at the meeting.

586
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:14,433
All right.

587
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,238
Did you get some sleep?

588
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:23,743
You were up all night doing research, weren't you?

589
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:27,246
When did we ever get enough sleep?

590
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:30,117
I'll drive you to Woowon.

591
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:33,553
That's alright. Someone else will drive me.

592
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:43,096
Jeez, how uncomfortable.

593
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:46,934
Are you and I in a position to ride in the same car?

594
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:50,968
You could have taken your own car. Why are you getting a ride with me?

595
00:47:50,968 --> 00:47:53,973
There isn't a drop of oil in this country.

596
00:47:55,375 --> 00:48:01,981
Let's not spoil things due to personal feelings.

597
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:08,354
So, the creative team can't handle this by themselves?

598
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:14,361
If you're going to beg for favors, do it properly.

599
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:18,912
Since you can't find a way, you need the project team's help. Isn't that it?

600
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:23,904
Did you grow up walking on eggshells like me?

601
00:48:23,904 --> 00:48:27,408
- What? 
 - You catch on quickly.

602
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:31,758
I'm tired, so I'm going to catch a wink. Wake me up when we arrive.

603
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:37,050
Hey! I'm not your driver!

604
00:48:37,951 --> 00:48:40,253
Gosh, what is this?

605
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:50,763
 I need his help to figure out the client's motives. 

606
00:48:59,506 --> 00:49:05,344
 I need her help to win this presentation. 

607
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:22,395
I knew you'd come in the same car.

608
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:25,898
It's been a while.

609
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,080
 Write them until you get sick of it. 

610
00:49:30,648 --> 00:49:34,806
 Even if your boss gets sick of reading them, keep going until they can't say you're bad at writing copies anymore. 

611
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,577
 Don't run away and keep trying! 

612
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:44,917
I heard that you two fight like cats and dogs at work.

613
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:47,755
Why do you ride in the same car?

614
00:49:47,755 --> 00:49:49,689
Because Go Ah In is something else.

615
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,592
I knew she'd make sure to get a ride with Chang Soo.

616
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:53,926
What are you saying?

617
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:56,289
They have to ride in the same car.

618
00:49:56,289 --> 00:49:59,098
Because if you run away, you lose.

619
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,833
I don't know what you're saying.

620
00:50:00,834 --> 00:50:02,755
Go easy, okay? Go easy.

621
00:50:02,755 --> 00:50:04,504
Find another job if you want to go easy.

622
00:50:04,504 --> 00:50:06,005
It's been a while. How's life?

623
00:50:06,006 --> 00:50:08,847
Life was pretty good until I saw your face.

624
00:50:08,847 --> 00:50:11,678
I don't want to live anymore.

625
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,280
You're still as rigid as ever.

626
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,649
It's been a while.

627
00:50:15,649 --> 00:50:17,651
It's better not to see each other often, isn't it?

628
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:20,253
I heard that 5 companies were invited.

629
00:50:20,254 --> 00:50:21,621
Two places dropped out.

630
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:27,474
I also wanted to drop out, but the company wants me to say hello.

631
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:29,516
Right?

632
00:50:29,516 --> 00:50:32,064
Don't do ads right now.

633
00:50:32,065 --> 00:50:34,768
What else is there to say?

634
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:36,637
Agreed?

635
00:50:36,637 --> 00:50:40,239
Catch up with each other. I'm going to work.

636
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:44,878
She's the same as ever. She's the only great one.

637
00:50:44,878 --> 00:50:46,478
Let's go!

638
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:56,789
Give that here.

639
00:50:58,625 --> 00:51:03,030
For the Woowon project, we're going to make a TF team.

640
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:04,730
The 4 of us?

641
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah. Since it's a difficult case

642
00:51:07,201 --> 00:51:10,137
and our team members haven't been appointed yet.

643
00:51:10,137 --> 00:51:11,370
What should we start with?

644
00:51:11,371 --> 00:51:14,134
First, we'll gather some corporate PR ads

645
00:51:14,134 --> 00:51:17,545
- and overseas cases... 
 - No, right?

646
00:51:17,545 --> 00:51:20,313
There aren't any. This type of case overseas?

647
00:51:20,314 --> 00:51:21,948
I'll collect materials about the Woowon side.

648
00:51:21,949 --> 00:51:25,419
Then, I'll go for flashy references.

649
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:26,796
Okay, let's get started.

650
00:51:26,797 --> 00:51:29,323
The client will throw something our way.

651
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:31,590
Right?

652
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,260
There's nothing we can give you.

653
00:51:40,734 --> 00:51:45,506
There are no guidelines for the corporate PR ad?

654
00:51:45,506 --> 00:51:46,740
None.

655
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,144
You mean, it's all up to the agencies, without even a briefing?

656
00:51:51,144 --> 00:51:53,246
That's correct.

657
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:11,564
I'm not sure if I may ask this...

658
00:52:11,564 --> 00:52:13,966
Please, feel free.

659
00:52:13,966 --> 00:52:18,437
You're not preparing for a large M&amp;A. Right?

660
00:52:20,074 --> 00:52:23,841
I'm asking because some companies have done corporate PR ads to boost their brand value

661
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:27,480
while they're secretly preparing for an M&amp;A.

662
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,316
If that's the case...

663
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:34,420
No. There are no plans for that. None at all.

664
00:52:36,356 --> 00:52:41,360
Senior Director Go, if you have something to say, speak frankly.

665
00:52:45,732 --> 00:52:49,602
This is quite a special situation.

666
00:52:49,602 --> 00:52:51,604
Go on.

667
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:58,878
This corporate PR ad could also form negative public opinion.

668
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:05,985
We will not hold the agency liable for that.

669
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:15,224
Along with that, if there is no usable message, we will use the billing to increase the existing ad volume.

670
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:20,665
Of course, the volume will be given to the agency that made the best proposal.

671
00:53:20,665 --> 00:53:24,370
From the agency's perspective, it's a positive offer.

672
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:27,307
I've removed the risk factors.

673
00:53:27,307 --> 00:53:30,243
But there's not a lot of time.

674
00:53:30,243 --> 00:53:33,779
When's the deadline for the presentation?

675
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:36,415
I'll give you a week.

676
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,686
Pardon?

677
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:42,588
It will be impossible to edit references.

678
00:53:42,588 --> 00:53:46,426
You may just present key copies and key images.

679
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:49,895
What's important is the message.

680
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,667
This is crazy.

681
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:05,044
Why should we do Woowon's work?

682
00:54:05,044 --> 00:54:09,636
Why? A company does the work it receives.

683
00:54:09,636 --> 00:54:13,638
If we do Woowon's ad, Seo Jeong will be Party A and I'll be Party B.

684
00:54:13,638 --> 00:54:15,688
Right?

685
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:22,795
Right. In terms of the contract.

686
00:54:22,795 --> 00:54:24,530
What's this world coming to?

687
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:30,266
But my ranking is way higher in the financial circles! How can a wolf work for a dog?

688
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,338
I don't think that's an appropriate phrase.

689
00:54:32,338 --> 00:54:35,174
Why not? It's spot-on.

690
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:42,112
Not all Party B's are the same. You've never been a Party B in life, have you?

691
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,016
Why would I?

692
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:47,820
How should I explain this...

693
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:58,865
If your arm tickles, and I scratch it for you?

694
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:02,516
Why would you scratch my arm? I can do it myself.

695
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:08,977
Exactly. You can do it yourself. Then, I'm truly Party B.

696
00:55:08,977 --> 00:55:13,240
But what if your back itches?

697
00:55:14,246 --> 00:55:19,106
It's driving you insane, but your hands don't reach.

698
00:55:19,106 --> 00:55:22,521
So I scratch it for you.

699
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:26,659
The one who scratches your back is Party A.

700
00:55:31,298 --> 00:55:35,168
Uncanny for sure.

701
00:55:39,807 --> 00:55:43,810
Mr. Park, you don't have a girlfriend. Right?

702
00:55:43,810 --> 00:55:44,678
Pardon?

703
00:55:44,678 --> 00:55:50,156
You definitely don't, right? It's not like you found one yesterday or will find one today. Right?

704
00:55:50,156 --> 00:55:52,818
Why are you suddenly talking nonsense?

705
00:55:52,818 --> 00:55:55,354
Answer. Quickly.

706
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:02,795
I don't. Nor do I plan to have one.

707
00:56:04,452 --> 00:56:08,768
 The more I see you, the more I can't give you to someone else! 

708
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:19,079
Good, let's have a fling!

709
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,613
What?

710
00:56:23,044 --> 00:56:26,352
- I'll see you on the presentation day. 
 - See you then.

711
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:29,887
Hey, Choi Chang Soo and Go Ah In. Let's play fair.

712
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:34,274
Can we play fair? When our skill levels are not fair?

713
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:38,331
Go Ah In, isn't that a double-edged sword?

714
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:42,602
The worst on the other side, the best on my side.

715
00:56:42,602 --> 00:56:44,570
An incorrigible character as well.

716
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:46,839
Take her if you like her so much.

717
00:56:46,839 --> 00:56:48,775
No way. I can't handle her.

718
00:56:48,775 --> 00:56:52,362
VC Communications people are tight.

719
00:56:52,362 --> 00:56:54,247
It's terrible to see.

720
00:57:09,724 --> 00:57:14,100
No, that's not allowed.

721
00:57:15,613 --> 00:57:17,410
Never with me.

722
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:19,400
What are you saying?

723
00:57:21,508 --> 00:57:24,644
Why would I have a fling with you?

724
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:30,740
You're already mine, who has a fling with their own thing?

725
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,689
This is a chance to make these lowly senior directors sweat.

726
00:57:37,891 --> 00:57:40,493
Ah, that fling?

727
00:57:44,331 --> 00:57:47,934
Why? You want to have a fling with me?

728
00:57:47,934 --> 00:57:52,972
I don't think you should fool around with someone else's livelihood.

729
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:55,775
Fine. You're so serious.

730
00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:59,078
Give Senior Director Choi and Senior Director Go a call.

731
00:58:00,414 --> 00:58:02,615
What should I tell them?

732
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:08,888
Yes.

733
00:58:15,696 --> 00:58:18,998
All right. Yes.

734
00:58:18,998 --> 00:58:21,267
Sounds like the same call.

735
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:23,102
Let's go.

736
00:58:25,706 --> 00:58:29,308
Since you came uncomfortably, go back comfortably.

737
00:58:44,484 --> 00:58:46,826
For real.

738
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:02,865
Damn it.

739
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,585
Let's hold a kick-off meeting after I meet with Senior Director Hanna.

740
00:59:12,585 --> 00:59:14,321
Okay.

741
00:59:14,321 --> 00:59:17,107
Did the client give a briefing?

742
00:59:19,674 --> 00:59:21,909
- No. 
 - What?

743
00:59:21,909 --> 00:59:23,048
 Nothing. 

744
00:59:23,048 --> 00:59:25,431
They told the agencies it's up to us.

745
00:59:26,767 --> 00:59:28,668
What kind of presentation...

746
00:59:28,668 --> 00:59:30,002
I'll tell you once I get there.

747
00:59:30,002 --> 00:59:32,238
Okay.

748
00:59:32,238 --> 00:59:36,039
What did she say? They didn't send anything.

749
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:40,427
The client didn't give us anything and said it was up to the agencies.

750
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:42,181
What?

751
00:59:47,321 --> 00:59:51,090
This is that. They won't use this ad anyway.

752
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:56,492
Right? It sounds like that, doesn't it? A test to check our skills before changing agencies.

753
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:58,498
They always do this.

754
00:59:58,498 --> 01:00:02,366
They get corporate PR ad proposals and say, "Let's check your skills first."

755
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:06,237
Little do they know that we pull all-nighters for weeks. Ah, such a letdown.

756
01:00:06,237 --> 01:00:09,309
Let's hold a meeting once the senior director gets here.

757
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:18,851
 The executive director himself held a meeting 

758
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:24,090
 Hello, I'm Woowon Group's Executive Director of Marketing, Hwang Seok Woo. 

759
01:00:24,090 --> 01:00:27,927
 with the agencies he invited, and... 

760
01:00:27,927 --> 01:00:30,630
 I'll give you one week. 

761
01:00:30,630 --> 01:00:34,267
 He can only give us one week. 

762
01:00:35,496 --> 01:00:40,340
Obviously, they can't afford to test our skills now.

763
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:46,045
Are you going to test them?

764
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:50,760
In terms of skills, aren't they the best in the industry?

765
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:56,324
Not that. The test my grandfather suggested.

766
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:58,992
What's that?

767
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:03,696
Give them a project that you wouldn't be able to manage.

768
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:05,164
If they succeed, keep them by your side.

769
01:01:05,164 --> 01:01:08,876
If they can't, it's goodbye forever.

770
01:01:08,876 --> 01:01:11,905
If I make them scratch my back,

771
01:01:11,905 --> 01:01:16,276
I'll find out who's on my side and who will have to go.

772
01:01:17,111 --> 01:01:19,345
What does that...

773
01:01:22,663 --> 01:01:28,230
Are you thinking of joining hands with the winner?

774
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:33,092
I doubt she wants to meet us to give us encouragement.

775
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:38,620
Does she want a piece of the pie because it involves the family's future in-laws?

776
01:01:39,995 --> 01:01:45,580
Well, even Kang Hanna has to show some results to the chairman.

777
01:01:46,271 --> 01:01:51,218
Of course. Could I ever become a tycoon standing beside a loser?

778
01:01:56,683 --> 01:01:59,385
We're always the same.

779
01:02:02,089 --> 01:02:06,209
The winning side is our side.

780
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:18,790


781
01:02:20,634 --> 01:02:23,791
   

782
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:33,190
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

783
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:39,440
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

784
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,120
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

785
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:50,202
 I've made just one mistake in my career of 25 years, 

786
01:02:50,202 --> 01:02:51,838
 I think it was you, Go Ah In. 

787
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:53,023
 Just one mistake? 

788
01:02:53,023 --> 01:02:55,320
 I've seen a couple. 

789
01:02:56,108 --> 01:03:00,012
 Is this within the influence of advertising? 

790
01:03:00,012 --> 01:03:04,250
 If you have to choose between Senior Director Choi and Senior Director Go, 

791
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:07,053
 who would you choose? 

792
01:03:07,053 --> 01:03:09,188
 Won't they be more grateful to the owner who fed them 

793
01:03:09,188 --> 01:03:12,291
 if I give this to the side that's hungrier? 

794
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:14,060
 It's the most important presentation of my life. 

795
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:16,863
 If you lose this presentation, your CEO position will be at risk. 

796
01:03:16,863 --> 01:03:18,632
 Throw it. 

797
01:03:19,933 --> 01:03:22,500
 Give it to the hungrier beast. 

798
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,570
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫
