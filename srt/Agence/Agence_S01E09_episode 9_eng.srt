1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,935
   

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:17,040


3
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,139
The letter has been written.

4
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:43,530
   

5
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,118
Your Honor, you're the first to clock in again.

6
00:00:52,118 --> 00:00:56,536
How can a civil servant that gets paid by the people be lazy?

7
00:00:56,536 --> 00:00:57,987
If you'll excuse me.

8
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,493
Have a great day at work.

9
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:02,595
- Yes, sir! 
 - Yes, sir!

10
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,432
It's a shame he stays at court all day.

11
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:10,870
Someone like him should be doing something more important in Yeouido.

12
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,607
I hope you like the letter I'm going to send you.

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,163
A miracle.

14
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:22,648
That's what I need most right now.

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:32,619
   

16
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:35,862
   

17
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,267
Oh, I'm so proud of you! You did that in such a short time!

18
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:47,206
Great job!

19
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:49,075
Do you want to die?

20
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,712
It was worth making you all creative directors.

21
00:01:52,712 --> 00:01:54,981
Go home and get ready. Let's meet in front of Woowon Group.

22
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,617
Aren't you going to go home?

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,755
I need to go get Senior Director Hanna's review.

24
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,324
Would the chairman's daughter know what she was looking at?

25
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:07,727
- You still don't know? 
 - What?

26
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:12,298
Reviews should be done by someone who doesn't know anything.

27
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,569
You're going to take this, right?

28
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,096
Great job, everyone.

29
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,522
Now, who wants to go first?

30
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,203
Senior Director Go, why are you empty-handed?

31
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,206
Oh, the edits haven't been finished yet.

32
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,509
Are you going to get a review without the video?

33
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,512
No, I don't need a review.

34
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,986
You agreed to a review on the morning of the presentation.

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,089
Not everything goes according to plan.

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,999
You weren't able to finish by the promised time.

37
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:23,302
Can I assume that you lost?

38
00:03:23,302 --> 00:03:28,906
The promised time is 1:00 p.m., at Woowon Group's conference room.

39
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,445
Go ahead. You have my complete attention.

40
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:45,060
This is a competition. Who would show their hand alone?

41
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:53,266
I don't have a second to spare. So if you'll all excuse me.

42
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,872
- Senior Director Hanna? 
 - Yeah?

43
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:02,474
If you're curious, come to Woowon yourself and take a look.

44
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:05,645
Me? Why would I?

45
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,783
 See you on the day of the presentation. 

46
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,018
 Will you be coming, too? 

47
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:15,354
 Of course. 

48
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:24,063
It's more fun to watch something yourself, isn't it?

49
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,251
Senior Director Choi, let's cancel today's review.

50
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,029
It seems like Go Ah In is trying to screw me over again.

51
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,201
She definitely has something.

52
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:07,863
I can see her intentions, but I don't see her goal.

53
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,777
I have a hunch.

54
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,579
What is it?

55
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:15,681
That I'll regret it if I don't go.

56
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,416
Then let's go.

57
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,254
It wouldn't be strange for an executive of the ad agency to go to the presentation.

58
00:05:22,254 --> 00:05:28,053
You wouldn't be the main character if you miss the most important part.

59
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,734
Okay! Let's go and see how well she did.

60
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,396
If it's lousy and she wasted my time...

61
00:05:37,396 --> 00:05:39,705
You can teach her a lesson.

62
00:05:39,705 --> 00:05:42,608
Let's go to Woowon!

63
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,182
I was up all night. What am I doing?

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,756
He's probably at kindergarten now.

65
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:58,691
Ow, my back.

66
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,800
I feel like death.

67
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:28,887
Huh? Mom!

68
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:32,191
Ah Ji, why didn't you go to school yet?

69
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,463
Oh, he has a slight cold, so I didn't send him.

70
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:39,331
Oh, is that so?

71
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:41,901
Are you done working now?

72
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,572
Well, the presentation is today. It's over after that.

73
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:49,808
Does that mean you don't have to go to work tomorrow?

74
00:06:49,808 --> 00:06:55,379
Huh? That... Well...

75
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:58,684
Uh... Yeah. I guess you could say that.

76
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,787
But I can't say that it isn't for sure.

77
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:06,926
I also maybe don't think it's too much to say that.

78
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,427
Huh?

79
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,199
It's late. I have to shower and get back.

80
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,618
 I'll try hard not to disappoint you. 

81
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:11,514
 It's one year. Don't you think things will settle down after a year? 

82
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:18,476
Wearing this feels uncomfortable,

83
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:23,002
but not wearing it will hurt my pride.

84
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,300
- Is the senior director here yet? 
 - Not yet.

85
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,855
I just went to the bathroom, but I want to go again.

86
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,757
Do you have a prostate problem?

87
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:47,726
A woman doesn't have a prostate!

88
00:08:47,726 --> 00:08:49,628
- They don't? 
 - What's wrong with you?

89
00:08:49,628 --> 00:08:51,330
Of course not. Just like how you have no knowledge!

90
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,844
Incredible. He even tried to pet his superior's head.

91
00:08:56,844 --> 00:09:01,805
I'm not even the one doing the presentation, so why am I so nervous?

92
00:09:01,805 --> 00:09:03,642
It's not like this is our first rodeo.

93
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:04,780
Are you kidding?

94
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,340
Come on.

95
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,682
What's this? Am I the only one that's scared?

96
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,906
So none of you need to take this sedative?

97
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:23,195
Give me half.

98
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,764
- Half of a half. 
 - Me too.

99
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,635
Let's see.

100
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,973
Half.

101
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,276
Half of a half and half of a half.

102
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,330
Hello!

103
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:46,210
Hello!

104
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,256
What are you eating?

105
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,757
Oh!

106
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,628
This one's for you.

107
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:58,330
Why? Are you nervous?

108
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,433
What? A little...

109
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,268
Are you the one presenting?

110
00:10:03,268 --> 00:10:08,073
We're a team. Of course, we're nervous.

111
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,644
It'll become a habit.

112
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,749
- What? 
 - Avoiding things because you're scared.

113
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:20,219
If you're nervous, you should move forward in that state to overcome it.

114
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,988
If avoiding things becomes a habit it then turns into trauma.

115
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,140
What are you doing? Let's go.

116
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,830
Yes, Ma'am.

117
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh.

118
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:09,968
We'll draw for the presentation order.

119
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,318
Crap. I'm last.

120
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,491
Then we'll proceed with the presentation in this order.

121
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:34,560
Can we switch?

122
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,596
As long as both parties agree.

123
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,564
Do you want to switch?

124
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,439
Would you like to switch?

125
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,909
Yes.

126
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,495
We'll proceed with this order at 1:00 p.m., and each company will have 30 minutes.

127
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:04,189
Let's talk.

128
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,801
Why did you switch with me?

129
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,804
The direction for this type of presentation is obvious.

130
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:21,940
Which says the same thing about the outcome.

131
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,343
You know you'll be at a disadvantage if you go last.

132
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,118
Wait, Go Ah In.

133
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,821
Are you pitying me?

134
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,226
Don't you know the position I'm in? I don't have time to pity you.

135
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:43,028
You're at an advantage to go first.

136
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,998
I'll be at an advantage if I go last. That's all.

137
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,035
You don't have to believe me if you don't want to.

138
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,414
Yes, I understand.

139
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,352
Senior Director Choi presents at 2:00 p.m., and Senior Director Go is at 2:30 p.m.

140
00:13:07,352 --> 00:13:09,688
Then we should get there by 2:00.

141
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,730
What the heck?

142
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,870
What's wrong?

143
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,837
Huh? What's the Vice President doing here?

144
00:13:25,837 --> 00:13:29,041
Why would Kang Han Soo come for the presentation?

145
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,947
- Let's go! 
 - What?

146
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,649
Let's go to the conference room now.

147
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:40,252
Kang Han Soo and Kim Seo Jeong could be working in cahoots.

148
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:42,454
They could give this presentation to a different agency on purpose!

149
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,023
- That won't happen. 
 - Why?

150
00:13:45,023 --> 00:13:47,559
They can't afford that luxury right now.

151
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,199
That's true.

152
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,103
Ugh. I don't know about this.

153
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,605
What?

154
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,541
 If you're curious, come to Woowon yourself and take a look. 

155
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,011
 It's more fun to watch something yourself, isn't it? 

156
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,747
I think she called me here on purpose.

157
00:14:08,747 --> 00:14:11,917
Is she trying to screw me over or help me?

158
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,654
I'm sure about one thing.

159
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,655
What?

160
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,458
I'm sure it'll be beneficial to her.

161
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,894
Then that means I also need to come up with a direction that'll benefit me in this situation.

162
00:14:25,894 --> 00:14:28,433
There is one way.

163
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,002
Give it to me.

164
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,670
   

165
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,160
   

166
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,590
   

167
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,426
May I start the presentation?

168
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,561
Just a moment.

169
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,042
You came. Sit down.

170
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,580
You weren't waiting for me, were you?

171
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,050
No, not at all.

172
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,150
May I begin?

173
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,720
Go ahead.

174
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,701
I will now begin Woowon Group's corporate PR presentation.

175
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,379
   

176
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,822
What was the vibe like?

177
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:58,857
Well, it was dry.

178
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,164
I had no idea who some of the people in there were.

179
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,733
Besides the advertiser?

180
00:16:08,733 --> 00:16:13,738
Yeah, they seemed to have more deciding power than the advertiser.

181
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,782
- Let's have the next team. 
 - Okay.

182
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,052
   

183
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:36,995
Yes, sir?

184
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:47,939
 You haven't presented yet, right? 

185
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,308
I will soon.

186
00:16:50,308 --> 00:16:55,210
I just heard something. There are Woowon Groups attorneys at the presentation.

187
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:57,582
Hmm. That's not bad.

188
00:16:57,582 --> 00:16:59,400
I feel the same way.

189
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,053
I'll be waiting for good news.

190
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:04,156
Okay, bye.

191
00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,596
The companies going first are probably having a hard time.

192
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,069
That concludes our presentation.

193
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,772
Are there any questions?

194
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,447
Then, that'll be the end of it.

195
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,243
Hello. I'm Choi Chang Soo, the Chief Project Officer of VC Communications.

196
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,747
Vice President?

197
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,285
It's nice to meet you.

198
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,090
Oh, yes.

199
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,716
Since this presentation is more important than others, that must be why you're...

200
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:19,264
I'm here to observe!

201
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,623
Goodness!

202
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,079
What's the Vice President doing here?

203
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,082
Am I not allowed to be here?

204
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:41,247
Of course you are. We're a family.

205
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,811
Sit down. I heard you were coming so I got you a seat.

206
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,660
Did you watch from the beginning?

207
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,470
Yeah.

208
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,277
This problem is serious.

209
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,479
What problem?

210
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,430
VC Communications is involved in this, and the Vice President of VC Group is here.

211
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:17,556
But he was present for other companies' presentations?

212
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,925
That means that even if our company wins with skill alone,

213
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:24,028
people will think that we won with our connections, won't they?

214
00:19:24,028 --> 00:19:27,365
They'll say a conglomerate was on a power trip.

215
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:28,945
Don't you think?

216
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,984
They'll say it was very inappropriate if the media got wind of this.

217
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,852
But...

218
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,789
I'll let it slide.

219
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:53,959
We're a family, right?

220
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,234
My chair.

221
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,172
Can you make some room?

222
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,246
Ugh, it's so cramped.

223
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,351
What else can I do about it in our tiny nation?

224
00:20:56,022 --> 00:21:00,659
Now, shall we see our employee's skills?

225
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,181
The last team may come in.

226
00:21:29,989 --> 00:21:33,692
Eun Jeong, let's go.

227
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:35,161
Where?

228
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:37,228
Are you not feeling well?

229
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:42,333
No, I'm just so sleepy!

230
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:44,769
How many sedatives did you take?

231
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:46,671
Two?

232
00:21:46,671 --> 00:21:48,573
Why?

233
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:51,443
The senior director didn't want it,

234
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:54,048
and I didn't want to waste it.

235
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,214
- You're out of your mind. 
 - You shouldn't have done that.

236
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:58,839
How could you eat two of those after staying up all night?

237
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,693
Let's go. Hurry.

238
00:22:07,914 --> 00:22:09,928
Great job.

239
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:12,464
- Be careful. 
 - What?

240
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,932
The mood isn't that great.

241
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,435
Complete strangers are asking strange questions.

242
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:18,169
What questions?

243
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,208
Good luck.

244
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:46,130
Did you come here yourself to witness something like this?

245
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:54,372
We have a two-for-one deal. We can talk when this is over.

246
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:57,742
You just waste double the time when you watch two crappy things.

247
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,412
Aren't I right, Executive Director?

248
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:07,220
You wanted us to watch something like this during such a critical time?

249
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,321
Should these people waste their entire day?

250
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,205
It's been a while, Senior Director Go.

251
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:30,108
Yes, sir. It's nice to see you again.

252
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,410
Are you well-prepared?

253
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,174
Yes, for this presentation...

254
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:39,049
Who are you to tell me what to do?

255
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,633
Me? The Vice President.

256
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,855
I make the final decision for this presentation.

257
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,891
How dare you?

258
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:50,397
VC Communications is number one in the industry even if we don't do this presentation.

259
00:23:50,397 --> 00:23:51,963
Then don't do it!

260
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:55,766
Who would be at more of a loss if we don't?

261
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,458
Party B.

262
00:23:57,458 --> 00:24:01,539
Really? Did you not know the person scratching the back was Party A?

263
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:03,042
What are you talking about?

264
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:06,045
- Moron. 
 - What?

265
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:15,086
Yeah, sure. It's so foul that I won't do it.

266
00:24:16,689 --> 00:24:19,891
Ow! Ahhh! It hurts!

267
00:24:30,436 --> 00:24:32,204
Did you all see that?

268
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:35,540
We sacrificed our sleep to prepare for this presentation.

269
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,744
May I start the presentation that we worked so hard on?

270
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,778
Yes, go ahead.

271
00:24:40,778 --> 00:24:43,215
Before I do that, let's settle things.

272
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:46,687
- Eun Jeong. 
 - Yes?

273
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:51,589
Those who make a fuss don't deserve to sit in here, do they?

274
00:24:57,232 --> 00:25:01,366
You. Get out!

275
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,674
Darn it.

276
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,290
   

277
00:25:23,624 --> 00:25:26,958
They say the world will change like this post-COVID.

278
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,260
Go ahead and read it.

279
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,637
It's about trends and the topic of the times.

280
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:41,940
I'm sure you heard about it all day.

281
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,045
The proposal is completely different from the video concept.

282
00:25:51,691 --> 00:25:53,884
This type of slogan. 
    

283
00:25:53,884 --> 00:25:57,084
I'm sure someone before me already presented it.

284
00:25:57,084 --> 00:26:00,558
- Excuse me? 
 - Yes?

285
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,461
Don't you think you lack sincerity?

286
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:07,565
That's because you're listening without sincerity.

287
00:26:16,642 --> 00:26:19,577
Ugh, I'm so sick of this.

288
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,049
What do you think you're doing?

289
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:31,595
I don't know. What am I doing?

290
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:35,961
We don't need to hear them to know that they're useless.

291
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:37,929
You're right.

292
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:46,604
Is this the useless crap you prepared for a two-for-one deal?

293
00:26:57,483 --> 00:27:00,651
- Senior Director Go! 
 - Turn on the light!

294
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,633
Shall we be more honest?

295
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,503
A negative issue arose with the group,

296
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:22,340
but there's another reason you're preparing a large-scale corporate PR campaign.

297
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:29,181
The reason why VC Group's Vice President and future in-law are both at the meeting.

298
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:33,351
Unknown attorneys from a law firm,

299
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:36,353
the reason they're all here.

300
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:40,349
Since nobody knows the reason, is that why they're all talking in circles?

301
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:45,631
No, it's not that they don't know why.

302
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,367
It's that they don't know how.

303
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:52,811
They're going in circles because they know the problem but not the answer.

304
00:27:52,811 --> 00:27:55,339
So what are you going to do?

305
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:02,447
This is the real start.

306
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:09,320
Starting now, put your leg down and focus while you listen.

307
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:15,359
You'll hurt your back if you hear it sitting in that position.

308
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,470
   

309
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:41,670
   

310
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:54,994
   

311
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:04,742
I can't leave her beside Hanna.

312
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:25,229
I will start the real presentation now!

313
00:29:25,229 --> 00:29:28,120
   

314
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:32,738
   

315
00:29:33,474 --> 00:29:34,407
   

316
00:29:34,407 --> 00:29:40,144
 I lived in prison for 23 years. 

317
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:43,848
Daddy, let's go home.

318
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:51,089
 But now they're saying I'm innocent. I'm innocent. 

319
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:55,625
- Oh, goodness. 
  - That's what the law is like. 

320
00:29:56,962 --> 00:30:00,965
 I was a murderer 23 years ago. 

321
00:30:02,292 --> 00:30:04,768
 But I'm not anymore. 

322
00:30:04,768 --> 00:30:08,539
 What kind of law goes back and forth like that? 

323
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,343
 They said they'd compensate me. 

324
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:19,717
 But how will they compensate 23 years with money? 

325
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,753
 She got married. 

326
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:28,793
 How much? How much is enough? 

327
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:35,333
 How much compensation do I get for not being able to see my daughter grow up? 

328
00:30:36,468 --> 00:30:43,174
23 years. He served one, two, three more after 20.

329
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:50,682
He served 23 years in prison.

330
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,351
But he was innocent?

331
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:57,321
One of the biggest problems in this was the arrest investigation.

332
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,974
Arrest investigation!

333
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:03,027
There are people who are claiming this.

334
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:07,998
We have Attorney Choi Yeong Jae here with us and he specializes in retrials.

335
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:09,434
It's nice to meet you.

336
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,303
Yes, hello.

337
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,984
Compared to the development in European countries,

338
00:31:12,985 --> 00:31:15,427
we have a high amount of arrests in Korea.

339
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:18,809
We refer to it as scoring the goal first and then investigating comfortably.

340
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,977
Scoring a goal?

341
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:21,695
It's a term used among prosecutors.

342
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,414
We say we scored a goal after an arrest.

343
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:24,548
 Goal! 

344
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,486
Keep the broadcast provocative all night.

345
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:31,390
Yes, I heard you started the public opinion poll.

346
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,225
It starts tomorrow.

347
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,028
Okay.

348
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:39,049
As for the number of ads...

349
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:42,334
I'll make sure to fill it for you.

350
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,068
Thank you.

351
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:50,042
♫  In time, I was like a lost child  ♫ 
    

352
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:55,247
♫  I don't want to wake up from a blue dream that resembles you  ♫ 
    

353
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,290
♫  Wake me up turn off the alarm  ♫

354
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:01,787
Yes, hello. This is KR Research.

355
00:32:01,787 --> 00:32:03,287
The law isn't perfect.

356
00:32:03,288 --> 00:32:05,857
This is a public opinion poll for investigations to be made without arrest.

357
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:10,394
 Press one if you agree and two if you disagree. 

358
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,167
 Press one if you agree and two if you disagree. 

359
00:32:14,167 --> 00:32:17,002
- Here, press one! 
 - Of course, it's one!

360
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,602
 The law isn't perfect. 

361
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:23,028
 This is a public opinion poll for investigations to be made without arrest. 

362
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:26,124
   

363
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,720
 8 out of 10 agree that investigations should be done without arrest] 

364
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:36,795
   

365
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,331
   

366
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,527
Hello, sir.

367
00:32:42,527 --> 00:32:46,665
I paved your way to Yeouido. Do you like it?

368
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:48,699
Oh, yes.

369
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:51,603
   

370
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,204
Yes, let's do that.

371
00:32:57,075 --> 00:33:01,445
There is nothing perfect in this world.

372
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:06,150
There's also nothing in the world that doesn't undergo change.

373
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:12,960
With that said, I'd like to apologize for past mistakes on behalf of the jury.

374
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,461
In accordance with the law to uphold common sense.

375
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:21,800
The court considers Kim Woo Won's risk of destroying evidence or fleeing low.

376
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,402
So we hereby grant him bail.

377
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,750
   

378
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,796
Great job!

379
00:33:42,796 --> 00:33:45,723
That's how you use money.

380
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:49,728
Cut the money the law firm uses in half.

381
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,962
Yes, sir.

382
00:33:56,401 --> 00:34:00,913
How can the air be so different behind one wall?

383
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:04,775
Oh, how sweet it is.

384
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:11,582
Sir, how about we order some chicken when we get to your house?

385
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:14,218
Chicken? Why?

386
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,920
   

387
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,156
 My dad doesn't like chicken. 

388
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:23,861
 Let's get a picture of him getting chicken as soon as he was released in the press. 

389
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:27,399
 The public's view of the chairman will change. 

390
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:30,634
 He's not the chairman of a conglomerate out on bail. 

391
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:35,503
 He's just one person who's no different from me and just wants to eat chicken. 

392
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,676
 That's a good idea. 

393
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,546
 Let's do that. 

394
00:34:42,546 --> 00:34:45,182
 Please proceed with the rest as I've said. 

395
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,418
 Okay, besides Woowon Group's CI, 

396
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,321
 I'll handle the press. 

397
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,325
How much is a chicken these days?

398
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:57,394
A little under 20,000 won.

399
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:01,266
This couldn't be solved with two billion won,

400
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,601
but it can be settled with a little under 20,000 won?

401
00:35:04,601 --> 00:35:07,439
- Who is it? 
 - Excuse me?

402
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:10,809
Saying that Hanna did it is a front.

403
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:13,511
I'm sure there was a person in charge!

404
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,013
Would you like to meet her?

405
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,463
Yeah!

406
00:35:17,463 --> 00:35:19,056
Yes.

407
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,841
The chairman of Woowon is out.

408
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,446
 Do you hear me? 

409
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:59,156
I mean, it can't be done with an ad.

410
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:02,227
It can. It really can.

411
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:08,699
Instilling awareness and creating public opinion is our territory.

412
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,636
To be honest, we had our doubts.

413
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,040
We were in awe when we saw the TF Team's creativity!

414
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:19,376
I presented the idea and the senior director just jumped on it!

415
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:23,395
She was able to figure it out right then and there with one go!

416
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:25,149
I see.

417
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:29,119
But why do you have that band-aid on your forehead?

418
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:31,288
Oh.

419
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,360
Thanks for letting me know.

420
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,605
Let's get drinks soon.

421
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,940
If I have time, though I don't know if I can.

422
00:36:51,743 --> 00:36:55,911
That moron. He couldn't figure that one thing out.

423
00:36:56,581 --> 00:37:01,085
Do I throw him away or reuse him?

424
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,032
Let's throw him away!

425
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:19,204
- You'll fire the chief project officer for losing one presentation? 
 - Yes.

426
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:24,074
And you want to use the presentation our company won as the excuse?

427
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:29,379
They agreed that the person to lose this presentation would leave the company!

428
00:37:29,379 --> 00:37:31,982
You didn't ask them to leave?

429
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:38,247
I didn't say it like that, but I guess it was similar.

430
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,593
It's all for the company.

431
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:47,531
I don't think it's for the company, I think it's all for your sake.

432
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,030
"I'm above you."

433
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:53,488
"I dare anyone to challenge me. I'll show you what happens."

434
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:55,572
Isn't that what this is?

435
00:37:55,572 --> 00:37:57,522
Do I look like someone who'd do that?

436
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:00,911
Yes, it seems you already are.

437
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:01,945
No, the thing is...

438
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,283
An employee can be fired over a trivial mistake

439
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,299
or an employee may be able to survive as long as they can read their boss.

440
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,891
Do you know what kind of employees remain at a company like that?

441
00:38:11,891 --> 00:38:13,791
No, I don't!

442
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:17,427
Incompetent employees.

443
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:20,727
The type who know how to brown nose

444
00:38:20,728 --> 00:38:23,187
and get promoted through in-house politics.

445
00:38:23,187 --> 00:38:25,269
At that rate,

446
00:38:25,935 --> 00:38:29,755
the employees who are good at their jobs don't stay at the company.

447
00:38:32,377 --> 00:38:35,679
They don't think they'll have a future, so they leave

448
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:39,650
or they get kicked out because of company politics.

449
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,188
Then what about Senior Director Go?

450
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:47,124
Go Ah In kicked out all the employees that she didn't like!

451
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:51,028
She was the complete opposite.

452
00:38:51,629 --> 00:38:55,433
She fired all the employees that survived through company politics.

453
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:58,318
Also, she never fired anyone.

454
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:01,505
They were appointed to new positions.

455
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:05,042
So you want me to do nothing?

456
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,778
You want me to just sit back and suffer?

457
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:11,215
 Yes, sir? 

458
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,753
Can you buy me a banana milk?

459
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:16,020
Bring a straw.

460
00:39:17,422 --> 00:39:19,890
Uncle!

461
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,229
You don't need to go.

462
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:26,296
She'll calm down soon.

463
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:35,886
If I can't even do that, what can I do without any industry experience?

464
00:39:35,886 --> 00:39:40,155
How do I control these sly foxes? I can't let them drag me around!

465
00:39:40,155 --> 00:39:42,514
Of course not.

466
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:46,016
Then give me a solution!

467
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:48,753
I just did.

468
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:53,023
Senior Director Go appointed them to new positions.

469
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,597
I see...

470
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:06,970
Please approve the documents in that direction.

471
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:11,909
- Arrange the documents! 
 - Okay!

472
00:40:15,813 --> 00:40:17,982
   

473
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:22,700
   

474
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,759
Who got Kim Woo Won out?

475
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:37,200
I should find out who did it, right?

476
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:44,508
Detective, can you find someone for me?

477
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,810
Then, I'll set the mood.

478
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:49,446
Yeah, together. All of us.

479
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,082
She's here.

480
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:58,721
- I'm headed out. 
 - Are you going home?

481
00:40:58,723 --> 00:41:00,224
Yeah, why?

482
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,861
It was a huge presentation.

483
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:07,665
It was incredible.

484
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:10,101
Yeah, it was.

485
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:13,203
We should have a dinner.

486
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:16,892
Yeah, of course. A dinner is the virtue of a true leader!

487
00:41:16,892 --> 00:41:21,109
- Shall I find a restaurant? 
 - This is nice. Shall I make reservations?

488
00:41:21,109 --> 00:41:23,881
Let's go. Come on.

489
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,021
Um, next time.

490
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:36,427
Next time? Not, "Eat without me"?

491
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,461
- Yeah. 
 - Then that next time.

492
00:41:38,461 --> 00:41:44,000
What year, month, day, and time?

493
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,005
When we're not too busy?

494
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,973
I'm off.

495
00:41:49,973 --> 00:41:51,476
- Goodbye. 
 - Have a good night.

496
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:54,057
- Bye. 
 - Goodbye.

497
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,284
Such bold progress.

498
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:03,620
I was shaking while I said it.

499
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:07,205
What's there to be shaky about? You have to knock for the door to open.

500
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,475
Knock?

501
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:11,094
It seemed like you were banging your head.

502
00:42:11,094 --> 00:42:13,964
Shall we go for drinks?

503
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,369
Next time.

504
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,503
Do you have plans?

505
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:23,273
Yeah, I'm going to treat my trauma.

506
00:42:23,273 --> 00:42:26,443
Avoiding something because you're scared turns it into trauma.

507
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,946
I'm going to face it head-on!

508
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,747
I'm off!

509
00:42:43,236 --> 00:42:46,363
Okay. Let's go.

510
00:42:57,642 --> 00:42:59,577
Everyone, attention!

511
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:05,949
This might surprise you, so stop eating and let's talk.

512
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:14,758
Listen and don't be surprised.

513
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:18,695
I'm not quitting my job.

514
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:24,000
No, I'm not quitting. In fact, I got promoted!

515
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:27,104
I'm not a copywriter anymore. I'm a creative director!

516
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,244
What is this? Why aren't you surprised?

517
00:43:35,244 --> 00:43:37,047
Why aren't you surprised?

518
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,949
I already knew.

519
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:43,349
Right? She didn't have the face of someone who wanted to quit her job.

520
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:47,388
What are you talking about? I was acting with all my strength!

521
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:49,059
You can't act.

522
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,595
I get worried whenever I look at her.

523
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:56,000
How can someone as simple as her survive society?

524
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,670
It's amazing. She got promoted instead of getting fired.

525
00:44:01,706 --> 00:44:06,009
What? You all already knew?

526
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:09,680
No, you did manage to trick one person.

527
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:18,278
No!

528
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:21,164
No, no!

529
00:44:21,165 --> 00:44:23,226
- Ah Ji. 
 - No, no!

530
00:44:23,226 --> 00:44:26,165
Mom, you're a liar! A liar!

531
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:29,499
Ah Ji, I got promoted. I can't quit.

532
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,718
No! You can quit!

533
00:44:31,719 --> 00:44:33,737
Just get someone to take over!

534
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:37,152
I can't! A creative director can't do that.

535
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:40,677
No! I hate it!

536
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,148
I hate it, too!

537
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,635
Do you have any idea how hard I worked to become a creative director?

538
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:51,722
No! I hate it!

539
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:56,059
Me too! I won't quit! I won't!

540
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,834
If you keep this up, I won't be your mom!

541
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:06,503
I'm going to keep being an ad mom!

542
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:16,680
You should soothe him. How could you fight with him?

543
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:19,589
I can't soothe him if he's not willing to communicate!

544
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,285
Who does he take after?

545
00:45:21,286 --> 00:45:25,388
No, no!

546
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:32,496
No, look. This didn't happen because of that.

547
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:36,914
Sure. Let's go inside your room, Ah Ji.

548
00:45:36,914 --> 00:45:40,150
Oh, it's okay. My baby, don't cry.

549
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:52,716
I went at it head-on! Why didn't it treat my trauma?

550
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:04,327
Good morning!

551
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:08,606
Eat up. Grandfather, you have two servings.

552
00:46:08,607 --> 00:46:11,701
Why? Do you want to raise this old man's blood sugar and put him in an early grave?

553
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:16,272
You need to eat and live a long life to see us become Asia's top company.

554
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:19,376
You speak like a politician.

555
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:22,380
How could you compare me to someone who holds a temp job for four years?

556
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,648
They say a bent tree protects the mountain.

557
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:28,451
The executives at headquarters praise you.

558
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:32,389
It's all thanks to the hard work of VC Communications.

559
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,857
That's right.

560
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:37,060
To be honest, it was Senior Director Go. You didn't do much.

561
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:40,497
It was my employee's performance, so it's my performance as well.

562
00:46:40,497 --> 00:46:43,534
Your employee? Is she really yours?

563
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:46,703
She's an employee of VC Group.

564
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:52,843
Hey, Grandson.

565
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:55,938
- Yes, Grandfather? 
 - Why do you say it like that?

566
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,347
Excuse me?

567
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,743
If a servant did a good job it's because of the owner's good orders.

568
00:47:00,743 --> 00:47:03,953
How can you say a servant did a good job?

569
00:47:03,953 --> 00:47:05,388
Yes, you're right.

570
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:09,795
Having skilled servants underneath you reflects the owner's abilities too.

571
00:47:09,795 --> 00:47:11,414
Of course!

572
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:17,333
I think I need to meet that female servant.

573
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:19,735
- Yourself? 
 - Yeah.

574
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:22,706
The chairman of Woowon wants to meet her, too.

575
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:25,109
Really? That's good.

576
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:28,912
I have dinner plans tonight with the chairman.

577
00:47:28,913 --> 00:47:31,364
Make the reservation for one more. Seat her next to me.

578
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:33,650
- Beside you? 
 - Yeah.

579
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:41,091
Kids who grew up walking on eggshells hate the bottom seat.

580
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:45,328
 Look at this. He read all of Go Ah In's files. 

581
00:47:46,397 --> 00:47:50,967
Grandfather? Stop working and rest.

582
00:47:50,967 --> 00:47:55,713
You grow old that way. You can't live a long life just by eating two servings!

583
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:02,545
Mr. Park, let's go!

584
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,390
Huh? Did you buy new shoes?

585
00:48:14,390 --> 00:48:15,950
Yes.

586
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,420
Oh! Let's break them in!

587
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,965
How could you be so childish in the morning?

588
00:48:20,965 --> 00:48:23,599
Why not? It's fun.

589
00:48:25,803 --> 00:48:27,421
This is fun?

590
00:48:27,421 --> 00:48:29,239
You're not a kid.

591
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:34,411
Creativity comes when looking at the world from a child's perspective.

592
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,645
You didn't know that?

593
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:37,881
It's from a book.

594
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,530
A book?

595
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,019
I'm sure you saw it online.

596
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,721
No, I didn't! I read it from a book!

597
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,523
Liar.

598
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,195
Come on!

599
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:58,367
They're close.

600
00:49:00,235 --> 00:49:02,312
A little excessively.

601
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:27,631
I know it's late, but congratulations.

602
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:31,701
Thank you. I couldn't do it without your help.

603
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,372
Are those new shoes?

604
00:49:39,326 --> 00:49:43,346
Are you free tonight?

605
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,549
Why?

606
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:50,217
Chairman Kang and his family have dinner plans with Woowon's chairman and his family.

607
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:54,624
They want you to attend as well.

608
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:57,560
- Me? 
 - Yes.

609
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,634
Which chairman wanted to see me?

610
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:09,072
To be more precise, it's the ultimate one.

611
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:15,478
   

612
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,260
   

613
00:50:22,253 --> 00:50:25,274
   

614
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:33,897
The reactions are good.

615
00:50:36,693 --> 00:50:37,901
Did you tell her?

616
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,203
- Yes. 
 - Well?

617
00:50:41,305 --> 00:50:44,173
 Dinner will be at 6:50 p.m.. 

618
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:46,309
 Don't even be a minute late. 

619
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,212
 I'll send you the address. 

620
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:51,581
 Mr. Park? 

621
00:50:52,283 --> 00:50:53,550
 Yes? 

622
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:58,354
 Do you have any tips for me? 

623
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:01,925
 Um... 

624
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:06,628
 When you meet the grand chairman, think as if you're standing in front of the god of the underworld. 

625
00:51:06,628 --> 00:51:10,233
 Just be truthful. Be as honest as you can. 

626
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:14,237
 Oh, and don't buy anything to bring. 

627
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,407
 They don't lack anything. 

628
00:51:21,178 --> 00:51:24,013
She didn't say much.

629
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:26,583
Okay.

630
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,402
Are you Senior Director Go Ah In?

631
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,836
Yes.

632
00:51:46,836 --> 00:51:48,638
Head inside.

633
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:34,717
This way.

634
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,958
You can sit here.

635
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:42,960
Here?

636
00:52:42,961 --> 00:52:46,129
A guest should sit at the head of the table.

637
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:52,201
Relax, just act like yourself.

638
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:58,741
Hello! I'm the Chief Creative Officer of VC Communications, Go Ah In.

639
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,577
Sit.

640
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,587
You're a guest in our house, and you came empty-handed.

641
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,689
Excuse me?

642
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:14,390
Was that how your parents taught you?

643
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:24,734
I came empty-handed because I already gave you the biggest gift of all.

644
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:29,138
And I didn't think you'd need anything.

645
00:53:31,475 --> 00:53:35,511
Good, I'm glad you're here. Let's eat.

646
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,356
There's not much to eat, right?

647
00:53:47,356 --> 00:53:48,925
This is fine.

648
00:53:48,925 --> 00:53:50,993
It's no different because we're rich.

649
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:53,296
Everyone eats the same way.

650
00:53:53,296 --> 00:53:57,367
Right? Everyone thinks we eat steak and caviar all the time.

651
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,769
Because that's all you eat.

652
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,905
When?

653
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:08,144
I eat it sometimes. Occasionally.

654
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,599
Senior Director?

655
00:54:16,766 --> 00:54:18,866
Eat up.

656
00:54:21,692 --> 00:54:27,430
Senior Director Go, how could I ever thank you?

657
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,333
It's fine. This is what I get paid for.

658
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:34,971
What a great mindset. You're paid for this.

659
00:54:36,473 --> 00:54:38,001
You're right.

660
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:39,542
Shall we start an agency, too?

661
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:41,852
Shall we?

662
00:54:41,852 --> 00:54:47,881
I could pay you, too. If Hanna ever torments you, give me a call.

663
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:50,520
I'll give you as much as you want.

664
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,622
You can tell me before that.

665
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:55,892
You can have the executive director of marketing position at headquarters.

666
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,998
Advertisers should be at the agency. Where would she go?

667
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:02,398
Personnel can be moved around as much as I please.

668
00:55:02,398 --> 00:55:04,333
If she gets a promotion.

669
00:55:08,739 --> 00:55:12,008
Now, it's a happy day. Shall we make a toast?

670
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,627
I'm sure it was uncomfortable. Did we keep you for too long?

671
00:55:31,627 --> 00:55:33,747
No.

672
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,920
I should get going.

673
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,900
Mr. Park.

674
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,771
Yes, sir.

675
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,141
She drank. You drive her.

676
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,344
- That's okay. 
 - We'll see you again.

677
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:11,341
Don't enjoy it too much, and don't doubt it too much either.

678
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:16,385
They'll call you if they need you, and kick you out if they don't.

679
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:23,513
Why are you so good to me?

680
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:26,783
Is it a sense of camaraderie between servants?

681
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:30,921
No, because our relationship is based on give and take.

682
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:34,590
I'm giving because I want to take later.

683
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,827
I'm already scared.

684
00:56:38,827 --> 00:56:41,961
What are you going to take?

685
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,168
Can we go somewhere else besides my house?

686
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:49,806
Yes, as long as it's south of the border.

687
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:55,790
   

688
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,297
Great job.

689
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:19,001
Seeing you tonight, I bet you have a hard time too.

690
00:57:20,771 --> 00:57:22,505
Goodbye.

691
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,800
   

692
00:58:02,346 --> 00:58:05,515
Oh, this is blasphemy.

693
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:06,750
What is?

694
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:10,253
You just got back from dinner with the chairman of a conglomerate

695
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,990
and I'm serving you something lousy like this.

696
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:20,194
Stop messing around. It was so uncomfortable that I barely ate.

697
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:22,999
Well, I guess that's your bill.

698
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:28,069
It's a reward for how hard you worked. Enjoy it.

699
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:37,713
What shall I do?

700
00:58:37,713 --> 00:58:41,550
I think I came in between the prince and the princess.

701
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:44,119
Don't do anything.

702
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:46,990
Don't try to pick a side and win.

703
00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:50,360
Just keep watch and pick the winner.

704
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:55,131
That's the flaw of success in our nation!

705
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:01,971
Oh, I'm honored. Take a drink.

706
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:03,872
What the?

707
00:59:03,872 --> 00:59:06,509
Are you looking down on me now that you're a big shot?

708
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:08,778
Shut up.

709
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:12,114
Was I too loud for you? Then...

710
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:15,718
Are you looking down on me already, Senior Director?

711
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,154
Stop it!

712
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:26,110
♫  Four walls up late, and the radios buzzing] ♫

♫  Don't know when it started but you're switching sides  ♫

717

♫  Left it all too late, maybe I should say nothing  ♫

718
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,360
The bill.

719
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:56,280

 Excuse me? 

726
01:00:47,411 --> 01:00:50,579
Why are you sleeping here?

727
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:32,010


728

733
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:05,554
 Who's hand will you hold? Kang Han Soo or Kang Hanna? 

734
01:02:05,554 --> 01:02:08,624
 This story is so cliché that I understood it immediately. 

735
01:02:08,624 --> 01:02:10,993
 Can I take that as a positive answer? 

736
01:02:10,993 --> 01:02:14,360
 Do you like me? 

737
01:02:15,297 --> 01:02:17,600
 I need some insurance, too. 

738
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:21,871
 Is there a job for me at the ad agency up the street? 

739
01:02:21,871 --> 01:02:23,046
 That's right. 

740
01:02:23,046 --> 01:02:26,541
 There are no rules in fighting. 

741
01:02:26,541 --> 01:02:28,198
 Why now? Of all times. 

742
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:31,140
 Ah In, just live like others. 

743
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:33,115
 Do you think I'm living like this because I want to? 

744
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:36,253
 You have to run away if you're weak. 

745
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:39,260
 That's the only way you'll survive. 

746

♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
