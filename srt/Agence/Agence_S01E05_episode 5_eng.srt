1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,050


2
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:16,474
The princess is full of greed but doesn't have anyone on her side in the group.

3
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,919
I should get ready to welcome her.

4
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:32,231
If you bow down from the beginning, how will she know the difference?

5
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,569
Senior Director Go Ah In?

6
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,309
Nice to meet you. I'm Go Ah In.

7
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,646
It's your first time, right?

8
00:00:45,646 --> 00:00:46,580
For what?

9
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,381
An ad agency...

10
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,001
I mean, office life.

11
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,758
Since you have a lot to learn, please feel free to ask about work.

12
00:00:57,758 --> 00:01:01,160
Don't start doing what you don't know and weren't asked to do

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,596
and make trouble.

14
00:01:04,652 --> 00:01:07,400
That crazy...

15
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:30,323
My door is always open if you have any questions.

16
00:01:30,323 --> 00:01:33,326
Excuse me. I have a lot to do.

17
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:38,765
Senior Director Go Ah In.

18
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,768
Yes?

19
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,540
    
    

20
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,945
You forgot to tell me where your office is.

21
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,793
That's right.

22
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:04,223
You wouldn't know where my office is.

23
00:02:04,223 --> 00:02:07,493
Ask around and come.

24
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,845
   

25
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,680
Will this make any difference?

26
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,931
    
    

27
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:50,605
   

28
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:53,013
   

29
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,170
   

30
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:14,427
So annoying!

31
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:18,932
Is she out of her mind? How dare she?

32
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,868
Deputy Park, fire her. Immediately! Now!

33
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:25,371
Tell her to just take her unemployment compensation!

34
00:03:30,511 --> 00:03:33,679
Fire her! Mr. Park, answer me!

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,802
Did everyone plan together to ignore me today?

36
00:03:35,803 --> 00:03:38,005
Huh? Is that it?

37
00:03:38,005 --> 00:03:40,947
I'm talking to the group's HR Team right now.

38
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:41,895
   

39
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,692
Okay. Carry on.

40
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,349
Yes, that's right.

41
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,369
All right. Yes.

42
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,705
It can't happen.

43
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:01,288
Right? This can't happen.

44
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:04,244
The group's HR Team must be outraged as well.

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,047
How can they keep that thing as an executive at my company?

46
00:04:08,048 --> 00:04:10,818
No, that's not what I meant.

47
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:11,718
What then?

48
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,152
They can't fire her.

49
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,754
Why? Why? Why?

50
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,890
We can't just fire people like that.

51
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,158
The labor laws in this country aren't strict for nothing.

52
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:23,362
Besides, Senior Director Go is the face of the group.

53
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,530
What face?

54
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:29,102
The face of a woman-friendly, competence-first group.

55
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:34,640
Just because she appeared in one or two articles?

56
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,842
That crazy bitch!

57
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:38,744
How will people react if someone who appeared in articles

58
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,781
gets fired before even a month has passed?

59
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:46,162
Besides, she was made the face of the group to make you an exec without starting from the bottom.

60
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:48,721
You know that.

61
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:53,526
Then, I'll just have to put up with her?

62
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:03,340
   

63
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,150
   

64
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:09,843
- Hey, Department Head Han. 
 - Yes.

65
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,545
You should keep your senior director in check.

66
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,047
Isn't that so?

67
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,576
It's not his fault.

68
00:05:17,576 --> 00:05:20,521
He just got stuck with the wrong boss.

69
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:24,624
Even a mutt knows its owner. But this...

70
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:31,164
This one bares her teeth at everyone.

71
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,766
Department Head Han.

72
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:36,002
Yes.

73
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,338
You need to decide now.

74
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:41,608
Decide what?

75
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:46,513
If you stay with that crazy mutt, you'll get bitten.

76
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,750
Isn't it time for you to cut ties with Go Ah In?

77
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,657
I know you're in a tough position.

78
00:05:56,657 --> 00:06:01,307
You can't ignore the boss you served for 10 years overnight.

79
00:06:01,308 --> 00:06:03,930
Yes, he's a loyal guy.

80
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:06,872
But there's something called a line.

81
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:09,737
She crossed it by a mile today.

82
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:12,839
What she did to the clients or Senior Director Hanna.

83
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,943
She's not just nasty, she's plain lost her mind.

84
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,964
Think it over carefully.

85
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:28,888
You don't need to reply immediately.

86
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,993
Thank you for your advice.

87
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:46,172
Let's create ads together for a long time.

88
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,375
Yes.

89
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,320
   

90
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,910
   

91
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,232
   

92
00:07:04,232 --> 00:07:06,092
Good job.

93
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,020
   

94
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:21,340
If you can't break your habit,

95
00:07:23,147 --> 00:07:25,913
do it with something cheaper. Please.

96
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:29,570
Something that's easier to handle.

97
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,652
Why? You think I'm crossing the line?

98
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:38,627
You purged the staff, provoked the clients, and talked down to the chairman's daughter.

99
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:41,361
Well, you certainly made an impact.

100
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,862
Why did you do it?

101
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,633
Why on earth did you do it?

102
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,569
Have you decided to just do whatever you want since it's a limited-time position?

103
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,942
I see.

104
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,844
Other people probably think like you.

105
00:07:57,845 --> 00:07:59,446
How can you smile in this situation?

106
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:03,617
You just dissed the chairman's daughter right to her face.

107
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,152
So what?

108
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,386
At the end of the day, she will side with Senior Director Choi.

109
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:11,725
Even wagging your tail wouldn't have been enough.

110
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,796
Wagging your tail is only for peaceful times.

111
00:08:15,796 --> 00:08:17,363
What?

112
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,003
What good is a tail-wagging dog when you have to go a long way to hunt?

113
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:29,343
What you need for a hunt is a dog that will bare its teeth.

114
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:34,447
One that's fierce, but also the most reliable when it's on your side.

115
00:08:35,215 --> 00:08:37,716
What do you mean?

116
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:41,687
I need to show her why she needs me.

117
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:48,338
The princess is full of greed but doesn't have anyone on her side in the group.

118
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:56,797
She'll find out soon enough that a candle is brighter than the sun at night.

119
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,372
But wait...

120
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,676
You're going to ask Senior Director Hanna to...

121
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,311
I should let her cool down first, right?

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,020
   

123
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:16,155
I know!

124
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:18,724
Why didn't I think of that?

125
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:24,630
Daddy to the rescue...

126
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:31,003
Why? Not social media. I'm going to call Dad.

127
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:37,276
Not a chance. Never!

128
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:45,051
Why is everyone picking on me today?

129
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,554
Senior Director.

130
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:52,893
- Senior Director! 
 - Why? What?

131
00:09:52,893 --> 00:09:56,963
If you want to succeed, don't disappoint others.

132
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:59,565
Especially your father.

133
00:10:00,634 --> 00:10:04,937
This is a workplace, and it's all business here.

134
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,306
If you can't handle such trivial matters yourself,

135
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:11,744
would he trust you with important business?

136
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:17,948
You have to make the impossible possible to get a chance.

137
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:25,825
Whatever. Everyone is great but me.

138
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,363
Fine.

139
00:10:35,002 --> 00:10:38,304
But I'm still annoyed. Do I just hold it in?

140
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:40,606
Just hold it in and turn this anger into cancer cells?

141
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:42,675
Should I just die of anger?

142
00:10:42,676 --> 00:10:43,876
- Yes. 
 - What!

143
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:47,380
You won't die. Just bear it.

144
00:11:02,296 --> 00:11:08,267
Then, let's go to someone that I can disappoint.

145
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:15,139
- Let's go! 
 - Where?

146
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,953
Someone who knows everything.

147
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:20,293
Gandalf.

148
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:32,992
 Grandpa! Grandpa! 

149
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,528
 Grandpa, Grandpa! 

150
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,766
You haven't been at work for long, why are you home already?

151
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,036
I came to ask you something.

152
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:52,880
What is that senior director's date of birth?

153
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,016
Deputy Park, how old is that madwoman?

154
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,352
She was born in 1981.

155
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,022
Why? Why are you asking?

156
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:09,528
I don't remember making any mistakes in that year...

157
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:12,966
She's completely my blood. She has Kang DNA.

158
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,233
What!

159
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:18,638
How's that? Does it make your heart pound?

160
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
Well... a little?

161
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,877
Of course! Since it's annoying.

162
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:29,348
You dropped your work and came to see me just because you're annoyed?

163
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:36,187
It takes one crazy person to know another. You two are similar.

164
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:38,558
Sparks fly when you go against each other.

165
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,960
Don't compare me to that thing!

166
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:44,363
Watch what she does.

167
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,002
If she was someone to make emotional outbursts,

168
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:53,206
she wouldn't have been able to climb up the ladder to that position.

169
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:57,376
She must have her reasons.

170
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,378
But still...

171
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,349
Hanna, mark my words.

172
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,585
Not all servants are the same.

173
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:11,091
There are servants whose minds are more uncanny than their owners'.

174
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:12,359
   

175
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,904
In those cases, don't be jealous.

176
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:28,574
You must bring them over to your side.

177
00:13:32,987 --> 00:13:38,050
No. Why should I side with her?

178
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,053
Who said you should side with her?

179
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:42,788
Then?

180
00:13:42,788 --> 00:13:46,926
Give her tasks that you will never manage.

181
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:51,364
If she succeeds, she's on your side, if she can't...

182
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:55,834
Goodbye forever.

183
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:59,605
There's nothing uglier than an owner getting jealous of a servant.

184
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:05,077
A true Gandalf. You know everything.

185
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:07,346
There's nothing you don't know.

186
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:12,318
Hey, hey, stop it. You're covering me with spit.

187
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,587
Because you're mine.

188
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:19,459
I raised you into a human, but you've become a pup instead.

189
00:14:20,394 --> 00:14:22,995
- What are you doing? 
 - Huh?

190
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:26,098
Get going. You have work to do.

191
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:32,839
Deputy Park, send me all the files related to Senior Director Go.

192
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,107
I've already compiled them.

193
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:39,912
Such an uncanny servant.

194
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,580
Pardon?

195
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,883
There's something like that.

196
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,536
Lunch. Let's go for lunch.

197
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:07,440
I have something to sort out.

198
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,242
What is it?

199
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,836
I guess it will be just us two today.

200
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:16,783
Let's go.

201
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,179
   

202
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,069
I'd also like a letter of withdrawal.

203
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:48,948
Song Ah Ji? Next time, ask before you throw a tantrum.

204
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:53,987
Don't tell me to quit or whatnot when you don't know anything.

205
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:06,465
Let me check once more for typos.

206
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,401
"Personal circumstances" is rather wordy.

207
00:16:10,401 --> 00:16:13,573
Then simply "Personal reasons."

208
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,212
Who tries to polish up their letter of resignation?

209
00:16:19,213 --> 00:16:23,783
This is an occupational hazard!

210
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,154
Come in.

211
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:45,237
Um, Senior Director.

212
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,573
What?

213
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,242
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,777
For what?

215
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:09,463
You said we can't fire anyone. What's this?

216
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:13,366
They weren't fired. They were transferred to petty posts.

217
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:15,736
Why did she do this?

218
00:17:15,736 --> 00:17:18,404
To show them who the boss is.

219
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,741
She doesn't have a line in the company.

220
00:17:24,278 --> 00:17:27,513
No line or support, so she'll just double down.

221
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:32,719
It's similar. Except that she acts within her authority.

222
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:37,290
Grandpa was right.

223
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,458
What did he say?

224
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,120
Something.

225
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,300
   

226
00:17:43,307 --> 00:17:47,500
Look at her... She's exactly my kind.

227
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,638
She's a completely different kind.

228
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:53,139
What do you mean!

229
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:56,809
She thinks strategically and acts crazy.

230
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,285
She's exactly my kind.

231
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:01,291
What do you think?

232
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,376
If you put it like that...

233
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,354
One of the two is definitely true.

234
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:11,057
The former? The latter?

235
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:16,997
Your face says the latter. Is that it?

236
00:18:16,997 --> 00:18:19,932
Do you also want to apply for unemployment compensation?

237
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:24,337
Then, will you let me go now?

238
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,674
Can I go back to the affiliate and work like an office worker

239
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:31,111
like the rest of my colleagues?

240
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:34,347
Never! Forget about unemployment compensation.

241
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:05,478
Relax. I can do this, I can do this!

242
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,387
Mom!

243
00:19:14,388 --> 00:19:17,422
Ah Ji.

244
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,514
- Did you hand in the resignation letter? 
 - Huh?

245
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:25,899
Yeah. See? The letter is gone.

246
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:30,170
- It's for real! Yes! 
 - Yeah!

247
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,840
Mom quit! Yeah!

248
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,176
I'm back.

249
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:38,778
Yes, go get changed first.

250
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:40,580
I made spicy stir-fried pork that you like.

251
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,749
Ah, okay.

252
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,030
 So excited! Super excited! 

253
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,654
 So happy! Yippee! 

254
00:19:52,186 --> 00:19:53,796
Ah.

255
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:57,416
What should I do?

256
00:19:57,431 --> 00:19:58,979
   

257
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:09,108
 A letter of resignation when I was going to make you a Creative Director? 

258
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,844
 Pardon? A CD? 

259
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,152
   

260
00:20:18,152 --> 00:20:19,339
   

261
00:20:22,623 --> 00:20:24,257
   

262
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,569
 CD? 

263
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:33,206
 I'm only in my 10th year. 

264
00:20:33,206 --> 00:20:34,567
 It's too early. 

265
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:37,136
 If you're going to quit, I guess I have no choice. 

266
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:38,170
   

267
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:39,705
 Wait! 

268
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,576
 I can do it! Why not? 

269
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,513
 But you said you wanted to quit. Hand me that letter. 

270
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:50,950
 I can't give the CD position to someone who'll quit. 

271
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,718
 No! 

272
00:20:58,826 --> 00:21:01,994
 I won't quit! Never! 

273
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:06,299
 Really. I give you my word. 

274
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:11,170
 - First, put that away. 
 - Okay! 

275
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,472
 I'm not interested in your reasons for writing that. 

276
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:15,174
 You don't have to know them! 

277
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:17,310
 You can't run away in the middle, is that clear? 

278
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,713
 Yes! I'll work hard! 

279
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:22,894
 No, don't work hard. 

280
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:26,686
 I hate people who are incompetent but work hard. 

281
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:29,215
 Just do well. 

282
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:32,225
 I don't care about the means or methods. 

283
00:21:32,226 --> 00:21:36,195
 Just bring me good results. Got it? 

284
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,916
 Yes! 

285
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,560
   

286
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:43,836
 I'll get rid of this hideous trash. 

287
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:56,683
 But, Senior Director... 

288
00:21:56,683 --> 00:22:00,686
 I'm just suddenly curious... 

289
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:04,457
 Why are you making me a CD? 

290
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,124
I'm a CD. Who cares about the reason! I love it!

291
00:22:31,124 --> 00:22:33,445
Hold up.

292
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,156
"CD Jo Eun Jeong."

293
00:22:36,156 --> 00:22:39,726
CD? CD, Ma'am?

294
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:42,189
No, it's too early.

295
00:22:42,189 --> 00:22:45,331
 - Come, dinner's ready.  
 - Okay!

296
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,502
Okay.

297
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,310
Wow!

298
00:23:02,243 --> 00:23:04,604
I was worried you might have lost your appetite.

299
00:23:04,605 --> 00:23:07,554
But you certainly eat well.

300
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:11,177
I was so hungry today. I didn't even have lunch.

301
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:13,293
Mom, don't talk with your mouth full.

302
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:15,194
It's dirty.

303
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:18,097
Watch.

304
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,533
Wow!

305
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,770
- Refill, please! A lot! 
 - Oh, sure.

306
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,711
Ah Ji, eat one spoon of rice for every spoon of meat.

307
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:33,946
But you eat one spoon of rice for every two of meat.

308
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:39,652
No! I ate one of rice and three of meat!

309
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,857
Did she get a big shock?

310
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:47,860
Even though she loves to eat, she looks too happy...

311
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:53,586
for someone who handed in a resignation letter.

312
00:23:59,573 --> 00:24:00,807
Hello?

313
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:03,242
Hey, pick up some chicken on your way home.

314
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:04,244
Why?

315
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:06,780
 Eun Jeong is a little strange. 

316
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,514
How?

317
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,952
A bit like that one time.

318
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:31,537
What's the occasion? We're in the mood for meat?

319
00:24:31,537 --> 00:24:33,907
- Are you okay? 
 - Why?

320
00:24:33,907 --> 00:24:36,375
Your letter of resignation...

321
00:24:41,295 --> 00:24:42,883
That's right.

322
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:46,786
I'd forgotten about it.

323
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:49,722
No, no. Great. Fantastic.

324
00:24:49,723 --> 00:24:51,324
Just eat and forget about it.

325
00:24:51,325 --> 00:24:55,795
Yes. It's best to forget about bad stuff quickly. Here.

326
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:59,799
- Right? 
 - Of course!

327
00:25:09,276 --> 00:25:10,844
She's a bit strange, right?

328
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:11,931
I think the shock hit her hard.

329
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:13,479
She's like that when she's not okay.

330
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,614
Right?

331
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:19,151
She was like that when she had postpartum depression.

332
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:25,625
High one moment, low the next. It's the same.

333
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,461
I'll keep an eye on her. I know a way.

334
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:30,963
If we put her in front of meat,

335
00:25:33,683 --> 00:25:35,668
we can keep her high.

336
00:25:36,336 --> 00:25:37,824
What are you doing?

337
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:40,873
If you don't hurry, I'll finish all the drumsticks.

338
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,582
Okay, go ahead.

339
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,290
Head, breast, belly, have them all.

340
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:46,711
For real?

341
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,749
No going back on your word.

342
00:25:52,853 --> 00:25:58,558
I'll make sure they can't go back on their word.

343
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,980
   

344
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,300
   

345
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,600
   

346
00:26:10,604 --> 00:26:13,440
   

347
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:18,665
   

348
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:24,084
Since she'll have some important work to do...

349
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,420
   

350
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,816
   

351
00:26:29,817 --> 00:26:32,859
I should feed her some carrots beforehand.

352
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,876
   

353
00:26:40,901 --> 00:26:44,637
Hello. I'm sorry for calling so late.

354
00:26:44,637 --> 00:26:49,175
I know something that will make a nice headline.

355
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:56,482
I apologize for the newly appointed CCO's

356
00:26:56,483 --> 00:27:01,821
reckless behavior yesterday.

357
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:06,692
The new CCO sent the email?

358
00:27:08,395 --> 00:27:10,162
Yes.

359
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:14,501
She schemed it herself without consulting anyone.

360
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:19,205
Then the CCO should come herself to apologize.

361
00:27:19,206 --> 00:27:23,542
If she were the type to apologize,

362
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:26,278
would she have caused this trouble in the first place?

363
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,115
Then, why did you call us here?

364
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:32,819
This isn't a problem we can just overlook.

365
00:27:33,887 --> 00:27:37,156
There's nothing like a good beating to make one obedient.

366
00:27:37,157 --> 00:27:41,160
People will start talking about clients abusing their power.

367
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,628
How will you take responsibility for that?

368
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:44,130
Don't worry about it and come.

369
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:48,935
I'll prepare everything so that you can reprimand her comfortably.

370
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:53,573
Go there in person.

371
00:27:55,342 --> 00:27:58,077
Will that be better?

372
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:02,181
There isn't a way?

373
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:07,154
You can't make the arrested Woowon Chairman

374
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:10,390
be tried without detention?

375
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:13,392
Sir, the Woowon group's legal team and the law firm in charge

376
00:28:13,393 --> 00:28:16,963
have reviewed the legalities countless times.

377
00:28:16,964 --> 00:28:19,031
If Woowon can't do it, does that mean we can't do it either?

378
00:28:19,032 --> 00:28:22,301
There isn't a way since he's already been arrested.

379
00:28:22,302 --> 00:28:24,537
If there's no way,

380
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:28,408
do we stop working?

381
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:34,481
When you were the chief prosecutor of the district office,

382
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:37,917
if your subordinate told you, "Sir, there isn't a way,"

383
00:28:37,918 --> 00:28:44,758
did you reply, "Oh, so there isn't a way."?

384
00:28:44,758 --> 00:28:49,095
But the person who is digging into the Woowon Group's affairs

385
00:28:49,096 --> 00:28:50,563
is a famous lunatic.

386
00:28:50,564 --> 00:28:52,465
Sir?

387
00:28:54,468 --> 00:28:56,336
Yes.

388
00:28:56,336 --> 00:28:58,752
The car provided by the company is beyond the Prosecutor General...

389
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:02,676
No. It's a car even the Minister of Justice can't ride in. Right?

390
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:03,343
Yes.

391
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:05,978
Last year alone, our company paid you more than

392
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:10,083
your total salary while working as a prosecutor for 25 years.

393
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:11,518
That's right.

394
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,289
But you can't handle one prosecutor who makes only 50 million a year?

395
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:20,092
- But... 
 - You are paid to do your job.

396
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:26,290
You are no longer a public officer who's guaranteed a place until retirement

397
00:29:26,291 --> 00:29:29,302
even when your performance falls short.

398
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:33,138
Pardon?

399
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,167
This is a company.

400
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:40,880
A company where performance and results are everything!

401
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:45,538
Find a way.

402
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:48,287
You can use as much money as you need.

403
00:29:52,326 --> 00:29:54,893
I trust you.

404
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:58,297
Yes, I'll do my best.

405
00:30:00,601 --> 00:30:03,236
If I spoke a little harshly,

406
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:06,472
it's only because the situation is rather serious.

407
00:30:07,741 --> 00:30:10,977
Don't hold a grudge or anything like that.

408
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:15,014
Of course. It happens when we work.

409
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:18,351
We can only work nicely if the results are nice. Right?

410
00:30:18,351 --> 00:30:19,552
 - Yes. 
 - Yes. 

411
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:22,255
Please excuse me. I have an appointment.

412
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:36,068
Are you going to work like this?

413
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:37,737
Yes?

414
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:41,841
We're in this fix because we must have missed something!

415
00:30:42,943 --> 00:30:44,811
That's it.

416
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:47,847
This is the power behind the Miracle of the Han River.

417
00:30:47,848 --> 00:30:51,905
Review the bail conditions from the beginning again!

418
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:56,089
The bottom will only move when it's beaten from above.

419
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:58,592
Don't tell me that there isn't a way!

420
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:00,726
Yes. I'll see you there.

421
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:04,797
No one's leaving until you find a way.

422
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,969
I'm off.

423
00:31:14,608 --> 00:31:16,075
Good luck on transtrans!

424
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,743
No, it's "transferring duties."

425
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:20,346
Yes, that's it.

426
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:21,681
I'll get going.

427
00:31:21,682 --> 00:31:22,883
Okay. Have a good day.

428
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,218
Mom, bye-bye!

429
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:27,653
Let's go in.

430
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:29,368
Let's go.

431
00:31:46,807 --> 00:31:50,009
It's graceless for a CD to run.

432
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,880
No, no. If I elegantly take a cab to work...

433
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,349
That's crazy. A cab costs as much as two fried chickens!

434
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,484
Wait!

435
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,855
Thank you.

436
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:14,033
I'm sorry. Just until the bus starts...

437
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:16,603
- Huh? 
 - Huh?

438
00:32:17,438 --> 00:32:19,506
We meet again.

439
00:32:19,506 --> 00:32:21,295
Did you bring the chair again?

440
00:32:21,295 --> 00:32:24,377
Of course. I really have to go in early today.

441
00:32:24,378 --> 00:32:26,479
Did something come up?

442
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:30,316
Strange things do happen in life.

443
00:32:30,317 --> 00:32:32,551
I recently got promoted.

444
00:32:32,552 --> 00:32:34,053
Really? Congratulations.

445
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:35,621
It feels great to let that out.

446
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:39,859
I wanted to boast about it, but I couldn't tell my family.

447
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:41,494
Why?

448
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:45,520
Well, what happened was...

449
00:32:53,207 --> 00:32:57,906
I ended up lying to my son that I gave in my resignation letter.

450
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:02,849
But boasting about getting promoted is even better than getting promoted.

451
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,997
Right?

452
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:08,454
But I had to put on a long face at home.

453
00:33:08,455 --> 00:33:10,556
My child cries every morning as well.

454
00:33:10,557 --> 00:33:13,226
Saying, "Mommy, don't go to work."

455
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:15,228
My child, too.

456
00:33:15,228 --> 00:33:18,398
We bring them money and get treated like convicts.

457
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,500
- Exactly. 
 - I know.

458
00:33:23,804 --> 00:33:25,752
Everyone, keep it up. Let's keep it up...

459
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:30,610
Sit down! Why are there three people over there?

460
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:34,847
You hiding over there, where's your seat?

461
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:38,117
Ah, shucks. Can he see me?

462
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,990
   

463
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:04,210
Take out the trash, please.

464
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:12,451
There's so much trash to sort out.

465
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,120
Right?

466
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,667
Let me know as soon as Senior Director Hanna comes in.

467
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:32,706
- Ms. Su Jeong? 
 - Yes?

468
00:34:32,706 --> 00:34:36,276
Let me know as soon as Senior Director Hanna comes in.

469
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:37,710
Yes.

470
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,314
Um, Senior Director...

471
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:59,132
What are you so busy with this morning?

472
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,468
Mental training.

473
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:04,871
Are you reading?

474
00:35:04,872 --> 00:35:07,540
Seriously? Why would I read a boring book?

475
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,575
Then, what are you watching?

476
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:18,251
Why are you like this? Really?

477
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:22,288
Why? What's wrong with it? I won't show anyone.

478
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,657
Even if you're looking at it alone...

479
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,194
What is this? You aren't a child.

480
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:34,634
It's how I de-stress. Why? What about it?

481
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:37,303
I have to release my anger somehow if I'm to work.

482
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:42,009
Would you rather I bottle up this anger and vent it out to her face?

483
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:45,446
- Steve Jobs must be turning in his grave. 
 - Why?

484
00:35:45,446 --> 00:35:48,848
He didn't develop this for it to be used in such a manner.

485
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:53,919
I paid for it with my own money and will use it as I want to.

486
00:35:53,919 --> 00:35:56,322
All right, use it. As you wish.

487
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,758
Consumers can...

488
00:36:02,096 --> 00:36:05,598
Deputy Park, are you listening to me? Hey!

489
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:06,933
I'm listening.

490
00:36:06,934 --> 00:36:10,336
I don't think you're listening. You're drinking coffee.

491
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,518
I don't drink coffee with my ears.

492
00:36:12,518 --> 00:36:14,232
Go on.

493
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:20,279
Consumers can do as they want to match their needs...

494
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,415
Darn, I forgot!

495
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:25,852
Take your time. I'm not going anywhere.

496
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:31,024
Consumers can do as they want to match their needs...

497
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,759
Deputy Park!

498
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:51,211
Senior Director Hanna has come in.

499
00:36:51,211 --> 00:36:52,812
Thank you.

500
00:36:59,486 --> 00:37:01,321
Um, Senior Director...

501
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,489
Yes.

502
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,791
I have something to say.

503
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,493
I know.

504
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:12,932
But it's not the time yet, is it?

505
00:37:12,933 --> 00:37:14,967
Pardon?

506
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:17,103
You have to do a bit more weighing.

507
00:37:17,103 --> 00:37:19,138
Senior Director Choi or me.

508
00:37:19,138 --> 00:37:22,341
Which side will make you a regular employee?

509
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,377
Pardon?

510
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,497
 You've been a secretary a few times. For two years each? 

511
00:37:41,497 --> 00:37:44,230
 Yes, since I'm a contract worker. 

512
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,135
 Your hometown... 

513
00:37:48,135 --> 00:37:51,538
 Wow, it's far. You must live alone. 

514
00:37:51,538 --> 00:37:55,208
 Monthly rent? Deposit? 

515
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,709
 I pay monthly rent. 

516
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,011
 With a contractor's wage, after paying this and that 

517
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:01,747
 you probably don't have anything to save. 

518
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:04,450
 Well, yes. 

519
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:08,621
 Would you like to become a regular employee at our company? 

520
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,392
 That'd be great. 

521
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:16,863
 But I hear that all executives' secretaries are contractors. 

522
00:38:16,863 --> 00:38:19,332
 Yes, executives' secretaries are contractors. 

523
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:22,602
 But the CEO's secretary is a regular employee. 

524
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:28,474
 After helping me out, you can become my secretary in a year. 

525
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,209
 The CEO's secretary. 

526
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,057
I understand. I'd have done the same.

527
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:49,662
But understanding doesn't mean that it's acceptable.

528
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:01,440
Ask yourself for the answer.

529
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,077
Pardon? What should I...

530
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,814
What would you do in my position?

531
00:39:09,583 --> 00:39:13,252
I'm sorry. I just did as I was told.

532
00:39:13,253 --> 00:39:16,022
I have half a mind to fire you straight away.

533
00:39:16,023 --> 00:39:18,057
Ma'am.

534
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:22,828
What could you have done? So, prove yourself to me.

535
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:26,185
I will not report to Senior Director Choi anymore.

536
00:39:26,186 --> 00:39:29,835
No, act normally.

537
00:39:29,837 --> 00:39:32,338
That way, Senior Director Choi won't get suspicious.

538
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:38,440
- Then? 
 - Prove that you are a useful person to me.

539
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,249
Not through Senior Director Choi's dirty ways, but with your abilities.

540
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,640
   

541
00:40:07,174 --> 00:40:09,942
Senior Director Go is here.

542
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:12,111
Why?

543
00:40:12,111 --> 00:40:15,214
You'll have to check in person.

544
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,585
Isn't it time you started working?

545
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:21,921
I've been working since yesterday.

546
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:25,591
Bad-mouthing me isn't part of the job, is it?

547
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:29,029
When the group's vice-chairman...

548
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:34,968
I mean, when your brother started work, there were press interviews

549
00:40:34,968 --> 00:40:37,470
and a lot of promotions.

550
00:40:38,172 --> 00:40:41,207
It looks like that's not happening this time.

551
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,710
So what?

552
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:49,182
Will you go along with it? Or will you do something?

553
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:58,391
Let's talk after you read it through.

554
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:12,172
   

555
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,579
   

556
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:25,570
   

557
00:41:29,923 --> 00:41:32,626
I've set an interview for 1:00 p.m.

558
00:41:32,626 --> 00:41:36,562
Do the interview as it's written here.

559
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,836
Excuse me for interrupting.

560
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:44,337
Feel free.

561
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:52,373
The email that you sent to the clients was like testing the king's wrath.

562
00:41:52,373 --> 00:41:56,083
Yes. Humans revolted against the gods.

563
00:41:56,083 --> 00:42:01,554
Why must Senior Director Hanna make amends for that?

564
00:42:20,007 --> 00:42:21,741
Yes.

565
00:42:24,812 --> 00:42:26,813
Did you want to see me?

566
00:42:26,813 --> 00:42:30,383
- Good news. 
 - What is it?

567
00:42:32,206 --> 00:42:35,722
The affiliates' marketing execs will be here soon.

568
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:37,590
Why?

569
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:41,627
Because of that email she sent to the clients?

570
00:42:41,627 --> 00:42:45,364
- Then... 
 - Shouldn't we welcome them?

571
00:42:47,701 --> 00:42:51,304
Because if I sort it out, it's an accident,

572
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,977
but if Senior Director Hanna sorts it out, it's reform.

573
00:42:57,977 --> 00:43:03,683
By reforming malpractices that have become custom in the industry,

574
00:43:03,683 --> 00:43:05,864
the chairman's daughter,

575
00:43:05,864 --> 00:43:12,792
or the next vice-chairman who will lead the group...

576
00:43:12,792 --> 00:43:16,563
 Next vice-chairman? 

577
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:22,002
...displayed new leadership on her first day at work.

578
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:24,769
According to a source from the industry,

579
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:27,306
Senior Director Kang Hanna has been welcomed

580
00:43:27,306 --> 00:43:33,679
as a strong rival of her brother and Vice-Chairman Kang Han Soo,

581
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:38,550
who is competing for the vice-chairman title.

582
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:43,923
All eyes are on Senior Director Kang Hanna's next step.

583
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:54,163
It's good timing and a good message, but it feels like you're using her.

584
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,935
Not using...

585
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:00,674
Give and take would be more appropriate.

586
00:44:00,674 --> 00:44:03,676
After all, words set the tone.

587
00:44:11,585 --> 00:44:14,087
What do you think?

588
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:19,826
- Senior Director? 
 - Huh?

589
00:44:24,085 --> 00:44:27,934
Ah, one moment.

590
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,810
 I can feel it. It's coming... 

591
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:44,918
   

592
00:44:44,918 --> 00:44:46,320
   

593
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:50,523
Are they out of their minds?

594
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:54,994
Call the marketing execs to my office.

595
00:44:54,994 --> 00:44:56,996
Now!

596
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,835
They'll wake up when we cut the ads.

597
00:45:02,836 --> 00:45:05,872
Who do they think they are comparing me with?

598
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:10,276
 I can see Kang Han Soo throwing a fit. 

599
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:15,081
 Ah, it's tempting... 

600
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:22,355
 But I'd hate to do anything that profits Go Ah In. 

601
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:27,293
Only a fool would make that decision.

602
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:30,363
What's that?

603
00:45:30,363 --> 00:45:34,367
Give up your own profits because you don't want to benefit others?

604
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:42,539
That's what losers do, living like victims of their own complex.

605
00:45:43,677 --> 00:45:45,711
Isn't that right, Deputy Park?

606
00:45:50,818 --> 00:45:52,452
Senior Director,

607
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:55,988
use jealousy that doesn't make any money when you're in a relationship,

608
00:45:55,988 --> 00:45:58,958
and just calculate profits and losses with me.

609
00:46:00,027 --> 00:46:04,330
There's nothing uglier than an owner getting jealous of a servant.

610
00:46:08,602 --> 00:46:10,837
Calculate profits and losses?

611
00:46:12,773 --> 00:46:18,141
I see the profits... but what are my losses?

612
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:21,848
Nothing. For now.

613
00:46:21,848 --> 00:46:23,482
But you said it felt like I was being used?

614
00:46:23,482 --> 00:46:25,885
I'll cancel what I said.

615
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:30,189
Since there's a clear give and take in this transaction.

616
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:37,963
Do it in your style.

617
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:40,866
What's my style?

618
00:46:40,866 --> 00:46:43,604
You act like a nutcase on the outside,

619
00:46:43,604 --> 00:46:47,440
but you know by instinct what will benefit you.

620
00:47:02,556 --> 00:47:05,291
Don't communicate with the group's promotion team.

621
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:07,315
I understand.

622
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:09,379
I'll get started.

623
00:47:23,944 --> 00:47:26,679
Should I receive them in the lobby?

624
00:47:29,883 --> 00:47:34,183
What does everyone think of the email Go Ah In sent to the clients?

625
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:40,359
To be honest, they like it. The clients were unreasonable.

626
00:47:40,359 --> 00:47:44,530
Are you going to let the clients see that?

627
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:51,571
Or are you going to make it appear like Go Ah In's solo act?

628
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:55,542
You'll receive them in the lobby?

629
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:58,612
When the affiliates' marketing execs come,

630
00:47:58,612 --> 00:48:01,547
shouldn't they know what the atmosphere is like?

631
00:48:01,547 --> 00:48:04,550
Should I put up some hand-written posters?

632
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,454
You're saying to make a situation where they can be comfortably angry, right?

633
00:48:08,454 --> 00:48:09,889
I understand.

634
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,458
I'll tell the team copies to come up with provocative lines.

635
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:15,595
Important work should be done yourself.

636
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,768
Quietly.

637
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:39,432
   

638
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:44,390
Did some urgent work come in?

639
00:48:44,391 --> 00:48:47,293
Go! Don't even come near!

640
00:48:47,293 --> 00:48:50,045
When did you guys do anything? I did all the important tasks.

641
00:48:50,045 --> 00:48:52,198
Why would you say that...

642
00:48:52,198 --> 00:48:54,867
Getting high-and-mighty recently?

643
00:48:54,868 --> 00:48:57,865
You think you've become someone, sticking to Go Ah In, don't you?

644
00:48:57,865 --> 00:48:59,038
When did I...

645
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:00,654
You'll find out soon.

646
00:49:00,655 --> 00:49:04,224
You guys are holding on to a rotten rope.

647
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:08,060
   

648
00:49:13,934 --> 00:49:15,521
   

649
00:49:15,521 --> 00:49:19,058
You should have been like this from yesterday, soft.

650
00:49:19,058 --> 00:49:23,763
I'm a bit shy of strangers. I can be a bit difficult as well.

651
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:26,732
You mean, very difficult?

652
00:49:26,732 --> 00:49:31,070
It's a problem if you're only that surprised.

653
00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:36,843
I'll bring you many surprises from now on. Positively.

654
00:49:38,278 --> 00:49:39,613
I'll look forward to it.

655
00:49:39,613 --> 00:49:42,382
You should surprise me in return.

656
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:43,318
How?

657
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:46,920
This was a win-win situation for us.

658
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,590
Next time, if I give, I'll also have to take.

659
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:53,392
Positively.

660
00:49:55,796 --> 00:49:57,997
Then, I'll get going.

661
00:50:04,004 --> 00:50:09,375
Ah, I almost forgot.

662
00:50:10,677 --> 00:50:14,113
Pay attention to every detail, from your makeup to your outfits,

663
00:50:14,113 --> 00:50:18,551
as if you are the model of the company and not just a senior director.

664
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:24,557
Pay attention to every detail, from your makeup to your outfits,

665
00:50:24,557 --> 00:50:30,229
as if you are the model of the company and not just a senior director. Okay?

666
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:36,736
You don't have to worry about that.

667
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,589
Which printer do I use to print posters?

668
00:50:56,589 --> 00:50:59,492
Connect it to the second printer.

669
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:17,750
   

670
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,547
Come in.

671
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,621
Did you want to see me?

672
00:51:31,812 --> 00:51:35,761
- Is there anything you'd like me to do? 
 - Yes.

673
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:40,767
- Copywriter Won Hui. 
 - Yes?

674
00:51:41,835 --> 00:51:44,504
Why do you dress like that to work?

675
00:51:46,373 --> 00:51:48,140
Pardon?

676
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,210
 How's Copywriter Won Hui? 

677
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,879
 She's great at coming up with concepts. 

678
00:51:52,879 --> 00:51:55,748
 The best in the industry for drafting proposals. 

679
00:51:55,748 --> 00:51:59,352
 A CD's role is to come up with concepts and write proposals. 

680
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:02,355
 And someone who's great at that isn't a CD yet? 

681
00:52:02,355 --> 00:52:07,727
 But a CD has another very important role. 

682
00:52:08,996 --> 00:52:11,224
 Meetings with the clients. 

683
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,001
 You must know the reason. 

684
00:52:16,236 --> 00:52:17,873
 I do. 

685
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:24,344
 Clients without an eye for ads, they'll look at the cover and say it's smart and trendy. 

686
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:27,380
Judging one's aptitude by their appearance.

687
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,096
It's comfortable when I'm working

688
00:52:31,096 --> 00:52:34,187
and it's a bit of a bother to dress up...

689
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:37,323
Why are you fighting with the world?

690
00:52:37,323 --> 00:52:38,425
Pardon?

691
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,361
At that stage, you must be more than aware that

692
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:44,530
form is more important than essence in many situations.

693
00:52:44,530 --> 00:52:47,467
Ever seen an anchor doing the news in pajamas?

694
00:52:47,467 --> 00:52:51,437
If a client demands a certain image from the agency,

695
00:52:51,437 --> 00:52:55,174
isn't it part of our work to project that image?

696
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,020
So...

697
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,682
I...

698
00:53:17,218 --> 00:53:22,301
Then, if I put on makeup,

699
00:53:22,301 --> 00:53:25,304
and pay attention to what I wear...

700
00:53:25,304 --> 00:53:27,807
Will I make you a CD?

701
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:32,412
- Never mind. You don't have to answer. 
 - Pardon?

702
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:35,314
You'll be appointed a creative director this time.

703
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:37,750
Pardon?

704
00:53:38,418 --> 00:53:42,088
It's not like an ad agency is a model agency.

705
00:53:42,088 --> 00:53:46,225
You do what you do best. I'll take care of the rest.

706
00:53:48,402 --> 00:53:52,832
Thank you. Thank you, Senior Director!

707
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,381
I'll do really well.

708
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:58,655
I'll really work hard... No, I'll do well.

709
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:02,275
Yes. I have high expectations.

710
00:54:02,275 --> 00:54:07,140
But there's one more thing you have to do.

711
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:10,983
What is it?

712
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:19,525
 You have to keep CD Kwon as a member of your team. 

713
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:31,973
It's fine.

714
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:37,209
If something good happens, it's understandable that something bad happens.

715
00:54:37,209 --> 00:54:39,545
Let's think positively.

716
00:54:54,161 --> 00:54:55,995
What are you doing?

717
00:54:59,566 --> 00:55:02,535
Hey, where's the tape?

718
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:04,470
Are you going to put that up in the conference room?

719
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:06,706
No, in the lobby.

720
00:55:08,208 --> 00:55:10,108
No,

721
00:55:10,996 --> 00:55:12,979
I'll find it myself.

722
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,460
   

723
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,178
It's going to be hard to get along.

724
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:48,481
   

725
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:52,785
 CD Kwon says he'll put this up in the lobby. 

726
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:59,292
How nice of him to up the ante.

727
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:32,192
Is it true that you ignited a reform drive on your first day at work?

728
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,727
When the chairman's daughter starts working at a company,

729
00:56:34,727 --> 00:56:38,264
everyone says, "It's nepotism, it's a free ride..."

730
00:56:38,265 --> 00:56:42,535
"What's there for a conglomerate's daughter to do at the company?"

731
00:56:42,536 --> 00:56:44,370
Well, yes.

732
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:47,307
- This is what I have to do. 
 - What do you mean?

733
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:51,177
Taking care of old and evil practices that others can't even touch.

734
00:56:51,177 --> 00:56:55,782
What use would I have if I only do what others could do?

735
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,688
Sounds good.

736
00:56:57,688 --> 00:57:00,987
So, there's work that only a 3rd-generation conglomerate's daughter can do?

737
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:04,591
If you have power, you have to use it. Properly.

738
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:10,510
Instead of promoting awkward pictures of eating with others at the company cafeteria.

739
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,598
That's old.

740
00:57:17,338 --> 00:57:21,374
The chairman ate at the company cafeteria last month.

741
00:57:24,905 --> 00:57:28,903
- I take that back. 
 - Okay.

742
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:29,783
Yes, Senior Director.

743
00:57:29,784 --> 00:57:31,385
She's doing the interview now, right?

744
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:33,219
 She's almost done. 

745
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:37,156
I'm saying this just in case, but pay attention to the journalists.

746
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:39,258
They will write promotional articles for our company.

747
00:57:39,258 --> 00:57:40,460
Yes, I'm doing that.

748
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:47,033
It'd be good to escort them when they leave.

749
00:57:47,033 --> 00:57:49,402
Senior Director Hanna should do it herself.

750
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:52,839
Does she have to go that far?

751
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:56,275
If the chairman's daughter escorts them to the lobby,

752
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:59,746
won't that gracious gesture find its way into the articles?

753
00:58:00,881 --> 00:58:04,283
You're right. I'll see to it.

754
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:06,419
Thank you.

755
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:18,160
Looks like Senior Director Choi will incur the real king's wrath trying to fight me.

756
00:58:22,002 --> 00:58:23,736
Good job, everyone.

757
00:58:23,736 --> 00:58:26,806
 - Good job. 
 - Good job. 

758
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:28,908
 - Good job. 
 - Good job. 

759
00:58:28,908 --> 00:58:32,165
Abolition of the clients' unreasonable requests.

760
00:58:32,165 --> 00:58:34,747
That was a great move.

761
00:58:36,183 --> 00:58:38,284
Please escort the journalists.

762
00:58:38,284 --> 00:58:39,992
All right.

763
00:58:39,992 --> 00:58:41,368
I'll escort you.

764
00:58:41,368 --> 00:58:43,085
Wow, what an honor.

765
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:44,985
 - It's an honor. 
 - Thank you. 

766
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:46,793
Let's go.

767
00:58:55,903 --> 00:59:01,007
They should be here soon.

768
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,200
   

769
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,590
Oh my! They're here!

770
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:19,826
I saw you yesterday, and now today; it's too often.

771
00:59:19,826 --> 00:59:22,061
What's this business about? We're busy people.

772
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:23,629
All we have to do is change ad agencies.

773
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,867
We can't do that because they are our affiliate.

774
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:30,970
We can only give them a beating as we take them along.

775
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:32,739
Let's go.

776
00:59:36,343 --> 00:59:37,926
- Thank you. 
 - Good job.

777
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:40,166
- I had a great time. 
 - You're a great talker.

778
00:59:42,849 --> 00:59:44,818
I'll write a good one. For real.

779
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,127
- Thank you. 
 - Yes.

780
00:59:48,018 --> 00:59:52,658
Oh dear, our poor princess...

781
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,690
   

782
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:41,602
   

783
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:42,603
   

784
01:00:42,603 --> 01:00:43,551
   

785
01:00:43,551 --> 01:00:46,580
   

786
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,680
   

787
01:00:51,718 --> 01:00:53,958
   

788
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:56,456
These jerks...

789
01:00:58,725 --> 01:01:03,262
Come on, show us a tantrum.

790
01:01:14,581 --> 01:01:17,994
   

791
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:29,960


792
01:01:31,031 --> 01:01:36,950
   

793
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:43,580
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

794
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:49,960
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

795
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:55,380
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

796
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:01,521
 Who gave you these orders? Who!? 

797
01:02:01,521 --> 01:02:03,563
 Why do you pick fights with the chairman's daughter? 

798
01:02:03,563 --> 01:02:04,525
 You... 

799
01:02:04,525 --> 01:02:07,667
 By any chance, are you copying me? 

800
01:02:07,667 --> 01:02:09,395
 Choi Chang Soo, Go Ah in. 

801
01:02:09,395 --> 01:02:12,498
 These lowly senior directors are trying to flirt with me. 

802
01:02:12,498 --> 01:02:14,667
 Are you going to test them? 

803
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:17,203
 The billing is worth 30 billion won. You have one week. 

804
01:02:17,203 --> 01:02:20,473
 It's that. They won't use this ad anyway. 

805
01:02:20,473 --> 01:02:22,809
 We're always the same. 

806
01:02:22,809 --> 01:02:25,810
 The winning side, is our side. 

807
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:30,280
♫  I wear that dress to cover this scar  ♫
