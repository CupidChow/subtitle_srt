1
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:09,742
Let's restrict access to the copywriters getting into the building.

2
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:14,113
Let's make sure they can't work with them if they won't work with us.

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,953
Isn't an ad just a love letter to a target audience?

4
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:23,956
That's right.

5
00:00:23,956 --> 00:00:25,858
Right this way.

6
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,100
What's the point of writing many letters?

7
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,370
When you don't know who you're sending them to.

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:42,575
This is an ad for just one person.

9
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,936
We have to captivate the heart of that one person...

10
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:57,670
that can make this a nation where miracles happen frequently.

11
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,030


12
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:06,699
I should be praying...

13
00:01:12,326 --> 00:01:18,377
that Senior Director Choi doesn't know what I know until this presentation is over.

14
00:01:26,794 --> 00:01:31,758
   

15
00:01:35,109 --> 00:01:41,354
First, I'm sure you all heard, but this is a very important presentation. 
    

16
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:43,448
The most important.

17
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:48,341
Well, are you all curious about anything?

18
00:01:49,657 --> 00:01:51,310
Oh, go ahead.

19
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,974
With all due respect, direct communication is difficult for us.

20
00:01:55,974 --> 00:01:57,683
There's too much pressure.

21
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:02,555
I'm aware. That'll be settled internally.

22
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:07,726
Please, feel free to share your ideas.

23
00:02:07,726 --> 00:02:10,262
We don't know which side will burst first in this presentation.

24
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:11,430
Is that what you're saying?

25
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,965
That's why you're all here.

26
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:16,736
That's the reason we gathered so many copywriters.

27
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:20,540
I look forward to your work.

28
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,047
Was it bad?

29
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:30,350
That place is famous.

30
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,948
Still, it's just soup and rice.

31
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:33,686
Ugh, you're an addict.

32
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:36,789
You said I could pick what we eat today.

33
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:41,560
Why do you always want to eat that though?

34
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,829
That's not something for you to say.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,364
Why? What?

36
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:50,336
You ate all the meat in my stew.

37
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:56,676
 It's hot. Be careful. 

38
00:02:57,811 --> 00:02:59,712
 Thank you. 

39
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,322
 - Huh? 
 - I'm eating this! 

40
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,427
 Oh! There's another one! 

41
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,932
 Do you even know what that is? 

42
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,703
 Yeah. It's cartilage. Right? 

43
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,641
 What? 

44
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:31,177
 Help yourself. 

45
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,747
Yeah, I did.

46
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,449
You never eat it and I didn't want to waste it, so I ate it! So what?

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,653
I was saving it so I could eat it later.

48
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:45,858
You're being so stingy over something that's not even meat.

49
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:49,629
Oh! Did she eat what you threw at her?

50
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,098
Her eyes lit up.

51
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,502
I didn't understand it even after I read it.

52
00:03:56,502 --> 00:04:00,272
I'm sure it's jargon for this industry.

53
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,976
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

54
00:04:03,976 --> 00:04:05,811
To poke around.

55
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:20,326
You said you wanted to go poke around.

56
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,728
Yeah, but I can't go empty-handed, can I?

57
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:25,498
You're going to take this?

58
00:04:30,931 --> 00:04:35,107
I'm a regular here.

59
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:38,478
Pick something. Choose your normal favorite.

60
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,978
We just ate, so I'm full.

61
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:42,448
Why would I pick my favorite?

62
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:45,684
You should buy them what you like to eat.

63
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,087
Don't you think this would be too rich to eat and work all night?

64
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:51,224
A cup of ramen is easy to eat in the middle of the night.

65
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:56,260
Sure, it is, but... they're VC Communications employees.

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,665
They're not in college anymore. Do you think they eat ramen all the time?

67
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,268
Also, you're the chairman's daughter.

68
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,903
I should save face?

69
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:08,074
Show the people the image they expect from me?

70
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,979
Here, show them.

71
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,781
I'm addicted to soup and rice, so I don't know much about this.

72
00:05:15,781 --> 00:05:20,453
Whatever I choose will be so delicious that it'll interfere with their work.

73
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:21,788
Excuse me.

74
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:27,091
Can I get two sets of prosciutto and a bottle of champagne? Can you wrap it for me?

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,200
   

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,521
Yes?

77
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:38,428
Oh, you're coming here?

78
00:05:40,349 --> 00:05:42,241
Okay, I understand.

79
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,549
Mr. Kwon, can you go back to your seat?

80
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:52,584
Excuse me? Why?

81
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,121
Senior Director Hanna is on her way.

82
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,724
Really? But why do I have to go to my seat?

83
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,905
Because you're part of the creative team.

84
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:08,056
Not to mention, I think she might still be angry.

85
00:06:08,056 --> 00:06:09,869
 Fire him! 

86
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,838
 Does it upset you to see it for yourself? 

87
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:16,008
 We have to terminate these types of executives! 

88
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,613
Call me when it's over.

89
00:06:25,352 --> 00:06:27,606
Ask the employees to clean this up.

90
00:06:27,607 --> 00:06:30,189
Okay. Let's clean up!

91
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:42,370
   

92
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:44,376
Yes?

93
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,720
Hello, Senior Director.

94
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,520
   

95
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,688
I hope I'm not interrupting you. I know you're all busy.

96
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,370
Please, sit over here.

97
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,890
   

98
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:12,361
We're focused on delivering the message to the general public. We're finished with the key copy.

99
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,700
Thank you for that.

100
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,236
How was it?

101
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:22,538
You're going to make it seem like the public wants the same thing as Chairman Kim?

102
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,510
That's right.

103
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,520
That's good.

104
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,818
But why does it feel like it lacks impact?

105
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:36,288
Powerful messages create another issue.

106
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,291
They force people to pay attention.

107
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:43,794
But in Woowon Group's current situation, that could cause more harm.

108
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,101
You have a point.

109
00:07:51,872 --> 00:07:54,039
Great job.

110
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:57,509
Thank you for this.

111
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,748
Did you not like the direction of the message?

112
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,584
No, it's not that.

113
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,386
It's just so different from what I was thinking.

114
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:08,321
How?

115
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:11,023
The mood. It's so clean and dry.

116
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:13,625
It's like any ordinary company.

117
00:08:13,625 --> 00:08:18,630
Yeah, it was different from the agency conference room I had imagined.

118
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,266
Is it because we called ahead?

119
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,002
Did you call the creative team, too?

120
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,116
No, not yet. I need to.

121
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:27,406
Don't. I want to see it raw.

122
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,574
Okay.

123
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:34,480
What did you think about her reaction?

124
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,387
It's a difficult direction for a rookie to understand.

125
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,330
 Yeah, but you can't just stick the images on like this. 

126
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,267
 Eun Jeong, you can't say I did it like that! 

127
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:54,934
 Do you want it in black and white? 

128
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,802
 I'm against nostalgia. 

129
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,906
 That's it. This is what an advertising agency should feel like! 

130
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,474
 What is with you all? 

131
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,212
Who the hell would burst into the middle of a meeting?

132
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,641
Are you looking to buy a house?

133
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,642
What?

134
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,345
Why do you keep looking around?

135
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,947
It's similar to the image I had in my head.

136
00:09:41,947 --> 00:09:46,352
Even if it's a little more chaotic than how I pictured it...

137
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,856
You're all working so hard. Eat up.

138
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:53,659
Thank you.

139
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,329
I just got back from the planning team.

140
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,365
How is the production team coming along?

141
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,201
We haven't prepared anything yet.

142
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,962
Really?

143
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:09,054
   

144
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:15,748
The reality can end up in the gutter if you chase too many ideals.

145
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:22,667
If you get into the habit of compromising with reality, you'll end up in the gutter.

146
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:26,308
You're so greedy.

147
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:29,561
Greed and avarice are two different things.

148
00:10:32,393 --> 00:10:38,070
The greed of those who are unskilled and don't know anything,

149
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,639
that's what you call avarice.

150
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:57,383
No, no, no. I wasn't trying to drink this.

151
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:01,093
I only wanted to touch it, and the cork flew off on its own.

152
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:15,741
No, no, no. This is just a reflex!

153
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,711
An instinctive reflex.

154
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:25,080
Drink it. A glass of champagne will relax you.

155
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,659
About this corporate PR ad.

156
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,129
Are you going to go with a message that has an impact?

157
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,789
Of course.

158
00:11:39,789 --> 00:11:44,691
Something that the public will passionately react to.

159
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:50,576
Then that'll just create another issue.

160
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,338
If you stand out too much in Woowon Group's current situation,

161
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:58,517
won't grabbing too much attention be a bad strategy?

162
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:11,177
This sounds like something they'd say during the project team's meeting.

163
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
This time...

164
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:24,109
we need to make a miracle.

165
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,313
Do you think it's possible?

166
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:30,548
It's impossible.

167
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,918
In the current situation.

168
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,970
I don't think it helped.

169
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,906
What?

170
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:56,742
The information I gave her.

171
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,779
What did she mean by a miracle?

172
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,783
Choi Chang Soo is stable but so predictable.

173
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:08,353
Go Ah In is unstable but useful.

174
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:15,240
If it can be controlled, an unstable matter has a higher destructive power.

175
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,362
Let's keep watch for now.

176
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm going to go meet someone.

177
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:38,250
- Sir. 
 - CEO.

178
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,252
It's just us here. So what?

179
00:13:40,252 --> 00:13:43,121
It becomes a habit.

180
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:46,658
Am I doing a good job?

181
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:48,027
How so?

182
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,863
What do you mean? I know you know.

183
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:56,365
If Cho Moon Ho of VC Group doesn't know then it never happened.

184
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:59,605
That's all in the past.

185
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,975
It seems you're doing what you want.

186
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:07,479
Well, I'm doing what I think is right.

187
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,715
What are you trying to gain?

188
00:14:10,715 --> 00:14:14,419
There must be something you want out of all this. Right?

189
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,688
You know what I want.

190
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:21,893
Then, are you willing to give up everything for that?

191
00:14:31,437 --> 00:14:33,539
I'm sorry to interrupt.

192
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,076
You have a meeting at the headquarters in 30 minutes.

193
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,445
You could've called.

194
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,850
You left this behind.

195
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,086
How did you know that I'd be here?

196
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:51,757
Mr. Park, are you stalking me?

197
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:59,064
I'll leave you two to talk.

198
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:10,742
It won't be easy.

199
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:11,911
What?

200
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:17,980
If you want to gain something, you'll have to give up something big in return.

201
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,219
I'm an exception.

202
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:22,021
There are no exceptions.

203
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,374
Action and reaction are the laws of the universe.

204
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,164
Your time to choose will soon come.

205
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,970
   

206
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:47,000
   

207
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:04,563
According to our schedule, it's time to go into production soon.

208
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:10,569
Even if you're not completely satisfied...

209
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,441
I'm not satisfied.

210
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:20,650
We have to settle for second-best when the best isn't available.

211
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:40,129
Since we have a backup plan, is that why we're being complacent and settling?

212
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:49,241
But...

213
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,182
Start over.

214
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:59,418
At this rate, we'll have to go into the presentation empty-handed.

215
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:00,920
With our schedule...

216
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,854
Do you think you can cut corners like this?

217
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:05,056
Do you really think this is sufficient?

218
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,591
Is this the best you all can do?

219
00:17:06,591 --> 00:17:09,060
You need to accept the reality.

220
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,496
Reality?

221
00:17:11,496 --> 00:17:15,434
If I was thinking realistically, do you think I'd make you all creative directors?

222
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:20,836
If you want to cut corners and work realistically, go to an ad agency that makes commercials for snacks!

223
00:17:20,836 --> 00:17:23,809
I don't work that way!

224
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,123
She's being pretty harsh today.

225
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:39,224
She normally doesn't yell.

226
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,527
Yesterday and today...

227
00:17:42,527 --> 00:17:45,630
I'll be back after I go see her.

228
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:48,567
Don't go right now.

229
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:19,899
Senior Director Go is human. I'm sure she's scared.

230
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:25,466
She speaks harshly, but she's not always that emotional.

231
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:28,173
The fact that she's acting differently than usual,

232
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,942
ijust proof that she's scared.

233
00:18:32,378 --> 00:18:35,113
The results of this presentation won't affect us.

234
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,148
They'll affect her.

235
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:40,785
Yeah, that's true.

236
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,126
Come on. We're all sensitive.

237
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:49,909
Let's just go.

238
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:53,716
Sensitive people together is a recipe for disaster.

239
00:18:55,601 --> 00:18:57,536
What's gotten into you?

240
00:18:57,536 --> 00:18:58,671
What?

241
00:18:58,671 --> 00:19:00,606
That was so admirable.

242
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:04,743
You're a completely different person than you were yesterday.

243
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:08,814
The power of Korean beef? The effects of marbling?

244
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:13,051
Look at me showing off my hidden charms.

245
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:17,122
My ability to scan the situation and diagnose it.

246
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,525
I had it hidden away because I didn't want to put any pressure on you all.

247
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:26,364
Was that champagne incident all calculated as well?

248
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:30,336
This is a huge plot twist!

249
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,405
Hey, I almost peed myself back there!

250
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:36,531
How did the champagne pop with a touch?

251
00:19:36,531 --> 00:19:37,809
Is that how the expensive ones are?

252
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,544
Is that true?

253
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,183
 Let's get back to work. 

254
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,250
 Let's go! 

255
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,918
 Go, go! 

256
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:53,959
 Remember the moments we'll have together. 

257
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,395
 It's all for the happiness we want. 

258
00:19:56,395 --> 00:20:01,733
 Woowon Group will create the nation we want. 

259
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:11,643
Something feels off...

260
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:13,545
Why? Did you not like something?

261
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,581
No, it's just that things came together too easily.

262
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:22,454
It feels like we missed something.

263
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:24,657
Why do you feel that way?

264
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:29,194
Because Go Ah In hasn't decided on her direction yet.

265
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:07,750
♫  Even if I stretch out my hand  ♫

266
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,540
♫  A place that can't be reached  ♫

267
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:17,170
♫  There is far away, a shining light  ♫

268
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:21,813
This presentation will be over eventually. Right?

269
00:21:23,063 --> 00:21:26,292
   

270
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:37,390
♫  I might lose you as you get farther away  ♫

271
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:47,210
♫  You, you are at the end of this road  ♫

272
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,330
♫  An unknown somewhere far away  ♫

273
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:53,277
I won't run away.

274
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:55,514
I won't run away.

275
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:05,660
♫  Oh, I'll protect you somehow  ♫

276
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:14,510
♫  Don't lose the most important thing  ♫

277
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:19,504
Is it better for me to disappear

278
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,607
instead of being humiliated and kicked out?

279
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:33,550
♫  You, I need you now  ♫

280
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:38,150
♫  Even if I lose everything I have  ♫

281
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:41,259
 However, you can't take alcohol with it! 

282
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,590
 Answer me! 

283
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:51,900
♫  Oh, I'll protect you somehow  ♫

284
00:22:51,900 --> 00:23:00,560
♫  So that I will never pass you by again  ♫

285
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:08,440
♫  Stay here  ♫

286
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:18,797
♫  Stay by my side  ♫

287
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:21,599
I need to leave it to fate now.

288
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:42,650
   

289
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,389
Mr. Han.

290
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,025
Yes, Ma'am?

291
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,662
Are you not feeling well?

292
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:56,401
It'll be morning in a few hours.

293
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:59,905
We have one of two options.

294
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:05,076
We can produce something with one of the ideas that you came up with

295
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:09,180
or we can suggest not doing this corporate PR ad.

296
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,788
I don't think we can do the second option.

297
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:18,557
Me too.

298
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,558
Let's start the production.

299
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:26,832
I could do a clumsy presentation and get fired

300
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,468
or I could give up on the presentation and just resign.

301
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,140
Which do you think is worse?

302
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,207
Senior Director Go.

303
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,976
We'll know once we do the presentation!

304
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,111
We'll make sure it's of the best quality!

305
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:45,383
Then are you confident we can win with this direction?

306
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,989
You don't need to do it to know.

307
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,326
What do you think, Eun Jeong?

308
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:03,401
What are you working so diligently on?

309
00:25:12,244 --> 00:25:14,278
What is this?

310
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:15,847
Huh?

311
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,083
What is that?

312
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,491
Bring this to the conference room right now!

313
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:28,760
Everyone, right now!

314
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,470
   

315
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,733
What is it? What's going on? What?

316
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:41,239
What is wrong with me today? Why?

317
00:25:56,948 --> 00:25:58,857
- Eun Jeong? 
 - Yes?

318
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:01,827
Open your laptop and show us.

319
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:04,129
I didn't mean anything by it.

320
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:05,830
Do it.

321
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:29,455
 I'm living in an advertising agency prison when I've committed no crimes. 

322
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:32,890
 At least they feed you in prison when it's time to eat. 

323
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,994
 At least they let you sleep when it's time to sleep. 

324
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:38,830
 This is so unfair. It's unfair. It's absolutely unfair! 

325
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:43,902
It's unfair.

326
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:46,838
Nope. It's not unfair. I don't feel that way!

327
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:48,691
That's right.

328
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:52,410
It'd be unfair to be locked up when you committed no crimes.

329
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:56,914
Nope. I love it. I'm so happy.

330
00:26:56,914 --> 00:27:00,285
Public opinion and miracles.

331
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,826
That's right.

332
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:14,232
We can show them how unfair it is.

333
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:19,674
If the public can sympathize with that, public opinion can be created.

334
00:27:19,674 --> 00:27:24,409
Then our nation will be a nation that creates miracles.

335
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,212
- Mr. Han? 
 - Yes?

336
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,682
Hire a good director that can shoot live. Right now.

337
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,084
Do you have your concept?

338
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:35,186
Yeah, I'll explain it later. Get it started.

339
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,624
You're going to shoot it in one take? There are only two days left.

340
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,425
If things go accordingly, two days will be enough.

341
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,083
Get it ready. I need to meet someone in the morning.

342
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,830
Okay.

343
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,366
- For the rest of you. 
 - Yes?

344
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,868
Go home and sleep.

345
00:27:49,927 --> 00:27:51,391
- What? 
 - Huh?

346
00:27:51,391 --> 00:27:54,372
We need to really start the work in the morning.

347
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,920
   

348
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,100
   

349
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,961
At this hour?

350
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:22,033
Hello, Senior Director. Why are you calling this early?

351
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,802
I need your help, Mr. Park.

352
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,538
 With what? 

353
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:32,311
The headquarters' team leader in legal used to be a prosecutor, right?

354
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,145
Yes, he used to be the district attorney.

355
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,314
Can you schedule a meeting with him for me?

356
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,685
With the team leader of legal?

357
00:28:39,685 --> 00:28:42,820
Yes, for this morning. As soon as possible.

358
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:48,881
Can I ask you why?

359
00:28:48,881 --> 00:28:54,499
Well. To keep my promise to you.

360
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,669
Will this be a win-win?

361
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,039
If things go according to plan.

362
00:29:02,074 --> 00:29:03,862
Then I'll try giving him a call.

363
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:07,311
But I don't know if his schedule will allow it.

364
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:09,714
He's the busiest person at VC Group.

365
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,916
Then can you send mehis contact information?

366
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,521
I don't think that would be polite.

367
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,956
Winning would be polite.

368
00:29:19,958 --> 00:29:21,792
Okay.

369
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:27,265
To be polite...

370
00:29:42,841 --> 00:29:44,156
   

371
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:49,420
 The team leader of legal says he can't fit you into his schedule this week. 

372
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:52,556
 He said he's busy enough as it is to meet an advertiser. 

373
00:29:52,557 --> 00:29:54,592
This makes things difficult.

374
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:57,595
I need to meet him if I want to coax him or soothe him.

375
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:24,121
 But just so you know, the team leader will be on the 14th floor. 

376
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:26,123
 He has a meeting with the legal team. 

377
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,860
 Kang Hanna is so lucky. 

378
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,386
What is it?

379
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,922
What do you mean?

380
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,158
Who are you texting this early that has got you smiling like that?

381
00:31:02,628 --> 00:31:04,062
A woman I know.

382
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,984
A woman?

383
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:09,800
You're on the clock right now!

384
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,702
But you're texting a woman and snickering like that?

385
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:14,706
In this crucial moment? Should you be working like this?

386
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,408
It's 8:00 a.m., so I'm not on the clock yet.

387
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:20,978
My contract states that working hours are from 9 to 6.

388
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:23,381
It's Senior Director Go.

389
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,785
It is? Why? What's going on?

390
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:30,588
She wants to schedule a meeting with the team leader from legal.

391
00:31:30,588 --> 00:31:32,657
The team leader from legal?

392
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:38,897
Look at this. She's got something.

393
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,031
Right?

394
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,332
It must not have been avarice.

395
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:45,069
I think she digested the meat we gave her.

396
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,472
So, did you get her the meeting?

397
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,174
No, he turned it down.

398
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,277
You should've told me. I could've made it happen with one call.

399
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:55,579
We can't do that.

400
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,750
We can't capture the prey for her.

401
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,419
We should teach her how to hunt.

402
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,628
So you just taught her where he'd be.

403
00:32:13,787 --> 00:32:16,734
But isn't it impossible for her to access headquarters without an appointment?

404
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:17,836
She can't.

405
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:22,320
Do you think she's the type to give up?

406
00:32:23,673 --> 00:32:25,743
Of course not.

407
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:29,781
She'll do whatever she can to meet him.

408
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,730
   

409
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:40,191
There are no meetings scheduled for the marketing team...

410
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:43,594
It's a last-minute meeting. I just made the call.

411
00:32:43,594 --> 00:32:45,670
Let me call the marketing team...

412
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,398
Look here.

413
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,466
Excuse me?

414
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:52,604
You're treating a senior director of VC Communications as a stranger to VC Group.

415
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,572
I apologize.

416
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,042
Affiliates can't access headquarters without a prior appointment...

417
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:01,845
I'm an executive of the affiliate with identification...

418
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,128
Senior Director Go Ah In?

419
00:33:23,602 --> 00:33:26,737
I'm Vice-Chairman Kang Han Soo.

420
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,545
You're working so hard.

421
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,781
That's what work is.

422
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:41,330
I'm not just talking about work. I'm sure it's not easy task to work for my sister.

423
00:33:42,082 --> 00:33:45,287
On Hanna's first day at work,

424
00:33:45,287 --> 00:33:47,925
I heard you told her to ask questions if she didn't know something at work.

425
00:33:48,593 --> 00:33:51,595
Yes, I did.

426
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,699
We should sit down for a meal one day.

427
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,135
For what reason?

428
00:33:58,135 --> 00:34:00,004
Reason?

429
00:34:00,991 --> 00:34:05,076
Well, let's say it's curiosity and a search for talent.

430
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:07,578
I'll refuse the curiosity.

431
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:11,815
As for talent, I've already been discovered.

432
00:34:11,815 --> 00:34:16,821
But if it's recruitment for talent, I could be interested in that.

433
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:29,467
She's a piece of work. I can't leave her beside Hanna.

434
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:38,206
You can get crushed in a fight between whales, or you can hunt one whale.

435
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:40,811
I'm sure it's one of the two.

436
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,313
 I think it'll be difficult. 

437
00:34:49,857 --> 00:34:51,790
 I told you not to say that you can't do it! 

438
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:56,260
 I'm sorry, but I don't think the chairman can get bail right now... 

439
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,494
 We have to be careful of the public... 

440
00:34:57,494 --> 00:35:00,731
 Hey, are you kidding? 

441
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,254
   

442
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,873
Who are you?

443
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,475
The person you are trying to call is unavailable.

444
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:15,145
Please try back again later.

445
00:35:17,983 --> 00:35:20,217
That's what it said...

446
00:35:20,217 --> 00:35:25,413
But I don't have time to call again. That's why I'm here.

447
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:29,994
It's not polite to show up unannounced like this.

448
00:35:29,994 --> 00:35:34,131
Not being able to do your job properly despite getting paid.

449
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,933
I wouldn't call that polite either, would you?

450
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:38,636
What? Who are you to say something like that?

451
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,638
Legal Team Leader?

452
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,040
Yes?

453
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,220
I hear you're struggling to keep your head above water these days.

454
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,856
Are you going to drown like this?

455
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:05,530
What did you say?

456
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:11,032
If I rescue you, what will you give me?

457
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:16,740
Turn a crisis into an opportunity.

458
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:26,402
Just give me 10 minutes. Alone.

459
00:36:26,402 --> 00:36:28,486
What do you think you're doing?

460
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,454
- Get out!! 
 - Wait.

461
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:37,594
You only need 10 minutes?

462
00:36:37,594 --> 00:36:39,731
Just don't ask for more.

463
00:36:39,731 --> 00:36:43,634
Isn't time of the essence?

464
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:51,610
   

465
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,227
Mr. Kim, have you had lunch?

466
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,228
I'm on my way now.

467
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,934
You must've had something good.

468
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:21,705
I met with a subordinate and had puffer fish stew.

469
00:37:21,705 --> 00:37:23,073
Sounds nice.

470
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:26,790
I heard you weren't in any type of position to enjoy yourself like this.

471
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,114
About that...

472
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:37,921
 Theoretically, that seems possible... 

473
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:41,125
 But is it possible in real life? 

474
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,760
 We have to try. 

475
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,662
 If I say it'll work without even trying, I'd be a con artist. 

476
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:54,903
 The overall angle is good, but a few parts are missing. 

477
00:37:54,903 --> 00:37:58,542
 That will be filled by other experts. 

478
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:05,408
 Yeah, hey. 

479
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,985
 Okay, wait a second. 

480
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,187
 Yeah, go ahead! 

481
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,085
 How's the disposition? 

482
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,875
 Okay, got it. 

483
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,870
 It won't be easy. 

484
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,972
 It seems he's the type that lives for meaning over desire. 

485
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:32,690
 That's only when meaning and desire are separated. 

486
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,712
 What I gave you isn't difficult, but regarding the model you mentioned... 

487
00:38:39,712 --> 00:38:42,753
 My subordinates might find it uncomfortable. 

488
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,889
 Because it's their weakness? 

489
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,690
 You could say that. 

490
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:52,528
 Then you should resign from the company so your subordinates can be comfortable. 

491
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:55,065
 You could raise a few dogs in the country. 

492
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,934
 - What did you say? 
 - Can you do that? 

493
00:38:58,934 --> 00:39:02,002
 Can you give up all of this? 

494
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:04,708
 Because that's where you're headed on this path right now. 

495
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:09,046
 You can't handle one prosecutor who makes 50 million won a year? 

496
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:11,974
 - Well... 
 - You should be worth the money you're paid. 

497
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,651
 Even if you don't work as much as you're paid, 

498
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:18,155
 you're no longer a civil servant who's guaranteed retirement. 

499
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:24,094
 This is a company. Performance and results are everything at this company! 

500
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:36,940
 Legal Team Leader. 

501
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,642
 Yes? 

502
00:39:39,344 --> 00:39:42,713
 You serve your distinguished superior even if it makes you uncomfortable, 

503
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,649
 but you comfortably disregard a superior who's not doing so great. 

504
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:50,087
 Isn't that what you call a society? 

505
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:53,624
 Especially, your particular subordinates. 

506
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,927
 This is what they do best in our society. 

507
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:03,501
 You work like a heroine. 

508
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:07,804
 I'm not working like a heroine. This is just how I work. 

509
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:11,441
 A superior with power even if it's uncomfortable... 

510
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:16,880
 Okay. I'll check and send you a list. 

511
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,917
 Make sure they look as simple as possible. 

512
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,353
 That'll be advantageous. 

513
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:25,022
 Also, if you don't mind. 

514
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,525
 Keep our conversation a secret from others. 

515
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:28,493
 For what reason? 

516
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:31,061
 Don't you think they'll try to gift wrap it as their own if they find out? 

517
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:34,660
 Especially, the one right next to the boss. 

518
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,567
 You're right. 

519
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,599
 I could only give you 10 minutes. 

520
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:42,740
 But you stole 25 minutes from me. 

521
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,919
 She's smart and reckless. 

522
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:59,656
 She's going to cause big trouble. 

523
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,094
Oh... About that...

524
00:41:07,766 --> 00:41:12,302
I should try to be more positive despite difficult situations.

525
00:41:12,302 --> 00:41:14,404
I'm busy. If you'll excuse me.

526
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:33,524
Find out who the team leader of legal met with today.

527
00:41:36,834 --> 00:41:41,996
He's got something... He's trying to keep it for himself.

528
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:52,376
This is it?

529
00:41:57,718 --> 00:41:59,717
   

530
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,927
   

531
00:42:07,927 --> 00:42:11,028
His desire must be greater than meaning right about now.

532
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,595
   

533
00:42:37,903 --> 00:42:40,331
   

534
00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:52,610
   

535
00:42:59,978 --> 00:43:02,813
Are you Attorney Choi Yeong Jae?

536
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:07,084
- Do you work out? 
 - Excuse me?

537
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:10,855
I mean, you came up four flights of stairs and you're not out of breath.

538
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:16,091
Which means either you work out a lot, or you're pretending to act hard in front of me.

539
00:43:16,091 --> 00:43:18,829
So you caught your breath before you came in here.

540
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:21,065
Most people normally pant while they come through the door.

541
00:43:21,065 --> 00:43:23,668
They're wronged, angry, and they can't eat.

542
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:24,905
They can't even sleep.

543
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:29,206
I've also come to you in a state where I can't eat or sleep.

544
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:36,179
You don't look like someone who's been wronged.

545
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:38,448
I haven't been wronged.

546
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:41,818
Then, who are you?

547
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:45,388
Santa Claus.

548
00:43:45,388 --> 00:43:49,559
I came to give a good lawyer who does good work a gift.

549
00:43:55,533 --> 00:44:01,505
Oh, wow. I guess Santa Claus drives a foreign car these days.

550
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:05,543
True, he'll get accused of animal cruelty if he rode around with Rudolph.

551
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:11,144
I'd like to propose something. Do you want to hear it while you eat?

552
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:18,206
Santa Claus says you shouldn't cry. I say my noodles shouldn't get soggy.

553
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,529
You won't be able to digest that after you hear what I have to say.

554
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:32,402
I'd like to support your activities.

555
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:36,340
Sure, go ahead.

556
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,708
I'll give you three billion won a year.

557
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:51,445
I told you, didn't I? That you wouldn't be able to stomach it.

558
00:44:59,231 --> 00:45:00,964
Are you at the office?

559
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,868
Go to my office. Call me when you get there.

560
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,890
   

561
00:45:16,647 --> 00:45:18,082
   

562
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,318
Yeah, what about the director?

563
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:24,153
Director Jang has agreed to do it.

564
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:29,790
 Whether you'll work dirty with them while buying them drinks or whether you'll work cleanly with me, 

565
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,163
 you do the math and decide. 

566
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,765
True. If we go with Director Jang, we won't have to worry about anything leaking to Senior Director Choi.

567
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:42,670
The problem is trying to get the best directors. They're hard to get a hold of right now.

568
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,609
That's okay. Speed is more important than quality right now.

569
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,311
What about the staff?

570
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,945
Just a moment.

571
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:51,215
The staff have been prepared.

572
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:52,583
It's all prepared.

573
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,785
Okay. I'm on my way. Let's talk when I get there.

574
00:45:54,785 --> 00:45:56,720
How long will it take you?

575
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,424
- 10 minutes. 
  - Okay. 

576
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:05,863
The senior director is almost here. Let's go to the conference room.

577
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:07,564
Okay.

578
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:22,847
How's it going? I heard you don't have a direction yet.

579
00:46:22,847 --> 00:46:25,649
Yeah, it's not going well.

580
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:26,984
I heard you started production.

581
00:46:26,987 --> 00:46:29,985
- That's none of your business. 
 - Must be nice. I'm so jealous.

582
00:46:29,985 --> 00:46:33,090
I haven't decided on a direction yet. If you'll excuse me.

583
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,928
Yeah?

584
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,699
Headquarters' legal team leader?

585
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:50,408
This is great!

586
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,057
You're all too excited right now.

587
00:46:56,228 --> 00:46:59,082
You're all so energetic after a good night's sleep!

588
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:01,652
It's not the sleep, it's the hope!

589
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,288
It was so frustrating trying to decide which message to relay.

590
00:47:05,288 --> 00:47:09,126
You won't regret making us creative directors.

591
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,030
What I said before...

592
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:27,577
I organized everything and emailed it to you.

593
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:34,352
Great.

594
00:47:34,352 --> 00:47:38,789
He refused to do it for 100 million won, but he called me back.

595
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,126
Attorney Choi Yeong Jae called me.

596
00:47:42,126 --> 00:47:44,040
He said he'd do it.

597
00:47:45,495 --> 00:47:49,266
I'm supposed to meet Senior Director Choi from the agency.

598
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:53,003
Did the head secretary tell you that?

599
00:47:53,003 --> 00:47:54,138
How did you know?

600
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:57,641
There are so many birds and rats listening.

601
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,546
I knew I had a bad feeling...

602
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,383
 - Where are you?  
 - Yeah, I'm on my way.

603
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:10,587
What shall I say?

604
00:48:11,656 --> 00:48:13,713
Everything besides what we talked about.

605
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:15,425
I'm hanging up now.

606
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,567
He just sent an email. Get this person's interview video.

607
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,968
Okay.

608
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:27,637
Try to make it as fresh as possible.

609
00:48:27,637 --> 00:48:31,228
- I think the BGM is just as important as the video. 
 - Yeah.

610
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:33,510
Pick a pop song that everyone in the nation would know.

611
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:35,612
Can you finish before the presentation date?

612
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:39,683
We have to make it possible, no matter what.

613
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:48,291
What shall we do?

614
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,773
- Look... 
 - Okay..

615
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,446
You don't think this is it, right?

616
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,883
It needs to capture more attention in our daily lives...

617
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,787
Eun Jeong?

618
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:22,492
 You're in charge of printing. Go with one line for the copy. 

619
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:24,561
 How? 

620
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:28,798
 The law isn't perfect. 

621
00:49:32,457 --> 00:49:34,171
 But what's the meaning behind this copy? 

622
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,607
 You want to know what that has to do with Woowon's corporate PR, right? 

623
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:40,344
 This sounds like a message from the members of the NGO... 

624
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:43,647
 That's it. Something the NGO would do. 

625
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:47,751
 Make it sound like it's a message from the public and not a private company. 

626
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:51,254
 Something people can see in their daily lives. 

627
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:56,537
 Oh, so use the environment in our daily lives and try to increase attention. Right? 

628
00:49:56,537 --> 00:50:00,964
 A way to get it to spread through social media and cause a buzz. 

629
00:50:00,964 --> 00:50:03,032
 Focus on that. 

630
00:50:05,069 --> 00:50:08,771
Jang Woo, how about this?

631
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:12,742
We can use an area or an object that gives off an imperfect image.

632
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:16,112
That can be the medium and we can just add a copy to it.

633
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:20,684
What about a broken place? With things that need to be fixed.

634
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:21,951
Things that look frail?

635
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:25,088
Yeah, like a cracked wall for example

636
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:27,069
or a subway escalator that's being repaired.

637
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:28,025
Or...

638
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:33,897
What if we wrap a copy around a broken car in front of the court?

639
00:50:34,992 --> 00:50:35,666
I'll look for it.

640
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:39,102
Send me everything you find as you find it so I can photoshop it.

641
00:50:44,975 --> 00:50:46,944
   

642
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,483
I thought you were doing something amazing after meeting with the legal team leader.

643
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,184
Who?

644
00:50:55,184 --> 00:50:56,953
Nevermind.

645
00:50:59,826 --> 00:51:04,227
I know you don't know Go Ah In that well, but isn't this too much?

646
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,795
What?

647
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:11,768
Go Ah In hates these types of proposals. The long and boring ones.

648
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,604
The ones that focus on trends or whatever...

649
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:15,439
I don't either...

650
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:21,211
True, that's the result if the direction sucks.

651
00:51:24,202 --> 00:51:26,182
Good luck.

652
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:33,023
 Make it long and boring. 

653
00:51:33,457 --> 00:51:36,686
 Talk about what the trends are... 

654
00:51:36,687 --> 00:51:40,129
 The type of proposal that has graphs? 

655
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:42,532
 Yeah, that's it. 

656
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:49,570
 Um... Don't you like proposals that are short and impactful? 

657
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:52,075
 Yeah, normally. 

658
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:55,579
 But the type of proposals I hate is what we need right now. 

659
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:59,649
 Write it. Make it long and boring. 

660
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,641
 About... 100 pages? 

661
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:05,446
 Okay? 

662
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:11,094
 I'm sure she has her reasons. 

663
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,511
Let's make a stop at this store.

664
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:30,313
Okay.

665
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:39,555
Excuse me?

666
00:52:42,026 --> 00:52:44,460
Do you want to buy refreshments or something?

667
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:45,996
Yeah, well...

668
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:47,064
Uh, okay.

669
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,270
Is anyone here?

670
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:49,930
   

671
00:52:49,937 --> 00:52:51,301
 - Hello. 
 - Hi. 

672
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:54,137
Do you know a Jo Seok Jae who lives up the street?

673
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:58,541
Who? Jo Seok Jae? Jo Seok Jae...

674
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:01,511
Oh, the man who lived a hard life?

675
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:06,382
Of course. He's a regular here. Why?

676
00:53:07,952 --> 00:53:10,920
Don't buy this. Buy some beer.

677
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:22,265
How can he sleep when he's so angry on the inside?

678
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:25,301
He sleeps after a drink.

679
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:30,006
His favorite is eating dried pollack with beer.

680
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:32,818
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

681
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:35,545
Thank you so much for helping us.

682
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,282
I didn't do much...

683
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:41,851
It takes some time to set up for the shoot.

684
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:45,922
Do you want to drink some beer with me?

685
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,333
- That's good. 
 - Sure.

686
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:13,649
But can we drink before we shoot?

687
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:15,258
Don't think of it as a shoot.

688
00:54:15,259 --> 00:54:20,721
We're just having a conversation over a beer. Just think of it like that.

689
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:25,461
Sir, we're ready.

690
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,268
Can we get started?

691
00:54:51,355 --> 00:54:53,756
Here we go.

692
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:04,267
Do you remember that day 23 years ago?

693
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:10,640
I don't just remember it...

694
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,050
♫  You are a small gesture, little bird, deep in the desert  ♫

695
00:55:27,051 --> 00:55:30,326
 Don't go overboard. Make sure it goes smoothly emotionally. 

696
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,280
 Make sure you adjust the speed. 

697
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,867
♫  I woke up from that long sleep  ♫

698
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,402
   

699
00:55:40,447 --> 00:55:43,372
 Can we raise this a little? 

700
00:55:44,141 --> 00:55:46,060
 This location is good... 

701
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:52,620
♫  Wake up, open the closed door, and take a step  ♫

702
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:57,770
♫  Step out, jump into the world with both feet  ♫

703
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,820
♫  Now I enter a whole new world  ♫

704
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:02,038
   

705
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:07,830
♫  Flying into another sky  ♫

706
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:09,075
   

707
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,849
   

708
00:56:16,006 --> 00:56:17,874
Yes, Ma'am?

709
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,009
How's the proposal?

710
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:22,011
Oh, I'm spell-checking it now. Do you want to check it?

711
00:56:22,012 --> 00:56:25,280
That's okay. The others?

712
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,918
They're finished. Shall I email them to you?

713
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:28,819
Yeah.

714
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:32,620
Eun Jeong, email it to Senior Director Go. Okay.

715
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:35,458
I'll pass this on.

716
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:38,900
♫  The sky is still too far away  ♫

717
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,170
♫  Tell me everything  ♫

718
00:56:41,171 --> 00:56:41,966
   

719
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:44,570
   

720
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:49,070
♫  Draw the scenes that will unfold after countless repetitions of falling  ♫

721
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,806
 The editing is finished. 

722
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:53,975
 If only we had more time, we could make it more detailed. 

723
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:57,647
That's okay. We have some time before we go on-air.

724
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:02,485
As long as we can make it to then.

725
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,955
How is it?

726
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:08,390
How was it?

727
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:11,193
I edited it with the sound off this morning.

728
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,895
I didn't want to get emotional while I was editing.

729
00:57:12,896 --> 00:57:16,198
I've got a good feeling about this.

730
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:19,268
I think it'll be okay.

731
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:21,704
Email it to me.

732
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:24,607
 Okay, I'll send it and head back. 

733
00:58:02,446 --> 00:58:04,841
   

734
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:36,979
The letter has been written...

735
00:58:37,848 --> 00:58:39,483
   

736
00:58:44,821 --> 00:58:47,123
Your Honor, you're the first to clock in again.

737
00:58:47,124 --> 00:58:51,194
How can a civil servant that gets paid by the people be lazy?

738
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,062
It's a shame he stays at court all day.

739
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:57,014
Someone like him should be doing something more important in Yeouido.

740
00:58:57,014 --> 00:59:00,903
I hope you like the letter I'm going to send you.

741
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:05,474
A miracle...

742
00:59:07,134 --> 00:59:10,079
That's what I need the most right now...

743
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:29,220
   

744
00:59:29,227 --> 00:59:32,340
   

745
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:40,360


746
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:48,430
♫  There's a girl whose hurt from a thousand cuts  ♫

747
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:54,450
♫  Buried deep inside of her mind  ♫

748
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:58,227
 But why are you empty-handed? 

749
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,696
 Oh, the edits haven't been finished yet. 

750
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:02,164
 You can review it on the morning of the presentation... 

751
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:04,233
 No, I don't need a review. 

752
01:00:04,234 --> 01:00:08,504
 It seems like Go Ah In is trying to screw me over again. 

753
01:00:10,477 --> 01:00:12,464
 You. 

754
01:00:12,464 --> 01:00:13,376
 Get out! 

755
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:16,412
 I think I need to meet that woman. 

756
01:00:16,412 --> 01:00:19,849
 Let's prepare when Go Ah In has her guard down. 

757
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,017
 Do it quietly when she's on cloud nine... 

758
01:00:22,018 --> 01:00:24,620
 What do you think I'm doing now? 

759
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,989
 I don't need to hear it to know that it's useless. 

760
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:27,824
 Senior Director Go! 

761
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,792
 Starting now, put your leg down and focus while you listen. 

762
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:34,530
 You'll hurt your back if you hear it sitting in that position. 

763
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:41,800
♫  Arguing and fighting till she wanna scream, just scream  ♫
