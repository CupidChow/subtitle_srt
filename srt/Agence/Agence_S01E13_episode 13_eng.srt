1
00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:12,945
 Mister! Mr. Moon Oh! 

2
00:00:14,214 --> 00:00:16,415
 Hanna! 

3
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:17,984
 What is it? 

4
00:00:17,984 --> 00:00:20,486
 Did you bring banana milk? 

5
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:24,090
 Banana milk? No, I didn't. 

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,649
 Why didn't you bring any? 

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,326
 I never said I would. 

8
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:31,345
 You said if I stopped myself from crying whenever I wanted to cry, 

9
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:34,267
 you would buy me banana milk. 

10
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:36,269
 Why did you want to cry? 

11
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:39,305
 My dad comes home late. 

12
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:42,126
 My grandfather is scary. 

13
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:46,079
 My brother doesn't play with me. 

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,713
 And? 

15
00:00:49,082 --> 00:00:53,385
 I miss my mom. 

16
00:00:53,385 --> 00:00:59,159
 I didn't cry because I wanted to drink banana milk. 

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,261
 Then I guess I need to buy you some. 

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,969
 Ta-da! 

19
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,072
 Drink it! 

20
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:23,349
 Mister, living is so hard. 

21
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:26,319
 What's so hard when you live in a nice house like this? 

22
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,756
 I don't think there's anyone in the world who's on my side. 

23
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:32,491
 That's not true. There is. 

24
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:33,593
 Who? 

25
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,656
 Me. I'm on your side. 

26
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:37,564
 Really? 

27
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:40,862
 Of course, and it's not Moon Oh. 

28
00:01:40,862 --> 00:01:44,270
 If you call me Mr. Moon Ho, I'll always be on your side. 

29
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,174
 Then promise me that you'll always be on my side. 

30
00:01:48,175 --> 00:01:52,411
 Okay! I promise. 

31
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:59,018
 Now that you promised me, I'll believe you 100%. 

32
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:01,154
 Don't believe me 100%. 

33
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:02,376
 Why not? 

34
00:02:02,376 --> 00:02:05,658
 You can't trust someone completely like that. 

35
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,895
 You could get hurt later. 

36
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:12,832
 Then I'll believe in you 50%. 

37
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,433
 Sure. 

38
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:23,724
   

39
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,550
   

40
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,157
What are you doing? Why aren't you getting out?

41
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:42,594
I'll stay in the car tonight.

42
00:02:42,594 --> 00:02:44,731
Get out.

43
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:49,402
I don't want to go anywhere without you.

44
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,197
More.

45
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,386
More!

46
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:23,202
Hey, why would you stop?

47
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,175
I stopped because I thought it would spill over.

48
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,844
Are you someone who makes decisions?

49
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,548
That's enough.

50
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:39,085
Why did you stop without my instruction?

51
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:44,257
You can't pour anymore because you're afraid it'll pour over?

52
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,251
But I heard you were full of yourself.

53
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:51,497
Since you got an MBA, did you think that would make us the same level?

54
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,904
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,914
You rude bastard, how dare you speak without permission?

56
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:24,063
You rude bastard, how dare you speak without permission?

57
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:46,183
He's calling after just an hour.

58
00:04:46,183 --> 00:04:48,831
Which means things must've gone accordingly.

59
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,765
   

60
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,628
Yeah, are you enjoying your date?

61
00:04:55,628 --> 00:05:00,333
Hey! Kang Hanna is a complete psycho!

62
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:02,835
What happened?

63
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:08,371
I said something to her secretary just like you told me to. Then she suddenly threw wine in my face!

64
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:13,045
What else? She kept going on about some Waiter Rule?

65
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,815
What? Waiter Rule?

66
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:19,051
 Are you insane? What the hell are you doing? 

67
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,853
 Speak for yourself! 

68
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,423
 What do you think you're doing during a business meeting? 

69
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:26,592
 Don't you know the Waiter Rule? 

70
00:05:26,592 --> 00:05:27,760
 What? Waiter? 

71
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:33,096
 Those who are rude to waiters or their subordinates are never good business partners. 

72
00:05:33,096 --> 00:05:37,003
 It's a business rule that CEOs all over the world know. 

73
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,805
 Why are you talking about some business rule on a date? 

74
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:45,608
 Hey, you agreed to this potential arranged marriage just because you want to join my family. 

75
00:05:45,608 --> 00:05:48,548
 That makes this business. Am I wrong? 

76
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,316
 Do you like me? 

77
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:55,421
 I know you don't. I also hate this Bourgogne 

78
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,406
 and the fact that you ordered it to eat with these snails. 

79
00:05:57,407 --> 00:05:58,891
 What do you know about me? 

80
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:01,060
 We can get to know each other. 

81
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,496
 What's there to know? I know one thing. 

82
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:07,567
 Your family's business ranking. 

83
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:11,270
 You barely rank in the business world. Where do you get off? 

84
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,909
 How dare you throw wine on my employee right in front of me? 

85
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:25,501
 You are ugly. Your fashion sucks. 

86
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:29,819
 You have terrible business etiquette. That's three strikes. 

87
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:35,561
 Go! 

88
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:40,099
Then she humiliated me!

89
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:43,336
Hang up for now. I'll look into it.

90
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,672
 Hey, wait. Hey! 

91
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:51,877
Now, shall we bear some fruit?

92
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,884
Is that true?

93
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,088
Ah In, that's great. That's a good thing!

94
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,300
What are you talking about? I have another mouth to feed now.

95
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,962
You're always saying things you don't mean.

96
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:14,079
She gave birth to you. It'll give you strength having to provide for her.

97
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,936
How will that give me strength?

98
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,105
Even if it gets so awful and despicable that you want to quit,

99
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,241
you'll be able to endure it because there's someone you have to provide for.

100
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:25,711
Enduring and holding out is what working at a company is all about.

101
00:07:25,711 --> 00:07:27,679
You didn't know?

102
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:33,808
Eventually, the person you must feed and provide for becomes your driving force for staying alive.

103
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,723
Your driving force was much bigger.

104
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:38,691
My Ji Woo?

105
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:42,928
She's all grown up now. She's even getting married.

106
00:07:42,928 --> 00:07:45,130
She's getting married?

107
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:49,568
She hasn't even graduated yet!

108
00:07:49,568 --> 00:07:51,304
She graduates this year.

109
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,808
Once she graduates, she's going to study overseas with her fiancé.

110
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,010
She can get married after she studies.

111
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,881
It seems her father-in-law will retire next year.

112
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,988
Did you reserve a wedding hall?

113
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,690
No, not yet. Why?

114
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,992
Executives of the VC Hotel affiliates get a discount.

115
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:18,230
Hey, even if there's a discount, it's still a hotel. I can't afford that.

116
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,304
Why? You're not drinking?

117
00:08:25,304 --> 00:08:28,307
Yeah, I've been working out.

118
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:30,776
Working out? What type?

119
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,946
- I'm running. 
 - You?

120
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:42,221
Oh, then I can't sit around for this. Wait a second.

121
00:08:43,217 --> 00:08:49,729
Your sneakers. What size were you again?

122
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,063
Why?

123
00:08:51,063 --> 00:08:55,300
Wait a second. There.

124
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,736
I sent you a gift.

125
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:00,773
With what money?

126
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:06,855
You stopped drinking and taking your meds. You're even working out now. Can't I do this much?

127
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,085
Then let me buy Ji Woo's dress.

128
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,653
Why would you?

129
00:09:13,653 --> 00:09:17,857
Your daughter is getting married. Can't I do that much?

130
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:23,395
You're funny.

131
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:45,190
♫  When the world turns its back  ♫

132
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,440
♫  Tell me, "I'm on your side"  ♫

133
00:09:55,750 --> 00:10:06,950
♫  When an anxious tomorrow hurts you, tell it  ♫

134
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,490
♫  To me  ♫

135
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,930
♫  Love yourself and believe myself  ♫

136
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:27,730
♫  I know everything but there are times when I don't  ♫

137
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:35,180
♫  Don't give up, always be happy  ♫

138
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:42,430
♫  Even if I sit down when I am told to get up  ♫

139
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,518
That's not good for her health.

140
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,217
   

141
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,103
Yes, Sir.

142
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,640
I just got the call about what happened.

143
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,008
I'm sorry.

144
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,445
Why would you be sorry for that?

145
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:23,649
Hanna is at her favorite bar. Right?

146
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:24,817
Yes.

147
00:11:24,817 --> 00:11:28,487
Come out for a second. I'm outside.

148
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:30,989
Right now?

149
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,394
Yes, don't tell Hanna. Come out quietly.

150
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:15,164
It's just a waste of time if I beat around the bush, so I'll cut to the chase.

151
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,170
Yes, Sir.

152
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,606
Keep meeting Hanna.

153
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:25,510
You can marry her. I'll help you.

154
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,379
How's that?

155
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,100
I see what you can gain from this.

156
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,486
What do I gain from this?

157
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,289
I knew it!

158
00:12:38,289 --> 00:12:41,861
You're perfect to be my brother-in-law.

159
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:47,266
If you marry her, I'll give you 300 billion won in cash

160
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:51,770
and 100% stakes in a company that manages the affiliates building.

161
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:58,710
But I didn't know I was worth this much.

162
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,446
What are you talking about?

163
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:05,050
If I think about what could fall into Hanna's lap, this is nothing.

164
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,923
What could be more cost-effective for both of us?

165
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:13,492
Well?

166
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:18,097
Think about it. I'll be waiting for your call.

167
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:24,550
Yes, I had a lot on my mind recently.

168
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,425
But now that I've heard your offer,

169
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,709
I'm thinking so clearly now.

170
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:38,350
I'll give you my answer as soon as possible.

171
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:03,938
Get up. You have to stand on your own from now on.

172
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,230
Hey, Mr. Park.

173
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,689
Why are you so poor? Why?

174
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,791
How am I poor? I'm a deputy section head of a conglomerate.

175
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:25,697
What did your grandfather and father do instead of making money?

176
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:30,001
It's not like I did that well for myself.

177
00:14:30,001 --> 00:14:32,671
What's wrong with you?

178
00:14:32,671 --> 00:14:37,009
I made a lifetime mistake, too.

179
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:39,978
- What is it? 
 - Bitcoin.

180
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,481
Oh! Did you hear?

181
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,984
There was someone who paid 100,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas.

182
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:48,520
100,000 Bitcoins at their highest price of 80 million won.

183
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,890
That would be 8 trillion won.

184
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:57,429
Why did I work so hard at a company?

185
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:01,166
I should've been mining Bitcoin at home. Right?

186
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,717
You're right.

187
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:08,907
If you had, we could've taken out someone like Kang Han Soo.

188
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:10,895
Yeah.

189
00:15:11,422 --> 00:15:13,519
If I had,

190
00:15:14,366 --> 00:15:17,549
I wouldn't have been so confused.

191
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:28,393
Senior Director Hanna, I feel like I could die.

192
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,590
♫  For a long time, I've had a lot of worries  ♫

193
00:15:36,598 --> 00:15:39,100
I'm suffocating to death. Release your arms a little!

194
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,506
Put me down.

195
00:15:40,507 --> 00:15:43,508
You've upset me. I want to get down!

196
00:15:43,508 --> 00:15:45,678
Shall we? Do you want to come down?

197
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:49,414
No, I changed my mind.

198
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:51,016
Get down now.

199
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:54,352
I don't want to! I paid you!

200
00:15:54,352 --> 00:15:56,922
Piggyback rides aren't in the job description.

201
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,392
How much is it? How much for a piggyback ride?

202
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:02,929
Forget it.

203
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:06,332
What do you mean? How much is it? I have a lot of money!

204
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,901
It's on the house. I'll do it for free.

205
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:13,972
Forever?

206
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,140
♫  No matter how much I try to tie up  ♫

207
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:22,814
That hurts! Get down if you're going to do that!

208
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:25,650
Let's take a walk.

209
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,201
You need to use your legs for it to be a walk. How could you call this a walk?

210
00:16:28,201 --> 00:16:31,223
I absolutely hate walking!

211
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:33,592
Ugh, you're so heavy!

212
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:36,876
You don't even look that heavy. How are you this heavy?

213
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:41,762
Welcome.

214
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,822
Take a seat.

215
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,839
Can you show me a two-room officetel?

216
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,109
Is it for you?

217
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:53,779
No, not me.

218
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,181
It's for my mother.

219
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,519
So it'll be for someone who's a little older.

220
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:08,660
There's a place with a subway station and a general hospital near it.

221
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,130
Here. I don't think this is the right place.

222
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,301
There's a police station close to here, so it could get kind of loud.

223
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:17,502
How's the security there?

224
00:17:17,502 --> 00:17:21,100
Oh, it's like the Blue House there.

225
00:17:21,706 --> 00:17:24,442
Then I'll take that place.

226
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,877
Call this number.

227
00:17:25,877 --> 00:17:29,381
Show her this place. You can call me if she likes it.

228
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,752
By chance, are you Senior Director Go Ah In's mother?

229
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:36,220
- Yes. 
 - Hello, I'm the real estate agent.

230
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,557
Let's go. I'll show you the place.

231
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,894
Let's go.

232
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,011
Come in.

233
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,210
Please come in.

234
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,930
   

235
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:29,875
You have a very devoted daughter. The rent here isn't cheap.

236
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,807
 The place is so nice that I feel sorry. 

237
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:26,131
 Mother, if you live there... 

238
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,240
 If you live there, it'll be of help to me. 

239
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,009
 I'll sign the lease. 

240
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,621
Did you call for me?

241
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,491
Why didn't you tell me?

242
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:55,627
Excuse me? What do you mean?

243
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,630
I met her yesterday. You can tell me.

244
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,134
Oh, well.

245
00:20:03,134 --> 00:20:04,836
It's okay.

246
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:10,281
I remember what you said to me before.

247
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:12,044
To prove it.

248
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,146
 Prove that you can be useful to me. 

249
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:19,653
 Not with the dirty tricks Senior Director Choi likes to use, but with your abilities. 

250
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,322
So?

251
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:27,493
I don't have any abilities I can use to prove myself to you.

252
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:31,296
It's not like I can give you ideas like the others.

253
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,906
I don't have any abilities to show you,

254
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:38,069
but I have the ability to not do something.

255
00:20:38,069 --> 00:20:42,941
I thought the best thing I could do was not say anything at all.

256
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:49,173
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:49,173 --> 00:20:52,250
I didn't even know the whole story, and I spoke to you in that way.

258
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,390
I apologize. Also, thank you.

259
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,493
No, it's completely understandable.

260
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:05,363
I would've done the same in that situation.

261
00:21:05,363 --> 00:21:07,866
Why didn't you report this to Senior Director Choi?

262
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,652
You could've become a full-time employee if you told him what you knew.

263
00:21:12,652 --> 00:21:15,807
I do want to be a full-time employee.

264
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:21,146
But I don't want to become one if it's going to hurt others.

265
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,083
I want to be part of one team, too.

266
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,718
One team?

267
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:31,223
Yes. Of course, it's impossible for me.

268
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,226
I've been working for eight years already.

269
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:39,331
But I never felt like I belonged anywhere before.

270
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,219
I heard that we are one team.

271
00:21:41,219 --> 00:21:44,669
It was also the first time someone said I was part of the family.

272
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,605
 Are you the one presenting? 

273
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:50,275
 We're a team. Of course, we're nervous. 

274
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,111
 Our team shares a common fate. 

275
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,582
Did Eun Jeong say that?

276
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,040
Yes.

277
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,887
It's the same for you, but they're wonderful to me.

278
00:22:03,887 --> 00:22:06,792
I didn't want to disappoint them.

279
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,800
I'll keep the promise that Senior Director Choi made you.

280
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,737
If I get the ability to do that.

281
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,409
Thank you. But...

282
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,145
Senior Director Choi told me to leave the company immediately.

283
00:22:30,145 --> 00:22:32,851
He was so scary when he said it.

284
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,255
So I had no choice but to report something to him.

285
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,558
What is it?

286
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,094
   

287
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,630
   

288
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,040
The chief project officer and the chief creative officer.

289
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,479
You two must be candidates to be the next CEO for VC communications.

290
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:01,747
Yes.

291
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:05,417
So you two are rivals?

292
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,352
That's right.

293
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,722
In other words, the enemy of my enemy is my friend?

294
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,690
Of course.

295
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,059
I've got a good feeling.

296
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,695
I came to say hello.

297
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:21,366
I didn't think we'd have anything to lose if we were to get along.

298
00:23:21,366 --> 00:23:26,471
Well, I might have something to give you.

299
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:30,975
But what can you do for me?

300
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:33,878
I'll be your speaker.

301
00:23:33,878 --> 00:23:36,247
With all the information that you give me.

302
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:41,887
I'll be the speaker that shares it with all the employees.

303
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,333
 It's the same for you, 

304
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:59,871
 but they're wonderful to me. I didn't want to disappoint them. 

305
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,718
What's wrong? Does your back hurt?

306
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,887
- Oh, hello! 
 - Hello, you're here?

307
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:21,593
Is there any office worker that doesn't have back or neck pain?

308
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,463
Aren't I right, young men?

309
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,820
Let's go.

310
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,900
Pardon?

311
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,663
Let's go to change them.

312
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,117
All of you.

313
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,370
♫  Four walls up late, and the radios buzzing
  ♫

314
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,710
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

315
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,400
♫  It's keeping me awake, maybe I should say something  ♫

316
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,299
People use that sort of desk these days.

317
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,395
Wow, I only ever saw them in movies.

318
00:24:57,395 --> 00:25:01,365
They stand and work like that in Silicon Valley.

319
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,202
I always wanted to use a desk like that.

320
00:25:04,202 --> 00:25:05,900
It used to be a punishment when we were kids.

321
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,406
We'd have to stand if we got caught talking in class.

322
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,310
Don't you know how to read the situation?

323
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,344
Are you trying to ruin the mood?

324
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:18,686
Come on, Jang Woo. That's why you've never had a girlfriend.

325
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,520
You've never dated anyone?

326
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,623
No.

327
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,759
Welcome.

328
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:30,061
We came to look at some desks.

329
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:32,230
I'll help you with the products.

330
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,400
♫  Don't say this ain't working  ♫

331
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,730
♫  Don't say we ain't, don't you say we ain't working  ♫

332
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,579
Oh! This will be so much better than sitting all day.

333
00:25:47,579 --> 00:25:50,603
The design is sophisticated and nice. What do you think?

334
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:53,018
- I like it. 
 - Me too.

335
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,655
We'll take it.

336
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,729
I don't like it.

337
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,432
Why not? You don't like it?

338
00:26:07,432 --> 00:26:11,169
No, the desk is really nice.

339
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:12,604
But?

340
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:17,842
This isn't the company card. It's your personal card.

341
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:20,446
You're using your own money.

342
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:23,114
I'm afraid it will be burdensome.

343
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,017
It's okay.

344
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,954
I have a debt to pay back to you all.

345
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:32,857
Debt? To us?

346
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:34,626
Yeah, there is.

347
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,598
Also, let's have a company dinner soon.

348
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,967
- Company dinner? 
 - A dinner?

349
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,611
Do you feel better?

350
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,713
Ugh, I'm so hungover.

351
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:58,715
You shouldn't have drank so much.

352
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:01,019
My head hurts, so don't nag me.

353
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,117
   

354
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,977
 It's time for me to tell her the result. 

355
00:27:27,546 --> 00:27:29,948
What's wrong?

356
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:36,020
Okay, I won't drink as much next time.

357
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,304
Eat it. It's one of your favorites.

358
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:58,376
Oh! Cartilage. I didn't have many in mine.

359
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,746
It's not cartilage.

360
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,670
Then what is it?

361
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,110
An ear.

362
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,686
- What? 
 - It's an ear. A pig's ear.

363
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,558
Mr. Park!

364
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,741
I wasn't feeling well to begin with! Did you have to tell me that now?

365
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:20,431
So did you trick me all this time?

366
00:28:20,431 --> 00:28:23,107
- Every time I ate this and liked it! 
 - Senior Director Kang.

367
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,650
Look around you.

368
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,330
Why?

369
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,113
I'm so embarrassed that I can't stay here.

370
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:38,437
I have things to do, so if you'll excuse me.

371
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,854
Are you going to leave me here alone like this?

372
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:49,294
Yes. You're an adult, so you should be able to do everything on your own.

373
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,759
I bet a building like that would be around 50 billion won.

374
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,200
Will that one be around 700 billion won?

375
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,384
My mom always wanted to buy a rural house in Jeju.

376
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:15,279
A billion won would be more than enough.

377
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,380
I couldn't use 300 billion won...

378
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,250
even if I tried.

379
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,382
   

380
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,734
Don't call me.

381
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,719
You're making me falter.

382
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,342
This brat!

383
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,362
What does he take me for? How could he be so cliché?

384
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,261
   

385
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,266
Are you at work? I'm on my way.

386
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,677
Welcome. Take a seat.

387
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,532
Did you have lunch?

388
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:36,567
Yes, I had soondae stew.

389
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:39,036
You should've eaten something nice. Why'd you eat that?

390
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:41,539
That's what I like. I'm a rice and soup addict.

391
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:45,240
That simplicity is nice.

392
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,046
I think I did a good job in judging you.

393
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,786
So, it seems like you've made your decision.

394
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:58,522
Yes.

395
00:30:58,522 --> 00:31:00,791
How do you want to proceed?

396
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,636
Like this.

397
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,574
Since I'm giving the vice-president an answer,

398
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:20,290
I prepared a classic white envelope.

399
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:26,620
   

400
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,110
   

401
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,493
Why are you being like this?

402
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,190
   

403
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:39,531
Is it not enough money?

404
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:43,434
No, I even calculated the money on my way here.

405
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:48,839
With 300 billion won, I couldn't use it all even if I tried.

406
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,043
But this is your answer?

407
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:54,278
Yes.

408
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:03,621
Hey! Are you insane?

409
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,025
Have you gone insane following Hanna around?

410
00:32:08,025 --> 00:32:12,089
Isn't that why you tried to get us together?

411
00:32:12,089 --> 00:32:14,031
Conjugal harmony.

412
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,809
If you're right, he's not resigning. He's being fired.

413
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:30,514
To be more precise, you're the one that fired him.

414
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:31,816
What are you talking about?

415
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:34,319
Was this promotion really a promotion?

416
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:39,824
He used Deputy Park to try to bring you down.

417
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:42,060
- Still! 
 - You knew that.

418
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,612
You knew this could happen.

419
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,635
You know that your future is over if you get caught with a servant. Right?

420
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:54,071
I can talk to my grandfather about that.

421
00:32:54,071 --> 00:32:58,464
I'll be the servant that had relations with you. I'll be kicked out.

422
00:32:58,464 --> 00:33:02,973
There is no synergy if we mix. We're poisonous to one another.

423
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,318
I wouldn't say I knew.

424
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:12,356
These are the results of what you said.

425
00:33:12,356 --> 00:33:14,130
Accept them.

426
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,218
Then, is giving up on something easily what working at a company is about?

427
00:33:20,218 --> 00:33:22,399
Just going down paths others have paved?

428
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,361
Of course not.

429
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:27,805
However, if you go down the path less traveled,

430
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:32,510
you must prepare yourself to go through things that others don't.

431
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,854
Hanna,

432
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:49,430
starting now, you're going to have to

433
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,490
get used to defeat and despair.

434
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,766
There's one more. Loneliness.

435
00:33:58,130 --> 00:34:00,304
You can help me!

436
00:34:00,304 --> 00:34:02,793
I can't do that.

437
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:08,576
You're going in a different direction from the advice I had given you. How can I help you?

438
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,518
Are you going to keep acting like you're not on my side?

439
00:34:14,518 --> 00:34:17,488
Did you forget what I just told you?

440
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:20,469
You have to get used to rejection.

441
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:23,961
Along with loneliness.

442
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:37,664
Fine. I'll figure it out on my own.

443
00:34:37,664 --> 00:34:41,078
You said you'd be on my side forever.

444
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:44,071
I hope you eat and live well all by yourself!

445
00:34:44,071 --> 00:34:46,132
Mr. Moon Oh.

446
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,361
Once it's stepped on, we'll find out.

447
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:04,655
Whether it's a sprout that'll die or one that'll grow into a big tree.

448
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,877
Let me ask you one last thing.

449
00:35:13,877 --> 00:35:17,047
It's because I can't understand it.

450
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,250
Go ahead.

451
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,319
You like Hanna, right?

452
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:23,654
Yes.

453
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:25,956
This is no small amount of money.

454
00:35:25,956 --> 00:35:27,759
It's a lot of money.

455
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:31,228
Then, how could you refuse an offer like this?

456
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,631
Because I want to live a happy life.

457
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:37,834
How can a broke man with no job be happy?

458
00:35:37,834 --> 00:35:43,274
If I take this money, I'd be ruining Hanna's future.

459
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,476
Could I be happy?

460
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,385
The way I see it, I think you're an unhappy person.

461
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,753
What?

462
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:59,882
That's what you said when you made me the offer. You said it was a cost-effective offer.

463
00:35:59,882 --> 00:36:01,992
So?

464
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:07,097
That means you think of everything in terms of cost-effectiveness.

465
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,834
Could you ever trust anyone?

466
00:36:10,834 --> 00:36:14,605
Could you ever love anyone?

467
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:20,310
It doesn't matter if you have 300 billion, 3 trillion, or 30 trillion in assets.

468
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,747
If it's a life where even love has to be cost-effective,

469
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,418
then I'll refuse.

470
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,424
You won't be able to gain anything if you live like that.

471
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:39,296
You'll be penniless. Won't you be cold?

472
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,837
I don't get cold that easily.

473
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,411
Make sure you live a warm cost-effective life.

474
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,740
Wait! What are you doing at headquarters, Deputy Park?

475
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,276
Are you here to see the vice-president?

476
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:32,650
I hope you live a warm and cost-effective life, too.

477
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:51,770
   

478
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,520
   

479
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,740
Where did you go?

480
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,175
I had something to do.

481
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:36,388
What was it? I called and you didn't answer.

482
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,951
- Are you on your way back from meeting Kang Han Soo? 
 - Yes.

483
00:38:41,951 --> 00:38:45,456
Why would you meet him? What did he say?

484
00:38:55,030 --> 00:39:01,535
You pick a fight with me and get angry, then you say you can't do this anymore.

485
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,607
Is this what you were after?

486
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,252
I knew it.

487
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,213
You were quick when it comes to this.

488
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,518
Don't tell me you turned in your letter of resignation.

489
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,287
Yes, I did.

490
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:19,489
What? Without speaking to me?

491
00:39:19,489 --> 00:39:22,593
Why would you turn that in to Han Soo?

492
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,999
Mr. Park, everything you're doing right now is so cliché.

493
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:29,866
It's not creative at all.

494
00:39:29,866 --> 00:39:31,689
Senior Director Kang,

495
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,939
life is full of clichés.

496
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:40,478
People can't accept creative things.

497
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:43,108
It seems you already know everything.

498
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,283
There's no need to explain.

499
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:10,407
I dare you to stick that in.

500
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,427
Grow up.

501
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:46,376
This is the last time I'll say goodbye.

502
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:53,594
If you leave like this, I'll never see you again.

503
00:40:53,594 --> 00:40:55,853
That's why I'm leaving like this.

504
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:02,893
Without you, there's no one in this world who's on my side.

505
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,662
There's no one I can trust 100%.

506
00:41:05,662 --> 00:41:10,599
You are the only one! Don't you know that?

507
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:12,835
I know.

508
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:14,920
If I stay here like this,

509
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:19,309
you could lose everything that you have.

510
00:41:22,347 --> 00:41:27,884
I hope you learned a lot this time.

511
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:33,490
That there are some relationships that can't create synergy when mixed.

512
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,220
♫  Even if I stretch out my hand  ♫

513
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,200
♫  A place that can't be reached  ♫

514
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,990
♫  There is far away, a shining light  ♫

515
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:09,900
♫  Grab me with both hands  ♫

516
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:19,300
♫  I might lose you as you get farther away  ♫

517
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,294
I won't cry.

518
00:42:23,375 --> 00:42:27,595
I won't cry.

519
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:38,000
♫  An unknown somewhere far away  ♫

520
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,490
♫  Oh, I'll protect you somehow  ♫

521
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,061
I will not cry.

522
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:55,830
♫  Don't lose the most important thing  ♫

523
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:04,170
♫  Stay there  ♫

524
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:21,031
I've been working for the past 19 years.

525
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:26,203
It's the first time that I've had trouble congratulating someone on their promotion.

526
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,874
Where are you going?

527
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,777
I'm going home.

528
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:37,013
You'll leave her alone?

529
00:43:37,013 --> 00:43:39,917
What would you have done?

530
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:46,824
If you became the weakness to someone who was the most precious to you?

531
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:52,112
If it were me,

532
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,266
I would've only thought about my gain.

533
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,072
I did the right thing, right?

534
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:04,608
Only time will tell.

535
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,583
I should go.

536
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:17,321
Mr. Park!

537
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,562
Don't change your number.

538
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:50,005
Visiting a nursing home, a detention center, and an orphanage?

539
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:52,551
A hamburger meeting?

540
00:44:52,551 --> 00:44:55,105
Are you asking me to run for office?

541
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,840
You have to look towards the back.

542
00:44:57,841 --> 00:45:01,031
It's content geared towards the MZ generation.

543
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:05,468
It's all a waste of time and so played out.

544
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:08,739
Still, this is what's popular with that generation these days.

545
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,841
So shouldn't it look like a waste of time?

546
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:14,778
That's why I pay you.

547
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:19,683
Make that waste of time look creative and a little more sophisticated.

548
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:24,927
Hanna wanted to send you away to the countryside.

549
00:45:24,927 --> 00:45:27,081
I can see why now.

550
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,150
Sir, I'll prepare this again.

551
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:35,731
- And if you do, will something be different? 
 - I'll try my best!

552
00:45:35,731 --> 00:45:40,034
Someone who was useful put in their letter of resignation and only the useless are left behind.

553
00:45:40,034 --> 00:45:43,206
I should've left this to Senior Director Go to begin with.

554
00:45:55,386 --> 00:45:57,888
- What are you doing? 
 - Excuse me?

555
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,391
Are you cold? Why are you shaking?

556
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:05,129
There are people that don't even bat an eye at 300 billion won!

557
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,566
All you get paid is your salary.

558
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:23,113
I'll prepare it again and show it to you when it's ready.

559
00:46:48,072 --> 00:46:49,240
What?

560
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,009
I have something to report to you.

561
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,443
What?

562
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,747
Yoo Jeong Seok's daughter is getting married.

563
00:46:57,747 --> 00:47:00,951
Do I need to care about that?

564
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:08,659
When is it?

565
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,397
I have to look into that. I'll let you know.

566
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:17,868
- Hey, Mr. Kwon? 
 - Yes, Sir?

567
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:21,839
I'm sorry I yelled. Great job.

568
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,021
Sure.

569
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:29,321
I'll check when the date is and let you know.

570
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:40,290
Hey. The VC Hotel Wedding Room is available, right?

571
00:47:40,291 --> 00:47:44,327
I want to wrap up Plan B which we talked about.

572
00:47:44,327 --> 00:47:46,248
Okay.

573
00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:52,860
   

574
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:56,316
The work the vice-president asked me to do,

575
00:47:57,449 --> 00:48:00,711
let's see if Go Ah In can do it.

576
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:06,726
He wanted me to show him what I was capable of.

577
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:10,220
Fine, I will.

578
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,400
Do you like that the best?

579
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:27,404
Yeah, I think this is the prettiest.

580
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:37,280
But it's too expensive.

581
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,750
Don't worry about the price and pick the one you want.

582
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,053
Still, this is too much for me to accept.

583
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:47,190
I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for your dad.

584
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:51,094
He doesn't want to accept anything from me.

585
00:48:54,231 --> 00:48:55,899
Don't hate him too much.

586
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:59,670
I don't hate him, my mom does.

587
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,639
My mom told him not to quit his job.

588
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,210
But he ended up quitting anyway and his business isn't doing well either.

589
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,015
At least for you, don't hate your dad.

590
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:19,253
Of course. I got a pretty dress like this because of him.

591
00:49:26,364 --> 00:49:29,867
Ma'am, bottoms up for the first shot!

592
00:49:29,868 --> 00:49:32,863
Just go home if you take half a shot! Just get back to work!

593
00:49:32,863 --> 00:49:36,173
We don't accept half shots.

594
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:52,888
- Is this how you have fun?  
 - Nope.

595
00:49:52,888 --> 00:49:56,326
This is how she has fun.

596
00:49:56,326 --> 00:50:01,646
Come on! This is a company dinner! I was just trying to lighten the mood!

597
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,134
And you!

598
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:06,436
What?

599
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:10,975
It's not like you to be so quiet!

600
00:50:10,975 --> 00:50:14,811
Come on. What are you talking about?

601
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:21,418
Do you like her?

602
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,220
Pardon?

603
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,322
You have that look on your face.

604
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:26,923
No, it's not like that.

605
00:50:26,924 --> 00:50:30,557
- So you don't like her? 
 - No, it's not that either!

606
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,364
I mean.

607
00:50:37,435 --> 00:50:40,336
He's a bit off the wall, but he's innocent.

608
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,406
Of course. He's so pure and innocent!

609
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:46,810
Now, that's enough! Eat your 1,500 grams of meat!

610
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:52,634
You eat 1,500 grams of meat?

611
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:57,787
Uh, sure. It varies depending on my condition, but...

612
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:01,591
I didn't know I was on the same team with these types of people.

613
00:51:05,463 --> 00:51:07,830
Then, what about you?

614
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:09,967
What about me?

615
00:51:09,967 --> 00:51:13,737
Was I serving a superior like this?

616
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:22,294
Get rid of that! Let me pour you a drink.

617
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:24,647
This is comfortable for me.

618
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:28,485
I'm uncomfortable.

619
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,020
Okay.

620
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:34,291
Take a drink!

621
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,204
Here.

622
00:51:56,461 --> 00:51:59,015
You can't pour your own drink tonight!

623
00:51:59,016 --> 00:52:02,520
I'm going to pour you drinks until my shoulder gives out!

624
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,289
I'll pour you drinks until I get carpal tunnel!

625
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,957
Okay, let's do that.

626
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,160
Let's fill our cups.

627
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:15,765
Give a toast!

628
00:52:17,768 --> 00:52:21,271
I hate stuff like that. Just drink!

629
00:52:21,271 --> 00:52:25,411
Then, let's just drink!

630
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:28,423
- Just drink! 
 - Just drink!

631
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:40,490
Oh my god, I'm so full.

632
00:52:43,815 --> 00:52:45,929
- Go, go, go! 
 - Oh, okay.

633
00:52:47,431 --> 00:52:48,994
This is new.

634
00:52:48,994 --> 00:52:51,534
Go Ah In is having a company dinner?

635
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,250
What the?

636
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:00,370
This is a first.

637
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:03,346
She even brought her assistant to the dinner.

638
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,380
   

639
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:19,762
So?

640
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:25,202
Go Ah In won't be able to increase sales by 50% within six months.

641
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:29,206
So, come back to work.

642
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:34,575
I'll be the CEO, and you can be Chief Creative Officer.

643
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:40,212
I'll send you back your money.

644
00:53:40,212 --> 00:53:42,712
Don't come back here again.

645
00:54:01,975 --> 00:54:04,590
   

646
00:54:07,845 --> 00:54:11,360
   

647
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,016
I heard your daughter was getting married.

648
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:18,021
Why would you have the ceremony in the outskirts instead of our hotel?

649
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,661
She's your only daughter.

650
00:54:25,661 --> 00:54:28,297
Do you want to sit around as a dad with a bar like this?

651
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:30,707
Or do you want to be an executive at a big advertising company?

652
00:54:30,707 --> 00:54:31,968
Hey!

653
00:54:31,968 --> 00:54:35,505
Do you want people to look down on your daughter as they do on you?

654
00:54:35,505 --> 00:54:37,244
You need power.

655
00:54:37,244 --> 00:54:41,144
It's the only way your in-laws won't step on you.

656
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:48,484
Is Go Ah In more important to you than your own daughter?

657
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,791
I'm going to keep the first promise that I made to Senior Director Go.

658
00:54:55,791 --> 00:54:58,061
A professor position at a university.

659
00:54:59,554 --> 00:55:04,088
She'll be a professor at a university and you'll be the next chief creative officer.

660
00:55:04,088 --> 00:55:07,085
It's a win for you both.

661
00:55:07,085 --> 00:55:08,905
Don't you think so?

662
00:55:18,855 --> 00:55:23,460
   

663
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:37,436
I sent the young man and woman together, so I'm sure they'll be fine on their own.

664
00:55:37,436 --> 00:55:40,904
Let's have fun on our own!

665
00:55:40,904 --> 00:55:43,940
I told you that we should come in separate cabs.

666
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,131
What are you talking about?

667
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:47,610
It's fun to chat on the way!

668
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,178
You call this fun?

669
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:51,447
I call this noisy.

670
00:55:51,447 --> 00:55:53,349
Let's go inside.

671
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:03,950
   

672
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,980
   

673
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:15,460
   

674
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:23,613
- How have you been? 
 - Oh, it's been so long!

675
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,648
- Hello! 
 - Come on in!

676
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,884
I see that you're open today.

677
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,820
Oh, yeah. Sit. Take a seat.

678
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:33,823
- We'll get the alcohol. 
 - Oh, sure. Yeah.

679
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:44,367
Huh? Is someone getting married?

680
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,119
Is Ji Woo getting married at VC Hotel?

681
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,572
Why didn't you tell me?

682
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,611
Why didn't you tell me?

683
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:58,514
Oh, I was going to call you.

684
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:27,843
But, Senior? I didn't want to say this.

685
00:57:27,843 --> 00:57:31,915
You used to be a copywriter. How could you misspell something?

686
00:57:33,584 --> 00:57:35,518
What are you saying?

687
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:43,326
Hof is spelled H-O-F, not H-O-P-E.

688
00:57:45,095 --> 00:57:47,430
Why would you say I misspelled that?

689
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:53,135
This glass of hof can give people hope.

690
00:57:55,038 --> 00:58:00,377
Wow, you really are a copywriter.

691
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:09,986
It's just a line to prove my past.

692
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,256
It's from my favorite writer's book.

693
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:16,592
I hope we can see each other often.

694
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:22,132
Why not? Is it too much of a burden for you?

695
00:58:22,132 --> 00:58:24,800
Am I too loud?

696
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:30,740
If we see each other again, I bet you'll be disappointed.

697
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,912
Is something wrong?

698
00:58:38,148 --> 00:58:43,152
This is why people need to get married.

699
00:58:43,152 --> 00:58:49,639
He's a father marrying off his daughter, his feelings are so uneasy right now.

700
00:58:49,639 --> 00:58:52,862
She doesn't even know that. Right?

701
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:56,799
Wait, excuse me!

702
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:24,794
Are you doing well?

703
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:34,770
Living isn't easy for me still.

704
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:42,134
In my life, there's no more hope.

705
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:44,140
People would go see the minister if his dog died,

706
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:47,343
but they wouldn't show up if the minister died.

707
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,400
   

708
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:09,340
   

709
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,380
   

710
01:01:17,711 --> 01:01:20,460
   

711
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:31,160
   

712
01:01:36,742 --> 01:01:37,794
   

713
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:40,015
   

714
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:43,927
   

715
01:01:43,927 --> 01:01:46,942
   

716
01:01:47,808 --> 01:01:53,170
   

717
01:02:11,595 --> 01:02:13,629
Senior?

718
01:02:15,365 --> 01:02:18,000
Oh, you're here.

719
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,037
Senior Director Go, welcome.

720
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:45,060


721
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:51,640
   

722
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:58,270
♫  Since I was left alone in the dark  ♫

723
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:04,540
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫

724
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:09,820
♫  I have the pain of soul to feel alive  ♫

725
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:15,100
♫  So I will make my road  ♫

726
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:18,027
 Weren't we at war? 

727
01:03:18,027 --> 01:03:21,463
 If I seemed peaceful, I owe you an apology. 

728
01:03:21,463 --> 01:03:26,467
 Putting employees together just because they're comfortable, that weakens us. 

729
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:27,769
 Increasing sales by 50%. 

730
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:30,207
 If we just figure that out, the rest will fall into place. 

731
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,208
 Why would you suddenly stop the ad? 

732
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:33,842
 I think you're very lucky. 

733
01:03:33,842 --> 01:03:35,277
 What do you want to say? 

734
01:03:35,277 --> 01:03:38,581
 There aren't that many loyal employees like that these days. 

735
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:40,616
 Human resources will call you soon. 

736
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:44,371
 You have to be stronger. How can you get weaker? 

737
01:03:44,371 --> 01:03:45,821
 You can use me. 

738
01:03:45,821 --> 01:03:48,557
 Of course. 

739
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:51,790
 It's not over until it's over. 

740
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:58,220
♫  So close to you when I fall asleep  ♫
