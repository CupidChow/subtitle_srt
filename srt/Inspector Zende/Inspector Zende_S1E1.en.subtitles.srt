1
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,625
Mumbai, 1986.

2
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:30,291
When Bachchan was wearing
the superstar crown on his head

3
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:33,416
and the lanes of Mumbai
were ruled by goons,

4
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,375
there was just one name
that the goons were afraid of.

5
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:38,041
The Mumbai Police.

6
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:41,041
In this era, there were quite
a few daredevils in the Mumbai Police

7
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,500
who brought
many astonishing cases to justice.

8
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,166
This is the story of one such case.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:50,083
A story that is true
but seems like a fantasy.

10
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:53,083
It's a story inspired by true events

11
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,708
but looks like a fairy-tale.

12
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,666
MAHARASHTRA ADMINISTRATION
GREATER MUMBAI MILK SCHEME

13
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:02,375
Uncle Joshi.

14
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,916
How are you?

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,291
Hey, Zende.

16
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:06,708
You on home duty today?

17
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,875
Uncle Joshi, if you have to keep
the commissioner at home happy,

18
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,458
you have to do these things.

19
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,750
And you have so many years of experience.

20
00:01:13,833 --> 00:01:15,333
Greetings! Special News Bulletin.

21
00:01:15,416 --> 00:01:19,166
Sources have confirmed
that Interpol's most wanted criminal,

22
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,666
Swimsuit Killer Carl Bhojraj,

23
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,833
fled last night
from the Tihar Jail in Delhi.

24
00:01:23,916 --> 00:01:24,916
Hey, Zende?

25
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,208
Where did he go?

26
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,708
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye.

27
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,166
-Bye, Dad.
-Go on. Bye-bye.

28
00:01:50,083 --> 00:01:51,166
Hey, where is the milk?

29
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,916
There is no milk, Commissioner.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Why?

31
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:56,083
Today the buffaloes
drank up their own milk.

32
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,000
It isn't even 7 a.m. yet.
You are in your uniform already?

33
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,083
I am leaving.

34
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:10,791
Go carefully.

35
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,208
What happened?

36
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,791
Name has been sullied.

37
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,000
Whose name?

38
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,333
The country's.

39
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:36,541
Dangerous killer, Carl Bhojraj

40
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:38,500
along with four other inmates,

41
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,625
fled from Delhi's Tihar jail last evening.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,958
Using his birthday as an excuse,

43
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,458
Carl gave the jail officials
and other inmates

44
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:53,875
a serving of rice pudding
laced with sleeping drugs.

45
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:10,875
Apart from Carl, the names of
the other inmates who fled the prison are:

46
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:14,750
David Jones, Lalit Khatana,
Ratan Tomar and Subhash Tyagi.

47
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,583
Tihar, baby!

48
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:31,958
Hey, get inside!

49
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,000
Will you sit on my lap now?

50
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,083
Come on, guys, we need to leave.

51
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,166
Goodbye, Tihar.

MAHARASHTRA NEWS

53
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,416
-Sir.
-Jai Hind, sir.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
-Patil, was there a call for me?
-No.

55
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,750
-It will come.
-It will not come, sir.

56
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,000
Our phone has been dead since last night.

57
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,041
He fled the jail and you are
sitting with a dead phone, Patil?

58
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:24,125
But, sir, I didn't--

59
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,333
That fellow Dattu Mane lives in
Building Number 4. Go fetch him.

60
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,500
Yes, sir.

61
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:30,958
But, sir, Dattu is a plumber.

62
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,500
His brother, Babu, he is the one
who works in the telecom department.

63
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:36,625
Get him here.
That's what I just said in Marathi.

64
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:40,083
Yes, sir. That's what you said.
I understood, sir.

65
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,125
Babu… Jai Hind, sir.

66
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,666
Hey, Babu, how much more time, man?

67
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,125
I am in more of a hurry than you, sir.

68
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,125
I was going to the toilet
when Patil sir picked me up.

69
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,500
Along with his tumbler.

70
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,375
You should pay the bill on time, sir.

71
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,666
Hey, loud mouth. Get lost!

72
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,250
AGRIPADA POLICE STATION

73
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,250
Sir…

74
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,291
Hey,

75
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:21,375
come here.

76
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:31,333
What brilliant mimicry, isn't it?

77
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,708
Do it one more time.

78
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:39,208
How about when the phone is engaged?
How will you mimic that sound?

79
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,208
He is an artist, isn't he?

80
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,916
Hey, Parab, take him in.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,750
Give him two on his behind,
and bring all the artistry out of him.

82
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,583
And he should continue to make the sound
till the phone starts ringing.

83
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,208
Sir, I was just trying to do
some social service.

84
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,500
I am also doing social service.

85
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,875
-Come on.
-For such a small thing…

86
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:08,083
Sir, I was wondering, who are you
expecting such an urgent call from?

87
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,958
He has run away. Him. Him!

88
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,166
Patil, sir, please hold on to it.

89
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,750
Oh, yes.

90
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,208
The phone is ringing, sir.
The real phone is ringing!

91
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:23,041
Oh, no… Patil, sir!

92
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,000
Patil?

93
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,958
You go ahead, sir.

94
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:30,583
I will pick up the fallen.

95
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey, shut up.
Why are you ringing when this is ringing?

96
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,875
-Hey, get him out of here.
-Sir.

97
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,875
Hello, this is Inspector Zende,
Agripada Police Station.

98
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,708
Yes.

99
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,458
Yes.

100
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,208
Yes.

101
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,708
I will be there, sir.

102
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:01,833
Right away.

103
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,833
MAHARASHTRA POLICE HEADQUARTERS

104
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,333
-Zende.
-Sir.

105
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,250
They have written about you
in the Daily Afternoon.

106
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,541
"Bombay Police have the man
who had nabbed Carl."

107
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,416
DAILY AFTERNOON

108
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,750
Have you caught Carl once before?

109
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,708
Swami Saranam. Swami Saranam.

110
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:05,833
Sir!

111
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,958
-Don't hit me. I will tell you everything.
-Tell me.

112
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,916
The plan is to rob Agarwal's office, sir.

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,541
-Who is Agarwal?
-A money lender on Merry Weather Road.

114
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:15,791
What is his name?

115
00:09:15,875 --> 00:09:17,666
-Carl.
-Carl?

116
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:20,916
Voilà!

117
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:34,833
Chanel?

118
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,833
Good choice, Mr Agarwal.

119
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,916
Please, sir.

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,791
My clothes?

121
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,041
You stay naked,

122
00:10:06,125 --> 00:10:07,375
you stay alive.

123
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,208
Hey!

124
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:16,541
Never point a gun at a lady.

125
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,500
Go on.

126
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:35,250
Which perfume?

127
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,791
Chanel.

128
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,250
Agarwal! You naughty boy!

129
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:44,375
You deserve better.

130
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:46,208
You know, don't you?

131
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,291
Boss, it's done.

132
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,208
Maybe next time.

133
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,875
Hello, Carl.

134
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:19,208
-Who Carl?
-You Carl.

135
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,541
I'm not Carl.

136
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,166
You are bloody Carl.

137
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,125
Shoot him.

138
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,250
You are under arrest!

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You are under arrest, Carl.

140
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,750
We have confirmed news from CID

141
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,416
that after fleeing the Tihar Jail,
Carl has come to Mumbai.

142
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,375
Can you catch him again?

143
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,541
Excuse me, sir.

144
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,250
Fifteen years ago,
Carl was an ordinary thief.

145
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:08,166
But in the last 15 years,
he has 32 murders to his name.

146
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,083
He has fled the prison five times,
across four countries.

147
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,375
It will not be that easy
to catch Carl now.

148
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:16,291
He is Interpol's most wanted criminal.

149
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,458
What do you know about him, Zende?

150
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:31,375
Have you got the role of
Gandhi's third monkey in some movie?

151
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,750
Oh, well.

152
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,500
Perhaps we picked the wrong man.

153
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,083
Karamchand Virwani Gurmukh Carl Bhojraj.

154
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,458
Mother is Lebanese.
Father is Indian Sindhi.

155
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,125
While he was still a child,
his father left his mother

156
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:46,958
and his mother remarried a French man.

157
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:49,750
He lived with them in France
for a few years.

158
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,875
He is part Indian, part Lebanese,
and part French.

159
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,000
But entirely criminal.

160
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,416
Carl always lives a five-star life.

161
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,000
Five-star hotels, five-star wardrobe,
five-star vehicles.

162
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,208
And he knows only one way
to fund all this.

163
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,500
Crime.

164
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:32,041
He has a face as handsome as Dev Anand,
and a tongue as sweet as Rajesh Khanna.

165
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,291
He can get anyone to do anything,
especially women.

166
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:54,916
You know what,
you look like that fellow Carl.

167
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:08,875
That criminal who broke out from prison
a few days ago.

168
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,875
My flight from Delhi to Bombay
had two men.

169
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:15,583
They had his picture.

170
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:18,750
They must have been policemen.

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,291
By the way,

172
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,500
what's your name?

173
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,250
Carl.

174
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,500
His first murder was
an American girl named Angela Norton.

175
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:51,625
He slipped sleeping pills into her drink
and drowned her in the sea in Thailand.

176
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,750
After Angela, there was Rosy.

177
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:11,041
After Rosy, there was Josephine.
And many other girls like them.

178
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:14,916
All the murdered girls
had swimming suits on them.

179
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,416
That's how he got his moniker,
Swimsuit Killer.

180
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:27,416
There are 32 known murders to his name.

181
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,541
What is the motive of his murders?

182
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:33,708
Money? Jewellery? Passport? Thrill?
The motive can be anything at all.

183
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,500
He has been arrested five times,
and fled prison all five times.

184
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,666
That is why the English newspapers
have given him the name "Snake".

185
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:43,458
Snake.

186
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,875
You know how to catch a snake, Zende?

187
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,833
Irrespective of how venomous
a snake is, sir,

188
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:57,333
a mongoose always beats the snake.

189
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,375
So, you are our mongoose?

190
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,375
Without a tail, with two legs.

191
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:06,541
-Get him, Zende.
-Sir.

192
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:10,750
Not on the chicken, man.

193
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,250
Do you think you are a mermaid?

194
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:16,916
Lalit, David, we have to leave.

195
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,583
-We were just starting to have fun.
-Now!

196
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,541
No more five-star hotels.

197
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,875
What should we do with this, sir?

198
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:31,083
Nothing. It is unclaimed.

199
00:16:31,583 --> 00:16:32,833
Right, sir.

200
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,583
Come on. Let us wrap this up.

201
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:20,083
What did you say his name was, sir?

202
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,125
Carl.

203
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:27,166
Carl? The one who fled the prison?
That one?

204
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:31,250
The one I caught 15 years back. That one.

205
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,750
So, that's who you have been
running after the past few days.

206
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:38,291
Commissioner, I ran after you for
three years before you agreed to marry me.

207
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,000
Are you planning to marry that rascal?

208
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,541
Don't make chapati
for me tomorrow, Mother.

209
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,000
Why? Are you going on a hunger strike?

210
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,916
No, tomorrow is a Saturday.

211
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,958
On every Saturday, I will fast in the
name of Hanuman, for your protection.

212
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,666
Look, Commissioner,
you are there for my protection.

213
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,416
Why trouble Lord Hanuman?

214
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,291
I don't meddle with your duty.
You don't meddle with my faith.

215
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,625
Absolutely.

216
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,916
Come on, now. You have school tomorrow.

217
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,541
What are you doing?

218
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,875
Just thought I'd help you out a little.

219
00:18:16,958 --> 00:18:18,875
There is no need to butter me up.

220
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:19,958
Leave it.

221
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:21,750
All right, fine.

222
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:35,833
You… Why does it have to be you?

223
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:38,666
Because I was the one
who caught him 15 years ago.

224
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,375
Then tell them that you are old now.

225
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:49,041
Am I really old now?

226
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,000
Let go.

227
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,041
Look, Commissioner.

228
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:58,750
One who does not commit injustices
on others is a noble man.

229
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:02,083
One who does not let others
do injustice to himself is a good man.

230
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,541
One who stops injustice
from happening to others…

231
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,916
is a true man.

232
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,791
Am I not a true man?

233
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,250
That is the trouble.

234
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,416
Trouble?

235
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,916
Uncle Zende!

236
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
What is it?

237
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:19,541
There is a phone call for you.

238
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,083
-Hello?
-Hello, sir. Sir…

239
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,625
-Hello?
-Yes.

240
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,541
Sir, a foreigner
has come into Hotel Airport Plaza.

241
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,583
He looks suspicious.
You should check him out.

242
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,416
Fine. I will be there in 20 minutes.

243
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:45,458
Look at this photograph carefully.

244
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,666
We are looking for this man.

245
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,666
Sir, how old is this photograph?

246
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,166
Fifteen years old.

247
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,416
What is this, sir?
We need the latest photograph.

248
00:19:58,583 --> 00:19:59,666
Is it?

249
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,541
Then catch him today.

250
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,166
And we will get
a photograph of him with you. The latest.

251
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:07,833
Housekeeping.

252
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:09,666
Click!

253
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,541
Sir, room service?

254
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,833
Room service.

255
00:20:28,708 --> 00:20:29,708
Cheers.

256
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,500
Sir?

257
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,958
Oh, madam.

258
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:37,041
Dinner?

259
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,875
Sir, the one in 410
is not opening his door.

260
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,083
-Break it down.
-Let's go.

261
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,833
Stop knocking. Break it open.

262
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,583
Say, Hail Bajrangbali! Break it!

263
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,958
-Get him!
-What is going on?

264
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,541
-Grab him!
-Let me go!

265
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,958
Let me go! Do you hear me?

266
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,125
-Shut up!
-Screw you!

267
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
Let me go!

268
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,791
Stand. Stand. Stand still.

269
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,916
-Does it look like him?
-No.

270
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:26,041
-No, it's not him.
-He is the same, sir.

271
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,125
Hello. Where are you from?

272
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,625
Let me go!

273
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,625
Look at his moustache. Look at it.

274
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,666
If I had a moustache,
even I would look different, sir.

275
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,083
Sir, he's biting me!

276
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,000
-Calm down, you goddam--
-What should we do now, sir?

277
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,958
-Take him in.
-Come on.

278
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,583
Come on.

279
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,500
Let's go.

280
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:50,208
-Come on.
-Let go of me.

281
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,625
-I hate you all.
-Hey, get inside.

282
00:21:52,708 --> 00:21:55,416
-Let's go.
-Come on.

283
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,208
Move!

284
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:58,958
Come on.

285
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:53,208
Sir! We are not able to handle him!

286
00:22:53,291 --> 00:22:55,875
Come quickly, sir! Hey, wait!

287
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,458
-Get off!
-Hold on to him.

288
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,750
Catch him!

289
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,416
-Don't--
-Quiet!

290
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,625
It is a very shameful matter,
DGP Purandare.

291
00:23:09,708 --> 00:23:11,083
Very shameful.

292
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:15,083
You should suspend
that useless inspector immediately.

293
00:23:15,583 --> 00:23:17,125
How can he catch the wrong man?

294
00:23:17,208 --> 00:23:18,625
And a foreign national at that?

295
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:21,791
Do you know the French embassy
has created a big ruckus over it?

296
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:24,041
Mr Swamy, tell us.

297
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:31,291
Mr Swamy works for our country
with Interpol.

298
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:33,125
International pressure
is building up, sir.

299
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,250
The 32 plus murders committed by Carl

300
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,375
have been on American
or European nationals.

301
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,541
That is the reason these countries
are putting so much pressure on us.

302
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:45,666
It has been four days since he fled Tihar
and we are nowhere close to catching him.

303
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,041
On top of that, the wrong
arrest made by the Mumbai Police,

304
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,541
it has made matters worse.

305
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,583
We tried our best, sir.

306
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:57,166
-But--
-But, clearly, your best is not the best.

307
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,958
I don't like it
when someone else disrobes me.

308
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:05,000
Yes, in fact, I am asking you
to hand over the case to someone else.

309
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,666
Will you come to the cattle mart with me?

310
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,166
To buy a pair of bulls?

311
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:12,333
Bulls, sir?

312
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:17,208
With your blessings, the department
is bound to give me an early retirement.

313
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:21,500
"Sorry, sir, I will go into farming."

314
00:24:21,583 --> 00:24:24,416
At least, the bulls will listen to me.

315
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,000
When did I ever not listen to you, sir?

316
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,583
I have handed you this case.
You are the one who is going to catch him.

317
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:33,750
Anyway, do you have any leads?
Where is he?

318
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:35,583
No, sir. After Airport Plaza,

319
00:24:35,666 --> 00:24:38,333
we have scoured through
all the five-star and four-star hotels.

320
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,625
He is not in Mumbai, sir.

321
00:24:39,708 --> 00:24:43,833
Wherever he is, his wicket
should be taken down by Mumbai Police.

322
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:46,458
-Yes, sir.
-Caught by Mumbai Police.

323
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,500
Bowled by Mumbai Police.

324
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:49,583
Yes, sir.

325
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:53,666
You want to jump in with me?

326
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:59,041
No, sir. If my clothes get wet,
I will get beaten up by the Commissioner.

327
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:00,125
Commissioner?

328
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,500
My wife, sir.

329
00:25:05,375 --> 00:25:06,875
Right, sir. Off you go.

330
00:25:09,916 --> 00:25:14,208
If we don't find Carl,
we will get beaten up by the ministry.

331
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:38,208
-Zende sir?
-Yes, sir.

332
00:26:38,291 --> 00:26:39,291
Let him pass.

333
00:26:41,458 --> 00:26:43,583
Sir. Inspector Jacob.

334
00:26:44,083 --> 00:26:46,958
Oh, yes, Purandare sir told me about you.

335
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:48,375
-I see.
-Yes.

336
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:51,166
Purandare sir gave me
the file on Carl just this morning.

337
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,708
Our friend left us a love letter.

338
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,083
That bastard.

339
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:04,750
Now we have to meet him soon and tell him,

340
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,416
"Mumbai Police loves you, too."

341
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,791
There is mention
of his wife in the file as well, sir.

342
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,416
Chantaal.

343
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,000
Chantaal is the name of his wife.

344
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:21,333
-Chantelle, sir. Chantelle.
-Huh?

345
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:24,125
-No, no, Sister. Can't have any more.
-Eat up. Eat, man.

346
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,041
But the spelling starts with C-H.

347
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:30,875
And C-H means "cha". Chantaal?

348
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:35,583
The spelling is C-H, sir,
but the pronunciation is "Shantelle."

349
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:39,375
Chantelle. These people are strange.

350
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:42,583
They write "cha", pronounce it as "sha".
Meanwhile, we are screwed.

351
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,291
Don't you laugh, Jacob?

352
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:56,375
-Me?
-Yes.

353
00:27:57,708 --> 00:27:58,833
I am laughing, sir.

354
00:28:00,625 --> 00:28:01,791
Okay. Fine.

355
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,375
Carl's wife left him long ago.

356
00:28:07,458 --> 00:28:09,458
But they haven't divorced yet.

357
00:28:09,541 --> 00:28:12,416
And the many books
that have been written on Carl,

358
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,541
the royalty amount from those books

359
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,041
gets deposited in Chantaal's…
Chantelle's account.

360
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,291
Hey.

361
00:28:20,375 --> 00:28:21,416
The tea.

362
00:28:23,416 --> 00:28:25,875
Sir, his wife is somewhere abroad, right?

363
00:28:26,666 --> 00:28:27,666
In America.

364
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,375
It's hot.

365
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:37,458
-What do you think, Jacob?
-Sir?

366
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:39,166
Where can Carl be right now?

367
00:28:39,958 --> 00:28:44,416
He could be anywhere, sir.
Jaipur, Jodhpur, Goa, Pondicherry.

368
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:49,583
Wherever there are a lot of foreigners.
They are his potential prey.

369
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:51,708
In such a place, as always,

370
00:28:51,791 --> 00:28:54,833
he will be staying in some five-star hotel
under a fake name.

371
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,666
MUMBAI
SATARA / PANVEL BUS STOP

372
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:06,291
Hey! Carl!

373
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,291
No names.

374
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,958
You said you'd take us to America.

375
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,541
What is this place you have brought us to?

376
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:17,833
The road to America goes through Panvel.

377
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:32,791
We were alert, sir,
because you sent us the Look Out Circular.

378
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:35,458
He was planning to get on
the Gorakhpur Express. We nabbed him.

379
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:38,750
We checked his bag.
We found these in the bag.

380
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,041
Ratan Tomar.

381
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:44,791
He is one of the five inmates
who fled Tihar along with Carl.

382
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,750
But he claims his name is Ajay Agarwal.

383
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Hello, Tomar.

384
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:51,375
Who is this Tomar, man?

385
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,541
My name is not Tomar, sir.

386
00:29:56,083 --> 00:29:58,541
It is Agarwal.
Ajay Agarwal, the businessman.

387
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:02,250
Sir, I swear that bag is not mine.
I found it lying around.

388
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,250
I must have taken leave of my senses
to have picked it up.

389
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:06,666
Why are your feet swollen?

390
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,833
Feet?

391
00:30:08,916 --> 00:30:10,291
I fell down as a child.

392
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,458
It is all right now, sir.

393
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
-You should have them massaged.
-Why?

394
00:30:16,583 --> 00:30:18,333
Nobody's massaged you?

395
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,375
My mother did in my childhood.

396
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,500
Mother is not there anymore?

397
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:26,166
You don't worry.

398
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,708
Your father is here now.

399
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:28,916
Gawde!

400
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,000
-Yes, sir.
-Get some lizard oil.

401
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:33,250
Lizard…

402
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,791
oil? Why?

403
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,875
So, Tomar.

404
00:30:36,958 --> 00:30:39,458
Not Tomar, sir. I told you, it is Agarwal.

405
00:30:39,541 --> 00:30:41,375
Ajay Agarwal, reputed businessman.

406
00:30:42,416 --> 00:30:43,458
Give.

407
00:30:44,791 --> 00:30:48,208
This India-Pakistan cricket match
that is scheduled in Sharjah.

408
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,708
Who do you think will win it?

409
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,750
Who is going to win?

410
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,875
Sir, I don't understand cricket at all.

411
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,958
I am a hockey man myself, sir.

412
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:03,250
Sir, the oil.

413
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,625
Lizard oil.

414
00:31:06,208 --> 00:31:08,041
I am okay, sir.

415
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:12,666
So, Agarwal sir.

416
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,875
Tomar… Ajay Agarwal.

417
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,916
-Gawde.
-Sir.

418
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:20,708
Give me the handkerchief.

419
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:25,833
Sir?

420
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Give me your foot.

421
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,500
Let it be, sir.
Why do you want me to partake in sin?

422
00:31:39,583 --> 00:31:43,208
As policemen,
it is our duty to serve the public.

423
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:45,000
Let it be, sir.

424
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,750
Sir!

425
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:52,333
It may hurt,
but all the pain will leave entirely.

426
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:54,958
Sir!

427
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:57,791
Okay. So, you like hockey, is it?

428
00:31:57,875 --> 00:31:58,875
Yes, sir.

429
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:01,541
Tell me the name of your favourite player?
Dhyan Chand?

430
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,625
Yes.

431
00:32:03,125 --> 00:32:05,166
-And Shahid?
-Yes.

432
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,500
-Roop Singh?
-Yes.

433
00:32:06,583 --> 00:32:07,916
Carl Bhojraj?

434
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,708
What happened?

435
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,125
Which player is that, sir?

436
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,916
I haven't heard of him.

437
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,208
Oh, you don't know of Carl?

438
00:32:18,833 --> 00:32:19,833
No.

439
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:22,708
He has shot big ones.

440
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,291
-Goals.
-He may have done, sir.

441
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:29,541
If an experienced person like you
is saying that, then he must be big.

442
00:32:29,625 --> 00:32:32,083
Sir, I am begging you, let me go.

443
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,083
You're trapping me for no good reason.
I haven't done anything, sir.

444
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,083
We have just applied the oil.

445
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,625
Now we have to squeeze it out.

446
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:39,958
Sir!

447
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,875
I got it, sir.

448
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,625
Come now, Tomar.

449
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,375
Let us play some hockey.

450
00:32:52,458 --> 00:32:54,041
Let it be.

451
00:32:56,291 --> 00:32:57,708
I don't want to play.

452
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:02,666
Hotel Panchratna.

453
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,333
Panvel.

454
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,500
HOTEL PANCHRATNA

455
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,458
You want rooms?

456
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:12,750
Mumbai Police.

457
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:15,708
What room is he in?

458
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,708
Alan? He is Alan, right, sir?

459
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:20,125
He is Carl.

460
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:21,916
Carl Bhojraj.

461
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,791
The swimsuit guy?

462
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,208
301 and 302.

463
00:33:26,291 --> 00:33:27,750
-Let's go.
-But they left, sir.

464
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,416
They checked out last night.

465
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,875
A telegram came for them this morning.

466
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:37,666
"Father not well. Haveliram."

467
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,500
The guy in 302 left just
an hour back. His train leaves at 12 p.m.

468
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:44,833
-Sir.
-Jacob, get to the station

469
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:47,375
-and make enquiries there, okay?
-Sir.

470
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:48,916
Hey, Jacob.

471
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:53,416
There is a station master
by the name of Shinde. He knows me.

472
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,125
I must be jinxed today.

473
00:33:56,208 --> 00:33:58,833
I missed the train.
Give me my room back, will you?

474
00:33:58,916 --> 00:34:01,000
-It is still available, right?
-Yes.

475
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:07,250
You got it cleaned up?

476
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:08,541
Yes.

477
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:16,625
Your room is available, sir. 302, right?

478
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,083
What are you mumbling, sir?

479
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,541
Grab him! Push him down!

480
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:37,291
"Father not well. Haveliram."

481
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:40,083
What is this?

482
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,333
It is nothing, sir.

483
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,541
Who is this Haveliram?

484
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:54,541
That series on TV, sir, called Buniyaad.

485
00:35:54,625 --> 00:35:57,375
He is the hero, Alok Nath.

486
00:35:57,458 --> 00:36:01,458
I am a homely man, sir,
who likes to watch series on TV.

487
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,541
These foreigners got me in trouble, sir.

488
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:06,083
Where is Carl?

489
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,791
Carl? Carl--

490
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,125
Sir!

491
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:12,458
He swindled me, sir.

492
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:16,208
He sent me off to Delhi,
and I don't know where he disappeared to.

493
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,208
-You bastard--
-Hey, stop it. Jacob, stop.

494
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:27,958
I am really bored of
running after this fellow, man.

495
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,666
Let us try something new.

496
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:32,416
-Sir?
-Something entertaining.

497
00:36:34,166 --> 00:36:36,458
You see that bee hive there?

498
00:36:37,958 --> 00:36:41,791
The one who breaks it
will get treated to a chicken meal.

499
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:45,041
Sir, that is not fair, sir.

500
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:49,208
You will run away after breaking it.
If they come for me, they will--

501
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:52,250
They will kiss you. Smack. Like that.

502
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,958
And not just one. A lot of kisses.

503
00:36:54,041 --> 00:36:55,833
Smack!

504
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,708
Sir. That is a crime, sir.

505
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,750
-Leave it. Let it be.
-Come now.

506
00:37:02,833 --> 00:37:04,500
-This is a good idea.
-You go first, sir.

507
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:07,791
It is a crime, sir. This is wrong.

508
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:10,958
What is this, sir? Go back further.
Anyone can hit it from here.

509
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:13,625
-Further back, sir.
-From this line.

510
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,708
-This is wrong, sir.
-Let me draw the line for you.

511
00:37:16,791 --> 00:37:18,375
I don't know anything, sir.

512
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,041
Sir, can I suggest something?

513
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:22,750
Let all three of us take shots.
Someone will hit it.

514
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,125
We just want to have chicken, right?

515
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,833
This is wrong, sir! Please let me go.

516
00:37:27,916 --> 00:37:30,458
No, sir. Please don't, sir.

517
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:31,791
-On the count of three.
-Oh, no.

518
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,291
-No, no, no, no.
-One, two--

519
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:35,833
Goa!

520
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:38,500
Goa.

521
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,625
-Goa.
-What about Goa?

522
00:37:41,333 --> 00:37:43,541
Carl has gone to Goa, sir.

523
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,750
What should I do if Carl has gone to Goa?

524
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,250
We are stuck here. In Panvel.
Come on, hit it.

525
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,666
Don't interrupt, man.

526
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,625
Sir! Bike!

527
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,833
He bought a bike.

528
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,625
A blue-coloured motorcycle.

529
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:02,708
A Rajdoot.

530
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:04,416
Registration number?

531
00:38:07,125 --> 00:38:08,583
8648.

532
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:10,166
Hey, Patil, note it down.

533
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,500
-Sir, it is our Jeep's number.
-8648.

534
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,125
-You bastard!
-Hit it!

535
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,291
Stop it, guys.

536
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:23,958
-Go, sit inside! Go! I will hit it.
-No, no, sir. He is not here, sir.

537
00:38:24,041 --> 00:38:25,958
Sir, G-R-D!

538
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:28,458
GRD 5460.

539
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,791
Why are you screaming?

540
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:16,791
She leaves for the US on the 7th.

541
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:19,583
And we leave with her.

542
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:24,875
-She will take us to America?
-In five days.

543
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:27,875
This was your plan, my dear friend?

544
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:30,875
Easy, bro! Easy, bro.

545
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,958
We need three passports.

546
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:37,083
We need three bodies.

547
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,875
I am going to America, baby.

548
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:57,875
Come with me?

549
00:39:58,916 --> 00:40:00,541
We will do bang-bang,

550
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,333
jing-jang,

551
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,166
American style.

552
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:24,833
So, America. Where will we go?

553
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,500
What will we do? Which city?

554
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,083
New York?

555
00:40:32,416 --> 00:40:33,750
I like New York!

556
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:37,166
I will earn in dollars,
and have lots of sex!

557
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:40,083
Every night, a different babe.
Foreign babes.

558
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,208
What do you say, Carl, my brother?

559
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:43,916
Whatever you want.

560
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,666
Whatever I want?

561
00:40:46,166 --> 00:40:48,583
I can do two at the same time!

562
00:40:48,666 --> 00:40:50,083
Sandwich!

563
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:52,291
I have seen it in films.

564
00:41:09,208 --> 00:41:11,125
Now we only need two dead bodies.

565
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:35,208
Sir.

566
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,250
Sir.

567
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,166
-Zende.
-Sir.

568
00:41:45,958 --> 00:41:46,958
Hey, come on, scoot!

569
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:53,875
-Sir!
-Sir!

570
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:59,833
I asked to meet outside the
office because this is a secret mission.

571
00:42:00,458 --> 00:42:01,750
Sit.

572
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:04,791
Sir, kokum juice.

573
00:42:04,875 --> 00:42:06,833
Oh, wow. Thank you.

574
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,666
Commissioner?

575
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,041
Yes, sir.

576
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:14,541
DGP. DGP Purandare.

577
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:15,791
Yes, sir.

578
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:22,416
Have some, Patil.

579
00:42:28,666 --> 00:42:30,000
As I was saying…

580
00:42:30,083 --> 00:42:31,958
Zende, why don't you sit?

581
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,375
-Sir.
-No, No, you sit. You sit.

582
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:38,875
So…

583
00:42:40,416 --> 00:42:42,291
-Yes, sir?
-Right.

584
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:46,458
-Right.
-Sir, please continue. I will be back.

585
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,500
This is a secret operation.

586
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:10,083
And we will not be
accepting the help of the Goa police.

587
00:43:10,166 --> 00:43:11,333
Sir?

588
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,250
If we take the local police's help
our mission will become easier, sir.

589
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,250
If you want an easy job, Jacob,

590
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,375
then you should open a grocery store.

591
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,458
Sorry, sir.

592
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,041
What do you think, Zende?

593
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:30,250
Sir, I do not want to give
the credit of our win to anyone else

594
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,375
or take the blame of our defeat
from anyone else.

595
00:43:34,166 --> 00:43:35,625
We cannot be defeated, Zende.

596
00:43:35,708 --> 00:43:38,041
Right, sir. We have lost once.

597
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:41,250
And it is best if there is only
one love and one loss in a lifetime.

598
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,916
Wow, well said, sir.

599
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Carl was there in Mumbai for four days.

600
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,416
And he ran away
by blindsiding the Mumbai Police.

601
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,916
The Mumbai Police
have to be the ones to catch him.

602
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,833
And, secondly,

603
00:43:55,916 --> 00:43:58,541
even after repeated notifications
to the Goa Police,

604
00:43:58,625 --> 00:44:00,416
there is no response from their end.

605
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,666
That is why
this work has to be executed by us.

606
00:44:05,083 --> 00:44:07,833
Zende, who are you taking with you?

607
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:10,625
Sir, Jacob, Patil,

608
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,416
and because
the Railway Police is involved,

609
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,833
-Deshmane.
-Sir.

610
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:17,375
And if we need help with the language,
Naik speaks Konkani.

611
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,791
-And Patekar.
-Sir.

612
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:20,875
Good.

613
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:25,916
None of you
should use your real names there.

614
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,041
Because the mongoose knows the snake,

615
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,541
but it is possible that the snake
knows the mongoose as well.

616
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:36,250
You have a 15 year old relationship
with him, Zende.

617
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,708
Understood, sir.

618
00:44:38,791 --> 00:44:39,958
All right.

619
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:43,166
All of you can
get on the morning flight tomorrow.

620
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,041
Flight?

621
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:54,000
What happened?

622
00:44:54,083 --> 00:44:57,625
Haven't been on an airplane before?

623
00:44:58,375 --> 00:44:59,416
No, sir.

624
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:22,833
-Dad.
-What?

625
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,541
Sister,

626
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:32,625
I need to borrow the blue suit
from Brother Prakash for a few days.

627
00:45:32,708 --> 00:45:34,916
-Sure.
-Thank you.

628
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:38,041
What did you say you needed it for?

629
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:39,958
That you have to go to a wedding.

630
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,500
-Our mission is secret, isn't it?
-Yes.

631
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:53,291
You won't go to Goa.

632
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:56,125
What happened now? See, that Carl--

633
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:57,625
Never mind Carl.

634
00:45:58,125 --> 00:46:00,166
Sister Surekha was telling me about

635
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,166
the things that go on
in these five-star hotels.

636
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,625
-What?
-Those things.

637
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:06,208
What things?

638
00:46:06,916 --> 00:46:08,375
Those

639
00:46:08,875 --> 00:46:10,000
cabaret dances.

640
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:14,833
They put on feathers like Helen
and dance like this.

641
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:18,416
Really? How? Show me.

642
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,250
Don't you know how Helen dances?
Like this?

643
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,333
You make me do crazy things.

644
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,166
-Go.
-Where? Goa?

645
00:46:50,875 --> 00:46:52,041
Viju.

646
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:54,500
Come to bed.

647
00:46:54,583 --> 00:46:55,583
I am coming.

648
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,208
We have a booking.

649
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:01,333
Name?

650
00:48:01,916 --> 00:48:03,875
Raut. Om Raut.

651
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,333
Om Raut.

652
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:06,708
Prabhakar Kadam.

653
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:07,791
Hari Pawar.

654
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,333
Chandrakant Bhoir.

655
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,875
Ganesh Randive.

656
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:12,291
Rushi Kapoor.

657
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,708
Rushi Kadoo.

658
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:26,083
K-A-D-O-O. Kadoo.

659
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,291
Number 10 and number 11.

660
00:48:29,916 --> 00:48:33,000
Excuse me? What shall I write
is the purpose of the visit?

661
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:35,916
Picnic.

662
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:57,708
Sir!

663
00:48:58,375 --> 00:49:00,583
We got the registered address
of the bike owner, sir.

664
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:03,541
Pinto Villa. Candolim.

665
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:13,000
Sir, it seems like
G. Pinto is not at home.

666
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:19,375
Patekar, go on.

667
00:50:59,083 --> 00:51:01,583
-The house is empty, sir.
-An empty house is the devil's workshop.

668
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:24,458
Thief?

669
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:27,708
Police.

670
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,875
Pinto ji--

671
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:34,166
Not Pinto ji. It is G. Pinto.

672
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:37,875
Gregory Pinto is my name.

673
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:42,541
Okay, ji. G. Pinto ji.

674
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:46,666
Is the bike GRD 5460 yours?

675
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:51,000
It was stolen.

676
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,500
Did you find it?

677
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:55,708
Are we the traffic police?

678
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:58,583
GRD 5460.

679
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,166
A blue-coloured Rajdoot?

680
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,416
What about it?

681
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,583
The one who took the bike is my brother.

682
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:11,041
He ran away because of a girl
and came here.

683
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,208
-He is your brother?
-My own blood.

684
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:16,416
Was something wrong
with your mom's system?

685
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,291
She gave birth
to that fair-skinned foreigner,

686
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:21,833
and then to you, a brown country bumpkin?

687
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:25,458
Just tell me this. Did he come here?

688
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:30,541
He came. Whoever wants to buy a bike,
comes to Lobo. Okay?

689
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:35,083
But after he buys it, how would I know
where he goes or what he does?

690
00:52:35,166 --> 00:52:37,666
Get lost, now. I have a lot of work to do.

691
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,916
Sorry.

692
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,125
Sir, let's pick him up.

693
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:46,125
Will you keep him in your house
after you pick him up?

694
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:48,416
This is not Mumbai. This is Goa.

695
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,375
Not the palm.

696
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:53,375
Calm. Calm down.

697
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:55,000
Sir? This means--

698
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:57,750
This means that Carl is in Goa.

699
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:01,708
For sure.

700
00:54:04,458 --> 00:54:07,041
We have to split into two teams tonight.

701
00:54:07,875 --> 00:54:11,458
We have to go to all the five-star hotels
and night clubs.

702
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:15,958
We have to go to the five-star hotels,
and look like we belong there.

703
00:54:16,041 --> 00:54:20,041
So all of you should come
wearing the best clothes that you have.

704
00:54:24,875 --> 00:54:25,958
And Patil?

705
00:54:26,041 --> 00:54:27,166
Yes, sir.

706
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:40,541
Patil, what is this?

707
00:54:40,625 --> 00:54:42,916
Sir, you told us
to put on our best clothes.

708
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:46,250
I got this tailored
for my brother's wedding.

709
00:54:47,041 --> 00:54:48,541
Absolutely smashing!

710
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:52,250
Amazing.

711
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:44,166
I hired the bike taxi twice.

712
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:45,916
Pilot taxi, sir.

713
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,791
It is called a pilot taxi in Goa.

714
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,000
Bill?

715
00:56:51,083 --> 00:56:52,583
I don't have the bill.

716
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:55,500
No problem, sir. We will write a voucher.

717
00:56:55,583 --> 00:56:57,916
I am sure you will remember
the registration number of the bike.

718
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I don't even remember my wife's name.

719
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:02,666
Sister-in-law Isabela, sir.

720
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:04,500
Wife's name.

721
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,916
Your wife.

722
00:57:09,875 --> 00:57:11,041
What do they care?

723
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:14,250
The accounts department
will question me, you know.

724
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,125
Rs.24?

725
00:57:18,291 --> 00:57:19,458
One tea, please.

726
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:24,125
Sir. Just like Bond, we should have gotten

727
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,708
fantastic cars
and automatic guns, isn't it?

728
00:57:28,291 --> 00:57:30,958
Then we would have caught Bhojraj
in a flash. Like that.

729
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:34,375
Hey, Patil.
You don't catch criminals with these toys.

730
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:36,875
They are caught from here.

731
00:57:37,416 --> 00:57:38,708
Criminals are not caught from there.

732
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:41,250
Sit.

733
00:57:42,291 --> 00:57:44,583
Criminals are caught from here.

734
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:47,250
And I feel it here,

735
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:50,208
that Carl has changed his tactics.

736
00:57:51,875 --> 00:57:54,125
We are looking for him in the stars,

737
00:57:55,083 --> 00:57:58,458
and that snake is crawling
somewhere in the mud.

738
00:58:34,125 --> 00:58:36,750
-Hey, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, too.

739
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:39,000
-He was telling me about you.
-All good things, I hope.

740
00:58:39,083 --> 00:58:43,125
Oh, well. Look at you.
What a beautiful… what a handsome couple.

741
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,166
-Thank you.
-When are you leaving?

742
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:46,750
-Tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

743
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:49,458
Oh, yeah. That's what I heard.

744
00:58:49,541 --> 00:58:51,666
He was saying
you are in the market for a memento.

745
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,750
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

746
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah? Enough with these beads,
whatever these are.

747
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,375
You want to be a Goa hippie for the rest
of your life? Jesus Christ. I don't.

748
00:59:00,458 --> 00:59:02,083
-I got them right here.
-What you got?

749
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:05,250
Back in the States,
I can charge a premium.

750
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:21,458
-Oh, my gosh. Are those real? Wow!
-Just a bit.

751
00:59:21,541 --> 00:59:23,250
As real as the blood in your veins.

752
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:25,625
Hey, you guys look over this.

753
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,333
Right? You give them a peek.

754
00:59:27,416 --> 00:59:29,083
I will get you a drink.
What are you having?

755
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,708
You… Don't worry.
I know what's good here. Yeah?

756
00:59:31,791 --> 00:59:35,000
Hey, don't pocket one of them. All right?

757
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,083
-Definitely not.
-I wouldn't dare.

758
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:38,708
The fuck you doing,
hitting on my girlfriend?

759
01:00:38,791 --> 01:00:40,791
I'll shoot you.

760
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:45,583
You'll pay for flirting with my Marina.

761
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,833
Have you fucking lost it?

762
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:49,375
I'll shoot you right here.

763
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:51,458
Shut up!

764
01:00:51,541 --> 01:00:53,958
-I'll kill you.
-Take it easy!

765
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,250
Okay. Listen.

766
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,958
Get lost.

767
01:00:59,041 --> 01:01:01,500
-Who are you?
-Okay. Gun down.

768
01:01:01,583 --> 01:01:04,166
-Put the gun down.
-I'll shoot him.

769
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:06,375
-Who are you?
-I am the police.

770
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:09,083
Okay. Gun down. Police.

771
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,916
No, calm down. Calm down.

772
01:01:22,041 --> 01:01:25,041
Inspector Madhukar Bapurao Zande?

773
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,083
Zende.

774
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,291
"Jha." Zende.

775
01:01:33,583 --> 01:01:34,833
What are you doing in Goa?

776
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,875
Picnic.

777
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:40,791
Why the fancy dress?

778
01:01:46,458 --> 01:01:48,291
To hide from the wife.

779
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:50,541
Where is the wife?

780
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,416
In Mumbai.

781
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,750
We are in the middle of a divorce.

782
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,875
She is the suspicious kind.

783
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:05,000
You want me to believe your word, Zende?

784
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:06,291
Yes, I mean…

785
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,666
Tell me the truth.
What are you working on in Goa?

786
01:02:08,750 --> 01:02:10,625
I told you. Picnic.

787
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:12,875
Zende, sir! Ze…

788
01:02:14,958 --> 01:02:17,875
Hey, Madan!

789
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:19,458
Hey, Madan.

790
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:20,833
-Madan?
-Madan.

791
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:22,083
-Madan.
-Madan.

792
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:25,625
-My brother-in-law.
-Brother-in-law?

793
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,291
You are a brother-in-law.

794
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:32,125
Him?

795
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,833
-He is your brother-in-law?
-Yes.

796
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,833
And your brother-in-law
calls you "Zende, sir"?

797
01:02:38,916 --> 01:02:41,875
In public. Out of respect.

798
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:44,916
In private he calls me Gotiya.

799
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,541
Gotiya?

800
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:49,125
Uh-huh. Hey, Gotiya! Like that.

801
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:52,666
Do you understand now
why I had to be in disguise?

802
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:54,833
Look, sir, the thing is,

803
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:59,708
the wife sent this crow to watch me.

804
01:03:00,208 --> 01:03:02,541
Now I have to go out
and settle matters with him.

805
01:03:02,625 --> 01:03:05,916
Otherwise he will go back
and tell his sister everything.

806
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,875
So, can I leave?

807
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,250
-Do not think, Zande--
-Zende.

808
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,500
Do not think

809
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:20,291
that I do not understand your theatrics.

810
01:03:22,166 --> 01:03:25,583
People in Goa prefer a leisurely life,

811
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:28,458
but we are not dumb.

812
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,666
Never.

813
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:31,958
So, enjoy you stay in Goa,

814
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,750
-Mister…
-Zende.

815
01:03:35,416 --> 01:03:36,416
Hey.

816
01:03:37,583 --> 01:03:38,666
What?

817
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:48,250
Come now, my brother-in-law.

818
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,208
-You want some beer?
-Yes, sir.

819
01:03:50,291 --> 01:03:51,291
Don't call me sir.

820
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:55,166
-Hello?
-Jai Hind, sir. Zende.

821
01:03:55,250 --> 01:03:56,375
Caught the snake?

822
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:57,666
Not yet, sir.

823
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,000
Goa may be small but it is still a state.

824
01:04:01,083 --> 01:04:02,500
And we are just six people.

825
01:04:02,583 --> 01:04:05,666
So, should I send
the entire army to help you out?

826
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,375
No. No, sir.

827
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:10,500
The day after tomorrow,
I am going to Mahad, near Goa.

828
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,125
The Prime Minister is visiting.

829
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:14,375
Give me the good news by then,

830
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:17,791
and I can bring the cage
to pick up the snake myself.

831
01:04:18,958 --> 01:04:20,416
Okay, sir. Jai Hind, sir.

832
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:23,875
Speaking at the conference,
the British Foreign Minister condemned

833
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:27,958
the escape of the international criminal
Carl Bhojraj from Tihar Jail.

834
01:04:28,041 --> 01:04:32,750
Even after 15 days, our police have not
been able to find the whereabouts of Carl.

835
01:04:32,833 --> 01:04:34,625
Talking to our correspondent,

836
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,166
our Foreign Minister
called this incident shameful.

837
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:41,375
Sir, he could have
fled the country in these 15 days.

838
01:04:41,875 --> 01:04:43,708
Then what is he doing here?

839
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:46,583
He has to leave the country.

840
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,250
But he needs a passport for that.

841
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,208
And to acquire that

842
01:04:55,708 --> 01:04:57,833
he is capable of killing someone.

843
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,333
-To life!
-To life.

844
01:05:22,416 --> 01:05:23,708
Santé!

845
01:05:23,791 --> 01:05:24,916
Bottoms up.

846
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:26,625
Why not?

847
01:05:55,416 --> 01:05:56,833
Rest in peace.

848
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,791
John Miller.

849
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,375
MAHARASHTRA POLICE HEADQUARTERS

850
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
-Sir's car has come.
-Sir!

851
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,833
-Sir is here.
-Sir!

852
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:45,833
Sir, Carl Bhojraj was in Mumbai but
our police were still unable to catch him.

853
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,958
-What is your opinion on this?
-Where is Carl now, sir?

854
01:06:48,041 --> 01:06:51,083
Should we accept then
that he has escaped the police for good?

855
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:55,625
Look, all your questions will be answered
but at the right time.

856
01:06:55,708 --> 01:06:57,500
Sir, give us something.

857
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:59,541
Mrs Zende, you are here?

858
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:01,500
-Come here. Come.
-Please, sir.

859
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,583
Come here.

860
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:04,791
Hello, sir.

861
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:08,583
The thing is,
it is our wedding anniversary.

862
01:07:10,125 --> 01:07:11,958
Oh, wow. Congratulations.

863
01:07:12,875 --> 01:07:15,583
He really likes puran poli.

864
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:18,208
So, I made some.

865
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:22,083
I don't know where he is in Goa.

866
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,541
Zende didn't tell you where he is?

867
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,625
Sir?

868
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:31,083
Our mission is secret, isn't it?

869
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,250
Yes.

870
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:36,208
Can this puran poli be sent to him?

871
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,541
Yes, it can certainly be sent to him.

872
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:40,500
But I will keep one.

873
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:43,666
The thing is, people only abuse us,
but nobody ever gives us puran poli.

874
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:44,958
No, sir.

875
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,625
No, I mean, don't take from this one.

876
01:07:48,708 --> 01:07:51,541
I made a separate box for you.

877
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:52,625
Hey.

878
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:56,958
For this, I can go to Zende personally
and feed him the puran poli.

879
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,583
-Hey. Here, take this.
-Yes, sir.

880
01:08:04,666 --> 01:08:05,791
Tea?

881
01:08:06,375 --> 01:08:08,458
No, no. I will leave.

882
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:09,833
Thank you.

883
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:27,916
Hello.

884
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,958
Line up!

885
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:35,208
Where did
so many Charlie Chaplins come from?

886
01:08:35,291 --> 01:08:36,791
They have a competition, sir.

887
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,375
Who will be the best Charlie?

888
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:41,083
I think Jacob will ace this.

889
01:08:41,166 --> 01:08:43,333
We just have to shave
half of his moustache from both ends.

890
01:08:47,875 --> 01:08:49,333
You can't even laugh at yourself?

891
01:08:49,916 --> 01:08:51,083
I am laughing, sir.

892
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,583
Sir, the lots are ready.

893
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:57,916
Today we will venture out on our own.

894
01:08:58,416 --> 01:09:00,541
We will spread out a little more.

895
01:09:00,625 --> 01:09:02,083
We will cover more ground.

896
01:09:02,166 --> 01:09:04,166
The lots will decide who goes where.

897
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,583
Sir, I added one more name to this list.

898
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:08,541
-What name?
-Divar Island.

899
01:09:08,625 --> 01:09:10,916
There is an island
in the middle of Mandovi river.

900
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:12,500
One has to get there by ferry.

901
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,625
I have a feeling
we should scout that place, sir.

902
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,500
Okay.

903
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,708
Arambol.

904
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:33,375
Candolim.

905
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,666
Majorda.

906
01:09:35,416 --> 01:09:36,625
Agonda.

907
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:38,791
Varca.

908
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:40,875
Divar Island.

909
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:08,708
I asked him
and he said three people had come--

910
01:10:08,791 --> 01:10:11,166
-Hey, isn't Patil back yet?
-Not yet, sir.

911
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,541
Sir, read this news item, sir.

912
01:10:14,083 --> 01:10:16,666
They found the body of a man
on Anjuna beach last night.

913
01:10:17,166 --> 01:10:19,666
The man was a foreigner.
Someone burnt him alive.

914
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,583
Most importantly,
no passport was recovered from him.

915
01:10:22,666 --> 01:10:25,166
Sir, this is exactly
Carl's modus operandi.

916
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:29,750
Sir.

917
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:31,375
What is it, Patil?

918
01:10:33,083 --> 01:10:34,458
I saw him, sir.

919
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:37,416
Who?

920
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:39,625
I saw Carl, sir.

921
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,916
You let him go just like that?

922
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,041
I got scared, sir.

923
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,333
He has committed 32 murders.

924
01:12:03,416 --> 01:12:04,958
Maybe 33!

925
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:09,458
-Sir, I will go to the ferry and check.
-What will you find now?

926
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:13,041
I don't know, sir, but I have to go.

927
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:19,375
I have two children, sir.

928
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:22,083
Their faces swam before my eyes--

929
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:25,166
Then go and tell your kids
that their father is a coward!

930
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:30,250
The criminal the entire world is chasing
came in front of their father

931
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:33,166
and that father, a policeman,
couldn't lift a finger!

932
01:12:33,250 --> 01:12:35,083
And they will be very proud of you.

933
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,916
-Sir--
-Fear!

934
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,958
Everyone feels fear, Patil!

935
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:43,333
But for a policeman, fear should not be
an excuse to turn his back.

936
01:12:43,833 --> 01:12:46,875
It should be the reason
to push your chest forward and stand up.

937
01:13:26,833 --> 01:13:30,000
Carl? Are you planning
to marry that rascal?

938
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:34,375
Look, Commissioner.

939
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,958
One who does not commit injustices
on others is a noble man.

940
01:13:38,625 --> 01:13:41,833
One who does not let others
do injustice to himself is a good man.

941
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:44,333
One who stops injustice
from happening to others,

942
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,166
is a true man.

943
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:48,666
Am I not a true man?

944
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:54,625
On every Saturday, I will fast in
the name of Hanuman, for your protection.

945
01:13:54,708 --> 01:13:58,333
I don't meddle with your duty.
You don't meddle with my faith.

946
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:11,083
-Hello?
-Happy Anniversary, Commissioner, sir.

947
01:14:11,166 --> 01:14:12,500
You remembered?

948
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:14,750
I have to stay alive, dear.

949
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,791
What nonsense you talk.

950
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:21,250
I am very angry. You finally found
the time to call after three days?

951
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:26,208
Listen, I gave a box of puran poli
to Mr Purandare to send to you.

952
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,583
To Mr Purandare?

953
01:14:28,750 --> 01:14:34,000
Viju, he is the DGP.
Director General of Police.

954
01:14:34,083 --> 01:14:35,375
So?

955
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:36,708
I am the wife.

956
01:14:37,291 --> 01:14:40,291
If a wife can ask
for a husband's life back from Lord Yama,

957
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,375
can she not give a box of puran poli
to the DGP?

958
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,250
If you men just listened to your wives…

959
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,166
-Wife!
-…once in a while, then--

960
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:47,875
Carl's wife.

961
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:50,250
Viju, Carl's wife!

962
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:51,916
What about his wife, sir?

963
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,958
Carl's wife is in America. Chantaal.

964
01:14:55,041 --> 01:14:57,166
-Chantelle.
-To hell with…

965
01:14:57,250 --> 01:14:59,250
Understand the matter, Jacob!

966
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:03,041
All of Carl's money is with his wife.

967
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:04,375
Where is the wife? In America.

968
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,000
So, if Carl wants to talk to his wife,
where would he go?

969
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:09,333
America?

970
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,875
That means an international call.
The telephone exchange, sir?

971
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:17,541
Exactly! So we have to go
where Carl must be going.

972
01:15:22,666 --> 01:15:23,750
Listen, Patekar.

973
01:15:24,958 --> 01:15:26,125
Patekar!

974
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:32,625
Can we see the register for
the international calls made from here?

975
01:15:33,291 --> 01:15:36,666
Air is the only thing free in our country.

976
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:40,291
If you mean business, then talk,
otherwise leave.

977
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:43,041
Give him.

978
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,041
Give him 20.

979
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:50,250
Money? We have to give?

980
01:15:52,333 --> 01:15:55,791
Listen. What will I tell
the accounts people when they ask me?

981
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:57,541
Where is the register?

982
01:15:59,875 --> 01:16:04,000
The register is on the table
in the cabin next door. Go and see.

983
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:05,708
Let's go.

984
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:07,541
By the way…

985
01:16:08,458 --> 01:16:12,750
The thing is, not too many people
come here to make overseas calls.

986
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:15,333
It is government work.
There is too much paperwork.

987
01:16:15,416 --> 01:16:17,541
There is a bar at Porvorim.

988
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:19,541
The owner there

989
01:16:20,833 --> 01:16:23,000
has an understanding with us.

990
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,875
You can make overseas calls from there.

991
01:16:24,958 --> 01:16:27,750
Pronto! Without paperwork.

992
01:16:27,833 --> 01:16:29,041
Name of the bar?

993
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:33,041
I gave you Rs.20.

994
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:35,500
O'Coqueiro.

995
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,625
No, I will need it
as soon as I land in New York.

996
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,291
It is my money, my dear.

997
01:16:45,291 --> 01:16:47,416
Yes. You are still my wife.

998
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:50,250
Yes.

999
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:56,250
Yes, I will call you soon.

1000
01:16:57,750 --> 01:16:58,875
Au revoir.

1001
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,625
Sir.

1002
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:28,333
Sir, even if we manage to
catch him here in Goa, what do we do then?

1003
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:30,041
Hand him over to the Goa Police?

1004
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:33,250
If we have to hand him over
to the Goa Police,

1005
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:35,458
why are we struggling over here
by ourselves?

1006
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:37,458
Shall I tell you the truth, Jacob?

1007
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:43,041
I do not want to play this game
of getting credit.

1008
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,666
A criminal escaped from prison.

1009
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,708
Since then, he has committed a murder.

1010
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,208
As a policeman, I have to catch him.

1011
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:56,250
By myself,

1012
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,666
or with someone else.

1013
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:02,583
Makes no difference to me.

1014
01:18:03,208 --> 01:18:06,166
Sir, if we bring Patil along--

1015
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:08,541
Cowards don't have a place in this team.

1016
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:12,458
-Understood?
-Deshmane?

1017
01:18:14,458 --> 01:18:15,541
My God!

1018
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:18,583
My God, Amdekar!
How are you? Where have you been?

1019
01:18:18,666 --> 01:18:20,875
A senior officer
has come in from Delhi. Mr Vyas.

1020
01:18:20,958 --> 01:18:23,083
Let me introduce you to him.

1021
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,208
What is this, Sinha?

1022
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:29,375
Sir, these are my friends
from the Mumbai Police.

1023
01:18:29,458 --> 01:18:31,625
And he is Mr Vyas, from the Delhi Police.

1024
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:35,166
Carl Bhojraj, who escaped
from Tihar Jail a fortnight back?

1025
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:39,375
Sir is in Goa with a team
of 15 to 16 people to catch him.

1026
01:18:41,458 --> 01:18:43,208
Inspector Zende, sir.

1027
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:47,666
Sir, we are also here
for the same purpose.

1028
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,916
Sir, Mr Purandare asked us not to reveal--

1029
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,500
It's okay.
There is no time for these protocols.

1030
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:58,958
If we work together,
Carl will get caught faster.

1031
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,291
Sir, we have got a lead that Carl Bhojraj
will definitely visit this bar.

1032
01:19:05,375 --> 01:19:07,708
Because you can make
a phone call from here

1033
01:19:07,791 --> 01:19:10,500
to anywhere in the world
at lightning speed.

1034
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:14,500
Carl's wife is in America and he will
definitely come here to contact her.

1035
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,000
First of all, Mister…

1036
01:19:17,083 --> 01:19:18,583
What did you say your name was?

1037
01:19:18,666 --> 01:19:19,958
Madhukar Zende, sir.

1038
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,000
I didn't ask you to have a seat.

1039
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,083
I will have to notify the Home Minister
about this unofficial operation

1040
01:19:28,666 --> 01:19:30,458
that is being carried out
by the Mumbai Police.

1041
01:19:31,083 --> 01:19:33,875
-Sinha, make a note of this.
-Yes, sir.

1042
01:19:33,958 --> 01:19:37,958
You guys from Bombay
don't do your homework correctly, do you?

1043
01:19:38,041 --> 01:19:41,708
Bhojraj was in Mumbai for four days
after he ran away from Tihar.

1044
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:45,041
And these guys
couldn't find even a single lead.

1045
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:48,791
Bhojraj always stays in five-stars.

1046
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:52,375
Why would he come
to this road-side bar to make a call?

1047
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:57,291
-Amdekar, let's go.
-Yes, sir.

1048
01:19:57,375 --> 01:19:58,375
Come on.

1049
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,041
Sir!

1050
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:07,916
Your homework
is not that great either, sir.

1051
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:10,875
That is why
while he was at your Tihar Jail,

1052
01:20:10,958 --> 01:20:14,166
he got the permission to celebrate
his birthday on the 16th of March.

1053
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:18,166
And using the celebration as an excuse,
he fed rice pudding to everyone,

1054
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,625
made everyone fall asleep, and ran away.

1055
01:20:21,708 --> 01:20:25,333
By the way,
Carl's birthday is tomorrow, sir.

1056
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:27,833
Sixth of April.

1057
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:32,125
All the best, Mister…
whatever your name is.

1058
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,458
Not whatever, sir.

1059
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:35,458
Inspector Zende.

1060
01:20:36,666 --> 01:20:41,916
Inspector Madhukar Bapurao Zende.

1061
01:20:47,041 --> 01:20:49,000
Sir, shall I station two of our men here,
if you see fit?

1062
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:50,375
What rubbish are you talking?

1063
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:52,458
What if he turns out to be correct, sir?

1064
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:54,583
He is just an ordinary inspector.

1065
01:20:54,666 --> 01:20:56,083
A low-grade cop!

1066
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,458
Carl will never come here.

1067
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,041
Yes, sir.

1068
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,500
-Sir?
-What is it?

1069
01:22:28,291 --> 01:22:32,791
We only have Rs.87 left.
And we still have to pay for the hotel.

1070
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:43,375
Keep it.

1071
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:48,625
Sir, from your own pocket?

1072
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,500
This is my work.

1073
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:52,666
Ten from me.

1074
01:22:54,333 --> 01:22:55,416
Twelve from me.

1075
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,041
Five from me.

1076
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:11,625
Sir, I only have Rs.2 left.

1077
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,291
We will not leave
without taking this bugger along.

1078
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:21,458
Yes, sir.

1079
01:23:22,416 --> 01:23:24,625
Sir, when I go back,

1080
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,708
I will tell everyone in the department

1081
01:23:27,958 --> 01:23:29,000
that…

1082
01:23:31,083 --> 01:23:34,791
Sir, don't turn around suddenly,

1083
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:37,000
-but I think it is--
-Fonseca.

1084
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:41,291
I know it.
He has been following us since morning.

1085
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,916
He reads the morning paper at night.

1086
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:53,416
Jacob, you are not laughing today.

1087
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:55,791
I am laughing, sir.

1088
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,583
Hey, Fonseca!

1089
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:05,166
I haven't seen him laughing till date.

1090
01:24:05,250 --> 01:24:07,750
He cannot laugh, otherwise.

1091
01:24:10,791 --> 01:24:11,791
Jacob.

1092
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:15,041
-You can smoke.
-No, sir. It is okay.

1093
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:16,541
You dropped it?

1094
01:24:16,625 --> 01:24:18,291
Well, never mind. It is a bad habit.

1095
01:24:18,875 --> 01:24:19,875
Okay, listen.

1096
01:24:20,625 --> 01:24:23,291
If Carl has to leave the country,

1097
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,708
he has to go to Mumbai.

1098
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:28,458
There is no international airport in Goa.

1099
01:24:29,958 --> 01:24:33,000
Then why is that bugger
staying here in Goa?

1100
01:24:34,375 --> 01:24:36,708
And now he even has a passport.

1101
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:38,500
Uh-huh.

1102
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:40,166
Come on, we have to go somewhere.

1103
01:24:46,833 --> 01:24:48,250
She leaves tomorrow.

1104
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,875
From here to Egypt,
and then on to New York, America.

1105
01:24:56,750 --> 01:24:59,291
Sir, the rat will try to escape
on this ship tomorrow.

1106
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:01,666
Shall we set up the fielding
here tomorrow, sir?

1107
01:25:02,333 --> 01:25:05,041
The port area is too big to cover, Jacob.

1108
01:25:05,541 --> 01:25:07,166
And we do not have a lot of people.

1109
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,875
We will come here,

1110
01:25:11,208 --> 01:25:13,875
but we must not skip our vigil
at O'Coqueiro tonight.

1111
01:25:14,666 --> 01:25:15,708
Sir.

1112
01:25:23,708 --> 01:25:24,791
Name?

1113
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:26,000
John Miller.

1114
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:32,291
-Purandare?
-Jai Hind, sir.

1115
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:35,291
Purandare, are some people
from your department in Goa right now?

1116
01:25:35,375 --> 01:25:36,916
Not that I know of, sir.

1117
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,625
Some people from Mumbai Police
came across ACP Vyas in Goa yesterday.

1118
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:43,000
They mentioned Carl.

1119
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:45,666
Maybe one of our officers
is there for a vacation, sir.

1120
01:25:45,750 --> 01:25:47,541
Or on a secret mission?

1121
01:25:48,833 --> 01:25:52,208
There are no secrets, sir. I assure you.

1122
01:25:52,291 --> 01:25:57,166
Your department has already failed once
while dealing with Carl, Purandare.

1123
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,791
If something like that happens again
because of you, then…

1124
01:26:00,916 --> 01:26:02,416
There is nothing like that, sir.

1125
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:05,291
Jai Hind.

1126
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:06,500
Jai Hind, sir.

1127
01:26:18,166 --> 01:26:21,750
Sir. Sir, they are purposeless.

1128
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:24,541
They just keep roaming around. It is Goa.

1129
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,291
But, sir, if I am honest,

1130
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:33,291
I don't think Carl is ever coming to Goa.

1131
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,791
Why would he come here?

1132
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:39,500
He will come. And he will come right here.

1133
01:26:40,041 --> 01:26:42,666
-Are you feeling it from here?
-I am feeling it from here.

1134
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:45,333
Everyone will be in their positions.

1135
01:26:45,416 --> 01:26:47,166
-Super alert.
-Yes, sir.

1136
01:26:47,250 --> 01:26:49,166
-Patekar, we need a car.
-Yes, sir?

1137
01:26:49,250 --> 01:26:50,875
-A car?
-Any problem?

1138
01:26:50,958 --> 01:26:52,125
I will organise it.

1139
01:26:52,208 --> 01:26:54,833
I accept that we do not have any weapons.
We do not have any money.

1140
01:26:54,916 --> 01:26:57,916
We do not have any support.
People call us "Pandu."

1141
01:26:58,458 --> 01:26:59,791
The Pandus of Mumbai.

1142
01:27:00,666 --> 01:27:04,458
But they do not know that if
a Pandu from Mumbai comes into his own,

1143
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:07,041
he is capable of
ripping apart anyone's fortune.

1144
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,041
Sir.

1145
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,458
When you have courage, Patil,

1146
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:19,208
you will always get a second chance.

1147
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Got it?

1148
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:23,458
Excuse me!

1149
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,708
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

1150
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:27,458
-Just a second, man.
-You might hit…

1151
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:31,583
What is going on?

1152
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:34,958
Sir, it looks like
there is a wedding reception here today.

1153
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:38,291
Wedding reception at a bar?

1154
01:27:38,375 --> 01:27:40,458
Welcome to Goa, sir.

1155
01:27:41,458 --> 01:27:43,333
Cheers!

1156
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:06,291
Sir, I think we have set up the fielding
at the wrong place.

1157
01:28:06,958 --> 01:28:09,083
We should be at the dock.

1158
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:12,333
You take the others
and head to the dock. I will stay here.

1159
01:28:12,416 --> 01:28:14,125
But, sir, you…

1160
01:28:14,208 --> 01:28:17,500
The policeman's heart says
that the bugger will come here.

1161
01:28:20,041 --> 01:28:21,166
You guys go to the dock.

1162
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:26,250
If you need to grab him there,
you will need more men.

1163
01:28:26,333 --> 01:28:27,708
Sir.

1164
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,666
-We have to go to the dock. Come on.
-And Zende sir?

1165
01:28:57,291 --> 01:28:59,291
Sir will stay here. Come on.

1166
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,458
Sir, let me stay with sir.

1167
01:29:02,041 --> 01:29:03,166
Please, sir.

1168
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:05,541
Let's go.

1169
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:11,916
Let's go, Deshmane. Let's go.

1170
01:29:13,333 --> 01:29:14,708
It is not even starting.

1171
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:16,708
What do you mean?

1172
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,333
What the…

1173
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,000
It started in the morning, sir.

1174
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,708
How would it get here otherwise?

1175
01:31:56,500 --> 01:32:00,291
-We did not order this.
-Oh. No, sir. Yes, sir.

1176
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:01,375
Hey.

1177
01:32:01,916 --> 01:32:03,500
This is the wrong order.

1178
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,250
It is wrong?

1179
01:32:06,541 --> 01:32:09,666
Patekar! Patil! Come on! Come here!

1180
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,416
Patil! Patekar!

1181
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:13,708
Come here!

1182
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,333
Patekar!

1183
01:32:20,541 --> 01:32:22,833
-Hello, Carl.
-Who Carl?

1184
01:32:22,916 --> 01:32:24,583
-You Carl.
-I am not Carl.

1185
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:25,875
You are bloody Carl!

1186
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,666
Just you wait. I will
sell you in the village for a good price.

1187
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:01,375
-Sir!
-Sir!

1188
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:03,750
Jacob! Patekar!

1189
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:05,875
Over here! Grab him!

1190
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:07,833
Shit.

1191
01:34:08,916 --> 01:34:10,708
You bastard!

1192
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:14,083
Hold him down!

1193
01:34:14,583 --> 01:34:16,875
Grab him!

1194
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:19,250
What is going on in my hotel?
I'll call the police!

1195
01:34:19,333 --> 01:34:20,958
I am the police.

1196
01:34:21,041 --> 01:34:22,458
Mumbai Police.

1197
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:25,375
Sir, I have taken care of him.

1198
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:26,833
Put the cart before the horse!

1199
01:34:27,916 --> 01:34:29,208
Amazing.

1200
01:34:34,375 --> 01:34:36,166
Sir, the snake has been caught.

1201
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:42,875
Yes, sir. Okay, sir.

1202
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,041
Purandare sir has asked us to take him
and leave for Mumbai immediately, sir.

1203
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:51,000
-Yes, let's leave--
-How do we leave? We do not have a car.

1204
01:34:51,083 --> 01:34:52,291
If we do not have a car,
then we take a horse.

1205
01:34:52,375 --> 01:34:54,166
If we do not have a horse, then a rocket.

1206
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:55,833
We can walk, we can fly,
we can drag him all the way.

1207
01:34:55,916 --> 01:34:57,291
We have to take him there after all.

1208
01:34:57,958 --> 01:35:00,000
Or do you want to celebrate your honeymoon
with him here at the hotel?

1209
01:35:00,083 --> 01:35:01,500
No, sir.

1210
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:03,125
-Sir?
-What is it?

1211
01:35:03,625 --> 01:35:06,208
You caught Carl Bhojraj at our wedding.

1212
01:35:06,708 --> 01:35:08,000
Can we get a photograph?

1213
01:35:08,750 --> 01:35:09,791
Sure.

1214
01:35:10,916 --> 01:35:12,166
There is one condition, okay?

1215
01:35:18,958 --> 01:35:20,166
What is the condition, sir?

1216
01:35:37,375 --> 01:35:39,458
-Who is this?
-This is David.

1217
01:35:40,083 --> 01:35:41,791
The one who escaped with Carl from Tihar.

1218
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,500
Carl Bhojraj?

1219
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:46,500
In Goa?

1220
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:47,625
Yes.

1221
01:35:50,875 --> 01:35:55,500
We were caught napping,
Fonseca. Literally napping.

1222
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,916
Those guys picked up Carl today
from a bar in Porvorim.

1223
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,000
If it is really Carl,

1224
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:04,083
then I do not want him
crossing the border of Goa. Understood?

1225
01:36:04,166 --> 01:36:05,291
Yes, sir.

1226
01:36:13,041 --> 01:36:15,041
Patil, will you be able to do it?

1227
01:36:15,125 --> 01:36:17,708
Do not worry, sir.
I drove an ambulance for two years.

1228
01:36:22,666 --> 01:36:23,791
What is this?

1229
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:32,208
Hello, Carl.

1230
01:36:34,416 --> 01:36:36,000
Do you remember me?

1231
01:36:36,833 --> 01:36:37,958
No.

1232
01:36:38,541 --> 01:36:39,833
Are you a film star?

1233
01:36:39,916 --> 01:36:41,750
Zende sir has caught you before.

1234
01:36:43,375 --> 01:36:44,541
'71.

1235
01:36:45,125 --> 01:36:46,458
I see.

1236
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,125
So, then we are old friends.

1237
01:36:51,041 --> 01:36:53,583
Happy birthday, Carl.

1238
01:36:54,916 --> 01:36:55,916
You know?

1239
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,041
The mongoose knows everything
about the snake.

1240
01:37:00,625 --> 01:37:02,833
Where is my birthday present?

1241
01:37:03,416 --> 01:37:05,833
We took out
such a grand wedding procession for you.

1242
01:37:07,166 --> 01:37:08,500
What more do you want?

1243
01:37:10,458 --> 01:37:11,458
Stop the van.

1244
01:37:15,083 --> 01:37:18,291
This van will now stop only in Mumbai.

1245
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:39,791
Hey. Sit down, you.

1246
01:37:40,708 --> 01:37:45,000
What is he doing, sir?
Will you sit down or not? Hey, not here.

1247
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:47,833
He will piss on me, sir.
Stop the car, sir.

1248
01:37:47,916 --> 01:37:49,791
Patil, stop the car.

1249
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:18,583
You're still alive.

1250
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:23,125
Or the news tomorrow would have said
that the snake was run over by a truck.

1251
01:38:24,208 --> 01:38:25,833
-Go on. Put him inside.
-Come on.

1252
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:29,708
I will not let you escape
this easily, you rascal.

1253
01:38:30,291 --> 01:38:34,125
I will sit on your chest like a phantom
till we reach Mumbai.

1254
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:36,083
-Drive, Patil.
-Yes, sir.

1255
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:42,125
Sir, Fonseca would have found out by now.

1256
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:45,750
It is a green-coloured Matador!
Green-coloured Matador!

1257
01:38:46,958 --> 01:38:50,958
Once we cross the border into
Maharashtra, then we do not have to worry.

1258
01:38:52,375 --> 01:38:55,375
It is going towards the Goa border! Over!

1259
01:39:00,666 --> 01:39:01,750
Zendi.

1260
01:39:03,291 --> 01:39:06,125
How much money will you take to let me go?

1261
01:39:06,208 --> 01:39:08,375
A wise person once said,

1262
01:39:09,666 --> 01:39:12,750
"Air and idiots can be found everywhere."

1263
01:39:14,833 --> 01:39:16,791
You are offering me money?

1264
01:39:18,416 --> 01:39:20,125
You are a real bastard.

1265
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:23,666
I will now remember your face.

1266
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:25,833
I will get out of jail,

1267
01:39:27,083 --> 01:39:28,500
and I will find you.

1268
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:30,416
I will be waiting.

1269
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:36,083
This bugger kills one at a time.
You plan to kill everyone all at once?

1270
01:39:36,166 --> 01:39:37,458
Sir, look ahead.

1271
01:39:46,291 --> 01:39:48,666
Patil, go through the barricade.

1272
01:39:49,333 --> 01:39:51,125
Drive through it! Hurry up!

1273
01:39:52,291 --> 01:39:53,750
Go through it!

1274
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:08,375
-Listen. Pick him up! Pick him up!
-We can't let him go!

1275
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:10,500
Stop!

1276
01:40:10,583 --> 01:40:12,083
Run! Run for the border!

1277
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:14,500
Stop.

1278
01:40:20,583 --> 01:40:21,916
-Bhende!
-Zende.

1279
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:23,250
The same.

1280
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:26,416
I told you, my eyes are on you.

1281
01:40:27,083 --> 01:40:29,500
I am taking him with me.

1282
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:34,000
Run for it.

1283
01:40:34,083 --> 01:40:35,625
-Hey! Help!
-Quiet!

1284
01:40:35,708 --> 01:40:37,666
-Shut up!
-Help!

1285
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:38,750
Oh, God!

1286
01:40:38,833 --> 01:40:40,416
Shut up, you fucker!

1287
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:43,875
-Until--
-Come on, go!

1288
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,166
Come here, Patil.

1289
01:40:45,250 --> 01:40:47,041
-Pick him up! Come on.
-Yes, sir.

1290
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,583
Let's go. Let us walk and cross.

1291
01:40:52,875 --> 01:40:54,708
Give him to me.

1292
01:40:56,208 --> 01:40:57,708
Zende!

1293
01:40:57,791 --> 01:40:58,916
Leave him!

1294
01:40:59,583 --> 01:41:03,083
-Leave him!
-Let him go!

1295
01:41:03,166 --> 01:41:04,416
Let him go!

1296
01:41:14,625 --> 01:41:17,291
Why, you bastard!

1297
01:41:17,875 --> 01:41:19,500
Sir, catch him! Don't let him go!

1298
01:41:20,125 --> 01:41:21,375
-Stop!
-Catch him!

1299
01:41:25,083 --> 01:41:26,833
Zende!

1300
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:33,000
Stop now, Zende.

1301
01:41:33,083 --> 01:41:34,583
I really will shoot you.

1302
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,166
You come into my state
and right under my nose--

1303
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:39,541
In your state?

1304
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:41,458
No.

1305
01:41:41,541 --> 01:41:43,083
You are in my state.

1306
01:41:43,166 --> 01:41:45,208
Welcome to Maharashtra.

1307
01:41:48,208 --> 01:41:49,791
MAHARASHTRA JURISDICTION STARTS

1308
01:41:54,083 --> 01:41:56,791
Do call if you are ever in Mumbai.

1309
01:41:56,875 --> 01:42:00,000
We will have tea. We will eat vada pav.

1310
01:42:00,083 --> 01:42:01,375
Stop.

1311
01:42:01,458 --> 01:42:05,833
I can still take him, along with you
and your men from here right now.

1312
01:42:06,958 --> 01:42:08,166
Who is here to witness it?

1313
01:42:26,416 --> 01:42:27,458
Sir.

1314
01:42:28,375 --> 01:42:30,958
Caught by Mumbai Police.
Bowled by Mumbai Police.

1315
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:32,750
I am proud of you, Zende.

1316
01:42:32,833 --> 01:42:34,166
Thank you, sir.

1317
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,375
-Proud of you, boys.
-Sir.

1318
01:42:38,791 --> 01:42:40,041
And him?

1319
01:42:40,625 --> 01:42:43,083
Inspector Fonseca. Goa Police.

1320
01:42:43,166 --> 01:42:46,291
It is because of him
that we reached this far, sir.

1321
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:04,666
Then I must thank you too,
Inspector Fonseca.

1322
01:43:06,166 --> 01:43:07,333
Thank you.

1323
01:43:11,708 --> 01:43:13,125
Bye, Carl.

1324
01:43:13,208 --> 01:43:14,500
Who Carl?

1325
01:43:14,583 --> 01:43:15,708
You Carl.

1326
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:17,125
I am not Carl.

1327
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:19,166
You are bloody Carl.

1328
01:43:20,833 --> 01:43:22,166
And you, Zende.

1329
01:43:23,416 --> 01:43:25,375
You will be famous because of me.

1330
01:43:41,791 --> 01:43:44,583
AGRIPADA POLICE STATION

1331
01:43:57,791 --> 01:43:58,958
Sir!

1332
01:43:59,041 --> 01:44:01,208
Inspector Madhukar Bapurao Zende.

1333
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:05,125
And I am Madhukar Bapurao Zende, the OG.

1334
01:44:38,166 --> 01:44:39,416
Viju.

1335
01:44:39,958 --> 01:44:41,166
Hey!

1336
01:44:42,291 --> 01:44:43,291
Viju?

1337
01:44:56,041 --> 01:44:58,250
Puran poli was very sweet.

1338
01:44:59,083 --> 01:45:00,166
Just like you.

1339
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:03,208
Purandare sir had them sent to you?

1340
01:45:03,958 --> 01:45:07,708
What else?
He might be the DGP in the department,

1341
01:45:08,666 --> 01:45:10,416
but he is also somebody's husband.

1342
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:14,833
Kids?

1343
01:45:15,791 --> 01:45:17,208
Went to school.

1344
01:45:17,291 --> 01:45:18,458
Mother?

1345
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:19,875
Went to drop them off.

1346
01:45:19,958 --> 01:45:21,083
Then?

1347
01:45:34,500 --> 01:45:36,083
Hey, what happened to that fellow Carl?

1348
01:45:37,041 --> 01:45:38,291
Listen to it on the radio.

1349
01:45:40,541 --> 01:45:43,166
Dangerous murderer Carl was arrested

1350
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,291
last night by a team from Mumbai Police.

1351
01:45:45,375 --> 01:45:48,041
Inspector Madhukar Zende
from the Mumbai Police

1352
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:49,708
accomplished this extraordinary feat.

1353
01:45:49,791 --> 01:45:51,166
Look, Zende sir has come!

1354
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:16,333
