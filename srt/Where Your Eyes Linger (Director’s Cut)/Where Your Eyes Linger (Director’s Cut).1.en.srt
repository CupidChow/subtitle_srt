Han Taeju, you son of a bitch!

2
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,825
Hey, Han Taeju!

3
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,375
Stop chasing me!

4
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,502
Stop there, you piece of shit!

5
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,980
You go that way!

6
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,397
Damn, you run so fast.

7
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:11,039
Yes, I wouldn't put it past you to hit on Mingyeong,

8
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,416
but three is too much, isn't it?

9
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,433
Step aside! Are you a giraffe?

10
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:17,133
Mingyeong?

11
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,730
You're cruising for a bruising!

12
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,748
And Hyeonjeong...

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
I loved her so damn much.

14
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,447
- She hit on me first...
- I'm nearly traumatized thanks to you.

15
00:01:26,447 --> 00:01:30,595
Though I don't buy Christianity, but devout Gippeum...

16
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:33,838
I didn't see that coming.

17
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,853
- She was the most attractive, though.
- Shut up!

18
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:39,750
Acting like he's damn perfect, huh?

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,521
I'm better looking...

20
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,221
Ain't I?

21
00:01:47,884 --> 00:01:49,630
You son of...

22
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:55,190
You do realize what you're about to bring upon yourself.

23
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:59,253
My dad is the director of TB Corporation, you shit!

24
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:06,678
Is this funny?

25
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:08,650
Hello? That's funny to you?

26
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,902
Funny, huh? Funny?

27
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:28,715
- Did you do this?
- Go easy on him.

28
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,878
I wondered why you didn't show up.

29
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:33,345
You're his dog, aren't you?

30
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:35,242
That's right.

31
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,832
Look at this piece of shit.

32
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,543
Are you okay?

33
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,819
You know what?

34
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:52,464
My dad is the chairman of TB Corporation.

35
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:01,863
I have an old friend...

36
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,727
from whom I'm never apart,

37
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,061
with whom I'm inseparable,

38
00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:10,214
and who is like family.

﻿[Where Your Eyes Linger]

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,053
I didn't assign you to Taeju to play house with him.

41
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:33,227
- I'm sorry, sir.
- It wasn't playing house.

42
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:35,782
It actually hurt.

43
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,806
You never learn, do you?

44
00:03:37,806 --> 00:03:40,591
I took a punch because I didn't want any trouble.

45
00:03:40,591 --> 00:03:44,454
Han Taeju, whenever you cause trouble,

46
00:03:44,454 --> 00:03:46,341
I'll beat up Guk.

47
00:03:46,341 --> 00:03:49,400
If it happens again,

48
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,519
I will send you off to England.

49
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:59,815
I got you a house so that you could lie low and live quietly there.

50
00:04:01,697 --> 00:04:03,150
You'd better behave yourself.

51
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,620
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

52
00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:16,249
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:17,249 --> 00:04:18,849
For what?

54
00:04:20,712 --> 00:04:23,621
I didn't expect that getting hit would be wrong.

55
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,967
From now on, don't get hit, just hit them.

56
00:04:28,198 --> 00:04:31,098
I'd rather do that.

57
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:34,122
You shouldn't have revealed you're the chairman's son.

58
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:37,137
Damn it! That idiot got on my nerves.

59
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:38,905
He said his dad was a director.

60
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:42,057
How pathetic is that?

61
00:04:45,304 --> 00:04:49,565
We're struggling to keep your status hidden. You better mind your P's and Q's.

62
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:53,638
What?

63
00:04:53,638 --> 00:04:55,400
Struggle?

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,789
Did you say 'struggle?'

65
00:04:57,789 --> 00:04:59,959
I'm enjoying myself.

66
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:01,762
I'm happy.

67
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,439
Aren't you?

68
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,547
We order chicken as much as we want, and play video games all night, you and I.

69
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:20,626
We can have ramen, too.

70
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,296
Yes, I'm happy too.

71
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:33,074
Darling, I don't want go to England.

72
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:35,067
- Don't do this.
- Why not?

73
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,433
Come off it. I kill you.

74
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:39,167
Look at you!

75
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:41,034
Hey, move it!

76
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:45,354
Taeju, are you okay?

77
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:49,303
I told you not to do it. Damn it.

78
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:50,390
Were you faking it?

79
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,640
Were you worried?

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,575
You are screwed. I was just startled.

81
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:56,191
Now I'm coming in hot.

82
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,958
Oh, no! I'm out of your league.

83
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,288
- So cocky!
- You know, I could do worse.

Attacking your weak spot.

85
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:27,314
Here.

86
00:06:29,932 --> 00:06:31,477
Looks nice.

87
00:06:31,477 --> 00:06:33,043
The food is good.

88
00:06:33,043 --> 00:06:35,323
No one from our school comes here, either.

89
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:38,308
You're a top and you're a bottom, aren't you?

90
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:39,745
- Sorry?
- Sorry?

91
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:41,455
Nothing.

92
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,266
For crying out loud! We have diners here.

93
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:52,829
Oh, sorry.

94
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,045
It's the air pollution.

95
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:00,111
This was the boy I was talking about.

96
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:05,539
My very first customer, who is cute and made me feel pumped up.

97
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:08,443
Uh-uh. It was you?

98
00:07:13,612 --> 00:07:15,312
It was delicious.

99
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:17,233
Let's drop in again sometime.

100
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,547
I'll think about it.

101
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:20,367
Suit yourself.

102
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:29,355
May I help you? Why are you following us?

103
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:35,091
Mom always talked about you.

104
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:37,384
You are cuter than I thought.

105
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:42,633
They usually pay attention to me, not to him.

106
00:07:49,651 --> 00:07:51,308
Give me your number.

107
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,296
Are you sure you don't want mine,

108
00:07:55,296 --> 00:07:57,398
but his?

109
00:08:08,056 --> 00:08:09,649
Here you are.

110
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:15,481
See you later, alligator.

111
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:23,101
Hey. What was that?

112
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,567
What about it?

113
00:08:24,567 --> 00:08:28,254
You've been flirting around while I was in Japan.

114
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:31,612
I've never seen her before until today.

115
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:36,317
You were acting all serious and cool.

116
00:08:36,317 --> 00:08:37,748
You're so pretentious.

117
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,942
What are you saying?

118
00:08:41,362 --> 00:08:43,815
Happy you gave her your number?

119
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,921
I didn't.

120
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,556
Then what?

121
00:08:50,582 --> 00:08:52,411
It's a fake number.

122
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,121
Seriously?

123
00:08:56,473 --> 00:08:58,000
Okay.

00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,153
So what?

127
00:10:00,153 --> 00:10:03,102
Please buy me some chocolate milk.

128
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,369
You're a rich boy. Buy it yourself.

129
00:10:04,369 --> 00:10:06,231
I want you to buy it for me.

130
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,063
I warned you not to do that.

131
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:24,854
What now?

132
00:10:24,854 --> 00:10:26,877
I thought it was settled.

133
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,733
I'm sorry.

134

I don't know what happened but my dad told me to apologize to you.

135
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:37,061
It's damn insulting.

136
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:41,145
Accepted.

137
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:43,730
What a shitty world, huh?

138
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,476
Are you really the son of the TB chairman?

139

No, he isn't.

00:10:49,884 --> 00:10:52,519
Even if he is, it's none of your business.

141
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,393
Okay.

142
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:56,855
I've apologized, so it's all good now. Right?

Have you lost your mind?

148
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:17,464
- So I'll stay away from your fourth girlfriend.
- Hey.

149
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,750
Is everything okay?

150
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,682
Yes.

151
00:11:50,682 --> 00:11:52,780
Then why did you do that?

152
00:11:54,073 --> 00:11:56,333
I don't like that jerk.

153
00:11:58,154 --> 00:12:00,888
I don't think he's that bad.

154
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:02,528
He's kind of cute.

00:12:03,949 --> 00:12:05,674
Cute? Look who's talking.

I might be a better fighter than you.

You think?

159
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:18,024
That means you don't need my protection.

160
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,393
Don't say that, even as a joke.

161
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:31,863
My bad.

162
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,800
Then, let's spar today.

163
00:12:38,423 --> 00:12:39,823
Okay.

171
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:14,307
I'm just joking around.

172
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:20,988
Sorry.

173
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,873
Wow!

174
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,842
You've got a buff bod.

175
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,736
We hang out together and eat the same food.

176
00:14:16,736 --> 00:14:18,735
But how can we be so different?

177
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:21,377
It's not the first time you've seen me shirtless.

178
00:14:21,377 --> 00:14:23,228
What's up?

179
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:35,353
- Hey, who's that?
- I don't know.

180
00:14:35,353 --> 00:14:37,018
Let's take a look.

181
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,649
It doesn't matter.

00:14:39,675 --> 00:14:41,335
Are you Kang Guk?

183
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:45,055
Why did you give me the wrong number?

184
00:14:46,341 --> 00:14:48,242
Who sent them?

185
00:14:52,688 --> 00:14:55,683
Hey, did you give her my number?

186
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,777
Why not? It's fun.

187
00:14:57,777 --> 00:14:59,995
It isn't for me.

188
00:15:01,389 --> 00:15:02,865
It's my gift!

189
00:15:02,865 --> 00:15:06,248
Don't blame me later and do whatever you want.

190
00:15:06,248 --> 00:15:08,278
Whatever! Anything!

191
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,123
Here's Guk's number.

192
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,625
He gave you the wrong number.

193
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,839
You can thank me later.

194
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:21,074
Who is it? Your Mr. Right?

195
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:25,479
No, Mr. Weirdo.

196
00:15:28,457 --> 00:15:30,102
His name is Kang Guk.

197
00:15:30,102 --> 00:15:32,219
Even his name is hot.

198
00:15:34,931 --> 00:15:37,572
I think you should give up.

199
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,512
Why?

200
00:15:39,512 --> 00:15:42,621
I don't think you should come between them.

201
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:44,915
What are you talking about?

202
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:49,950
No going easy, okay?

203
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,853
Of course not.

204
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,221
Have you replied to her?

205
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:11,116
Not planning to.

206
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:17,956
Do it. This is an order.

207
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:21,892
You can't.

208
00:16:21,892 --> 00:16:23,863
This is the only place I can get even with you.

209
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:26,814
Sounds like you can't do that anywhere else.

210
00:16:26,814 --> 00:16:29,092
Sure. That's the way it is, you and I.

211
00:16:33,622 --> 00:16:35,724
Should I really kill you?

212
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,567
It's easier to admit it.

213
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,801
That's our relationship. We can't help it.

214
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,638
I'll touch your ear.

215
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,230
What's up?

216
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,920
You know touching your ear makes me calm down.

217
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,615
Even so, no.

218
00:16:58,793 --> 00:17:02,565
By the way, you should stop pumping your chest.

219
00:17:02,565 --> 00:17:04,834
They are almost as big as...

220
00:17:10,697 --> 00:17:12,398
What's wrong?

221
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,763
Are you okay?

222
00:17:16,491 --> 00:17:19,735
- Sorry. I didn't mean it.
- I knew it.

223
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:21,545
He didn't do it on purpose.

224
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,547
Did he contact you?

225
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:27,625
- He didn't mean it.
- As for me, a handsome son-in-law wouldn't hurt.

226
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:30,415
I don't mind either of them.

227
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:32,713
Oh, my!

228
00:17:32,713 --> 00:17:35,313
It would be nice if things go well between the two.

229
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:39,893
Mom, what's wrong with you?

230
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:43,115
I haven't felt this romantic for a while.

231
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:48,768
If you get stuck between best friends, it's bound to be awkward and tiring.

232
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:51,599
Oh! That's awkward!

233
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,288
I said I'm sorry.

234
00:17:56,288 --> 00:17:59,141
Yeah, you won. Okay?

235
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:02,761
Now I can't even study and eat properly.

236
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:15,326
Cook something nice for me tomorrow.

237
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,026
Okay.

238
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:25,208
How am I going to take a shower?

239
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,982
What do you mean by "how?"

240
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:29,693
Just make sure to keep your cast dry in the shower.

241
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:34,468
How can I wash my hair with just one hand, especially my left hand?

242
00:18:34,468 --> 00:18:36,347
- You can manage it.
- I mean...

243
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,117
You do it for me.

244
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,166
No, I don't want to.

245
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,961
Why not? I want to wash thoroughly. I hate to feel half-washed.

246
00:18:43,961 --> 00:18:47,372
I'm your bodyguard, not a servant.

247
00:18:50,548 --> 00:18:53,429
Why would a bodyguard break his client's arm?

248
00:18:53,429 --> 00:18:56,304
Damn it! So uncomfortable.

249
00:18:57,638 --> 00:19:02,643
Just taking off the jacket is hard.

250
00:19:02,643 --> 00:19:05,473
What am I supposed to do with this?

251
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,594
I only have two hands, not four!

252
00:19:17,886 --> 00:19:22,178
I know this is forward but... do you have plans on Saturday?

253
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:31,283
Nothing.

254
00:19:31,283 --> 00:19:33,083
Why don't we hang out?

255
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:54,803
This is why I asked you to help me wash.

256
00:19:56,822 --> 00:19:58,615
It's cold.

257
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:05,850
It tickles.

258
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,569
Put up with it.

259
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,640
This reminds me of my mom.

260
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:16,190
Mom used to do this, too.

261
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:25,512
Why don't you take a shower? You should take a shower.

262
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:29,297
I will do it later.

263
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,435
You should take a shower.

264
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,344
I said I would later.

265
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:37,745
Oh, hey!

266
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:40,082
It's cold!

267
00:21:40,082 --> 00:21:41,663
Then take a shower now.

268
00:21:41,663 --> 00:21:43,654
I'll do it later.

269
00:21:43,654 --> 00:21:47,558
Why? We used to shower together.

270
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,516
I'll shower later.

271
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,352
Are you going through puberty or what?

272
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:53,657
I'm way past puberty.

273
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,425
Did you reply to her?

274
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:01,950
I'll see her this Saturday.

275
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,825
I'll go out while you are being tutored.

276
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:08,649
Gosh, have you made plans all by yourself and just notified me?

277
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:09,913
I don't know you at all.

278
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,193
You're the one who suggested it.

279
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:17,739
Hey, go easy!

280
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:21,139
You should treat my glossy hair with great care.

281
00:22:26,189 --> 00:22:27,889
That's it.

282
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,190
But you shouldn't neglect me just because you're in a relationship.

283
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:41,406
- That would be good.
- What?

284
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,079
Say that again.

285
00:22:51,233 --> 00:22:52,906
I said, 'good'.

286
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:06,513
Anyways, have you ever been on a date?

287
00:23:07,196 --> 00:23:09,114
You've never done it before.

288
00:23:09,114 --> 00:23:11,181
Oh, my Kang Guk.

289
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,873
You'll be all gruff and unsociable.

290
00:23:13,873 --> 00:23:16,019
You won't be a good date.

291
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:22,346
I'll teach you a thing or two tomorrow.

292
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:24,738
How's that? Are you grateful?

293
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:25,949
No, I'm not.

294
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:27,559
I know you're thankful.

295
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:30,896
Hey, watch your hands.

296
00:23:44,572 --> 00:23:47,283
How could you go out with my friend?

297
00:23:47,283 --> 00:23:49,031
Your friend?

298
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:51,308
You even gave her the same present.

299
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,603
You asshole!

300
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:02,938
I couldn't take my eyes off you.

301
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,376
Even when I wanted to close my eyes,

302
00:24:14,346 --> 00:24:16,255
I couldn't.

303
00:24:26,275 --> 00:24:28,120
I wanted to run away.

304
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,546
Let's eat.

305
00:24:48,656 --> 00:24:50,335
Hey, Guk.

306
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:58,768
- What are you doing?
- You have good manners... and you are good-looking.

307
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:05,440
That one, please.

308
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:17,584
You are a good cook, too. Just my cup of tea.

309
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,664
Guk is my cup of tea.

310
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:24,914
What? Why do you look at me like that?

311
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,364
Is something on my face?

312
00:25:39,557 --> 00:25:41,409
Come on, let's eat.

313
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:44,979
You proved me right.

314
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:47,047
You're nice but a poor conversationalist.

315
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,691
Don't just stare at me.

316
00:25:48,691 --> 00:25:51,648
Ask a question. Start a conversation.

317
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,396
I got this.

318
00:25:59,243 --> 00:26:01,428
We have no time to lose.

319
00:26:04,638 --> 00:26:07,386
Wow! What a cool place.

320
00:26:08,486 --> 00:26:11,296
You like to make things with your hands.

321
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:16,211
You could look cool if you talked about art.

322
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:17,819
I said no.

323
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,623
Give it a try. She seems nice.

324
00:26:20,623 --> 00:26:24,874
Son Mingyeong, that Miss Cold Shoulder, came to see you?

325
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,533
Stop! She can wait.

326
00:26:27,533 --> 00:26:29,468
We're supposed to be his dating coach now.

327
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:32,512
I didn't know Hyeonjeong and Mingyeong were friends.

328
00:26:35,459 --> 00:26:37,351
- Just go then.
- Why?

329
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:40,458
- If you're not going to be helpful, then leave.
- Okay, okay.

330
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,792
I need to know who you're seeing first.

331
00:26:49,043 --> 00:26:51,839
- Don't tell me...
- It's not your fourth.

332
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:54,151
She's a new student.

333
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:57,007
Man! You scared the hell out of me.

334
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,078
- You should stop.
- Stop what?

335
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:01,877
You've never kissed before, have you?

336
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:10,631
Did you see me and Mingyeong kissing last night?

337
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:13,659
What?

338
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:15,080
You said she came over to argue with you!

339
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,529
Why did she kiss you? It doesn't make sense!

340
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:22,237
- Isn't the angry kiss familiar to you?
- Angry kiss?

341
00:27:22,237 --> 00:27:24,397
What's an angry kiss? I know Angry Birds.

342
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:25,980
Is it to do with birds?

343
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,966
I see you've got a lot to learn.

344
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:29,944
Wait, is it me or what?

345
00:27:29,944 --> 00:27:31,777
- Kim Pilhyeon.
- Yes.

346
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:34,557
Hey! This is our hideout.

347
00:27:34,557 --> 00:27:37,408
They are okay.

348
00:27:37,408 --> 00:27:39,868
Let's talk again later. Okay?

349
00:27:44,966 --> 00:27:47,436
Why do you trust him?

350
00:27:47,436 --> 00:27:50,619
It's boring with just the two of us.

351
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,780
How about that?

352
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,601
Your heart skips a beat, right?

353
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:13,043
That's what love is like.

354
00:28:13,043 --> 00:28:15,950
Just one act when it's least expected.

355
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:21,654
The same goes for touching.

356
00:28:21,654 --> 00:28:24,564
I don't know if you're up to it.

357
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,379
Is this how you do it?

358
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:35,176
Wow! Kang Guk.

359
00:28:35,176 --> 00:28:37,167
Is it romantic?

360
00:28:39,053 --> 00:28:40,973
You're angry, aren't you?

361
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:45,856
Stop doing things like this.

362
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,454
Stop pushing my buttons.

363
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,653
Seriously, I'm begging you.

364
00:28:53,434 --> 00:28:55,176
You don't want to do that either.

365
00:29:02,502 --> 00:29:05,339
I have an old friend,

366
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:09,837
who is never apart from me...

367
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,774
and who is like a shadow.

368
00:29:12,774 --> 00:29:15,897
Stop it! Stay out of trouble this time.

369
00:29:18,242 --> 00:29:20,510
That shadow...

370
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:25,083
- has an ego.
- Stop doing this.

371
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,752
Stop pushing my buttons.

372
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:45,020
You're free to go.

373
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,291
Are you sure?

374
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:52,525
Save the theatrics.

375
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:54,564
I won't get stabbed.

376
00:29:55,957 --> 00:29:58,149
Call me if you need me.

377
00:29:58,149 --> 00:30:00,035
Whatever.

378
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,087
This is driving me up the wall.

379
00:30:20,087 --> 00:30:23,406
Is it okay to take it off?

380
00:30:23,406 --> 00:30:25,662
I was faking it all along.

381
00:30:30,431 --> 00:30:32,750
Let's solve the next question.

382
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:36,899
The most critical thing in this part
is to read the questions first,

383
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,710
and then organize your keywords.

384
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,561
- Here you can see the options of A, B, C, D.
- He really means it.

385
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,037
Taeju!

386
00:30:54,422 --> 00:30:56,378
Excuse me, Miss.

387
00:30:58,396 --> 00:31:00,429
I'm hungry.

388
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:26,232
They say I should start an eating show.

389
00:31:27,138 --> 00:31:30,065
Right. You're a really good eater.

390
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,780
Will you watch it if I do it?

391
00:31:34,318 --> 00:31:37,452
Sure. It's nice to watch someone enjoy food.

392
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:42,862
Try this one too.

393
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:49,478
I'm not sure but...

394
00:31:50,304 --> 00:31:52,786
I'd like to get to know you better.

395
00:32:02,945 --> 00:32:04,922
I even had a dream last night.

396
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:07,222
I had a meal with you and watched a film together.

397
00:32:07,222 --> 00:32:10,388
We got married and had two babies.

398
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:14,935
I'm just joking.

399
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,439
Please come in.

400
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:27,129
Did you invite him?

401
00:32:28,157 --> 00:32:29,657
No, I didn't.

402
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:38,584
Do you like Taeju?

403
00:32:38,584 --> 00:32:39,794
Huh? What?

404
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:42,343
Or does he have a crush on you?

405
00:32:43,935 --> 00:32:45,526
It's not like that.

406
00:32:45,526 --> 00:32:48,201
- I'm like his bodyguard.
- What?

407
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:52,249
I live in Taeju's house and earn living expenses.

408
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:55,594
It's a master-servant relationship, to be precise.

409
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:59,124
Is it a good setup?

410
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:04,090
Well... Just...

411
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:06,060
(dialogue)

412
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,366
What's up, dude?

413
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,224
Want some pasta?

414
00:33:10,224 --> 00:33:11,942
Excuse me?

415
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:17,229
I'm not Kang Guk.

416
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:20,487
I know, you're Pilhyeon. Want some pasta?

417
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:22,251
Hey, man!

418
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,950
Am I expected to follow
your every command like Guk?

419
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:28,919
- Come on, I wouldn't say command.
- I'm busy.

420
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:33,962
Ta-da!

421
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:37,451
The shrimp's gone.

422
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:39,651
It's gone.

423
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,619
He hung up on me.

424
00:33:44,275 --> 00:33:49,713
Since I spoiled him, that jerk thinks
he's above me. What a bastard!

425
00:33:49,713 --> 00:33:52,377
Why do you hang out with him?

426
00:33:52,377 --> 00:33:54,944
You want to ditch us and switch sides?

427
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,795
I have a valid reason.

428
00:33:56,795 --> 00:33:58,473
Your pasta has arrived.

429
00:33:58,473 --> 00:34:00,580
Please enjoy.

430
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:04,471
I feel pain in my heart.

431
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:08,424
All of a sudden?

432
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:10,066
Are you alright?

433
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,556
I have a weakness for a guy with a secret back story.

434
00:34:15,556 --> 00:34:17,964
I feel like I've been punched in the face.

435
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:29,923
I want to like you.

436
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,451
Thank you for asking for my number.

437
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,709
What kind of line is that?

438
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:49,826
And you two, are not suited for each other.

439
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:52,927
- You two are weird.
- Listen, Taeju.

440
00:34:52,927 --> 00:34:55,111
We haven't finished talking.

441
00:34:55,111 --> 00:34:57,678
Can I talk to you after that?

442
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:05,305
I'll come back after I see Hyemi off.

443
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:21,272
Sorry about this awkward situation.

444
00:35:21,272 --> 00:35:25,108
On the contrary, it gets less boring. It's a plus.

445
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:32,318
I feel relieved.

446
00:35:41,724 --> 00:35:44,029
What happened to your cast?

447
00:35:45,438 --> 00:35:47,179
I lied from the beginning.

448
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,788
Hey!

00:36:01,856 --> 00:36:05,564
You walk home. I'm not feeling well.

450
00:36:11,144 --> 00:36:15,259

Because you're being mean.

00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:13,127
Why are you roaming around during class time?

549
00:47:15,616 --> 00:47:18,047
You are the one, aren't you? Guk's date?

550
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:21,744
Hey, hey, don't go there. They're fighting.

551
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:25,251
- Fighting?
- I don't know. Just go away.

552
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:27,908
We're supposed to eat this together.

553
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:41,666
They can see us.

554
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,198
Let's go.

555
00:48:15,405 --> 00:48:17,786
Aren't you wearing your pants backwards?

556
00:48:17,786 --> 00:48:19,650
I'm not.

557
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,730
Did I put them on backwards?

558
00:48:31,194 --> 00:48:33,131
I told you they were fighting.

559
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,585
Good afternoo-

560
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,925
I thought you were a customer.

561
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:46,209
We hardly have any customers. I'm worried.

562
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:49,013
The restaurant was crowded during lunch time.

563
00:48:49,013 --> 00:48:51,049
Congratulations!

564
00:48:53,142 --> 00:48:55,912
- Mom.
- Yes?

565
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:58,593
Even friends get jealous, right?

566
00:48:58,593 --> 00:49:01,583
Sure. It happens a lot.

567
00:49:01,583 --> 00:49:03,369
They do, don't they?

568
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:05,622
I think I've got that feeling myself.

569
00:49:06,642 --> 00:49:08,789
- I felt that, too.
- Why?

570
00:49:08,789 --> 00:49:12,421
Guk and Taeju got jealous?

571
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:14,979
Aww, how cute.

572
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:19,669
I'm not in the mood for jokes.

573
00:49:26,108 --> 00:49:28,394
Just start cooking already.

574
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:43,872
You're lucky. You've got something you want to do.

575
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:56,747
You want a piece of me?

576
00:49:59,041 --> 00:50:01,124
Should I kill you?

577
00:51:07,267 --> 00:51:09,710
I should've never said that.

578
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:13,747
Yeah, why did you do that?

579
00:51:17,344 --> 00:51:19,704
"Stop pushing my buttons."

580
00:51:21,894 --> 00:51:24,261
"Seriously, I'm begging you."

581
00:51:25,254 --> 00:51:29,705
"Han Taeju, I asked you, remember?"

582
00:51:32,053 --> 00:51:34,236
What the hell are you doing?

583
00:51:34,236 --> 00:51:36,400
Don't avoid it.

584
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,262
Why did you do that?

585
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,687
You said we have to resolve any issues
because we're meant to be for life.

586
00:51:41,687 --> 00:51:44,155
If we talk, we can't stay together.

587
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:50,089
When I see you with Hyemi, I get really angry.

588
00:51:50,963 --> 00:51:53,765
I thought I felt jealous as a friend.

589
00:51:59,232 --> 00:52:01,199
But I like you.

590
00:52:08,711 --> 00:52:11,741
I want to be with you all day long,

591
00:52:12,601 --> 00:52:15,195
hold you when we're together,

592
00:52:17,955 --> 00:52:20,981
and grumble when you don't look at me.

593
00:52:24,437 --> 00:52:26,853
Give it a rest, will you?

594
00:52:26,853 --> 00:52:30,178
I've had enough of your whining.

595
00:52:30,178 --> 00:52:35,496
You're only doing this... because you think of me as your mom.

596
00:52:35,496 --> 00:52:37,522
Don't get confused. It's annoying.

597
00:52:37,522 --> 00:52:40,010
Enough is enough.

598
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,292
Do you think I'm a brat who can't tell them apart?

599
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:49,121
You're deliberately being rude.

600
00:52:51,522 --> 00:52:52,974
You're so self-centered.

601
00:52:52,974 --> 00:52:56,580
I am. I've always been like that.

602
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,897
What about your feelings, smart boy?

603
00:52:59,897 --> 00:53:01,510
Out with it.

604
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:05,862
Who do you think
will have more to lose if I leave?

605
00:53:06,845 --> 00:53:10,937
You think I'll lose because you've been paying me. But!

606
00:53:13,027 --> 00:53:14,993
It's not.

607
00:53:16,505 --> 00:53:19,284
I can live without you,

608
00:53:21,827 --> 00:53:23,747
but you can't.

609
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,605
That's not what I'm asking.

610
00:53:32,605 --> 00:53:35,265
You need to know this.

611
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:39,820
For the past 15 years,

612
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:42,960
the week you were in Japan...

613
00:53:44,566 --> 00:53:47,253
Was the happiest and most liberating time for me.

614
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:11,294
Go and tell my dad that right now.

615
00:54:12,671 --> 00:54:16,753
Tell him that you've had a hard time
covering the ass of a spoiled brat.

616
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:20,729
That he should give you money
before you blow Han Taeju's secrets.

617
00:54:23,852 --> 00:54:25,792
Tell him that.

618
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:28,418
Got it?

619
00:54:34,516 --> 00:54:36,689
I know.

620
00:54:36,689 --> 00:54:39,453
You've always been smarter than me.

621
00:54:40,534 --> 00:54:43,077
So you must be right this time, too.

622
00:54:55,334 --> 00:54:57,407
I'll give you a month.

623
00:54:59,746 --> 00:55:01,803
Get lost by then.

624
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:08,672
Why didn't you pack up and leave
if you hate being with me so badly?

625
00:55:18,335 --> 00:55:22,511
[Choi Hyemi]

626
00:55:27,802 --> 00:55:30,102
Where's Taeju?

627
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:31,842
He's at home.

628
00:55:33,982 --> 00:55:36,105
Sorry, I left without a word.

629
00:55:36,105 --> 00:55:37,865
It's alright.

630
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:43,469
Ta-da!

631
00:55:43,469 --> 00:55:46,266
What do you think? It's a guardian angel.

632
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:50,785
- A guardian angel?
- I made it myself. Isn't it cute?

633
00:55:50,785 --> 00:55:52,929
Yes, it is cute.

634
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:54,429
Take it.

635
00:55:58,314 --> 00:56:01,604
There's no one to protect you, right?

636
00:56:03,671 --> 00:56:08,161
I hope you're not having a hard time.

637
00:56:11,898 --> 00:56:13,838
- Hyemi.
- Yes?

638
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:16,087
I'm not having a hard time.

639
00:56:17,067 --> 00:56:20,830
Guarding Taeju is not hard at all.

640
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:22,530
And...

641
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:25,774
I'm sorry.

642
00:56:25,774 --> 00:56:28,389
Like you said, I like...

643
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:32,227
- Mom was right.
- Uh?

644
00:56:32,227 --> 00:56:34,329
I don't want to admit it but...

645
00:56:34,329 --> 00:56:37,340
I guessed it from the beginning.

646
00:56:39,635 --> 00:56:41,569
Your eyes...

647
00:56:41,569 --> 00:56:44,351
Even though you kept looking at me,

648
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:49,602
It seemed as if your gaze was elsewhere.

649
00:57:01,003 --> 00:57:03,433
We used to fight sometimes,

650
00:57:05,275 --> 00:57:07,800
but we patched things up quickly.

651
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:16,480
Once again, the same as always,

652
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,990
I'll pretend I don't know

653
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:21,358
(dialogue)

654
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:23,514
and rekindle our bond.

655
00:57:35,365 --> 00:57:36,965
Taeju!

656
00:57:51,699 --> 00:57:53,399
Taeju!

657
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:10,649
Sir, I think Taeju was kidnapped.

658
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:15,396
I checked his location on the GPS but his phone's off.

659
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,674
I'm sorry, sir.

660
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:20,268
I'm heading to his last location.

661
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:52,836
Hey, I need to see you.

662
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:54,493
I can't afford...

663
00:58:54,493 --> 00:58:56,617
It's about Taeju.

664
00:59:04,728 --> 00:59:06,647
What's going on?

665
00:59:08,297 --> 00:59:10,793
I'm not sure but...

666
00:59:15,943 --> 00:59:17,767
Say it!

667
00:59:19,273 --> 00:59:21,421
I mean... I...

668
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,999
I didn't expect it to go this far.

669
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:29,203
Speak now or I'll kill you.

670
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:31,316
I told them.

671
00:59:31,316 --> 00:59:33,478
I told him...

672
00:59:33,478 --> 00:59:36,135
That I saw you guys kiss in the school backyard.

673
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,917
The chairman ordered my dad so...

674
00:59:38,917 --> 00:59:42,141
I spied on you guys.

675
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,864
It's embarrassing, but I had to.

676
00:59:44,864 --> 00:59:47,547
Otherwise, my dad would've been fired.

677
00:59:52,228 --> 00:59:54,095
I'm sorry.

678
00:59:55,038 --> 00:59:56,798
Thank goodness.

679
00:59:58,451 --> 01:00:00,918
That means the chairman has him.

680
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:03,363
So that's a relief.

681
01:00:05,796 --> 01:00:08,001
Taeju will be sent to England.

682
01:00:13,513 --> 01:00:15,102
Guk, I'm really sorry.

683
01:00:15,102 --> 01:00:17,782
I didn't mean to do it.

684
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:22,039
Please don't say it was me.

685
01:00:22,039 --> 01:00:24,260
I'll get into trouble.

686
01:00:34,223 --> 01:00:36,737
Ouch, it hurts like mad.

687
01:00:39,223 --> 01:00:41,602
You, piece of shit!

688
01:00:41,602 --> 01:00:43,951
Kim Pilhyeon, you are shit.

689
01:01:13,373 --> 01:01:16,336
I shouldn't have let you two live together.

690
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,662
Don't hurt Kang Guk, please.

691
01:01:20,662 --> 01:01:22,933
I'm the one to blame.

692
01:01:25,613 --> 01:01:27,313
Only you?

693
01:01:32,026 --> 01:01:34,406
I had a crush on him.

694
01:01:37,083 --> 01:01:40,223
You are so weak. Just like your mother.

695
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:43,007
Don't insult Mom.

696
01:01:48,013 --> 01:01:50,686
Kang Guk's here.

697
01:02:31,803 --> 01:02:33,971
Taeju probably knew that

698
01:02:33,971 --> 01:02:38,539
because he'd been through a breakup before.

699
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:41,245
When the breakup was about to happen,

700
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:43,201
I came to realize...

701
01:02:47,552 --> 01:02:50,813
that being someone's shadow

702
01:02:50,813 --> 01:02:53,443
and not wanting to lose them...

703
01:02:57,108 --> 01:02:59,697
is what love is,

704
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,587
that reason holds no weight
in the face of love,

705
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:13,305
and that without light, there is no shadow.

706
01:03:16,609 --> 01:03:19,075
It's all new to me,

707
01:03:20,561 --> 01:03:23,181
so there I have it.

708
01:03:44,202 --> 01:03:46,227
Let him in.

709
01:03:58,308 --> 01:04:03,876
Guk, you were useful as a bodyguard.

710
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:08,115
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me why did you walk in...

711
01:04:08,115 --> 01:04:10,226
on your own two feet.

712
01:04:13,972 --> 01:04:16,592
I know I can't win this fight.

713
01:04:17,608 --> 01:04:21,893
I have nothing, whereas you Sir...

714
01:04:21,893 --> 01:04:23,490
have the power to do anything.

715
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:25,449
Exactly.

716
01:04:27,662 --> 01:04:32,536
You may be well aware of it, but one momentary mistake

717
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:35,416
cost you the rest of your life.

718
01:04:35,416 --> 01:04:37,820
Let me talk to him for five minutes.

719
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:44,677
We've been together for 15 years,

720
01:04:46,663 --> 01:04:49,231
we'll need at least five minutes.

721
01:04:54,356 --> 01:04:57,873
If you caused trouble, I would hit Guk. Remember?

722
01:05:06,888 --> 01:05:08,826
I'll go.

723
01:05:10,192 --> 01:05:12,346
I'll go to England.

724
01:05:14,724 --> 01:05:17,200
- And?
- And...

725
01:05:19,567 --> 01:05:21,730
just by myself,

726
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:25,757
I'll study,

727
01:05:25,757 --> 01:05:28,053
go to college...

728
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,292
I'll do everything.

729
01:05:31,292 --> 01:05:32,716
Why should I trust you?

730
01:05:32,716 --> 01:05:35,544
I'll leave tomorrow.

731
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:39,481
I'll do just fine.

732
01:05:40,364 --> 01:05:42,751
Please give me a chance.

733
01:05:45,304 --> 01:05:47,890
I'll show you, dad.

734
01:05:55,223 --> 01:06:00,145
Book his plane ticket for tomorrow and proceed as planned.

735
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:03,239
But...

736
01:06:06,179 --> 01:06:08,269
before that,

737
01:06:13,432 --> 01:06:15,314
let me...

738
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:21,374
make a quick trip home tonight.

739
01:06:50,136 --> 01:06:53,167
I've set you free. Why did you come here?

740
01:06:54,985 --> 01:06:56,967
Don't you know why?

741
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:05,585
I don't want to go to England.

742
01:07:11,118 --> 01:07:12,818
I'm sorry.

743
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:26,514
That stupid jerk, Kim Pilhyeon! I'll kill him.

744
01:07:32,486 --> 01:07:35,286
What the hell, it's already dawn.

745
01:08:07,505 --> 01:08:10,149
I don't know how long it's been but...

746
01:08:11,309 --> 01:08:13,486
I've always wanted to hold you.

747
01:08:16,772 --> 01:08:18,352
I love you.

748
01:08:26,524 --> 01:08:30,324
You're confessing to someone who's leaving in a few hours?

749
01:08:39,203 --> 01:08:40,862
To England,

750
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:44,470
goodbye, Taeju.

751
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:57,688
If you're doing this, you should've
reciprocate my kiss back then.

752
01:08:58,782 --> 01:09:01,045
We haven't even kissed yet.

753
01:09:04,346 --> 01:09:06,320
Hey.

754
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,552
I'm not a pervert.

755
01:09:08,552 --> 01:09:11,352
I don't want to kiss your bleeding lips.

756
01:09:19,795 --> 01:09:22,087
Can we see each other again?

757
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:28,981
Keep trying to find good tteokbokki places for me.

758
01:09:31,301 --> 01:09:33,123
I'll be back.

759
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:36,600
No, you shouldn't.

760
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:40,643
We're not in the same league.

761
01:09:41,782 --> 01:09:45,097
- Just have fun in England and...
- My dream is...

762
01:09:46,187 --> 01:09:49,087
to live happily ever after.

763
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:57,681
I'm happiest being around you.

764
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:01,443
So I will return.

765
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:12,217
I couldn't... take my eyes off you.

766
01:10:12,217 --> 01:10:16,938
You couldn't... take your eyes off me.

767
01:10:33,827 --> 01:10:36,896
Although you wanted to close your eyes,

768
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,581
you could not.

769
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:43,587
Although I wanted to close my eyes,

770
01:10:44,964 --> 01:10:47,004
I could not.

771
01:11:07,518 --> 01:11:09,717
I wanted to run away.

772
01:12:42,017 --> 01:12:44,508
- He smiles with his eyes.
- With his eyes?

773
01:12:44,508 --> 01:12:47,200
Hang on, let me put on lipstick.

774
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:51,300
(dialogue)

775
01:12:51,300 --> 01:12:53,370
(dialogue)

776
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:58,353
- Tteokbokki is ready.
- Okay.

777
01:13:02,979 --> 01:13:05,502
Here's your order.

778
01:13:11,505 --> 01:13:14,386
Hey, here are your customers.

779
01:13:16,177 --> 01:13:18,040
May I help you?

780
01:13:22,486 --> 01:13:26,699
I didn't want my tteokbokki
place to become so popular.

781
01:13:26,699 --> 01:13:29,593
Listen to yourself, mom.

782
01:13:31,713 --> 01:13:35,608
Hey, Guk, Are you sure you're leaving?

783
01:13:35,608 --> 01:13:38,110
Yes, I am.

784
01:13:48,767 --> 01:13:53,034
But... Why Japan, though?

785
01:13:53,034 --> 01:13:54,333
Just because.

786
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,542
I've always wanted to visit there.

787
01:13:56,542 --> 01:13:58,539
When will you be back?

788
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:02,267
When I don't feel anything anymore?

789
01:14:05,921 --> 01:14:10,390
How am I supposed to live

790
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:13,350
without my handsome Guk?

791
01:14:14,310 --> 01:14:16,627
Oh dear, all I have is her.

792
01:14:16,627 --> 01:14:19,947
Mom, stop it.

793
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:28,752
Here, take it. Take it.

794
01:14:28,752 --> 01:14:31,163
It's your part-time pay.

795
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:34,958
Thank you, ma'am.

796
01:14:36,925 --> 01:14:39,170
Hyem.

797
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:41,214
Here he comes again.

798
01:14:43,488 --> 01:14:46,243
I was really looking forward to today.

799
01:14:46,243 --> 01:14:49,971
I was so anxious with you around Hyemi.

800
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:52,074
- Is college fun?
- I don't know.

801
01:14:52,074 --> 01:14:55,168
They teach me weird stuff all the time.

802
01:14:55,168 --> 01:14:57,286
Should I study abroad too?

803
01:14:57,286 --> 01:14:59,173
Are you an idiot?

804
01:15:04,763 --> 01:15:06,248
Take care, damn it.

805
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:08,948
Keep in touch.

806
01:15:08,948 --> 01:15:10,809
Ohisashiburidesu. (Japanese)

807
01:15:10,809 --> 01:15:12,925
That means "long time no see."

808
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:15,399
Did you see him after a long time?

809
01:15:22,217 --> 01:15:24,117
Farewell.

810
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:32,499
Oh, my Guk.

811
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:37,253
He is so fragile.

812
01:15:37,253 --> 01:15:40,207
How can he live on his own?

813
01:15:40,207 --> 01:15:43,919
He's far from fragile, Ma'am.

814
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:47,021
That's why I told him not to leave.

815
01:15:47,021 --> 01:15:50,145
- Have you contacted Taeju?
- Uh.

816
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,869
What did he say? Say anything?

817
01:15:51,869 --> 01:15:53,412
I don't know.

818
01:15:53,412 --> 01:15:55,181
I told him Guk's moving to Japan for good.

819
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:57,205
But he said nothing at all.

820
01:16:00,023 --> 01:16:02,833
Oh, god! My Guk!

821
01:16:02,833 --> 01:16:04,604
My fragile Guk.

822
01:16:04,604 --> 01:16:07,288
Ma'am, he's not weak.

823
01:16:07,288 --> 01:16:11,796
Without Taeju... How can he...

824
01:16:16,089 --> 01:16:19,212
Three years has passed since Taeju left.

825
01:16:20,372 --> 01:16:22,674
He didn't come back,

826
01:16:22,674 --> 01:16:27,211
and I'm leaving for Japan... to forget him.

827
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:33,257
In Korea, everywhere feels like Taeju.

Are you indulging in self-pity here?

835
01:17:47,544 --> 01:17:50,276
Wow, you've become even cooler.

836
01:17:50,276 --> 01:17:51,944
You!

837
01:17:56,902 --> 01:17:59,297
Are you going to Japan?

838
01:17:59,297 --> 01:18:01,987
I told you to find tteokbokki restaurants.

839
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:04,051
Why are you running away?

840
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:07,181
You're late.

841
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:14,876
We should run away together.

842
01:18:15,671 --> 01:18:17,765
That was our wish.
