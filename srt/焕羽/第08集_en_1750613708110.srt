Zhao Xinyu

259
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Good morning

260
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Don't leave

261
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Don't leave

262
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Don't leave

263
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Don't leave

264
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Don't leave

265
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Don't leave

266
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Did you hear a sound?

267
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Actually, this big tree can talk

268
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's saying

269
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Sorry

270
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You play me

271
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I didn't play you

272
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,000
I shouldn't have been angry with you yesterday

273
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Sorry

274
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Those records and those albums are actually my mother's

275
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
And this place

276
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
It's also my secret base with my mother

277
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you want to hear my story?

278
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm sorry

279
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,000
My parents divorced when I was very young

280
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I was brought up by my grandfather

281
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
In the summer of the mid-term

282
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
My grandfather also left

283
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
From then on

284
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I became a burden

285
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So I always feel

286
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I was born wrong

287
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So you see, Zhao Xinyu

288
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Not only you have weakness

289
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Why did you tell me this?

290
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I just want to say

291
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm sorry

292
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Lin Shan

293
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You don't look so annoying

294
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I'm here

295
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I'm here too

296
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Then I'll go up first

297
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Qiao Xinyu

298
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I'm here

299
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm here

300
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm here

301
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm here

302
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm here

303
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I'm here

304
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'm here

305
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I'm here

306
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Your letter

307
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I finally have a chance to give it to you

308
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Will you give it back to her?

309
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Don't get me wrong

310
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I was thinking that the final exam was coming soon

311
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm afraid it will affect your study

312
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Why? I'll go first

313
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I won't give it back to her

314
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Tianyu

315
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Mom, why didn't you knock on the door?

316
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I forgot

317
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Don't go to school tomorrow morning

318
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm on leave

319
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You go out with me

320
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What's the matter?

321
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You'll know when you get there

322
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You'll know when you get there

323
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
What's going on?

324
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Where are we?

325
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
We're going back to our hometown to change our names

326
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Why?

327
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
They said that we should change our names

328
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I don't want you to be like your sister

329
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll change my name and I won't be busy anymore

330
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I won't go

331
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I don't want to change my name

332
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
This is our business

333
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I won't go

334
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I don't want to go

335
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Look

336
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Let's talk

337
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
What are you doing?

338
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let's talk

339
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Let's talk

340
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
She's been holding the little girl

341
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I don't think she wants to go with her

342
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
My name is Li Fanghao

343
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Her name is Qiao Qingyu

344
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
She's my daughter

345
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I want to take her back to her hometown

346
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Is this your mother?

347
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Look at her

348
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
She's ignoring you

349
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You old lady

350
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Qiao Qingyu, say something

351
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You're wearing a mask

352
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You dare not see anyone

353
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
I think she's a criminal

354
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I'm not a criminal

355
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Qiao Qingyu

356
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
She's ignoring you

357
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
What are you doing?

358
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Qiao Qingyu, say something

359
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Say it clearly

360
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I'm not ignoring you

361
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Qiao Qingyu, say something

362
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Say it clearly

363
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Say it clearly

364
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Qiao Qingyu

365
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Qiao Qingyu

366
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
What do you want?

367
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I'm asking you

368
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
What do you want?

369
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Do you think you can be free

370
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
if the police catch me?

371
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Say something

372
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Okay

373
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
The kid knows he's wrong

374
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Hurry up

375
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Tell mom you're not like this

376
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I didn't do anything wrong

377
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Why should I?

378
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Qiao Qingyu, listen to me

379
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I'll take care of you all day

380
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm your real mother

381
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Okay

382
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
If you're capable, you can use a knife

383
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
You can kill me with a knife

384
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You can kill me

385
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
I don't care about you

386
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
I'll let you go

387
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You don't respect me

388
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Go

389
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Qiao Qingyu

390
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Say something

391
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm asking you to take care of you

392
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Go away

393
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I'm asking you to go to school

394
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Go away

395
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Or I'll kill you

396
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'm asking you

397
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Okay

398
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay

399
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
If you can treat me like this

400
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll treat you like this

401
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Why are you so rude?

402
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll protect you

403
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You

404
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
The kid is right

405
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
You need to respect her

406
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Besides, she's grown up

407
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Don't mind her

408
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Qiao Lusheng

409
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
She's grown up

410
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
How many times have you been in charge?

411
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
You're a bitch

412
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Qiao Qingyu

413
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Qiao Qingyu

414
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Qiao Qingyu

415
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000

416
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Qiao Qingyu

417
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Why did the kid

418
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
get involved with her parents?

419
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Besides, they didn't ignore her

420
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
They also worked hard

421
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
to raise the kid

422
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Qiao Lusheng

423
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I begged them

424
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
to raise my kid

425
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
They took the kid

426
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
from me

427
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
You're one of them

428
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
For your self-esteem

429
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
your shame

430
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
your vanity

431
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I shouldn't have listened to you

432
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I should have

433
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
left with Zeyu

434
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I should have

435
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
left with Zeyu

436
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Here

437
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Take it

438
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Actually

439
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
it's not bad to change your name

440
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I think

441
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
we should take this opportunity

442
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
to change a nice name

443
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
How about I change it with you?

444
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
We should change the same name

445
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
So that people will know

446
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
that we're sisters

447
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I'm sorry

448
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Students

449
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Yesterday, the school

450
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
refused to

451
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,000
hold a psychological counseling lecture

452
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
to protect the youth

453
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Some students didn't attend

454
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I've recorded it here

455
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
After the meeting

456
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I came here to explain the reason

457
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
The monitor will send us

458
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
the vacation homework and the grade list

459
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I won't talk here

460
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
You must complete the homework on time

461
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and be careful when you go out

462
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I wish you a happy vacation

463
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
It's my vacation

464
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Sorry

465
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I was the one who asked

466
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
about Brother Hei

467
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
He wanted to see you

468
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's not your fault

469
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I wanted to see him

470
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and it's over

471
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Is he the one you want to see?

472
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
You're mean

473
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm sorry

474
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I didn't mean to hurt you

475
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Don't be

476
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I'm sorry

477
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000
I'm sorry

478
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I'm sorry

479
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I'm sorry

480
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I'm sorry

481
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I'm sorry

482
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I'm sorry

483
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:16,560
It seems that Alesha will soon be

484
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,060
in the expanded case with the

485
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:59,200
IN UNISON

486
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,340
theatre

487
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,640
not

488
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,920
the

489
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,980
high

490
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:23,960
A

491
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,060
My mom gave it to you.

492
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
Mom.

493
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,060
I don't want to eat it, either.

494
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,060
The car is a bit broken. I'll go down and have a look.

495
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,060
Sir, can the car be repaired?

496
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:01,060
What are you looking for? I'll go down and have a look first.

497
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,060
The car is broken. It will be repaired in half an hour.

498
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,060
There are ten miles ahead. You can go ahead in a hurry.

499
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,060
Sir, should I return the money?

500
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
You can't.

501
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I'll go down and have a look.

502
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,060
Sir, can the car be repaired?

503
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Yes.

504
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
What if it's not repaired?

505
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:35,060
I told you that it will be repaired in half an hour.

506
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,060
It's a small place to walk back.

507
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,060
How long will it take?

508
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,060
A few hours.

509
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
You still have so many things.

510
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,060
Mom, can you give me the tea?

511
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,060
I'm a little hungry.

512
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Here.

513
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:10,060
Leave one for your sister.

514
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,060
She doesn't want it.

515
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,060
Dad.

516
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,060
I'm here.

517
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,060
Dad.

518
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Mom.

519
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,060
You're back.

520
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Third.

521
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
You're back.

522
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,060
I was so worried.

523
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,060
The car was broken on the road.

524
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,060
I was late.

525
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,060
You must be cold.

526
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
Put it down.

527
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
Is the ginger soup ready?

528
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,060
It's ready.

529
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
I'll buy it for you.

530
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
Put it down.

531
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
The ginger soup is here.

532
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,060
You're back.

533
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,060
You're back.

534
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Go and rest.

535
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,060
Okay.

536
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,060
Go and rest.

537
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
Come on.

538
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
Hurry up and have some ginger soup.

539
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,060
Come on.

540
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
You rest.

541
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
I'll do it.

542
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
Here.

543
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
Thank you.

544
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,060
Sister.

545
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:56,060
How's Jin Rui's wedding?

546
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,060
She's already married.

547
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,060
That's great.

548
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
Thank you, grandma.

549
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,060
I'm moved too.

550
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
You didn't raise your hand.

551
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,060
The daughter-in-law can't run away.

552
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
My daughter-in-law

553
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,060
is very beautiful.

554
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
She's also a high school student.

555
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,060
She's also a single mother.

556
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:16,060
She can also help our Jin Rui.

557
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
Sister.

558
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,060
By the way,

559
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,060
people in the city don't need a bride.

560
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
Anyway, everything is good.

561
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:25,060
Jin Rui can find Xiaoyun to be his wife.

562
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,060
It's really a blessing for our family.

563
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Really.

564
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,060
You're talking like we're in the top class.

565
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:36,060
My grandson is the top student in the county.

566
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,060
Not to mention Xiaoyun.

567
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
Even if it's ten or eight,

568
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,060
we're worthy of it.

569
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
That's right.

570
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,060
Two days ago,

571
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,060
Uncle Zhi wrote Jin Rui and Xiaoyun

572
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,060
into the family register.

573
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,060
Now,

574
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:52,060
we have to rely on Jin Rui

575
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,060
to support our family.

576
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,060
Grandma.

577
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:59,060
When will my sister and I enter the family register?

578
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,060
When you get married,

579
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Uncle Zhi will write you in.

580
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,060
What about my sister?

581
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,060
Today is a girl's wedding.

582
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,060
She's going to get married in the future.

583
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,060
That's right.

584
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:14,060
I'll put my luggage away first.

585
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,060
Okay.

586
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,060
You clean up first.

587
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,060
Brother, sit down.

588
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,060
Okay.

589
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,060
You sit down, too.

590
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,060
I'll add some more.

591
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,060
Xiaoyun, eat more.

592
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,060
I don't drink.

593
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,060
You don't drink.

594
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

595
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

596
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:01,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

597
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

598
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

599
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:16,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

600
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:22,060
The more you care, the more you're careful.

601
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,060
The future

602
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:38,060
will be revealed.

603
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:45,060
Waiting is the reason for no sound.

604
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:52,060
But it will never be over.

605
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:00,060
So my heart is

606
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,060
your name.

607
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:10,060
The only stubbornness in my heart.

608
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,060
From the first glance,

609
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:18,060
I draw the future.

610
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,060
The dream starts to come true.

611
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:28,060
So your heart

612
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:33,060
has a place.

613
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:39,060
It's the same story.

614
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,060
Fortunately, you're not smart enough.

615
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:47,060
You don't have the courage to come.

616
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:54,060
So time can't be without you.
