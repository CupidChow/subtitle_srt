Why are you so mean?

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Who knows that you would give up your life for this thing?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am lucky to save you this time.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
We are even this time.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000

Sheng.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I heard about your glorious career in the swimming pool.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't bully Qiao Xingyu.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's not easy for Qiao Xingyu.

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Give it to me.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Give it to me.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Did you tell them?

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What did I say?

37
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Did you tell them about Qiao Beiyu?

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The painting is good.

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's okay.

40
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The little girl is beautiful and beautiful.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But she can't lose weight in a hurry.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll give you some medicine to strengthen your stomach.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But you have to exercise more.

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are not fat.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Doctor, I want to ask if there is a person named Qiao Beiyu.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Because of the surgery of Dr. Lan, she died in the People's Hospital.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We can't let the patient's privacy be exposed.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What is your relationship with her?

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
She is my sister.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She knows the specific marriage organization.

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
She knows it better.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we have been in the hospital for more than 20 years.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No one died because of Dr. Lan.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm here to give you...

55
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What are you doing here? It has nothing to do with me.

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are here to find your father, right?

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What does it have to do with you?

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You can really get Qiao Beiyu's medical record.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't.

60
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm begging you.

61
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I said I can't.

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You can know the truth. Why don't you tell me?

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can just tell me the truth.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can't.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm begging you.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I said I can't.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can know the truth. Why don't you tell me?

68
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You can just continue to make a fuss, right?

69
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You are thinking too much.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The medical record is personal privacy.

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And I have a bad relationship with my father.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Doctor, I'm begging you.

73
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please save our Qianqian.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
She is only 28 years old. I don't want to give up like this.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Doctor, I'm begging you.

76
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm begging you. Please save her.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm begging you.

78
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Don't worry.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
We need to discuss the patient's condition.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So we can give you a family card.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Calm down, okay?

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'm begging you. Please save her.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm begging you.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't do this.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We need to discuss it right now.

86
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Wait a minute.

87
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Doctor.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Doctor, please save her.

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Doctor, I'm begging you.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Please don't give up.

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Get up.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
If we decide to stop, we will do our best.

93
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Get up first.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's talk.

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Get up first.

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your living expenses have been cut.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The hospital bill for school's regular class.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Please sign.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Please sign.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why did you draw my hospital?

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Li Ke is more suitable for you.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
My plan for your hospital

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
is to become a doctor like me in the future.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
My dream is to become an artist.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You are the first prize in the National Biological Competition.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you know why I want to participate in the National Biological Competition?

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Why do I have to work so hard to be the first prize?

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Because I want to be like you.

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not incapable.

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's because I hate you.

111
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I hate the doctor.

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I hate you.

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't need you to care.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
For such a big person,

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
you'd rather sacrifice your future

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
just to make me angry.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Son,

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
this is not called capable.

119
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
This is called childish.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Isn't this the opinion of a real parent?

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This is my attitude.

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Your attitude is to impose your personal music

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
on others, right?

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You don't care about others' feelings.

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
When you kicked my mom out,

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
and pulled out my grandfather's ventilator,

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
you did the same thing.

128
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can interfere with others' lives

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
by using your own money.

130
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You are not a doctor.

131
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You are a murderer!

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You shut up.

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you remember the girl from the training center?

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Qiao Bei?

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Do you dare to say that their experience

136
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
has nothing to do with you?

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I will never be a doctor.

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I will never become someone who hates you like you.

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You must be very busy at night.

141
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I took a list from the nearby construction site.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There are more than a hundred people.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't wait for us at dinner.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Make some at home.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Make an egg.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There is milk in the fridge.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Your health is the most important.

148
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm leaving.

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You can still use the detergent.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Add some water. It can last for a week.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Xing Yu.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What are you doing?

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Right.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Wake up and put on your clothes.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This...

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Wait!

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I don't care about your words.

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will call you.

160
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you dare to say yes?

161
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Qiao Qing Yu.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Are you sick?

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You are so boring.

164
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I went to the People's Hospital yesterday.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You are sick?

166
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You are sick?

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You went to investigate the backup?

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I asked several doctors and nurses.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They all said that the People's Hospital

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
didn't die because of the Blue-Haired Yan.

171
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Are the words of

172
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Dad, Mom and Jing Wei Ge all fake?

173
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't know either.

174
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But today I saw the drawer in Dad and Mom's room locked.

175
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The drawer in our house never locked.

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We owe a few tens of thousands to Qiao Bei Yu.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We also owe some money to the moving company.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The thief saw us

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
and he was so angry.

180
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The lock is really unnecessary.

181
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Unless there is something that people don't want to know.

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
As long as we can open the drawer,

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the medical records, the hospital's receipt,

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
we can find something related to Bei Yu's illness.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I think

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
you should just forget it.

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This lock is not used to prevent thieves.

188
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It is specifically used to prevent us.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
At this time,

190
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
you still want to do the top-secret case?

191
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Aren't you afraid of being dragged by Mom?

192
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Moreover,

193
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
even if they

194
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
are intending to hide it,

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
adults will always have their own reasons.

196
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
What if

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Qiao Bei Yu

198
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
really got the illness?

199
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I think

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
it's better not to know

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
this kind of truth.

202
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In order to avoid knowing the truth or the pain,

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
you don't need to know the truth.

204
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are not lying to yourself.

205
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't beat you. You are a genius.

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Anyway,

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I think you should stop torturing yourself.

208
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You are already dead.

209
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Living in lies

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is the saddest thing.

211
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The most painful truth

212
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
is better than the sweetest lie.

213
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This is the last test before the 11th exam.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Everyone should show

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
your true strength.

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The answer card and the paper

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
are all checked.

218
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I will say it again. Don't miss the exam.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You should treat every test

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
as the last high school exam.

221
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
We should constantly improve ourselves, train ourselves, okay?

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Come on, pass the sword to Ma Hai Chuan.

223
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Everyone must be careful.

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
The test is over.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You should do the test first.

226
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
When we were young,

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we always said

228
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that we would be better

229
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
when we grow up.

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
But

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
the more we grow up,

232
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
the more we have

233
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
problems and troubles.

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I am 17 years old.

235
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't want to be seen as a young man.

236
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Even if it's heavy, even if it's painful,

237
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I want to use my own strength.

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I think

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
as long as I follow the truth in my heart

240
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and have no regrets,

241
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
there is no difficulty

242
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
that can stop me.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I am 17 years old.

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Although I am still a critical person,

245
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know that

246
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
hope and light

247
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
are both in front of me.

248
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Is this the crime?

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,560
After the combo,

250
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:09,420
we think everything was completed easily.

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Of course.

252
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,760
That's

253
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
the spirit more than any compście

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,740
to believe in us.

255
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,000
Try to think not to be offended by the society

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
that's kind of following our views,

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
the people of the stock.

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
You're back.

259
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
It's raining today.

260
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
It's raining so hard.

261
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,680
Yeah.

262
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,000
Thanks to Jin Rui.

263
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
He watches the weather forecast every day.

264
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,000
He reminded us

265
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,400
to live in the building of Haisheng.

266
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,560
Otherwise,

267
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
we wouldn't have been able to do anything.

268
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,280
Okay, mom.

269
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,800
Put it down.

270
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,200
Okay, okay.

271
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,640
We'll talk later.

272
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,560
Put it down.

273
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,880
Mom, we can do it.

274
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,440
Yeah.

275
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,240
Go.

276
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,040
Look.

277
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,040
It's okay, mom.

278
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,760
You can put it down.

279
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,400
You don't have to worry.

280
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,240
Take a rest.

281
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Qingqing.

282
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,800
You've grown taller and thinner.

283
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,720
The girls in her family are all pretty.

284
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,840
Why is Qingqing so ugly?

285
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,000
Fang Hao.

286
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,960
Don't be so obsessed with business

287
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,600
and making money every day.

288
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
You should put more effort

289
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,200
on these two kids.

290
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,720
Mom, you're taking good care of them.

291
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,080
When you're back,

292
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,640
I'll take my parents away.

293
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,400
Okay, okay.

294
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,360
Okay, dad.

295
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,840
Mom, you go back and rest.

296
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,400
Let's clean up the old mountain.

297
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
Okay.

298
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,680
Okay.

299
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,520
Okay.

300
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,400
Let's go.

301
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,080
Be careful.

302
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:29,560
Don't slip.

303
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,240
Yeah.

304
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,400
Brother.

305
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,560
Bring something for mom and dad.

306
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,480
Go back.

307
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,560
Third.

308
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,480
It's been hard on you

309
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,440
in the old house these days.

310
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,440
Let's go.

311
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay.

312
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,640
Okay.

313
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,480
It's too hot.

314
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,880
Don't let sister see it.

315
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,840
Put it away.

316
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:48,680
Thank you, mom.

317
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,400
I'll send it to you.

318
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,040
Okay.

319
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,320
Okay.

320
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,400
Do you want to go back to the old house

321
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
and continue being your detective Di Renjie?

322
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
It rains every year and gets flooded every year.

323
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,960
This old house is too old.

324
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,400
Look over there.

325
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,440
The wood is rotten.

326
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,840
I'm thinking

327
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,080
after we clean up this time,

328
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,440
we should just renovate this old house.

329
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Do you think it's okay?

330
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,200
If so,

331
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,760
it will be more comfortable for parents to live here.

332
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,600
Okay.

333
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,640
If you have money, just fix it.

334
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:00,920
No.

335
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,640
You have to give me money.

336
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,000
We young people suffer a little.

337
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,000
You can just deduct it from the deposit.

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,520
No.

339
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,080
You...

340
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,920
You can deduct as much as you want.

341
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,880
Just deduct it.

342
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:13,960
No.

343
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,240
I...

344
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,840
I'm discussing with you.

345
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,720
I didn't say anything.

346
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,320
I said it's okay.

347
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,440
Anyway, your family matters most.

348
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,000
It's not easy to celebrate the new year.

349
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,200
It's great to stay at home all the time.

350
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,320
We should do some homework and have a rest.

351
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,200
But he insists on coming back.

352
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,560
What should I let him do?

353
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:35,840
Enough.

354
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,680
It's a mess.

355
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,200
Okay.

356
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,080
Let's get back to work.

357
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,280
One, two, three, four.

358
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,080
Go.

359
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,280
Hurry up.

360
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,000
Look.

361
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,680
Get him a drink.

362
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,240
Who's that?

363
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,520
Let me introduce him.

364
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,800
The first famous girl in Shunyun.

365
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,640
Qiao Beiyu.

366
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,960
The pretty girl in the disease area?

367
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,040
If you don't tell me, I don't know if the new girl in our class is her sister.

368
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,880
I just ate it too.

369
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
Are you going to hit me?

370
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,160
Just kidding. I'm just chatting.

371
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,480
It's okay.

372
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,600
I heard that Qiao Beiyu is very attractive.

373
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,960
But if there's a guy who treats her better,

374
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:53,440
you'll see her passion and be more generous.

375
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,160
You know so much about her.

376
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,320
You don't have any ideas?

377
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,080
No. I heard from Brother Hei.

378
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,480
Do you know who he is?

379
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,160
My father's big brother.

380
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,840
He said he talked to Qiao Beiyu.

381
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,520
Brother Hei talked to your father?

382
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,720
How come I don't know?

383
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,640
Is this the point?

384
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
The point is Qiao Beiyu.

385
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,440
If the sister is a flower in Shunyun,

386
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,880
is the sister a flower?

387
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,000
The big flower and the flower look alike.

388
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,480
Is it possible that the personality is similar?

389
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Is Qiao Jingyu...

390
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,520
Your hair.

391
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,560
It's slippery.

392
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,160
I have something to do. I'll go first.

393
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,360
You guys play by yourselves.

394
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,840
What's going on?

395
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,680
I'm not talking about your sister's world.

396
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,360
She says she's got your sister's vote back.

397
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,440
You can't bring her back.

398
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,480
Block her.

399
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,280
Do you have time to think who the snake is?

400
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,840
Perseversancepes.

401
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,960
Maybe we can see the method.

402
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,120
Ah Xiang.

403
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,120
You left suddenly?

404
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,120
Who sent you a message?

405
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,120
What does it have to do with you?

406
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,120
I just asked.

407
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,120
Protect the environment.

408
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Find a home for the trash.

409
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,120
What?

410
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,120
Find a home for you.

411
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,120
No.

412
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
You must have sent a message to your sister.

413
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
Why are you so busy all day?

414
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
Protect yourself.

415
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Let's go eat.

416
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
I'm so tired.

417
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,120
Let's go.

418
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Thank you, auntie.

419
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,120
By the way, remember to add more chili in my sister's meal.

420
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,120
Okay.

421
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,120
Thank you, auntie.

422
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I have something to ask you.

423
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
What is it?

424
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,120
It's about Qiao Beiyu.

425
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,120
People say she's a bad person.

426
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,120
But I think she's a good person.

427
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,120
She was thrown into this country at a young age.

428
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,120
Your parents didn't come to visit her for months.

429
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,120
Your grandparents are old.

430
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,120
They don't have the energy to take care of her.

431
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
She's like a wild child in this village.

432
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
But it's weird.

433
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,120
A wild girl who no one cares about.

434
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,120
The more she looks, the more beautiful she is.

435
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
She dances well.

436
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,120
She's talented.

437
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,120
I heard she was awarded by the Beining Dance Academy.

438
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
I know why.

439
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
She went to Huanzhou Medical School.

440
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
I heard it was a big transfer.

441
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
What a pity.

442
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Look, sister.

443
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,120
You didn't come back to Nanjiao Village often when you were a kid.

444
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,120
Your sister is waiting for you every day.

445
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,120
She has good things for you.

446
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Come out, please.

447
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,120
Throw away the light and the useless things.

448
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,120
Mom, do we have to throw away the lights?

449
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
They're fine.

450
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,120
We can replace them later.

451
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I'll throw them away.

452
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,120
This is the best thing I've ever seen.

453
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,120
And I remember this was a gift from Jingrui.

454
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,120
You didn't hear me, did you?

455
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
They're useless.

456
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
They're useless.

457
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,120
I've been here for more than once.

458
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
I should have thrown them away.

459
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,120
I'm sorry.

460
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,120
It's good to live in this old house.

461
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,120
If I hadn't lost my job back then,

462
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,120
it would be nice to live here.

463
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
You don't have to be so tired.

464
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,120
You have to take care of your kid while running the noodle shop.

465
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,120
Xiaobei won't leave us.

466
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,120
I remember when we were kids,

467
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
every time we went back to Nanjiao Village,

468
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,120
he would leave us with good food and toys.

469
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,120
What if Qiao Beiyu stayed with us

470
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,120
and his parents in Shunyu?

471
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
What would he do?

472
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,120
Grandparents always say

473
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
that their parents can't raise us three.

474
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,120
So they left my sister in Nanjiao Village.

475
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,120
If you stayed in Nanjiao Village,

476
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,120
would Qiao Beiyu feel better if I stayed?

477
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,120
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
Fang Hao.

479
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,120
Fang Hao, look at this.

480
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Do you remember one year you told Xiaobei

481
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
that if he won the contest,

482
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
he would take him to Mount Wu.

483
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
We were too busy to go to the city.

484
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,120
I called him and told him I couldn't go.

485
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,120
It's okay. I didn't win.

486
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
Actually, he won.

487
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,120
But he didn't hold us back.

488
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,120
What were you thinking?

489
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Why didn't you fight for it?

490
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
We had Xiao Yu.

491
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
If we held on,

492
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:34,120
my dad might agree to take Xiaobei back.

493
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Then we would be fine.

494
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:43,120
I don't know when

495
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,120
Qiao Beiyu became a criminal.

496
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Mom was furious when she mentioned him.

497
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Dad was so angry when he mentioned him.

498
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,120
I hate him too.

499
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,120
I hate him for being so cold.

500
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,120
He calls me a good-hearted person.

501
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,120
But he would beat you up.

502
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:07,120
He would also leave me the candy.

503
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,120
Okay, stop writing love letters.

504
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
You can't be reborn.

505
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Beiyu is gone.

506
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,120
It's over.

507
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
Mr. Sun,

508
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,120
I sent you the form this afternoon.

509
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
I didn't have time to do it

510
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
because my dad was on a business trip.

511
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
Don't worry.

512
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,120
I'll finish it before your vacation is over.

513
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Let me see.

514
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
Here.

515
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Look at mine.

516
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,120
Why is it in English?

517
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,120
I thought your dad was the dean.

518
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
You should have a better signature.

519
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I'm not sure.

520
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
You should have a better signature.

521
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Yes.

522
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
Sign here.

523
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,120
How is it?

524
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
How is it?

525
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
I think it's better than yours.

526
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
It's better than yours.

527
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,120
Look at what you wrote.

528
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,120
At least it's in Chinese.

529
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Sun is a good kid.

530
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Think about how to tell your dad.

531
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
It's okay.

532
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
My dad doesn't care about me.

533
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
He can't care about me.

534
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
Okay.

535
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
I've handed in the whole class.

536
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
You're the only one left.

537
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,120
Send it to him before the vacation is over.

538
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
You've worked so hard.

539
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
You'd rather sacrifice your future

540
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,120
just to get rid of it.

541
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
That's not being capable.

542
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,120
That's being childish.

543
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
Sun.

544
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Sun.

545
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
You're back.

546
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
Hello.

547
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
You're back.

548
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
I heard you were back.

549
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
When did you arrive?

550
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,120
We came in the morning.

551
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
We're back.

552
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Let's eat.

553
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
I have soup.

554
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I'll bring it to you.

555
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
We'll eat soon.

556
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
You're here.

557
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
You're back.

558
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
You can sit down.

559
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
You're welcome.

560
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
Sit down.

561
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Sit down, sister-in-law.

562
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Uncle, auntie.

563
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
I have soup.

564
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
Xiaobei.

565
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Xiaobei.

566
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
No, this isn't Xiaobei.

567
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Xiaobei.

568
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Wenxiu.

569
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Aunt.

570
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Wenxiu.

571
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Let go.

572
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
This is Qingyu, not Beiyu.

573
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Aunt.

574
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
Wenxiu.

575
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
I miss you so much, Xiaobei.

576
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Let go.

577
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
Xiaobei.

578
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
Let go of the flowers.

579
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Let go of the flowers.

580
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
The flowers are not pretty.

581
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
Aunt.

582
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
The flowers are crushed.

583
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
Flowers.

584
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Flowers.

585
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Flowers.

586
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Flowers.

587
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
Xiaobei.

588
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Xiaobei.

589
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
Let's eat first.

590
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Let's eat first.

591
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Let's eat first.

592
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Let's eat first.

593
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
You guys eat first.

594
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
I'll bring him back to the room to eat.

595
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Let's eat first.

596
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
Let's eat first.

597
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,120
Are you okay?

598
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
Let's go.

599
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Xiaobei.

600
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
Don't sweat when you're done eating.

601
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Okay.

602
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,320
Okay, let's talk.

603
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,400
Bathing, drinking, bedding, might not.

604
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,360
Are you angry?

605
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,920
Do you have any aquí, Chen?

606
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,960
I'm good.

607
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,120
Why did you hear that?

608
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,280
Probably my mom.

609
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,600
You are probably for no reason.

610
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Mm.

611
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Xiaoqin, she seems to be still a little...

612
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Since our child died,

613
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
she's been sick.

614
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
She's been stimulated.

615
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
She's seen a lot of doctors.

616
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
They say it's a mental problem.

617
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
She can't be cured.

618
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
You're pretty tough, too.

619
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You're pretty tough, too.

620
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,600
Oh, slow down.

621
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,600
I'm happy that you're back.

622
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
I was going to get married

623
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,600
and have a child to live a normal life.

624
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Wenqiu likes children, too.

625
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
But now,

626
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
she can't have children.

627
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
She can't live without me.

628
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
I admit it.

629
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
I can't live without her.

630
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Wenqiu,

631
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
every family has its own difficulties.

632
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Just live your life.

633
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
Just live it.

634
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
You're all good.

635
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
We have Qingqing and Xiaoyu.

636
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
They grew up in a few years.

637
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
But speaking of which,

638
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
Qingqing grew up so fast.

639
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,600
I didn't recognize her when I first came in.

640
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
I thought she was her sister.

641
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
I thought she was her sister, too.

642
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
What's wrong with her?

643
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
Take your time.

644
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Sun,

645
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I didn't mean that.

646
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,600
It's not good for girls to grow up.

647
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
You have to see it.

648
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Brother, you...

649
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Let's drink.

650
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Bei Yu lived in the old house

651
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,600
before he went to Huanzhou to study.

652
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,600
He and Aunt Xing are very close.

653
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
They've been living together for so many years.

654
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
They must have feelings.

655
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
No wonder he treats you like Bei Yu today.

656
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
When Qin Ai hugged me today,

657
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
he hugged me so tightly

658
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,600
that I couldn't say a word.

659
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,600
He's not normal.

660
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,600
You don't have to take it seriously.

661
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:49,600
But I think he's sincere.

662
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
I think he's really good to Bei Yu.

663
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
It's a pity that Qiao Bei Yu...

664
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,600
It's normal to be a pity.

665
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
When people talk about Qiao Bei Yu,

666
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
they all sound mean.

667
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
It turns out that only Aunt Qin and she are on good terms.

668
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Tell me,

669
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
what happened to Qiao Bei Yu

670
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,600
that made Aunt Qin feel so bad?

671
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Go.

672
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
Go.

673
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,600
Sheng.

674
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,600
Sheng.

675
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,600
I live in the head of the Yangtze River,

676
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,600
you live in the tail of the Yangtze River.

677
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,600
I live in the science class,

678
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
you live in the civil science class.

679
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
We're like parallel lines.

680
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
We'll never have a connection.

681
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
When I think of these, I feel so painful

682
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
that I can't control myself.

683
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
You're so dramatic.

684
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Sheng,

685
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,600
even if you go to the science class,

686
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
we're still brothers.

687
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Let's have dinner tonight

688
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
and get into shape.

689
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm still going to the science class.

690
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
What?

691
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
You've made up your mind?

692
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
You're not very welcoming.

693
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Are you afraid that I'll steal your style?

694
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
No.

695
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,600
We just didn't make up our minds.

696
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Aren't you going to tell your dad the truth?

697
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Why are you so obedient?

698
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,600
It's my decision.

699
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,600
It's none of his business.

700
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Who's that?

701
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
Good shot.

702
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Qingyu.

703
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
Ma Minka.

704
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,600
I'm also here

705
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,600
to visit someone else

706
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,600
on this vacation.

707
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,600
We haven't seen each other

708
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,600
for a long time.

709
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,600
By the way,

710
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
why didn't you reply to my letter

711
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,600
when I wrote to you?

712
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,600
I didn't receive any letter.

713
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,600
What's wrong?

714
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Maybe I remembered it wrong.

715
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
After all, there aren't many people

716
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,600
who write letters now.

717
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Anyway,

718
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
as long as you don't

719
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,600
deliberately not reply to me,

720
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,600
it's fine.

721
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,600
What did you write?

722
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,600
Actually, it's nothing special.

723
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
Qingyu,

724
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
tomorrow morning,

725
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
let's go to the library

726
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
to study together.

727
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
You have good grades.

728
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
I have a good promotion

729
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
to ask you.

730
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:32,600
Ma Minka,

731
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,600
thank you.

732
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
For what?

733
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Thank you for being willing to play with me.

734
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Actually,

735
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
I've heard about it.

736
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
But you are the back-up.

737
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,600
You can't use this back-up

738
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
to blame yourself.

739
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Moreover,

740
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
the Qingyu I know

741
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
is a good student

742
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
who is good at studying.

743
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
He never does anything out of the box.

744
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,600
He's obedient and calm.

745
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
What do you mean by

746
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
being obedient and calm?

747
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
I mean

748
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
you are different from your sister.

749
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
I have something to do today.

750
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
I'll go first.

751
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Well...

752
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
See you then.

753
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
What if

754
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
Qiao Beiyu

755
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
really got sick?

756
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I don't think

757
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,600
it's a good thing to know.

758
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Stop.

759
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Forget it.

760
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
I can't beat him.

761
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
I won't.

762
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
Let's go.

763
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Let's go home.

764
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Let's play next time.

765
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,600
Let's play next time.

766
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
I'll go first.

767
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Where did you get it?

768
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
You stole the letter

769
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Ma Mingkai sent me.

770
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,600
I asked the monitor.

771
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
You were responsible for

772
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
getting the whole letter

773
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
from the conveyor last month.

774
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
I didn't take the letter.

775
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Don't wrong good people.

776
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
Okay.

777
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Can you do me a favor?

778
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
I want my sister's cancelled sick leave.

779
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
I've already written

780
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
the request letter for the cancelled sick leave.

781
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I can only help you

782
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
apply for the copy of the sick leave.

783
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
If you do,

784
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
how will you pay me back?

785
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,600
How do you want me to thank you?

786
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
Yes.

787
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
The eyebrows on the top,

788
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,600
the smile on the lips,

789
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
I've revealed a signal.

790
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
I'm possessed.

791
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
The End

792
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Aunt Xiao Zhen.

793
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Qingqing, you've grown so tall.

794
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
My uncle and aunt have gone out.

795
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:47,600
They haven't come back yet.

796
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
It's okay. It's okay.

797
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,600
It's your uncle.

798
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
He asked me to come and see Xiaoqin.

799
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,600
The End

800
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
How is it?

801
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:23,600
It looks good.

802
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,600
I'm a cleaner at the sanatorium.

803
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
I don't know how to treat this disease.

804
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Your uncle asked me to come and see

805
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,600
because he was worried about his brother.

806
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,600
He was afraid that he would cause trouble

807
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,600
if he was sick.

808
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,600
By the way,

809
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
I'll tell your uncle

810
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
to help you with the treatment.

811
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Don't let him get too excited.

812
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,600
Aunt Xiao Zhen,

813
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,600
you're a cleaner at the sanatorium?

814
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,600
Yes.

815
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:47,600
It's been more than 20 years.

816
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,600
I know who has a big and small problem

817
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
in this village.

818
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,600
Do you know about Qiao Beiyu?

819
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
I'm sure

820
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,600
I've heard about him.

821
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Everyone says that.

822
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
But I don't know

823
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,600
if he has the disease or not.

824
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,600
There's one thing

825
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,600
I remember very clearly.

826
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
The End

827
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,600
The End

828
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:29,600
Waiting is the reason for life

829
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:36,600
But it will never end

830
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,600
So my heart

831
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,600
is your name

832
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:53,600
The only stubbornness in my heart

833
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,600
From the first glance

834
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,600
I draw the future

835
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:07,600
The dream starts to become real

836
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,600
So your heart

837
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,600
has a place

838
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:22,600
to hide the same story

839
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Fortunately, you're not sensible enough

840
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,600
You didn't have the courage to come

841
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:36,600
So time can't be without you
