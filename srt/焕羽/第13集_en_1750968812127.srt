00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Episode 16

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
He's going abroad to study?

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,360
Yes.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,320
His parents have already agreed

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,880
on his future plans.

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,760
He'll go to study in France

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,960
and become a great doctor in the future.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,480
He often goes to school

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,320
and takes classes.

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,800
He doesn't want to take the exam.

11
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,600
He's very strict

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,200
when it comes to language.

13
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,480
If nothing goes wrong,

14
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,040
he'll live abroad.

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
We're not

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,160
in the same world.

17
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,160
You're only 18 years old.

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,560
I'm afraid

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,760
you'll make the wrong decision

20
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,600
because of your impulsive.

21
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,440
After all, you're going to Jiangzhou.

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,920
You're not familiar with the life there.

23
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,440
You haven't finished your books.

24
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,360
Your life is likely to be completely changed

25
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,400
because of this decision.

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
I don't know

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,760
what you're going to do.

28
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,960
But Sheng's future

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,160
will be better than

30
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,600
his parents' plans.

31
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
I'm going back.

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,760
If Ming Sheng comes back,

33
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,120
don't tell him I've been here

34
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,280
in case he's worried.

35
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,480
Thank you for talking to me.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,960
I'm leaving.

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm leaving.

38
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,360
Thank you.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,280
You're welcome.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,760
Mr. Lu.

41
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,360
I told you not to run around

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
and you might get lost.

43
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,360
What if I can't find you?

44
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,680
Let's go.

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,080
Xiao Qing Yu.

46
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,480
Xiao Qing Yu.

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,800
It's me. What's wrong?

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,440
Nothing. I was just laughing.

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,280
Just kidding.

50
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,800
Childish.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,720
Xiao Qing Yu.

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,400
What's wrong?

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,400
Don't go.

54
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,080
Wait for me.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,120
Cheng Li Yuan.

56
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,300
They are both all

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320
Meineřians.

58
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,960
They keepamiento with kids.

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,480
cores save her from

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,640
being exposed.

61
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,200
She is so writain

62
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,500
She called your friends

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,840
to join him,

64
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,540
not others.

65
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,740
But people are so dreamy.

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,220
I find my pain

67
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,260
I'm not a dream girl

68
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,100
I'm not a dream girl

69
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,420
How can you be a dream girl?

70
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,380
You're blinded by your eyes

71
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,100
Boss, come and smoke

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,900
You don't know your manners

73
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,180
I bought some food

74
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,500
and some clothes for you

75
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,180
I think the clothes are almost the same

76
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,220
We can buy the rest

77
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,740
after we arrive in Jiangzhou

78
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,140
By the way, I bought this for you

79
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,580
It's a warm bag

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,660
When you go out tomorrow

81
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,260
put it in your clothes

82
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,580
It's cold outside

83
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,100
I don't want to

84
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,580
drag a cold one with me

85
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,940
I'll put it here

86
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,300
I've been saving this

87
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,860
since I was five

88
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,660
for 12 years

89
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,700
It's 17,000 yuan in total

90
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,980
Now I'll give it to you

91
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,100
I love to throw things

92
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,300
You can keep it

93
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,300
I said I'll keep it

94
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,100
You can keep it

95
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,100
Take it

96
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,780
This is all my belongings

97
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,820
You have to keep it

98
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Don't throw it away

99
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,340
And tomorrow

100
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:25,300
we can't take a train

101
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,300
or a plane

102
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,820
So I'll call a taxi

103
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,940
tomorrow morning

104
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,660
I'll arrive in Jiangzhou

105
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,940
in the afternoon

106
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,420
But have you ever thought

107
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,980
after we arrive in Jiangzhou

108
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,780
what to eat

109
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,460
where to live

110
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,860
how to make money

111
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,380
How can you explain to your dad?

112
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,660
I've thought about it

113
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,780
I have an online friend in Jiangzhou

114
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,180
He can help me

115
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,660
find a job in the supermarket

116
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,020
and also sponsor

117
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,100
the staff dormitory in the supermarket

118
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,940
I'll plan

119
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,460
the future

120
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,780
You shouldn't be like this

121
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,900
What's my life like?

122
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,700
It's up to me

123
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,820
Actually, my family's business

124
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,100
has nothing to do with you

125
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,100
You don't have to

126
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,900
be like this for me

127
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,620
I didn't leave because of you

128
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,660
I've wanted to leave here for a long time

129
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,780
I left home

130
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,300
and left my dad

131
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,580
I just happened to meet you

132
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,580
and I'm happy

133
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,900
What if this decision is wrong?

134
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,340
When we are 28

135
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,900
and 38

136
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700
we'll look back at the decision we made now

137
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,340
and feel regretful and stupid

138
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,140
Qiao Xingran

139
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,460
You haven't started yet

140
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,420
You won't fight against Tang Gu, right?

141
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,860
Qiao Dalian is a boss

142
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,260
You won't be Qiao Songbao, right?

143
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,100
What?

144
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:48,740
Give me the hook

145
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,340
Can you?

146
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,180
Ten thousand year

147
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,220
ontinuously

148
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,060
I bought this.

149
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,060
Thank you.

150
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Thank you.

151
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
Thank you.

152
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
As our program was broadcast the day before yesterday,

153
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,060
there were more and more enthusiastic citizens in Huanzhou

154
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,060
who started to pay attention to the escape of high school student Qiao Qingyu.

155
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,060
They also provided a lot of relevant clues.

156
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,060
Unfortunately,

157
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,060
these clues were not effectively confirmed by the police and Qingyu's family.

158
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,060
They didn't get any practical and effective information.

159
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,060
So today,

160
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,020
it has been five days since the Qingyu incident.

161
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,020
The hotline of our TV station is still open 24 hours.

162
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,020
I hope that more enthusiastic citizens

163
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
will continue to provide us with relevant clues.

164
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,020
We have eight or nine hours left.

165
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
We are leaving Huanzhou.

166
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,020
Do you think

167
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
our escape journey

168
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
will be like the movie?

169
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,020
What escape journey?

170
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
You are over-examining yourself.

171
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
No.

172
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
The picture in my mind

173
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,020
is like the Roman calendar.

174
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,020
I am not sure

175
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
if it is the same as the movie.

176
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,020
I think

177
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
it is the same as the movie.

178
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
I think

179
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
it is the same as the movie.

180
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,020
After we leave here,

181
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,020
no one can control us.

182
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,020
What do you want to do?

183
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
I want to eat hamburgers.

184
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,020
I want to go to the playground.

185
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:10,020
I also want to go to the beach to see the lighthouse.

186
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,020
No.

187
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:19,020
Jiu Jiu Yu,

188
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
you are so good at this.

189
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,020
You can't just

190
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,020
make fun of me.

191
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,020
I won't do that.

192
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,020
What about you?

193
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,020
What do you want to do?

194
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,020
I want to be a bomb.

195
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
I want to go to the bar to watch the game.

196
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Then I want to go to the concert

197
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
and sit in the first row.

198
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,020
Anyway,

199
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
it is the same as adults.

200
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,020
I want to do what I didn't do before.

201
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
I want to do it again.

202
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,020
Xiao Jin,

203
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,020
look at the moon tonight.

204
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
It is beautiful.

205
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,020
It is beautiful.

206
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
It is beautiful.

207
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Let's go to sleep.

208
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,020
Chen Xin Yu,

209
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,020
the moon tonight

210
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,020
is really beautiful.

211
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,020
Can we take Jiu Jiu with us?

212
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,020
Sure.

213
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,020
Let's go together, Jiu Jiu.

214
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,020
Wait a minute.

215
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
You should wear this.

216
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,020
Because when you go on a trip,

217
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,020
everyone knows what clothes you are wearing.

218
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,020
It will be safer.

219
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
I'll go down and take a taxi.

220
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,020
Then you can see what is

221
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,020
left in the house.

222
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
Remember,

223
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
you come down after I call you.

224
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,020
It's okay.

225
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
What's wrong?

226
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,020
Thank you.

227
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
I will remember your kindness to me.

228
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
Why are you so mean?

229
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
Wait for me.

230
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,020
I'll go with you.

231
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
Sir, will you go to Zhangzhou?

232
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,020
Not far from here.

233
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,580
Jian Li zero

234
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,660
Master, are you leaving Jiangzhou?

235
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,580
I'm leaving

236
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,540
thoughts

237
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,580
Then you wait for me

238
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,620
I have someone else

239
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,880
Then I take down

240
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,100
aları

241
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,380
I talked about people's hot news last night

242
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,180
To receive a hint to the hot name

243
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,180
It's said that Qiao Qingyu

244
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Used to be in Chaoyang hochschnee

245
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,100
Тогда

246
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,940
I said

247
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,220
We went to Chaoyang hochschnee this morning

248
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,040
Are you Qiao qin marmon

249
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,180
Wasn't Qiao qin marmon

250
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,100
Qiao Qingyun

251
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,020
Qingyun

252
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,100
So where did you come from

253
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,900
Look how great you look

254
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,980
So how good you look

255
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,700
Aren't you Qiao sun

256
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,820
How did you look

257
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,220
So what

258
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,980
Don't stop me

259
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,260
Eat your food!

260
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,980
What did you think you were doing?

261
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
I don't know what they were up to.

262
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,980
It's not like me.

263
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,020
What's going on?

264
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:11,020
This is a video, you know?

265
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Ming Shan

266
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
What's wrong?

267
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
Thank you

268
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
I will remember your kindness

269
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,020
What's going on?

270
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,020
Your mom has been at home for days

271
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,020
She is worried about you

272
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Sister

273
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Why don't you go back?

274
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,020
Are you dead?

275
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,020
You really come back?

276
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,020
Tell me

277
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,020
Go home

278
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,020
Go home

279
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Go home

280
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Qiang, you should take care of your daughter

281
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,020
Ok

282
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,020
Dad Qiao, you should take care of your daughter

283
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,020
Thank you

284
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Go home

285
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
This is a village of human

286
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,020
On behalf of Qiao family

287
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,020
I want to thank all the people who help us

288
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:46,020
Qiao family finally reunite

289
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
Grandpa, have some tea

290
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,020
No

291
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,020
You, kneel down

292
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
No

293
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
Grandpa

294
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Sit down

295
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
No

296
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Grandpa

297
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
Are you sure?

298
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,020
Say something

299
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,020
I am not wrong

300
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
I just want you to apologize

301
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,020
If you do this, it's over

302
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Jin Rui's wedding

303
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,020
is destroyed by you

304
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,020
Grandma was also angry and fell ill

305
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
That's wrong

306
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,020
The police have already provoked this family

307
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,020
You ruined the whole family

308
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,020
I can also provoke this family

309
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
You're done, right?

310
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,020
What's the mess?

311
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
This is what my dad is talking about

312
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
You this

313
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,020
This is what you brought bad

314
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
Grandpa, grandpa

315
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,020
You say a few words

316
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
Don't get angry

317
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
We didn't take care of the child

318
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,020
We will take good care of it in the future

319
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Okay, the child is back

320
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,020
Let's go back

321
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,020
Go back

322
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,020
Go

323
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,020
You, take her back to her hometown

324
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
When things come to this

325
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,020
You have to explain to her

326
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,020
I can't believe it

327
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
Go

328
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,020
Go

329
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,020
Go

330
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,020
See how big you are

331
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Then the dean, let's go out first

332
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,020
Someone called

333
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,020
The surveillance station revealed

334
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,020
Qiao Xinli's whereabouts

335
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,020
This person is only likely to be you

336
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,020
The person who called

337
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,020
Just want to stop a mistake

338
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
Why do you always

339
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
Ignore others' feelings

340
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
You are always doing what is right

341
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,020
Interrupt my life

342
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,020
I don't have time to explain to you

343
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,020
I am very busy

344
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
Just because you are parents

345
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,020
So what you do is right

346
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
Son

347
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
There is no such thing in this world

348
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
Parents who don't love their children

349
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,020
All excuses

350
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,020
I tell you

351
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,020
I hate your control

352
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,020
I don't want to have any more relationship with you

353
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,020
When can you

354
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,020
From life

355
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,020
Completely disappear

356
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:04,020
Wait for the day you really grow up

357
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,020
What's up

358
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,020
What's up

359
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,340
Are you my wife?

360
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,560
How can I not love you when you have to quarrel and fight to defend yourself.

361
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,340
That's handsome.

362
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,280
Sometimes, just because I swing an arm

363
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:56,480
It doesn't mean that you should not love her.

364
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,880
I understand.

365
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,480
Don't change for a hundred years.

366
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,840
The

367
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,880
You said such a big thing happened.

368
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,760
Why can't you apologize?

369
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,800
Big big big

370
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,440
You said the little one is so quiet

371
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,160
I don't know how you led the child

372
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,520
It's all my fault

373
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
It's all my fault, okay?

374
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,160
Their good is yours

375
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
The bad is mine

376
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,880
I have three children

377
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,760
I have worked hard to pull them up

378
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,400
It's all because I didn't treat them well

379
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
I taught them badly

380
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,520
So your family should be scolding me, right?

381
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,000
Can't I say something?

382
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,360
You did bring the child.

383
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,240
What's wrong with me apologizing to her?

384
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,600
Yes, I can understand Panic's mistake.

385
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,560
But she's only 18 years old now.

386
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,800
You can't even care about that.

387
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,360
You said she's grown up, can you still care about that?

388
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,600
Then how do you end this?

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,600
Dad, I'm hungry.

390
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Did I say that?

391
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,880
I'm still on your side.

392
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Dad, make me a bowl of noodles.

393
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,280
I want to eat noodles with tomatoes.

394
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm losing weight.

395
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,720
Your dad and mine were in difficulty.

396
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,800
He was mad at us.

397
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
Peasants.

398
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,800
Be shortages?

399
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,640
Clear.

400
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,520
Go, don't stones me out on 끈.

401
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,480
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,480
You're so bold.

403
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Why did you leave without saying goodbye?

404
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,920
Your whole family is looking for you.

405
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,680
We even went to the police station.

406
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,240
Where have you been these days?

407
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,520
At my classmate's.

408
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,320
Which classmate's?

409
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,920
The one across the street.

410
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,200
Is it that boy, Ming Sheng?

411
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,440
The coat and the shoes

412
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,640
belong to him, right?

413
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,440
He and I are just ordinary classmates.

414
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,360
He found me and saw that I had a fever.

415
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,440
So he took me to his house

416
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,240
and stayed there for a few days to help me.

417
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,880
He took the initiative to look for you

418
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,120
and stayed at his house for a few days?

419
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,680
Is that right?

420
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,840
Why did he take the initiative to look for you?

421
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,200
You didn't contact him.

422
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,520
How did he find you?

423
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,080
There are only two possibilities.

424
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,000
First,

425
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,880
he has a special idea.

426
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,160
He wants to be good to you.

427
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
And there's another one.

428
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,680
You're a genius.

429
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,800
What kind of person is he?

430
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,080
Not at all.

431
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,520
He just wants to help me

432
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,560
because he's pitying me.

433
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,040
You're still talking for him now?

434
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,120
Do you really care about him that much?

435
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,160
No.

436
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,760
You don't?

437
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,120
Then what are you worried about?

438
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,200
What are you afraid of?

439
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,480
I'm not afraid.

440
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,040
You're afraid that I'll go to him

441
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
and that I'll embarrass you, right?

442
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,240
You can scold me if you want.

443
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,360
He was kind enough to help me.

444
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Why are you looking for him?

445
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,200
So it was you

446
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,480
who posted it.

447
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
You...

448
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,040
What have you been doing

449
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,280
together all these days?

450
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,600
We didn't do anything.

451
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,560
Qiao Qingyu,

452
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,400
how could you lie to me?

453
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,200
Qiao Qingyu,

454
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,280
you're only 18 years old.

455
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,720
I...

456
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,200
I always tell you

457
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,040
what you're thinking.

458
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,760
Can you remember it?

459
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,160
If others know about this,

460
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:14,880
what will they think

461
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,640
and what will you do?

462
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,960
Have you thought about it?

463
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,040
How can you be like your sister?

464
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,960
Anyway, I can't just

465
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
look at you and your sister.

466
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
Why can't you

467
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,320
listen to me?

468
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,440
You're still young.

469
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,080
You're not sensible.

470
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,120
You don't know.

471
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
Can't you just listen to us?

472
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,840
We can't kill you.

473
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,360
Qiao Beiyu was killed by you.

474
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,560
Did you send him

475
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,800
back to Nan Qiao Village?

476
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,920
Did you send him

477
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,640
to Qiao Jingrui?

478
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,320
You blame us for everything.

479
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,640
You're always the most hard-working

480
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,400
and the most sober.

481
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,320
Can you reflect on yourself?

482
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:45,960
You always

483
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,040
stand on the high point of morality

484
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,080
and kidnap us.

485
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,040
You force me.

486
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,000
You force me to the point

487
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:50,480
that I can't stand it anymore.

488
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,320
You'll ruin me too,

489
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,440
okay?

490
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,800
I dare not ruin you.

491
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,400
Take it easy.

492
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,760
Go.

493
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,880
Go now.

494
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,080
Leave me.

495
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,080
Leave me and Yuan Yuan.

496
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,520
Leave this family and Yuan Yuan.

497
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,480
I don't care if you die.

498
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,760
Go.

499
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,640
Just go.

500
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Where are you going?

501
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,480
Let me go back.

502
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,520
Let me go.

503
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,400
Let me go.

504
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,280
Sister.

505
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,760
Let me go.

506
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,680
I hate you.

507
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,480
You're so big.

508
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,440
I can't stand you.

509
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,440
Let me go.

510
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,480
Let me go.

511
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
You're so big.

512
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,120
I can't stand you.

513
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,760
Let me go.

514
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,280
Let me go.

515
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,560
What are you doing?

516
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,640
Dr. Lin.

517
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,520
Dr. Lin.

518
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,280
How is she?

519
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,920
You're Tan Qian Qian's family, right?

520
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,720
Yes.

521
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,160
The patient had a sudden bleeding

522
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,160
during the operation.

523
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,560
Meiniang tried to save her.

524
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,160
We're very sorry.

525
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,360
I'm sorry.

526
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
I'm sorry.

527
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,680
I'm sorry.

528
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I'm sorry.

529
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
I'm sorry.

531
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
I'm sorry.

532
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,480
I'm sorry.

533
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
I'm sorry.

534
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
I'm sorry.

535
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,440
How could this happen?

536
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,720
Let's go.

537
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,880
I'll give you some alcohol

538
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,200
to disinfect your wound.

539
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,440
Bear with it.

540
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,600
Bear with it.

541
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,360
Don't hide.

542
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,320
Okay.

543
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,800
It's a little embarrassing.

544
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
But it's just a scratch.

545
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,880
It'll be fine in a few days.

546
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,760
Sister.

547
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,360
It must be her fault that Mom hit you.

548
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,080
But Mom is also angry.

549
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,360
Just listen to me.

550
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,120
Don't be like this.

551
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,440
Just say sorry if you admit your mistake.

552
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,360
It's not that hard.

553
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,040
I'm not wrong.

554
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,240
Why should I admit my mistake?

555
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,120
Dad, Mom, Grandpa, Uncle, Uncle.

556
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,600
Everyone said you were wrong.

557
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,600
Did I do anything wrong

558
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,640
if they said I was wrong?

559
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
What if they did?

560
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,160
When we were kids,

561
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,920
they told us to be honest,

562
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,720
not to bully others,

563
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,920
not to lie.

564
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,480
But when Qiao Beiyu was bullied,

565
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,640
they lied.

566
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,080
I revealed the truth.

567
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,600
They said I was wrong.

568
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,880
What's right and what's wrong?

569
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,600
I don't know what's right and what's wrong.

570
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,840
But in the end,

571
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,920
Mom and Dad will never hurt you.

572
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,960
I haven't told you yet.

573
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,160
Mom almost got hit

574
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,280
by a car to find you.

575
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,520
If you didn't want to do good for you,

576
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,560
why would you risk your life to find you?

577
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,680
tremendely.

578
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,320
Don't go.

579
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,880
Since I didn't force myself,

580
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,200
theatre can compete with theater.

581
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,740
If I failed in it,

582
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,280
my mom Chinese team would cry the whole prepare.

583
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,120
Okay.

584
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:46,720
Just won't know it's my winter army but my 감사합니다.

585
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,440
I can understand it.

586
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,040
This medicine can't cure my illness.

587
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,440
If you have an illness, treat it.

588
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,440
Eat.

589
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:06,040
I have an illness. I have an illness, okay?

590
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,640
Are you okay now?

591
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,440
Do you need me to do something for you?

592
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,240
I'm fine.

593
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,040
One door is a big door, the other is a small one.

594
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm on a double insurance.

595
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,840
From now on, you call me Guo Shao.

596
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Jiu Jiu Shao.

597
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,240
I'm sorry.

598
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,640
I'm Qiao Qing Yu's mother.

599
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,840
Stay away from my daughter.

600
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,240
If you keep messing with her,

601
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,440
I can do anything to kill her.

602
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,840
I returned the clothes to the guy opposite you.

603
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,440
I also warned him.

604
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,440
If he keeps messing with you,

605
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,840
I'll go and order their house.

606
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:12,040
Give me the traffic card later.

607
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,440
From now on,

608
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,240
no matter if you go to school or not,

609
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,040
I'll pick you up and send you off.

610
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,640
You don't need to bring any money.

611
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,040
Just tell me what you need. I'll buy it for you.

612
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,840
I'll pay you back every month.

613
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Don't worry about anything else.

614
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,240
Just study.

615
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,840
And think about it.

616
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,040
Don't tell anyone about what happened between you and that guy.

617
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,840
Including your good friend.

618
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,040
Do you understand?

619
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
If he keeps messing with you,

620
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,040
tell me immediately.

621
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:52,040
No matter what happens, don't keep it from me.

622
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,040
I don't care if you want to or not.

623
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I just want to care about you.

624
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,440
I don't want anything from your father.

625
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,440
I just want you to go to college safely.

626
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
After you go to college, I won't care about you.

627
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
I don't care about you.

628
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,440
I'll go feed the birds.

629
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,040
Can't you just eat and not be distracted?

630
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,440
You can't even control yourself. What bird are you going to control?

631
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,040
Let go of the bird.

632
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,840
It's injured. If I let it go now, it'll die.

633
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,040
Once it's fully recovered, I'll let it go.

634
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,040
It won't affect the study.

635
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
What's wrong with his face?

636
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,040
The person on the top is him.

637
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
You're famous.

638
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
You're a celebrity now.

639
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,440
Don't mention it. My mom is chasing after you every day.

640
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,440
She's more active than my idol.

641
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,040
When they hugged each other, my mom cried so much.

642
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,040
Do you know why she left?

643
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
You don't even watch TV?

644
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,440
I just don't watch it.

645
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,640
People shouldn't be too ambitious.

646
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,640
I didn't think Qiao Qing Yu is so capable.

647
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:37,040
Didn't you say you can't tell when you see people?

648
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,040
I didn't.

649
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I said I can't tell when I see people.

650
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,640
You're really not easy.

651
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,240
It's the last class. Stop talking nonsense.

652
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,440
Stop talking nonsense. It's the last class.

653
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,440
Teacher Sun.

654
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,240
I didn't understand much of this question.

655
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Tell me more.

656
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,240
This question is about the weight of the sodium bicarbonate.

657
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,440
The key to solving this question is that the B-part and the sodium bicarbonate

658
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,240
produce sodium bicarbonate.

659
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,440
The white part is non-soluble and non-soluble.

660
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,840
We can give it a weight by filtering and drying.

661
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,440
I understand.

662
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,240
Qing Yu, come out with me.

663
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:45,040
Qing Yu, I saw the famous news a while ago.

664
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,440
I don't know the details of the incident, but I believe you have a reason.

665
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,640
When I was your age, I also panicked.

666
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,040
My whole youth period was a journey for my parents.

667
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
What happened afterwards?

668
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,840
Afterwards...

669
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,440
Afterwards, I was like every child.

670
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,840
When I grew up, they also got older.

671
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,440
So I'm saying this to tell you that

672
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:14,440
it's normal to have your own thoughts in your youth period, but you have to have a degree.

673
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,240
If you still believe me and think there's a place I can help you,

674
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,040
just tell me. Don't treat me as a teacher. Just treat me as a friend.

675
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,640
Actually, I understand your situation at school.

676
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,840
The school has established an effective mechanism to control the school's bullying.

677
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,840
It also announced the phone number of the vice principal of the law school that is in charge of security.

678
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,040
If there's any problem, you must ask the school for help.

679
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,040
If you need help, the school has a teacher who will help you.

680
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,440
Don't always keep it in your heart. You can do it alone.
