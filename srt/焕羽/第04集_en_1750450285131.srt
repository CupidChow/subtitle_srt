00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your uncle asked me to come and have a look.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He just wanted to rest assured.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He was afraid that he would use his illness to escape from the trouble.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Oh, right.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I will tell your uncle later.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let him help you look after your health.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't let him get too excited.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Auntie Xiao Zheng, you are the health worker at the village health center?

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, it's been more than twenty years.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I know who has a big and small disaster in this village.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then do you know about Qiao Beiyu?

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I must have heard that everyone talks about it.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But I don't know if she has the disease or not.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There is something I remember very clearly.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
When Beiyu came back from Huanye after the winter vacation,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
she came to the clinic for a miscarriage.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She came to the clinic.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Not long after, your mother came too.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Your Majesty.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mom.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Mom.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Mom.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A young girl in her twenties was miscarried.

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Last night, the health workers didn't tell anyone about it.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
She didn't go out and made a mess.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
This little girl, too.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She was so young and had such a big loss.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
She couldn't remember anything.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Luckily, she broke the jar and the water.

49
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Do you know who that person is?

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't know who that person is.

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
But based on her life style,

52
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
she is a wolf.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She doesn't blame anyone.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm going.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
If you have nothing to do today, come to the hospital and wait for me to get off work.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Let's have a meal together.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What a coincidence.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Today, I had a big surgery and was temporarily discharged.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can take a few hours off.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We can have a meal together.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Do you remember what I like to eat?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You've always liked pizza.

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There's a new restaurant at the door of the hospital.

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We can go there and try it.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I liked pizza when I was a kid.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
But that was before I was six or seven years old.

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm seventeen now.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I stopped eating pizza since my mom left.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's you who made me feel like I was a child.

70
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You made me leave my mom since I was a kid.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You didn't even tell me when my grandpa passed away.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You have to prepare for the midterm soon.

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm afraid it will affect your studies.

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is the midterm important?

75
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is the biology competition important?

76
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is the relationship between my mom and my grandpa important?

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This is all in the past. Why are you still bringing it up?

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's go eat.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I tried to understand you.

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But you never changed.

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You can leave now.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You only care about your patients and your surgery.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What about Sheng and me?

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Have you ever cared about us?

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I can see the sacrifice you made.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Can you understand me?

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I understood you and I understand you.

88
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What about you?

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sheng needs a father who can grow up with him.

90
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't want to apologize.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Every time you can be called away by the phone.

93
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Every time!

94
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Why do you always make me and Sheng sacrifice

95
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
to help you become a good doctor?

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I've had enough of this life.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mom, don't go!

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Mom!

99
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mom!

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll hold you.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay.

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Slowly.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You...

105
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Slowly.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Stand still.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hold me.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's okay. Stand still.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Sheng, listen.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Listen to what?

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The wind blows through the leaves.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And the birds sing.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sheng, look.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
There's a bird.

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The sound of the river and the flowers.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Did you hear that?

118
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
When you're in a bad mood,

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
listen to the sounds of nature.

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They're all magic.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
As you listen,

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you'll feel calm.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You'll forget about those annoying things.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Okay?

125
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Try it.

126
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll play the phone.

127
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll play the phone.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hey, is this Mingsheng?

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hello.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I want to talk to my mom.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Anna is at the studio now.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
If you need anything,

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
just let me know.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Never mind.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you doing here?

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why are you here?

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You can't see me

139
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm here

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Why should I?

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Go away

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What are you doing?

143
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Are you out of your mind?

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Go away

145
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm not leaving

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not leaving

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not leaving

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm not leaving

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not leaving

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:55,040
,

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,420
I heard about that then,

152
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,760
,

153
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,920
,

154
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,700
,

155
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,200
,

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,520
The

157
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,600
Didn't you lose your job?

158
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,040
Mom, I can't lift my legs.

159
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,640
I have to hide at home tomorrow.

160
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,760
Brother.

161
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,960
Brother, drink some water.

162
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,680
I don't want to drink.

163
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Give me a glass of water.

164
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,480
I want some too.

165
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,480
You're back.

166
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,400
What time is it now?

167
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,760
I'm going to the library.

168
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,760
It's not that late.

169
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
What time is it now?

170
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,320
I forgot to pay attention to the time.

171
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,680
It's good that you love reading.

172
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,760
I heard that

173
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,880
all the students in Huanzhou Middle School can get a good grade.

174
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,760
You can just wait and enjoy the time.

175
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,680
I'm going back to my room.

176
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
I'm going back too.

177
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm serious with you.

178
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,880
What time is it now?

179
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,160
It's so dark.

180
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,560
What if you run into bad people on the way?

181
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,880
Girls don't go home at this time.

182
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
You're always so anxious.

183
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,400
I know.

184
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,720
I'll pay attention next time.

185
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,040
You must remember that.

186
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
Didn't she say that

187
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
she's late reading?

188
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
It's not her intention.

189
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Go back to sleep.

190
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,800
Wait.

191
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,520
Why don't you go to work?

192
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,040
She's the only one who wants to be alone.

193
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm going to the library too.

194
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,880
What are you going to do?

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,800
Read.

196
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,080
You're going to play games, right?

197
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
You're biased.

198
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Xiaoyu.

199
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,080
I finally know

200
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,880
why my parents didn't marry Qiao Beiyu.

201
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Why?

202
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,800
Because those rumors are the truth.

203
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,520
You mean

204
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
she's not the one who did it?

205
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,600
You mean she's the one who died because of love?

206
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,200
I didn't want to admit it before.

207
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,560
But I also think

208
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,400
Qiao Beiyu's death

209
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
is questionable.

210
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,880
Because only she's really sick.

211
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,960
Parents, friends,

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,280
and family's reaction are logical.

213
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,400
But because my parents kept denying it,

214
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,560
I thought

215
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,360
her death was another reason.

216
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,480
I've been trying to clarify it.

217
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,920
It's all in vain.

218
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,080
What evidence did you find?

219
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,280
She left a medical record in the hospital.

220
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,840
She really got sick

221
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,240
like everyone else.

222
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,400
Our family suffered.

223
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
We have to keep going.

224
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
So those rumors are true.

225
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,880
And she had an abortion in Nan Qiao Village.

226
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Really?

227
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
How did you know?

228
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,680
I met Xiu Zhengu today.

229
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
He told me.

230
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,280
Could it be

231
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,040
that he was the one who killed her?

232
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Don't talk nonsense if you don't have evidence.

233
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,520
I have to find out

234
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
who this person is.

235
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,440
Mo Mo.

236
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
Do me a favor.

237
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,720
Give this to Ming Sheng.

238
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,760
But don't tell her

239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,760
that I asked you to give it to her.

240
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,960
Don't worry.

241
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,760
Okay. Thank you.

242
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,760
Goodbye.

243
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Good shot.

244
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,240
Turn the ball.

245
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Come on.

246
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Look.

247
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,440
So cool.

248
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,840
So cool.

249
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,840
I want to be a computer table.

250
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Ansheng.

251
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,320
You guys play first.

252
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,640
Take a break.

253
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Take a break.

254
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
How did they know each other?

255
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,440
The smell of jealousy.

256
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,160
What smell?

257
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
Sweet and sour.

258
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,240
It's delicious.

259
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,640
Is Mo Mo so pretty?

260
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
Or is she a genius?

261
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,640
What are they talking about?

262
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,040
Compared to her,

263
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,640
we are the same type.

264
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,640
You are the same type.

265
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,640
I'm not.

266
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,640
I have a special news.

267
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,640
Do you want to hear it?

268
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
What?

269
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Tell me.

270
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
I'll buy you a week's worth of yogurt.

271
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
It's said that

272
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Mingsheng and Wang Mo Mo

273
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,120
grew up together

274
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
in the open-air pants.

275
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
You know what?

276
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
The relationship between the three of them

277
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
is like a brotherhood.

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
The relationship between the three of them?

279
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
They are three men.

280
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
And they are women.

281
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Bro,

282
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
metaphor.

283
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Paraphrase.

284
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
That's enough.

285
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,120
I'm sorry.

286
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Here.

287
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Did you wait for a long time?

288
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
No, I just arrived.

289
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
It's okay. Don't worry.

290
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
I bought you a cup of milk tea.

291
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Thank you.

292
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
By the way,

293
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
I don't understand this question.

294
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
What do you think?

295
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,120
How do you see

296
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
Shan Yi's lies?

297
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,120
Lies are lies.

298
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Lies are lies.

299
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Even if you use Shan Yi to correct it,

300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
it can't change its essence.

301
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,600
But Shan Yi's lies

302
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,600
are for your own good.

303
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
It's all for your own good.

304
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
It's for your own good.

305
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,600
But it's even more harmful.

306
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Is the truth

307
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,600
really that important to you?

308
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
I've thought about it.

309
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Maybe the truth is cruel.

310
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,080
You can't accept me.

311
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
I can.

312
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,080
And I can bear all the consequences.

313
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Everyone is different.

314
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
There's another one.

315
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,080
The world is full of flowers.

316
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,080
The world is full of wind.

317
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
The world is full of clouds.

318
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,080
Yao Qingyun.

319
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,080
Come on.

320
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,080
Come home with me.

321
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Hello, auntie.

322
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
I don't care who you are.

323
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
Stay away from her.

324
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
Let's go.

325
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Auntie.

326
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Auntie.

327
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Qingyun.

328
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,560
It's delicious.

329
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,560
Here.

330
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Your favorite sweet and sour sauce.

331
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
Actually, I'm not good at cooking.

332
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
Grandpa taught me.

333
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm not good at cooking.

334
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,560
I'm not good at cooking.

335
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm not good at cooking.

336
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,560
I'm not good at cooking.

337
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I'm not good at cooking.

338
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I'm not good at cooking.

339
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
I'm not good at cooking.

340
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

341
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
When grandpa is here,

342
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,040
he will definitely take care of us.

343
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
When I was a kid,

344
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
he often took me to buy mooncakes.

345
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
He would make mooncakes with egg yolk filling.

346
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
He knew which one looked the best.

347
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,040
But now,

348
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
he's not here.

349
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Grandpa is not here. I'm still here.

350
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,040
This is from a friend of mine.

351
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
You like to play.

352
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I brought it to pick up the gift.

353
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
It's really delicious.

354
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Your friend

356
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
is Mingqiu Xin, right?

357
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,040
Uncle Ming's food

358
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,040
always tastes like a disinfectant.

359
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
You and Uncle Ming are still so close.

360
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Grandpa was already in a high-risk condition.

361
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
He was only able to hold his breath

362
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
and maintain his vitality.

363
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Uncle Ming is the best surgeon in the province.

364
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Although he has given up on treatment,

365
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
I believe that

366
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
he made the best choice for Grandpa.

367
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
This is a good thing.

368
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
I'm not saying that it's a bad thing.

369
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I know he's a good surgeon.

370
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But I hate him.

371
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Why do I hate him?

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because he didn't have the right to choose for Grandpa.

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He made a death sentence for Grandpa without permission.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I...

375
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't even have the right to know.

376
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Maybe he thinks that

377
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
he's good to Grandpa and you.

378
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
He's just being himself.

379
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
He thinks he's good to me,

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
but he's not really good to me.

381
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
He's just being himself.

382
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Take this to him.

383
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I won't accept his false accusation.

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
One day,

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll leave this house

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and beg him to let me go.

387
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Didn't you go to the library to read?

388
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
I did.

389
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
I ran into Ma Ming Kai at the library.

390
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Ran into?

391
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Why so coincidental?

392
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
I've been thinking that you've been acting weird lately.

393
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Were you with him last night?

394
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
No.

395
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Qingyu, you're still denying it?

396
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I asked the people in the library.

397
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
You weren't there last night.

398
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
I was with him.

399
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
It's not what Mom thinks.

400
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
Qiao Qingyu, listen to me.

401
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,480
What you're saying now

402
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,480
is exactly what Qiao Beiyu said to me.

403
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,960
You're the same as me.

404
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Learning is important.

405
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Your reputation is more important.

406
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,960
At this age,

407
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
there are so many girls out there.

408
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,960
You can't make a single mistake.

409
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
You can make up for it by learning.

410
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,960
What if your reputation is bad?

411
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,960
You can't even wash it clean.

412
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
You'll have to wear it forever.

413
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Your sister is the best example.

414
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
She's gone and you're still telling her to go.

415
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
Don't you know that?

416
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,440
You're going to be the same as her.

417
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
From tomorrow on,

418
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
you're not allowed to be with Nan Sheng alone.

419
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
No matter what the situation is,

420
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
do you understand?

421
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Or I'll let your brother watch you.

422
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
You can go wherever you want.

423
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
I'm sorry.

424
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Sister, why are you sitting here?

425
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
Xiaobei.

426
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Come here.

427
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Come here.

428
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,440
Come here.

429
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Xiaobei, hurry up.

430
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Where are we going?

431
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Let's go.

432
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,440
Let's go look for your parents.

433
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
Where are we going?

434
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
My name is Wenqiu.

435
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Wenqiu.

436
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,920
My name is Wenqiu.

437
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,920
Wenqiu.

438
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,920
Wenqiu.

439
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Wenqiu.

440
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,920
Come here.

441
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Hurry up.

442
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,920
Why are you running?

443
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Where are you running?

444
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Let's go.

445
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Wenqiu, don't run.

446
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,920
Let's go home and eat.

447
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,920
I don't care.

448
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
No.

449
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Let me go.

450
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,400
Let's go home and eat.

451
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Let's go.

452
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Let's go.

453
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
Should we ask Uncle Wenqiu and the others to come with us?

454
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
They just took you away.

455
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
Let's go.

456
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Don't worry about food.

457
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Don't cry.

458
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
Let's eat.

459
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,880
I can't keep an eye on you.

460
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I can't do it alone.

461
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,880
I can't do it alone.

462
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,880
I can't do it alone.

463
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
I feel sorry for you.

464
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
Your uncle's life is more difficult.

465
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,880
Taking care of people is the most tiring.

466
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,880
Especially this kind of illness.

467
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,880
We can't do anything at home.

468
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
Your uncle didn't take her to the hospital.

469
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,880
It's been a long time.

470
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,880
No one can stand it.

471
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Why are you crying?

472
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I work every day.

473
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I don't care.

474
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I have to find you everywhere.

475
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Don't cry.

476
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,360
Let's eat.

477
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
This is good.

478
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Can you let me save some money?

479
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Can you let me save some money?

480
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Can you?

481
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Let's go.

482
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,880
Let's leave here.

483
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,880
Go find your parents.

484
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,800
Above the clouds

485
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,040
The new day is here

486
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:47,940
Interesting

487
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
Jin Yuan

488
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
What are you doing?

489
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
Get up.

490
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,360
What's wrong with you?

491
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,400
Why are you running around in the middle of the night?

492
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
You're dragging me down.

493
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
I'm dragging you down to be bold.

494
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,440
I...

495
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,240
I...

496
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
I'm not bold.

497
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,000
Are you a man or not?

498
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,040
Hold this.

499
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,680
It's raining.

500
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,280
You won't get scared later, right?

501
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
I...

502
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,200
This is the tomb of the rain.

503
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
What's wrong?

504
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,680
I didn't expect someone in Nan Qiao Village to remember him.

505
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Don't you hate him?

506
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,280
Why are you running around in the middle of the night to burn his fingers?

507
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,360
I do hate him.

508
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,760
But I also care about him.

509
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
You're so precious in this photo.

510
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,440
Take it with you.

511
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,080
When the rain was falling,

512
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
my parents didn't let us come.

513
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
He was so beautiful when he was alive.

514
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:30,360
I didn't expect that he would be buried in such a cold place.

515
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Sister, is that our house?

516
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,960
It's on fire.

517
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,360
I heard that it was on fire last night.

518
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,360
Let's go and have a look.

519
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Let's go.

520
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
What's going on?

521
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
What's going on?

522
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
What's going on?

523
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,360
Which room is on fire?

524
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,360
There's a room on fire.

525
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
What room?

526
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,360
What's going on?

527
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,360
It's so windy.

528
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
It's really not on fire.

529
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
It's not on fire.

530
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Old Qiao,

531
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,960
you said that it was on fire last night.

532
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,960
What's going on?

533
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
I heard that Xiao Qin smoked last night.

534
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
The smoke didn't go away.

535
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
He lit it.

536
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
It's the wind.

537
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,560
I'm glad I found it earlier.

538
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Look at this.

539
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,560
It's on fire.

540
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,560
It's on fire.

541
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,560
It's too dangerous.

542
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Old Qiao, are you okay?

543
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,560
I'm fine.

544
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
My second brother is in the hospital.

545
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
The things are on fire.

546
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
He's not a good person.

547
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,560
He's not good at keeping things.

548
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Do you need our help?

549
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,560
No, no.

550
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
You guys can leave.

551
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Stop looking.

552
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
Stop looking.

553
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Stop looking.

554
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,560
Go back.

555
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Stop looking.

556
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Let's go.

557
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
It's not good.

558
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Let's go.

559
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Let's go.

560
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Let's go.

561
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,560
I fell in love with him.

562
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,560
He wanted me for the first time.

563
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,560
I loved him.

564
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,560
He was the only one I could rely on in Nan Qiao Village.

565
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Dad, mom, or do you think we should move to the old house?

566
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
We can save up the money.

567
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
I'll think of something.

568
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Mom.

569
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
Mom.

570
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
It's going to rain.

571
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Mom.

572
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
Mom.

573
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Mom.

574
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,560
Mom.

575
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Mom.

576
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,560
Mom.

577
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
Mom.

578
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Mom.

579
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Mom.

580
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Mom.

581
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Mom.

582
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Mom.

583
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,560
You looked like a bird just now.

584
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
You look taller now.

585
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
I was this tall last year.

586
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Let's go. It's going to rain.

587
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
Why was it so snowy last night?

588
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,560
Oh, my.

589
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,560
Hey, hey.

590
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Watch out.

591
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
There's a lot of snow.

592
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Are you watching?

593
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
I'm looking for you.

594
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
I'm looking for you.

595
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
I'm looking for you.

596
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Turn around. Don't look.

597
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,560
Good. Next.

598
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Good. Next.

599
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
Did you see my shoes?

600
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
No.

601
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Did you see my shoes?

602
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
No.

603
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Did anyone see Qiao Qingyu's shoes?

604
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Did Qiao Qingyu's shoes go missing?

605
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Quiet.

606
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,560
Who saw Qiao Qingyu's shoes?

607
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Take them out.

608
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Guys, after the 11th long vacation,

609
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,560
we have a class for literature and science in the second year of high school.

610
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Only a few of you went to the literature and science class.

611
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,560
The rest of you will be in the new science and science class.

612
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Good.

613
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Okay, guys.

614
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Since we're in the class,

615
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,560
it means we're getting closer to the college entrance exam.

616
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I don't want you to feel at ease when you're working hard.

617
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Speaking of which, I can't be free from the school.

618
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
I have to say this.

619
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
College entrance exams are the best.

620
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
The soldiers' battlefield is in the field.

621
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,560
The workers' battlefield is in the factory.

622
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Where is our classmate's battlefield?

623
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,560
In the factory.

624
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Okay, okay. I know you're tired of listening.

625
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,560
I hope you'll be like when you were holding the grades at the end of the semester.

626
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,560
I'll emphasize again.

627
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Pay attention to the exam.

628
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,560
Don't be late.

629
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,560
The principal is watching you after class.

630
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,560
Do you hear me?

631
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Yes.

632
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,560
Go home after school.

633
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,560
Thank you, teacher.

634
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
Ah Xiang.

635
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Ah Xiang, let's go.

636
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Let's go.

637
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Okay.

638
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
We'll go to the battlefield first.

639
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Are you ready?

640
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Wait a minute.

641
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Let's go.

642
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,560
You're so young.

643
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I'm not young either.

644
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
It's still early.

645
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
Why don't we go outside?

646
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
Let's go.

647
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Help me throw it away.

648
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,560
It's hot.

649
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,560
Let's go.

650
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
Let's go.

651
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,560
Ah Xiang, we've been waiting for you for a long time.

652
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
What are you looking at?

653
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
Nothing.

654
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Are you following Qiao Qingyu?

655
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Why should I follow him? I'm sick.

656
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
Let's go play.

657
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
No.

658
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
Why?

659
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
I have something to do.

660
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Let's go.

661
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Why are Qiao Qingyu's shoes the same as Sheng's?

662
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Aren't those Sheng's shoes?

663
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
Let's go play.

664
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
Go.

665
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,560
I know. I have to go back to the store right away.

666
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Okay, tell him to come back in 20 minutes.

667
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
I promise.

668
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,560
Wait.

669
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
Whose shoes are these?

670
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
Where are your shoes?

671
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,560
I lost them.

672
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,560
I picked them up from the trash can and they were someone else's.

673
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,560
You're an adult.

674
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,560
How could you lose your shoes?

675
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Where did you drag them?

676
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Besides, these shoes are fine.

677
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Why would someone throw them away?

678
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Qiao Qingyu,

679
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,560
you can't pick up these shoes.

680
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Unless someone wants you to wear them.

681
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,560
What's going on?

682
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Why do you have to wear men's shoes instead of your own shoes?

683
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
That's the way it is.

684
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
I lost my shoes.

685
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
And then,

686
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,560
a nice guy

687
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,560
threw a pair of new shoes and you picked them up?

688
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
You don't even know how to play the game.

689
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,560
You're a girl.

690
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,560
How could you wear a pair of men's shoes?

691
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
How could you be so casual?

692
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,560
What's going on?

693
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Tell me.

694
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
You're back.

695
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,560
Mom,

696
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,560
I was really bullied at school.

697
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,560
I don't know why,

698
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,560
but Qiao Beiyu

699
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,560
was dragged out again.

700
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,560
The news was so bad.

701
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,560
Not only my sister,

702
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,560
but also my schoolmate,

703
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,560
was also dragged out.

704
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
Qingyu,

705
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
I was a little anxious.

706
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
I know you suffered in school.

707
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,560
But why didn't you tell me?

708
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
You've been so shy since you came back from Nanjing.

709
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,560
I didn't hear you say a word.

710
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
I'm not a bug in your stomach.

711
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:09,560
I've been so busy all day long.

712
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,560
You have to tell me if you need anything.

713
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Qingyu,

714
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
we came to school

715
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
with such a great effort.

716
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
It's to get into a good university

717
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,560
and have a good future.

718
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
At this time,

719
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,560
we have to be patient.

720
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,560
We have to be a good person.

721
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,560
There are things that can't be explained.

722
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,560
The more you explain, the darker it gets.

723
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,560
No matter how bad others say,

724
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,560
you have to be patient.

725
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,560
As time goes by,

726
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
you'll forget it.

727
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
I really have to go.

728
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
The food is ready in the pot.

729
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
I have to go back to the store.

730
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,560
I'll go.

731
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
If I hadn't told you the truth,

732
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,560
you would have been scolded.

733
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,560
What did Mom tell you?

734
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,560
Nothing.

735
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,560
I saw her talking to you for a long time.

736
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:24,560
She's always like this.

737
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,560
She tells me to tell her everything.

738
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,560
She's very strong.

739
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,560
She does everything she wants.

740
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,560
I don't think she wants to hear me.

741
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,560
Maybe that's what adults do.

742
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Actually,

743
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,560
it's okay if you've heard bad things.

744
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,560
Everyone says that Qiao Beiyu is bad.

745
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,560
They say bad things about her.

746
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
But has anyone ever thought about

747
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,560
what Qiao Beiyu went through before she died?

748
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,560
What did she go through before she died?

749
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
She was the one who caused her miscarriage.

750
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
She was responsible for her death.

751
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
But even if she was found,

752
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,560
she can't be reborn.

753
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,560
That's not the only thing.

754
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Qiao Beiyu is so beautiful.

755
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,560
She has a lot of boyfriends.

756
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,560
I've seen a few of them.

757
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
But who could be the boyfriend

758
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,560
of this Nan Qiao Village?

759
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
What?

760
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,560
What kind of candy is this?

761
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,560
Be careful.

762
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:31,560
Remember our distance.

763
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:38,560
One step closer.

764
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,560
The future

765
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
The future

766
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,560
The future will open the mystery

767
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Waiting is the reason for the sound

768
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,560
But it will never be over

769
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:18,560
So my heart is your name

770
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:24,560
The only stubbornness in my heart

771
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,560
From the first glance

772
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,560
Describe the future

773
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,560
The dream starts to come true

774
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,560
So your heart

775
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,560
Has a place

776
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:52,560
Hiding the same story

777
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,560
Fortunately, you're not mature enough

778
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,560
You don't have the courage to come

779
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,560
So let time

780
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,560
Protect each other
