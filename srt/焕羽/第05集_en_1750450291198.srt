1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Top line, a guiding light Just like you, makes light to pray

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Breaking free from darkness You gave me strength

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In a moment of truth I find my pain

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Drawing on the hope that you render me

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In this long journey, in my realm, I will ride me

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:35,000
In this long journey, in my realm, I will ride me

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:48,000
The full version is available on the official website

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
53.2 yuan

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
78.7 yuan

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
79.5 yuan

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
How much?

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
No?

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The road is blocked.

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The express train is on.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We have to stay here for a few days.

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I heard that their meals and meat are all fast-paced.

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
They can't turn around and eat.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't understand.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think they have a lot of money in the school.

21
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
We should take care of the school and the residential building.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We should send them.

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes.

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll be tired in a few days.

25
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When the school is over, we can go to the university.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It will be better.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The parents can bring some fruits and healthy food.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We will bring some fruits and healthy food.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll eat them.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll go to the gym to have a family meeting.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'll go to the gym to have a family meeting.

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll go to the gym to have a family meeting.

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I hope so.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm hungry.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Qiao Li.

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to find Qiao Bei Yu's boyfriend in Nan Qiao Village.

37
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I know what she did to Bei Yu.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do you want?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You have to help me.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's not good.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What should I do?

42
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Mom will not let me go.

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You have to listen to me.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why?

45
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm your sister.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Qiao Bei Yu is our sister.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't worry.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Even if something happens, I won't drag you down.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How do I feel that you are not like you?

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Clean it up.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No.

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I didn't do it.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Qiao Jing Yu.

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't talk to us.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Sheng is my brother.

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I'm just trying to make Sheng.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What are you doing?

59
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Qiao Jing Yu.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Qiao Jing Yu.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What are you doing?

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sheng, how can I clean it up?

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What's wrong?

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Nothing.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Actually, there is something.

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I put the garbage in the bag of the famous sage.

67
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But they bullied me first.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The character of the famous sage will not let me go.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm not afraid of him.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I've been prepared long ago.

71
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
But I'm a little nervous.

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Am I a little nervous?

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You have a lot of ideas.

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sheng is not the kind of person you think.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You know the lady too?

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not only do I know her.

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
We grew up together.

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let me tell you.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
When I was a kid,

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
the most favorite group of couples

81
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
took the cat room.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Sheng's first class

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
was also carved for me when I was fighting.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sheng was greedy.

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
But he had the sense of justice.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He was so righteous.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't think he is not funny.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Actually, he is kind.

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He is very kind.

90
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Sometimes,

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
he is quite childish.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Next one.

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Ji Huo.

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We have learned

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
how to kick the leg in the field.

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We will practice in the water today.

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let's do three rounds.

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Listen to the sound.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go.

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
First round.

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Kick the leg.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Qiao Qiaoyu.

103
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Focus on the strength.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Kick the leg.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Kick it clean.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's mainly some dust.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's still very good.

108
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then, do I have to thank you?

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
To get the dust in Qiao Qiaoyu's bag?

110
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
No need.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Your joke is a bit too much.

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's a small matter to wipe the bag.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't bully Qiao Qiaoyu.

114
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You used to spread the dust

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
of Qiao Beiyu's things.

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You made me misunderstand Qiao Qiaoyu.

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I even got you into trouble.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am not a good person.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I even got you into trouble.

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What's your problem?

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I heard from a schoolmate

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
about Qiao Beiyu's things.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then,

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
he spread the gossip

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to our school.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't expect

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
he thought it was you.

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You spread the gossip.

129
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sheng,

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
don't be so serious.

131
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm done with the guy

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
who's a beauty in the school.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
That's not it.

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't talk nonsense.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You're still talking.

136
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's all my fault.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's all my fault.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's all my fault.

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's all my fault.

140
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's all my fault.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's all my fault.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's all my fault.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll leave you alone.

144
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Thank you, Sheng.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll give you a toast.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry for the noise.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You're the best.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I think you should just

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
give it back to your mom.

152
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She's still in her heart.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sheng is a good girl.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But she's very positive.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
She's very positive.

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's all my fault.

158
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's all my fault.

159
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Throw it away.

160
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll leave you alone.

161
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Don't look at her

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
as if she's not funny enough.

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
She's kind.

164
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
She's very kind.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Find a new clothes for your friend.

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't catch a cold.

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A restaurant

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A restaurant

170
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
A restaurant

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
No.

173
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
A restaurant

174
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
No.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
A restaurant

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
A restaurant

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
A restaurant

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A restaurant

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
No.

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The shop will be closed this month.

184
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Only 5,000 yuan left.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
One more address.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Put the rent,

187
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
water and the house

188
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and the two children's expenses

189
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
away.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's less than 1200 yuan.

191
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
I mean...

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How much should we give him?

193
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
He's going to build an old house.

194
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How about you talk to him?

195
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let him help us with the shop.

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
We'll pay back the spring.

197
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yes, that's not right.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Wang called you. You didn't answer, did you?

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
He called me.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
His son is getting married.

201
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We have a day to sign the contract.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
We should pay back.

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll pay back the rest of the money.

204
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No.

205
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Look.

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It should be three sons' house for the old man.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The second brother is in this situation.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can't get him.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So I mean...

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What do you think?

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's give him 1200 yuan on this account.

212
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We don't eat or drink.

213
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
That's not what I mean.

214
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I mean...

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
How much should we give him?

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
My father has been taking care of him.

217
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He's going to build a house.

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He's going to build a house.

219
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He's been taking care of people.

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
He's going to build a house.

221
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He's going to build a house.

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He has to do something for the old man.

223
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What happened to the old man?

224
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We should be bullied.

225
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
They're good people.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
We're all bad people.

227
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
We should be killed by them.

228
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I...

229
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I didn't mean that.

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Why are you so anxious?

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
You're not anxious.

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know what?

233
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You know what?

234
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's a lot of good people.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I...

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Chen.

237
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Mr. Chen.

238
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Do you have a gift for me?

239
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Yes.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Mr. Chen,

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
you're here.

242
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I want to talk to you.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Every time we come here,

244
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
we don't dance or sing.

245
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Can we have another two or three?

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Sometimes, we can have two or two.

247
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's not good.

248
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Do you want it or not?

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I want it.

250
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I want it.

251
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Before Mr. Zhao Zixi comes,

252
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
please copy this poem with me.

253
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's go.

254
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Take it easy.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'll find it hard.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I was going to throw this shoe away.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But it looks like

258
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
someone put it in a white bag.

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll just let it shine.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'll wear it for a few more days.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Keep writing for me during this semester.

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I want to take the exam for TEF.

263
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't have any time.

264
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But don't misunderstand.

265
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm not going to use the kindness

266
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I've applied for you.

267
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
After all, writing is not the same as writing.

268
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's hard to be the same.

269
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I can write for you.

270
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
But I need something to be taught.

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's not hard for you.

272
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Come out and listen.

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
First, borrow me your phone for a few days.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Second, have you found the letter?

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Give it back to me.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I can give you the phone.

277
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Where's the letter?

278
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I forgot to bring it.

279
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll go back and find it.

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Study hard.

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're the real girl.

282
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Sheng.

283
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Sheng.

284
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I have something to do.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I can't figure it out.

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Help me analyze it.

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What is it?

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have a friend.

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A man.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He likes to hide the letter

291
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
from other girls.

292
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Do you think he's a little sick?

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't think he's hiding it from others.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He's hiding it from a girl.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Right.

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's not a problem.

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He likes her.

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Who likes who?

299
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
The guy who hid the letter.

300
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The girl who likes him.

301
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Nonsense.

302
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I mean

303
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I know this guy.

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
He can't...

305
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Sometimes,

306
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in order to not need self-esteem,

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
people say that they're not good at self-esteem.

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
They even deceive others

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
by deceiving themselves.

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's called a fake.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Who is that guy

312
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
who said so much?

313
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
No one.

314
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
It's the sister Qin

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I saw in a TV show yesterday.

316
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
When did you watch TV shows?

317
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
My face is red.

318
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Me?

319
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
My face is red?

320
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The weather is too hot today.

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
My face is red.

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's normal.

323
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The sun is so big.

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you too tired

325
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
to do the stage surgery today?

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I'm tired.

327
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
There's a patient

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
who's having a surgery today.

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I took the operation out of the accident.

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The blood

331
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
was accidentally entered into the eyes.

332
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I saw your previous report.

333
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The blood pressure on the surface is 100.

334
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You also injected the blood pressure on the medical ball.

335
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
There should be no problem.

336
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Don't worry.

337
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I heard that

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the development department

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
opened a amusement park.

340
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
We'll have a rest tomorrow.

341
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
How about taking Ah Shen

342
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and having fun?

343
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm tired.

344
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Okay, I got it.

345
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'll inform you right away.

346
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The driver who got the car

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
suddenly got into a deep coma

348
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and was unable to make a decision.

349
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
So,

350
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
we must do the surgery

351
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
right away tonight.

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Director Li,

353
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'll inform your team right away.

354
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The second room is open.

355
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The first operation is to be performed tonight.

356
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Yes.

357
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'll be there right away.

358
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Okay, thank you.

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Have some tea first.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You've cured so many patients.

361
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Your pulse is getting worse.

362
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh, right.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Ah Shen is now trying to betray your wife.

364
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
She's very close to me.

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm worried that if we're

366
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
sharing our relationship now,

367
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
her mood will get worse.

368
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
So, I'm thinking

369
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
if we can wait until

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
she's done with the surgery,

371
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'll make up for her relationship with him.

372
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Ah Shen will understand

373
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
what I've been saying.

374
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'll go arrange for the surgery.

375
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Okay.

376
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Mom,

378
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
our teacher said that

379
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
she was wrong about my learning information

380
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
when she was starting the school.

381
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
She asked me to get the back-to-school

382
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
and re-college the school.

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
So rude.

384
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll get it for you tomorrow morning.

385
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
No, mom.

386
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Just get it for me now.

387
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What if we forget it in the morning?

388
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Our teacher has been urging me

389
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
for several times.

390
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I haven't thought about it for a few days.

391
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay, okay.

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll get it for you now.

393
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll listen to you.

394
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Okay.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll go get it for you.

396
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't know what that little head of yours

397
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
wants to eat.

398
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What's wrong?

399
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
What's wrong?

400
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Mom.

401
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
His hand is hot.

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll get it myself.

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm not sure.

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
He can't even do this.

405
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
His hand is hot.

406
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Hurry up.

407
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Let's go get the stuff.

408
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What should we do?

409
00:21:43,000 --> 00:22:05,560
I'll go

410
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:34,460
Zhang succes of Long日本

411
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm not sure.

412
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You're just taking this one, right?

413
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
How much work did I give you to make this medicine?

414
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
That's all. I almost passed it.

415
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Sister, I don't understand.

416
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You were going to investigate the death of Qiao Bei Yu before.

417
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Didn't you already find out?

418
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Qiao Bei Yu died in a sudden.

419
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Please. She died of illness.

420
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
She didn't kill herself.

421
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Could it be that she could find a murderer?

422
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Even if she was just a fool,

423
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
and she had a boyfriend who was missing,

424
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
she was already dead.

425
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
It's useless to be so stubborn.

426
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Just like what mom said,

427
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
we forget everything when we have time.

428
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
I've already said it.

429
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
I'll stop here.

430
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't want to be in this soup.

431
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If mom finds out,

432
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
we both will have nothing to eat.

433
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What are you doing?

434
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

435
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

436
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

437
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Is that you, Qiao Bei Yu?

438
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

439
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Even if I was alone,

440
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I would find out the truth for you.

441
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Not only for the living.

442
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
And for you.

443
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Mom.

444
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We always say that

445
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
when you start school,

446
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
you should fill out my academic information.

447
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Let me take the back-up notebook

448
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
and re-enact it at school.

449
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Mom.

450
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
I'll take the back-up notebook myself.

451
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

452
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

453
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

454
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

455
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

456
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

457
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

458
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

459
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

460
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

461
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

462
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Qiao Bei Yu.

463
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Who taught you this?

464
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Tell me.

465
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Qiao Jing Yu.

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Come in.

467
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Your brother has already told you

468
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
that the money is from my drawer.

469
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What's wrong with your phone?

470
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Where did it come from?

471
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I picked it up.

472
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Where did you pick it up?

473
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I picked it up at the school library last week.

474
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I picked it up at the school library last week.

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
It's still in your hands.

476
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Do you know where it is?

477
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wait.

478
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Ask. Don't touch it.

479
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
You're still protecting it?

480
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I don't care about it.

481
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I don't care about it.

482
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
It's in the police station.

483
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Let me ask you the last time.

484
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Where did you get this phone?

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Did you spend the money you bought yourself?

486
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
How much money did you spend?

487
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Who gave it to you?

488
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What's going on?

489
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I picked it up at school.

490
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You picked it up at school, right?

491
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay. I won't go to the store today.

492
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Let's go.

493
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'll go to school with you now.

494
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Let's go.

495
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Let's go to the school library.

496
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Okay.

497
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
How can you be so easy to pay?

498
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Don't you know how to make a fool out of yourself?

499
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Tell your mom.

500
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Your brother has no heart and no lungs.

501
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
He can be a thief today.

502
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
He won't do anything bad tomorrow.

503
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
And you.

504
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You're still so young.

505
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
You're so thoughtful.

506
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm calling him a thief.

507
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But I don't want to call him Fan Qian.

508
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I just want to know how Qiao Bei Yu died.

509
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
And...

510
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
And what?

511
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And who killed him.

512
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
No one killed him.

513
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Mom.

514
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I found this at the old house.

515
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Where did you find it?

516
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
The old house.

517
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I found it from the old house.

518
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The rest are gone.

519
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There are only a few left.

520
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Mom.

521
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Is Qiao Bei Yu's diary true?

522
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What can I do about it?

523
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I can't give it back.

524
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I didn't want to say a few words to him.

525
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
But I understand him now.

526
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I'm talking nonsense.

527
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I shouldn't listen to them.

528
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
But I don't dare to ask you.

529
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I went to the police station.

530
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I just want to know what happened.

531
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
No matter what happened to him.

532
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
He shouldn't have done it himself.

533
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I've grown up.

534
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'm not a kid anymore.

535
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You can tell me what happened at home.

536
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I can take the responsibility.

537
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Qiao Bei Yu didn't die of cancer.

538
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
The boy in the south village is the most vicious, right?

539
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Qiao Qing Yu.

540
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Qiao Bei Yu died of cancer.

541
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
How did you know about these stupid things?

542
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
The diary written by Yuan Ming Yuan is the one I know.

543
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
You're a good girl, right?

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Qiao Qing Yu, I'm telling you.

545
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I'll tell you what you need to know.

546
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You don't need to know about this.

547
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
You never want to know.

548
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You just need to take care of yourself.

549
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Look at yourself.

550
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You're so stubborn.

551
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You want to investigate me secretly.

552
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
And your phone.

553
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
What a coincidence.

554
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The new phone is in your hand.

555
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You picked it up.

556
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
You let it go.

557
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What's going on?

558
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Fine.

559
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You're not going to tell me, right?

560
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I'll find out when I get to school.

561
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Qiao Qing Yu, I'm your mother.

562
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I'll take care of you all day.

563
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Qing Yu, you've made up your mind.

564
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
As long as you tell me the truth,

565
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
it's over.

566
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
As for how the phone came,

567
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I won't ask for it.

568
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I won't hurt you.

569
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You're talking nonsense.

570
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Qing Yu,

571
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
no one is right now.

572
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
If it's not a positive image,

573
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
just tell me now.

574
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
It's just a retreat for yourself.

575
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
A chance.

576
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
If it's a positive image,

577
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
you should tell me.

578
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
It's a confession for yourself.

579
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I picked up this phone

580
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
in the library last week.

581
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You picked it up last week.

582
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
It's still in your hand.

583
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
You don't want to give it to me.

584
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Teacher,

585
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
what's the difference between you and him?

586
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Whether you believe it or not,

587
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I won't do that.

588
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I'll get the phone back.

589
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Did you just see

590
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
that I called Qiao Qing Yu

591
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
to the office?

592
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What?

593
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I heard he's packing.

594
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
It's clear anyway.

595
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I can't get rid of the score.

596
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
I'm still in the kitchen.

597
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Students, please take a seat.

598
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Next, I'll report a 15-day notice.

599
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
There are students in the library

600
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
in the school on the Friday afternoon.

601
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
They're on their way to the school.

602
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Please take a seat.

603
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The students in the classroom

604
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
are in the library after the break.

605
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You always say

606
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
that you're always alone

607
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
in the school.

608
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Great.

609
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
We're from a small town.

610
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
There's no way

611
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to compare the conditions

612
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
with your classmates.

613
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You know that,

614
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
your parents are not capable.

615
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
They opened a small noodle shop.

616
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
They worked hard every day

617
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
and worked so hard.

618
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
They couldn't buy you good food.

619
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
But the more you do this,

620
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
the more you rely on yourself.

621
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Be yourself.

622
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Make the score better.

623
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You won't feel

624
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
more affectionate

625
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
than others

626
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
in your life

627
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
like me.

628
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
In this age,

629
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you have to start living your life.

630
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
You can't go wrong step by step.

631
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
You can't go wrong step by step.

632
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I heard that the owner of that phone

633
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
found it.

634
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
N95.

635
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
How long has it been?

636
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
The owner is so generous.

637
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Who knows?

638
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Let's go to his room.

639
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
You're so hard to see.

640
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
You're loving yourself.

641
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Your parents won't harm you.

642
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Why are you wearing a male shoes?

643
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You're back.

644
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Come on.

645
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Don't be angry.

646
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You're the one who's going to leave.

647
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
You're the one who's going to leave.

648
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Don't worry.

649
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
This school is quite popular.

650
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Sister-in-law,

651
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
we've found the owner of the phone.

652
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
This is

653
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
the classmate of class 3 Wang Mu.

654
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
The phone that you picked up

655
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
is hers.

656
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Hello, aunt.

657
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I forgot to take the phone

658
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
on the library store.

659
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
It's good that you found it.

660
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
My phone is the N95.

661
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
The front is silver,

662
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
the back is black.

663
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
There are two bottles of

664
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Rose.

665
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,000
One before.

666
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
It was taken on the ground

667
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
when I took the bus.

668
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't know

669
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
whether it's true

670
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
or not.

671
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
If you don't believe me, you can take a look.

672
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I don't need it. It's yours.

673
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Mumu told me just now.

674
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
She did lose her phone accidentally.

675
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
So, this matter has been solved.

676
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Hello, Mumu.

677
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Thank you for your help.

678
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
You are the one who is grateful.

679
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
What should I do?

680
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
I'll give you the money I need.

681
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Qiao Jingyu,

682
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
you are so cute.

683
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
No wonder she always bullies you.

684
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm also a bit of a drag.

685
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
If you really want to thank her,

686
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
just thank her.

687
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
The two of you are so rich.

688
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
You are so stupid to find us three.

689
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Sheng,

690
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
the three of you are so handsome.

691
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You are so handsome.

692
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Girls like you

693
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
are so handsome.

694
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Yes.

695
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I think I'm also handsome.

696
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Why don't I have a girlfriend?

697
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Thank you.

698
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Look.

699
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I don't know who is so cool.

700
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm so happy to see you.

701
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
I'm also pretty.

702
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Which girl is the one who is chasing after you?

703
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Don't be shy.

704
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You are so young.

705
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Are you annoyed?

706
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
It's none of my business.

707
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Is it Mum?

708
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I'm going out.

709
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Get me a roll.

710
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
What was so shocking?

711
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Did you happen to kill yourself?

712
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
She sure didn't do that.

713
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
She did make you upset?

714
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I like your市场.

715
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's all from my intern.

716
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
I hope that contact will continue.

717
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

718
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

719
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

720
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

721
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

722
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

723
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
There's no point in telling me.

724
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
No matter what, I don't want to have this kind of experience.

725
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm going to have this kind of experience.

726
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
There's no one I can't tell you.

727
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to get to the top of the mountain.

728
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Qingqing,

729
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
it's almost time to go home and write homework.

730
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Okay.

731
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Mom, I'm going home to write homework too.

732
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What are you writing?

733
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
You just want to go home and play games.

734
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Hello, sit down.

735
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The bread is ready.

736
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Coming, coming.

737
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Are you Qingyu?

738
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Who are you?

739
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
How do you know my name?

740
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Nan Jiao-chun, He Da.

741
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
He Da's son.

742
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
He...

743
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Auntie, my name is He Fei-hai.

744
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
I didn't expect you would come.

745
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I've been in Huan Zhou University.

746
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I haven't been here for a long time.

747
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Thank you, Auntie.

748
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Uncle,

749
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I heard from Jingrui that you opened a noodle shop here in Huan Zhou.

750
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
So I came here to see it.

751
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You're welcome.

752
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
How is your parents?

753
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
They're all pretty good.

754
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Your parents are really lucky.

755
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
They're both college students.

756
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
They're both worth it.

757
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'm compared to Jingrui.

758
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Auntie,

759
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
I came here today

760
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
because

761
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
you might not know that

762
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I'm with Bei Yu,

763
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Tong Man.

764
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
I heard from him that he was in Huan Zhou

765
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
for a long time.

766
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I hope you'll be happy.

767
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Well,

768
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
we won't talk about the past.

769
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Eat, eat, eat.

770
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Uncle made it today.

771
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
But

772
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
it's all done by the old man.

773
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
You can't eat here.

774
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I'm guessing

775
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
that He Fei-hai is Jingrui's little companion.

776
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
He was always with Bei Yu and Jingrui's butt.

777
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Qiao Bei Yu wrote in the diary

778
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
that his favorite person came to Huan Zhou.

779
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
He Fei-hai is the college student

780
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
in Huan Zhou.

781
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Could he be

782
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Qiao Bei Yu's boyfriend

783
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
in Nan Xiao-chun?

784
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,000
You're not going to have anything to do again, right?

785
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I don't want to

786
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
bother you anymore.

787
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I'm just being serious.

788
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Don't worry.

789
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll do whatever I want.

790
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I'll make rice with rice.

791
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Here.

792
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Let's go.

793
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'll send you.

794
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll send you.

795
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I'm not your dad.

796
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm not a kid.

797
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I'm a big kid.

798
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
So you don't have to be so polite with me.

799
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
If you want to eat something,

800
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
come to the restaurant.

801
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Okay.

802
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Thank you, uncle.

803
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Fei-hai.

804
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
I made some pickles at home.

805
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
You can take them back.

806
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
I'm not very happy about that.

807
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I made them for you.

808
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Take them.

809
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Okay.

810
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Thank you, Jingyu.

811
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Thank you, auntie.

812
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'll go back now.

813
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll come back to visit you some other day.

814
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Take care.

815
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Come on.

816
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Let's see.

817
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Let me see.

818
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Why are you here?

819
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
We're holding a meeting.

820
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
We're holding a meeting.

821
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Who are you?

822
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Four of us.

823
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We're not here yet.

824
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
After school,

825
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
there's a basketball game in school.

826
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
As the leader of the East Island,

827
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
everyone is going to play with us.

828
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Come on, play chess.

829
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Okay.

830
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Jingyu, are you going to play chess?

831
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I'm not going.

832
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I'm afraid that I can't be a part of

833
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,000
the dance class.

834
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
It's true.

835
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Let's go.

836
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Let's start the game.

837
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Let's go.

838
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'll get the dishes.

839
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
This is the menu.

840
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What do you need to drink?

841
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You asked me out today.

842
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
You want to buy a cup of fish?

843
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I'm hungry.

844
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I'm hungry.

845
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm hungry.

846
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,000
I'm hungry.
