Jingjing, are you there?

41
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jingjing.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Jingrui.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm going to the post office to get my wedding photos. Do you want to come with me?

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's go.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're still young and you're always bored at home.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You'll get sick if you stay here. Let's go.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Jingjing.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's been almost 10 years since I bought this car.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's time to change it.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Jingrui.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Jingrui.

52
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
This is the one when I first bought the car.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I hung it on the wall.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Jingrui.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Tell me about the things that happened when you were young.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's been so long.

57
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can't you remember it clearly?

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Every time I ask about Qiao Beiyu,

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,200
I really don't know who to ask except you.

60
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
Just tell me.

61
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,920
When Pei was six years old,

62
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,560
he was taken back to Nan Qiao Village by his grandparents.

63
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,040
He must have been very scared

64
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
when he left his parents at such a young age.

65
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,880
I can feel it very well.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,080
But he didn't cry and make a fuss.

67
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,680
It's like he knew

68
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,440
what it was for.

69
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,760
Even adults thought

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,720
that the child was very good at business.

71
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,480
But I found out

72
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,000
that he always hid in the night and cried.

73
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,000
Pei, why are you crying?

74
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Are you okay?

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm okay.

76
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,040
Let me show you something.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,960
The sequel

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,080
Pei,

79
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,080
you must be much better.

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,260
Hold, hold!

81
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,120
ï¿½

82
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
Have you mistaken.

83
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,220
I never thought you likes me.

84
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,000
The man in the photo-book

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,820
showed you yogurt for depression

86
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,020
2 months ago

87
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,520
I I married theaman

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,980
Hey hey

89
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,200
I was shocked

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

91
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

92
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

94
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

96
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

97
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

98
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,200
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to do this.

99
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
Xiaobei!

100
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,200
Xiaobei!

101
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Wait for me!

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Wait for me!

103
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Wait for me!

104
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
Go home!

105
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,200
Go home!

106
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Everyone's waiting for you to have dinner.

107
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
Grandma even made your favorite ribs.

108
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
That's not for me to eat

109
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
It's for Qingyu and Xiaoyu to eat, I don't care.

110
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
It's for Qingyu and Xiaoyu to eat, I don't care.

111
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,200
Then do you care about the new clothes?

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,200
Little Auntie bought you a lot of beautiful clothes

113
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,200
There are many beautiful clothes, shoes and new school bags.

114
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,200
If Qiao Huan sees them, he will be so jealous.

115
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
If you don't want them,

116
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
I will tell my aunt to give them to Qiao Huan.

117
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
You dare?

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Xiaobei, go and beg your uncle and aunt.

119
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Tell them to take you back to Shunyu.

120
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,200
My aunt is the best talker.

121
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Go and talk to them. They will definitely agree.

122
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,200
My grandparents said that if I go to Shunyu,

123
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,200
Qingqing will stay in Nan Qiao Village for me.

124
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Qingqing is still young and will cry.

125
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,200
But you want to stay with your parents.

126
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,200
It's okay. My brother...

127
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,200
From that moment on, I swore

128
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,200
I would protect Xiaobei.

129
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
I would never let her suffer.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
Not long after you were born, Xiaobei was taken back to Nan Qiao Village.

131
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Although you were together for a long time,

132
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
she always felt that she was her sister.

133
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
She should love you and protect you.

134
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,200
I didn't have time to get to know Qiao Bei Yu.

135
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,200
She left.

136
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,200
Fortunately, I was with her in Nan Qiao Village.

137
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Qingran, thank you.

138
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I am her brother.

139
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,200
This is what I should do.

140
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I will be waiting for you in the car.

141
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
I will take you to the nearby area.

142
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
How was it?

143
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Was it tiring flying all the way here?

144
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It was okay.

145
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Your mother often mentioned you.

146
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,200
My name is Guan Chengyu.

147
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I am your mother's good friend

148
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
and also her manager.

149
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,200
During this time,

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
she has been very busy.

151
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
She has been busy with her work.

152
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
She has been busy with her work.

153
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
She has been busy with her work.

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
She has been busy with her work.

155
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
She has been busy with her work.

156
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
During this time,

157
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
she was preparing her own music.

158
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
So she would always be in the studio.

159
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Right here.

160
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,200
When I first met Anna,

161
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,200
she played this piece of music.

162
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
At that time, she had just come to France.

163
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,200
She was working in the restaurant and looking for opportunities.

164
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
I was still a young kid who had not graduated from college.

165
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,200
One time,

166
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
when she was delivering her dinner,

167
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
she played this piece of music on the public piano

168
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
at the train station in France.

169
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I just happened to pass by.

170
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Even people who do not understand music at all

171
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
will be deeply attracted by her.

172
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
It is not because of her incurable skills,

173
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
but because of her sensitivity.

174
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
She is a person who can cross the boundaries of race,

175
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,200
gender, and language.

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,200
See you next time.

177
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Bye.

178
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,200
Bye.

179
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Bye.

180
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Bye.

181
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Mom.

182
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
How was it?

183
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
Are you tired from the plane ride?

184
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,200
No.

185
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Are you tired?

186
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
No.

187
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
You are wearing so high.

188
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
You are taller than me.

189
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I played basketball in school.

190
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
I am wearing so fast.

191
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Come, let's take a look at the studio.

192
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Come in.

193
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
How is it?

194
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Do you like it?

195
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
I... I am not sure.

196
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,200
Jingrui,

197
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
move to the left.

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Left.

199
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,200
Okay.

200
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Move higher.

201
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Too high.

202
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Move down.

203
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Jingyu, you are lower.

204
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Move higher.

205
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Okay.

206
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Hang it up.

207
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Your grandma is so...

208
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,200
She left the new house unoccupied.

209
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
She is going to come to the old house to drink.

210
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I moved Jingrui's stuff here.

211
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Jingrui, you are also from the same school as me.

212
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Do you know any of Qiao Beiyu's classmates?

213
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
When she was in high school,

214
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Jingrui went to Huanzhou University.

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
How could she know any of her classmates?

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,200
Jingxing, come and help me put the sheet on.

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,200
Which one do you think is better?

218
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I think that one looks better.

219
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
This one?

220
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Okay, I will hang this one.

221
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Yanfen,

222
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
you have made it this time.

223
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Wait for the good fortune.

224
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
I don't want to live a good fortune.

225
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
When Jingrui has a child,

226
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I will go to the city to take care of the child.

227
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Of course.

228
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
It is the mother's heart that cannot be taken care of.

229
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
Yanfen, teach us.

230
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
How can we raise our son

231
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
as talented as Jingrui?

232
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,200
Our Jingrui has been raised in the village.

233
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
I have never given up on him.

234
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Her grandparents think

235
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
that Jingrui is here to repay them.

236
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
It is true.

237
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Yanfen, if you say so,

238
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
then you are too modest.

239
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Who doesn't know that

240
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Qiao family is a famous

241
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
intellectual and moral model in the village.

242
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
This is like the old days.

243
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
You have to set up a few stands in the village.

244
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Really.

245
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
I think

246
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,200
the family of Qiao family is good.

247
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
The children are all good.

248
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
It is a pity that Xiaobei is not here.

249
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Yanfen, I remember

250
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
the last time our village was so lively,

251
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
was it the time when Jingrui was admitted to college?

252
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,200
It was.

253
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Yes.

254
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
Right?

255
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,200
At that time, our Haisheng

256
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
bought all the firecrackers in the village.

257
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
It was so lively.

258
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Yes.

259
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
All the people came.

260
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
I remember that was the most lively

261
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
in our village.

262
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
You are right.

263
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Uncle, I pour it for you.

264
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Thank you.

265
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Uncle,

266
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I am so happy that you are here.

267
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's drink more today.

268
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Thank you.

269
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Come on.

270
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Come on.

271
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,200
Be happy.

272
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,200
I finally have a class.

273
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Haisheng,

274
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
your two weapons are really not simple.

275
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Not only did you train the first

276
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,200
college students of the village,

277
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,200
but also the college students of Shunyu County.

278
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,200
Sister Hao,

279
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
you really have a good reputation for your family.

280
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Thank you.

281
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
You have a good reputation for our village.

282
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Thank you.

283
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Let me see.

284
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I have never seen

285
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,200
what the college students look like.

286
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,200
They look like this.

287
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Be careful.

288
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Don't get dirty.

289
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
I haven't seen enough of Yanfen.

290
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Hurry up.

291
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Let's go.

292
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
Mom, I want to go out for a while.

293
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Come on.

294
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Let's go.

295
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Okay.

296
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Come on.

297
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,200
You light it yourself.

298
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Okay.

299
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Wait for me.

300
00:15:50,200 --> 00:16:20,200
The first class of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the second year of the

301
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:45,800
five

302
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Not bad.

303
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Wrong number.

304
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Childish.

305
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Why don't you ask me how I'm doing in France?

306
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,200
How are you doing?

307
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,200
How are you?

308
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Hello? Can you hear me?

309
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Can you hear me?

310
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Hello? Hello? Hello?

311
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
Can you hear me?

312
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,200
I can hear you.

313
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,200
But I don't have a microphone. I can't talk.

314
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,200
You don't have to talk.

315
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
Just listen to me.

316
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
Hello?

317
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
How is it?

318
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm pretty good, right?

319
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
When I saw my mom this time,

320
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
I felt like she was the one in my mind.

321
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I feel like I'm in a different place.

322
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Maybe leaving home,

323
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
leaving me,

324
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
is a good thing for her.

325
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
But I don't know how painful it is

326
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
when she leaves.

327
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,200
And my dad is always working

328
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
and doesn't care about me.

329
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Do you think

330
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I'm too much

331
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
to them?

332
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
You're not.

333
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Thank you.

334
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
Did you remember it wrong?

335
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
No.

336
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I won't remember it wrong.

337
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
It's a red box.

338
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
What about inside?

339
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
It's my wedding

340
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
bed sheet and my back cover.

341
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,200
I'm going to give it to my granddaughter-in-law.

342
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
You can look for it.

343
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Is it this one?

344
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Yes.

345
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Be careful.

346
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Be careful.

347
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
Be careful.

348
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
Be careful.

349
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Let go.

350
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Let go.

351
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
It's a good thing.

352
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
I don't know how long

353
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
I can hold on.

354
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
If I fail,

355
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
these words are

356
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
the proof that I used to be here.

357
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I'm not crazy.

358
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
My name is Qin Wenqiu.

359
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Mom,

360
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
let me help you.

361
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
No, no.

362
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Yes, the process is wrong.

363
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,200
You need to add salt.

364
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,200
You don't need to care about anything.

365
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Actually, you don't need to sit.

366
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
I can't sit.

367
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I can't sit.

368
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
I can't sit.

369
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I can't sit.

370
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I can't sit.

371
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I can't sit.

372
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,200
I can't sit.

373
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
You don't need to sit.

374
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,200
I can't sit.

375
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
I need to help you.

376
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
You just stay here.

377
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I'll make you your favorite dumplings.

378
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,200
You don't need to care about anything.

379
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You need to add salt.

380
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
No, add water.

381
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
Mom, you added too much.

382
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Too much?

383
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,200
She can't mix it.

384
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I have a way. Add flour.

385
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,200
Mom,

386
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Mom.

387
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Mom.

388
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,200
Why are you living like this?

389
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
I'm fine.

390
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm fine.

391
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
I'm fine.

392
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Guan.

393
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Dr. Wen.

394
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Come here.

395
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I just passed by Tangren Street

396
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
and bought you Chinese food.

397
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
Chinese Spring Festival is coming.

398
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
I brought you some flowers.

399
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm sorry.

400
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,360
Guan.

401
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,200
You know how to make up for the loss of your appetite?

402
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,680
How do you know that we didn't eat?

403
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,000
I don't know her.

404
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,080
Your mother's cooking

405
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,680
is really amazing.

406
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,960
She was so happy.

407
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,760
One time, she wanted to make sacha noodles for us,

408
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,040
but the whole table was covered in smoke.

409
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,320
Enough.

410
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,040
Say what I have to say.

411
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,360
Don't disturb me.

412
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,280
From then on,

413
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,160
I don't dare let her get close to the kitchen again.

414
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
You're still talking.

415
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,600
Okay.

416
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,200
There's still some preparation work at the concert.

417
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,000
By the way, Dr. Meng.

418
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Call me if you want to eat anything tonight.

419
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,560
Don't let her get close to the kitchen.

420
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
Hurry up.

421
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,320
You're busy.

422
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,640
Don't let her get close to the kitchen.

423
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,120
Hurry up.

424
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,520
Bye.

425
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,400
There's flour on your clothes.

426
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:11,720
It's okay.

427
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,600
Sorry.

428
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Bye.

429
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,840
Open the door.

430
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,720
We still have to eat dumplings.

431
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
We've been busy for a long time.

432
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,440
We can't waste it.

433
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,560
It's not wasting it.

434
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,760
It's not a waste.

435
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,440
You two are still in the same boat.

436
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,200
Snowflake.

437
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,720
Mom.

438
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,600
You've been separated from my dad for so long.

439
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,400
Have you ever thought about starting over?

440
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,360
No.

441
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,120
I've been through a failed marriage.

442
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,800
I don't want to be fat again.

443
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,800
Fan Chu.

444
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,880
Dr. Meng.

445
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,520
To be honest,

446
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm not a good mother.

447
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,480
Will you still remember me in your heart?

448
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,280
No.

449
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,760
It's all Mingqiu's fault.

450
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
I just want to leave her.

451
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,640
As soon as possible.

452
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,760
Qingyu.

453
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,280
Help me.

454
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,960
Why did you buy so much?

455
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,800
I buy so much every New Year.

456
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
Let me change the water for them.

457
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,560
I don't want to throw up.

458
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Let's kill them tonight.

459
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:14,800
Okay.

460
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,320
I'll change more later.

461
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,800
Mom.

462
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,280
Why did you get up in the middle of the night?

463
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,800
I'm not going to get up.

464
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
Why did you get up?

465
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,400
Me?

466
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,240
No.

467
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,240
Really?

468
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,200
Why didn't you remember me?

469
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,520
Qingqing.

470
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,600
Qingqing.

471
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,320
The village organized a holiday resort

472
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,600
for us to take care of our kids.

473
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,760
Today is my turn.

474
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,840
If you're free,

475
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,280
come with me.

476
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Okay.

477
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,120
Mom, I'll go with Jun.

478
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Me?

479
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,200
Jun

480
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,320
Jun

481
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,400
Jun

482
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,800
Jun

483
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,000
Jun

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,920
Jun

485
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,880
Jun

486
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,460
Jun

487
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,040
Jun

488
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,760
Jun

489
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,120
Jun

490
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,520
Jun

491
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,760
Jun

492
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,760
I'm the best friend of Xiaobei in Nan Qiao Village.

493
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,760
Xiaobei is so beautiful and smart.

494
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,760
I dance so well.

495
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,760
I treat her as my student, my daughter.

496
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,760
We are fated to be in Nan Qiao Village.

497
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,760
She promised me that she would dance at the Huan Zhou Theater.

498
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,760
She wanted me to applaud her on stage.

499
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,760
One day, Xiaobei told me a secret.

500
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,760
She fell in love with Qiao Jingrui.

501
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
Xiaobei had a miscarriage.

502
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,760
Jingrui is not from Qiao's family.

503
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,760
To inherit the family business of Qiao,

504
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,760
my brother and sister-in-law adopted Jingrui from an orphanage.

505
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,760
For Jingrui's identity,

506
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,760
and to preserve Qiao's family's reputation,

507
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,760
they poured all their dirty water on Xiaobei.

508
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,760
After the miscarriage,

509
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,760
Xiaobei's parents went back to Nan Qiao Village.

510
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Sister-in-law, I have to see Jingrui no matter what.

511
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
If I can't see him today,

512
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
I'll wait for him next week.

513
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,760
If I can't see him next week, I'll wait for him next week.

514
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I have to see him anyway.

515
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,760
I have to ask him what happened.

516
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
What does it have to do with Jingrui?

517
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Besides, they are siblings.

518
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,760
What evidence do you have?

519
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
You think Jingrui is the one who did it?

520
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
It's ridiculous.

521
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,760
If Jingrui is not the one,

522
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,760
why can't I see Jingrui?

523
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Why can't I ask him in person?

524
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,760
I'll make a scene at school and outside.

525
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
Who will benefit from you, our family, and Jingrui?

526
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,760
How dare you!

527
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,760
Jingrui is the top student in the college entrance exam.

528
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,760
You are so smart.

529
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Who doesn't say he has a chance?

530
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,760
Even if this happens,

531
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
your daughter will be the one who will hurt my son.

532
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,760
Nonsense!

533
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
You are just a class president.

534
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,760
You are just a class president.

535
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Enough!

536
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Are you done?

537
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
Isn't it embarrassing to lose money?

538
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,760
Xiaobei thought her parents would stand by her side.

539
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,760
But what happened was just a slap from her mother.

540
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
Xiaobei was very aggrieved.

541
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,760
She dared not tell her parents the truth.

542
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,760
She didn't know who else in this world could rely on.

543
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
I love her.

544
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,760
I pity Xiaobei.

545
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,760
This should be the money Jingrui gave her mother.

546
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
She gives it every month.

547
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,760
I am responsible for her.

548
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I am her brother, but I failed to take care of her.

549
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
That's why she is cheating on me.

550
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
Jingrui, you are also from the same school as her.

551
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,760
Jingrui, tell me about what happened when Xiaobei was a kid.

552
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,760
This is the same thing that Xiaobei hung up on the car.

553
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,760
The End

554
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,760
Do you think Jingrui would know that I am like this?

555
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
I think Jingrui knew it.

556
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,760
But she never returned to the southern village.

557
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,760
The news about Xiaobei's miscarriage was spread all over the village.

558
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Yan Fen!

559
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
I haven't seen you in days.

560
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
Come, come, come.

561
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
Take this.

562
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Did you hear?

563
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Someone said that your Xiaobei had miscarriage since she came back from the Han family.

564
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Yan Fen, you must take good care of her.

565
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Xiaobei, where have you been?

566
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Did you go to the wild?

567
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
I didn't.

568
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Xiaobei never explained anything.

569
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,760
She was alone.

570
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
The End

571
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
The End

572
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
The End

573
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,760
Here, here, Jingrui.

574
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,760
Thank you, Grandma.

575
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,760
Wow, little fish, come on.

576
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Thank you, Grandma.

577
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Okay, let's eat while it's hot.

578
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Have some wine.

579
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Qingqing, you've been staying in the house these days.

580
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,760
You don't go downstairs unless you eat.

581
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,760
This won't do. It's the New Year.

582
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,760
There are more and more people who come to visit you at home.

583
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Uncle Zhang asked you today.

584
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm writing homework in the house.

585
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,760
I don't know them.

586
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,760
It's kind of you to ask.

587
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,760
You should be happy to say hello to them.

588
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,760
This is what juniors should do.

589
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,760
It's not like you start school tomorrow and do homework.

590
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,760
Yes, sooner or later you will have to marry someone.

591
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,760
I think, when Qingqing was studying well in Shunyi,

592
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
she didn't have to go to another school.

593
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,760
There are many people like that in Huanzhou.

594
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Xiaoyu is a boy.

595
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,760
It's good to go there to see a good interview.

596
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Today is a girl. What if she's bad at school?

597
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,760
Sister, we heard that Huanzhou is good at teaching.

598
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,760
We want to ask Qingqing to work hard

599
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,760
and see if she can get into a good university.

600
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Actually, she always looks down and doesn't care about anything else.

601
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
I'm not worried.

602
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,760
You're a worm in her stomach.

603
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Don't blame me for being straight.

604
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,760
There are many girls nowadays.

605
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
Some of them are already familiar with the world.

606
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,760
They will go astray when they are 16 or 17.

607
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,760
You should really keep your eyes on them.

608
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Be careful of Qingqing.

609
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
She's in Huanzhou.

610
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Or she will be brought down.

611
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,760
Qiao Beiyu grew up in Nanqiang Village.

612
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,760
Who brought her down?

613
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,760
Who brought her down?

614
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,760
Our family is a famous family business.

615
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:23,760
We raised our two kids with care and care.

616
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,760
Everyone in the village knows that.

617
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
If someone is brought down,

618
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,760
it's probably Jiang Shang's wife.

619
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,760
Why did you bring me here?

620
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Jingrui, is what the aunt said true?

621
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,760
It has nothing to do with you.

622
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Jingrui, you can ask anyone about her character.

623
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
It's not a big deal.

624
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,760
That's right. If Jingrui is wrong,

625
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,760
can Xiaoyun's parents marry Xiaoyun's daughter?

626
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,760
Her family is a leader.

627
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
She has good conditions.

628
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
She's willing to marry us.

629
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,760
That means Jingrui is capable and reliable.

630
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Qingqing, you're lucky that we're all family.

631
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
What will people think if they hear you?

632
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
Right, Dad?

633
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,760
Third, you're the leader of your family.

634
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Say something.

635
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,760
We're all elders.

636
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,760
How do we talk?

637
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,760
You're right.

638
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,760
When Qiao Beiyu was little,

639
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
she was so sweet.

640
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,760
How did she change?

641
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,760
Someone must have brought it down.

642
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
She died, but it doesn't mean that it didn't happen.

643
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,760
What?

644
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Enough.

645
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
She's at a sensitive age.

646
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,760
It's normal to have strange thoughts.

647
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Jingrui, I know you care about your sister.

648
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
Everyone is sad about what happened to Beiyu.

649
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,760
But she chose her own path.

650
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
No one can blame her.

651
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,760
I think she hopes that everyone will remember her good side.

652
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,760
Let's forget about the past.

653
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
Enough.

654
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
It's all in the past.

655
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
Let's eat.

656
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
Dad, I'll give you a toast.

657
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Here.

658
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
Drink some water.

659
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
Jingyu,

660
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:14,760
I'm warning you.

661
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Don't talk about your own business.

662
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Don't talk about Chen Fei's business.

663
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,760
You're an old man.

664
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
You should know your place.

665
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,760
You're busy with Jingrui's wedding.

666
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
You shouldn't be so anxious.

667
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
Why?

668
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Why?

669
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,760
Because Jingrui is the first student in the village.

670
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,760
He's the most intelligent kid.

671
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,760
And you're helping him with his transfer.

672
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
He's sending you a grade.

673
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Maybe you'll need help with your work.

674
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
What did he do to Beiyu?

675
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Who?

676
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Jingrui and Beiyu.

677
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
How do you know?

678
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
Who told you?

679
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
It's all nonsense.

680
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
No.

681
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,760
You're so good-tempered.

682
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,760
You listen to your wife.

683
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Look at what Qingqing has become.

684
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,760
In a family,

685
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,760
it's up to the man.

686
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
Whatever you know,

687
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
you know you're a bastard.

688
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
We don't know what you know.

689
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
You're a bitch.

690
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
You're a bitch.

691
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
You'll get your brother in trouble.

692
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
You'll get your brother in trouble.

693
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:37,760
You'll get your brother in trouble.

694
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
That's great.

695
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,760
No one in our family is a bitch.

696
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,760
They all wronged Qiao Beiyu.

697
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
You don't want justice for Qiao Beiyu.

698
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
No.

699
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
I don't want justice.

700
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Justice?

701
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
There's no justice.

702
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
No one wants justice.

703
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm busy.

704
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
If you're really capable,

705
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
you can go to a good university

706
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
and make a living.

707
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,760
I think you're good.

708
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,760
Wife is an outsider.

709
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,760
Only we are family.

710
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Drink.

711
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
It's late.

712
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Drink.

713
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Drink slowly.

714
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,760
Drink slowly.

715
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Drink.

716
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
You drink all day.

717
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,760
Did you say that yourself?

718
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,760
Your brother doesn't do anything else after drinking.

719
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Qiao Shusheng.

720
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
I'm warning you.

721
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Don't be a bad student.

722
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
Do you hear me?

723
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
You're annoying.

724
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,760
Ji Rui.

725
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,760
Is my wedding dress ready?

726
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,760
Yes.

727
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,760
Here.

728
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,760
I was going to send it to your house tonight.

729
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,760
Since you're here, it's perfect.

730
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
Congratulations, Ji Rui.

731
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
If Beiyu is still here,

732
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,760
she will be happy for you.

733
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,760
It's all my fault that I didn't protect Beiyu.

734
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Otherwise, she wouldn't be so young.

735
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Don't think too much.

736
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,760
Everything will be fine.

737
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm leaving.

738
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,760
Brother Fei Hai.

739
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Qingyu.

740
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
What's up?

741
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Will you come to the wedding?

742
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,760
Jin Rui is getting married. Of course I will.

743
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,760
What if Beiyu doesn't want you to come?

744
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,760
Qiao Jin Rui did something that hurt her.

745
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,760
If you really treat her as a friend,

746
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,760
don't come to the wedding.

747
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
Do you have some misunderstanding?

748
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
No.

749
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,760
He's a hypocrite.

750
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
He's just pretending to be nice to Beiyu.

751
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
Qingyu.

752
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
I know.

753
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Beiyu left so suddenly.

754
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
You can't accept it.

755
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
You want to find a criminal for her misfortune.

756
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,760
But this person can't be Jin Rui.

757
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,760
If Beiyu knows that you hurt Jin Rui in her name,

758
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
she will be very disappointed.

759
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
You don't know anything.

760
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
Qingyu.

761
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
Everyone is sad about Beiyu's death.

762
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,760
But she chose her own path.

763
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,760
She can't blame anyone else.

764
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
Do you have some misunderstanding?

765
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,760
But this person can't be Jin Rui.

766
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
If Beiyu knows that

767
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
you hurt Jin Rui in her name,

768
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
she will be very disappointed.

769
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,760
Everyone wants justice.

770
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
There's no justice.

771
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,760
Jin Rui

772
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,760
Jin Rui

773
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,760
What a coincidence.

774
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,760
The sword on your car

775
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,760
is a set of Beiyu's music box.

776
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,760
Where did you find these?

777
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,760
I had a dream last night.

778
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,760
Qiao Beiyu told me

779
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,760
there's a music box in the attic.

780
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,760
I really found it.

781
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
You said she had a dream.

782
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:01,760
Is it because she had no wish?

783
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,760
What does she want to tell me?

784
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,760
Don't talk nonsense.

785
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,760
There's no such thing as a dream.

786
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Is this picture of you?

787
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Of course not.

788
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
How is that possible?

789
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Jin Rui

790
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,760
You have to pay for lying.

791
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,760
Jin Rui

792
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
Jin Rui

793
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,760
Jin Rui

794
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,760
Jin Rui

795
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Jin Rui
