1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,500
Music

2
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,300
Just like you makes light turn bright

3
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,500
Breaking free from darkness

4
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
You gave me strength

5
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,500
I'm longing for truth

6
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,500
I find my pain

7
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,500
Drawing on the hopes

8
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
That you render me

9
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
In this long journey

10
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
I run around lightly

11
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,500
There's something strange

12
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,500
Our department recently received a cash

13
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
For the medical expenses of Tan Qianqian

14
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
But I don't know who sent it

15
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Sister, I'm here to talk to you

16
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,500
I know

17
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
It's okay

18
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
You and your dad are very alike

19
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
I'm here to talk to you

20
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
You didn't bring an umbrella?

21
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
Yeah

22
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
What about you?

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I didn't bring an umbrella either

24
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
How are you recently?

25
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
I'm fine

26
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
I got a new friend in my 50s

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,500
In this exam

28
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
What about you?

29
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
I heard about your dad

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
It's just a medical dispute

31
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
It's not once or twice

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Why are you asking?

33
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
That's good

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
You recently...

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm preparing to take the entrance exam

36
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
For the University of Paris

37
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
So I'll do my best

38
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,500
To prepare for the study abroad

39
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Maybe

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I won't go to school

41
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Today may be our last meeting

42
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Don't you have anything to say to me?

43
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
I wish you all the best

44
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
It's raining, I'm going home

45
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
Wait

46
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
I didn't bring an umbrella

47
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
I lied to you

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Since it's our last meeting

49
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
I can't change anything

50
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
I'll just disappear

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
what's up

52
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,500
That child of yours

53
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Surelywends a lot of trouble

54
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
You don't know what you're thinking.

55
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
You don't know what you're thinking.

56
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,500
That's right. You and Mumu are good friends.

57
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Her father is sick. He should go and see him.

58
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
Then you can go once.

59
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
You can go there over and over again.

60
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,500
That's the hospital.

61
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,500
You have more time to do it. Is that okay?

62
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Is that okay?

63
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Mumu is quite pitiful.

64
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Her father was sick long ago.

65
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
He got sick when he was in the college entrance exam.

66
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,500
He ruined his child.

67
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Mum,

68
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,500
how much do you think a person's life is worth?

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,500
100,000? 200,000?

70
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Or 300,000?

71
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,500
The prices of different people are different.

72
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,500
Then how much do you think my life is worth?

73
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,500
How much is Qiao Beiyu's life worth?

74
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
Actually, two years ago, I came to Huanzhou to deliver clothes to you.

75
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
I ran into Qiao Beiyu.

76
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
He told me at the time,

77
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
I'll return your parents to you.

78
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,500
Is that right?

79
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,500
From that moment on,

80
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,500
he knew that his family didn't want him anymore.

81
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
I'll drink it while it's hot.

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
I'll go to bed early.

83
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
I'll go to bed early.

84
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I'll go to bed early.

85
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,500
Mum,

86
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
what are you doing up here?

87
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Come and eat.

88
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
I'll send you to the school.

89
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Where's Mum?

90
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
She's...

91
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
She's at the store.

92
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
She went to the store.

93
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Dad,

94
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
do you think something's wrong with my mum?

95
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Last night,

96
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
I saw her standing on the rooftop alone.

97
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
It seemed like she was dreaming.

98
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
What do you mean she was dreaming?

99
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
She's old.

100
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
She's in her seventh year of middle school.

101
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
She can't sleep well.

102
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
It's not the first time.

103
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Last time she was in Nanqiao Village.

104
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Enough.

105
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Don't think too much.

106
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Eat.

107
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
You're late for school.

108
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Eat.

109
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Recently,

111
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
I've been dreaming about my childhood.

112
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Actually,

113
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Dad was nice to me when I was little.

114
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
He would cook for me,

115
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
tell me stories,

116
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
and let me ride on his shoulders to go to the lantern show.

117
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Me, Dad, Mum,

118
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
the three of us,

119
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
we were always happy together.

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I think

121
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,500
Mum must still remember these things.

122
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
So these years,

123
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
she has been silently enduring Dad.

124
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
At that time,

126
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
my dad was a math teacher

127
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
in Huanzhou Academy of Sciences.

128
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
He was funny and humorous.

129
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
He was praised as an excellent teacher every year.

130
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,500
Students liked him a lot.

131
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Until one time,

132
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
a student in the kindergarten

133
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
had a birthday party.

134
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
That was the first time I attended a birthday party.

135
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Now that I think about it,

136
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
that day,

137
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
it was like a fairy tale.

138
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,500
I've never seen

139
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
such a beautiful princess.

140
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
I've never eaten such delicious ice cream.

141
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
After I got home,

142
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,500
I was bothering my dad.

143
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I said, Dad, Dad,

144
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Dad,

145
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
I want to live in a big house.

146
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,500
I want to wear beautiful clothes.

147
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Why don't we

148
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
have money in other people's houses?

149
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Qingyu,

150
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
do you think

151
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,500
my dad would give up his job

152
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,500
and go down to do business

153
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
because of what I said?

154
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,500
If not because of me,

155
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
he wouldn't have gone through a failure in his business,

156
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
he wouldn't have received a loan,

157
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,500
he wouldn't have continued his job,

158
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
he wouldn't have become

159
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
what he is now.

160
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
No.

161
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
That's just your guess.

162
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
What if it's true?

163
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Mumu,

164
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
you have to believe that

165
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
no one can change

166
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
other people's fate

167
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
and not punish himself

168
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
with other people's mistakes.

169
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Come on.

170
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
You want me to take the...

171
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
You want me to take the risk?

172
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Let's go.

173
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Good, good.

174
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Sheng,

175
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,500
you called us here to play with you at noon.

176
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
What are you looking at?

177
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
What else?

178
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
I feel like the money

179
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,500
the hospital received

180
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
is related to the patient's husband.

181
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
I found his phone number,

182
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
but he didn't say anything.

183
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
That's strange.

184
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,500
You gave money to the hospital,

185
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,500
and you let the hospital pay for it.

186
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
You found his family number?

187
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
Fine.

188
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Call Ling. He'll help you.

189
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
Ling.

190
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Okay.

191
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
I'll pay for it.

192
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
We have a volunteer activity every Saturday.

193
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
You're welcome.

194
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
What are you doing?

195
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Do you want my pocket money?

196
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
I want it.

197
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,500
What do you want it for?

198
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Do me a favour.

199
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I'll pay for it.

200
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Hello.

201
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Hello, I'm Fang Fang.

202
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
I'm the volunteer here.

203
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
What's your name?

204
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
I'm Qiao Qing Yu.

205
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Qiao Qing Yu?

206
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
I'll call you Qing Yu.

207
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Is this your first time here?

208
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Don't be shy.

209
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
All the people here

210
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
need help.

211
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Admit that you need help.

212
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
It's the first step to healing.

213
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
No, you're mistaken.

214
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Don't worry.

215
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,500
We keep our identity as volunteers secret.

216
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Fang Fang.

217
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Qing Yu is my student.

218
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Our organization

219
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
is a professional social organization

220
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
made up of love, charity, and prevention workers

221
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
and all kinds of people.

222
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
It's the government's contact with the society

223
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
to participate in the bridge and belt of love, charity, and prevention.

224
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Currently,

225
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
there are 130 volunteers

226
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
registered here.

227
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,500
They all have their own jobs.

228
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
But they still have time

229
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,500
to go to all over the country

230
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
to do some anti-epidemic propaganda.

231
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,500
At the same time, we will also provide

232
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
preventive information to HIV-positive people

233
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,500
to help them reduce the chance of infection.

234
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,500
In addition,

235
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,500
we will hold a public lecture every Saturday

236
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,500
on prevention of AIDS.

237
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,500
AIDS is a chronic disease.

238
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
After the AIDS virus infects the human body,

239
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,500
if it is not cured by any intervention or treatment,

240
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
the infected person's life

241
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,500
will be about ten years.

242
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,500
If the infected person is not cured

243
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,500
during the onset of the disease,

244
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,500
the patient may die within

245
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
twelve to eighteen months.

246
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
AIDS is a very dangerous infectious disease

247
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
caused by the AIDS virus.

248
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,500
HIV is a disease

249
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
that can attack the immune system.

250
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Dr. Zhang, thank you for your hard work today.

251
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
You're welcome.

252
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
This is Zhang Xiaohui, a infectious disease doctor.

253
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
He is also a volunteer

254
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
at our association.

255
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
This is my student, Qiao Qingyu.

256
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Hello.

257
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
I have some questions for you.

258
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Please go ahead.

259
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Dr. Zhang,

260
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
if an infected person

261
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
finds the disease early

262
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
and takes the medicine regularly

263
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
after the onset of the disease,

264
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
what is the reason

265
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
that may cause him to get worse

266
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,500
and even die in a short period of time?

267
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,500
Generally speaking,

268
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,500
in this case,

269
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,500
the patient's life will be greatly extended.

270
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
The possibility of sudden death

271
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
is not very high.

272
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I think the death of this patient

273
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
may have other reasons.

274
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
You mean

275
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
it may not be death or suicide?

276
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,500
You're back.

277
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I came back to get clothes for the men to change.

278
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh,

279
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
there are dirty clothes in the pocket.

280
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Put it here. I'll wash it for you.

281
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
You're brushing his hair?

282
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Yes, dressing him up.

283
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I found that you were more patient

284
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
than when you were a kid

285
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
in taking care of this dog.

286
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,500
Do you know why?

287
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,500
Because he is cuter than you.

288
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,500
I heard

289
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
that your medical treatment

290
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
is scaring me.

291
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Don't worry about it.

292
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
You should focus on

293
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
your study and pass the language test.

294
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,500
I don't want to worry.

295
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Do you regret it?

296
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
About what?

297
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,500
About the patient.

298
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
I don't regret it.

299
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
If I meet the same situation next time,

300
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I will do the same.

301
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Did you buy this dress for him?

302
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
Of course I did.

303
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
You're a good dog.

304
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Look at your taste.

305
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,500
You're ugly.

306
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
My dad said you're cuter than me.

307
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
Right?

308
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
It stinks.

309
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Give it to me.

310
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
I'm sorry.

311
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Mom, why haven't you come home yet?

312
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
Sister, it's me.

313
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,500
Mom is in the hospital.

314
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Huh?

315
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
You should take care of her tonight

316
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
in case she has any accident.

317
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Dad, what's going on?

318
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Why is mom sick?

319
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
She is stable now.

320
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
Her condition is stable.

321
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,500
The main reason for her death

322
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,500
is paroxetine.

323
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500
You should take care of her

324
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,500
and take care of her medicine.

325
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,500
What is paroxetine?

326
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Why does she take paroxetine?

327
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
What?

328
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Don't your family know that paroxetine

329
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
is a drug to fight depression?

330
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
The patient has depression.

331
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
I brought the medicine.

332
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
Take it on time.

333
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I know.

334
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I know.

335
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
I'm sorry.

336
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Dad.

337
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Did you know

338
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
about mom's illness?

339
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Actually,

340
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
I didn't know.

341
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
I just knew

342
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
that she was sick.

343
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
I didn't know.

344
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
I just knew.

345
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
I just knew.

346
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Actually,

347
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
in the bottle of paroxetine,

348
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
there is paroxetine.

349
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
It's a drug to cure depression.

350
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
She said her shoulder was hurt.

351
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
It's caused by depression.

352
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
When did it happen?

353
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
It should be

354
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
after Xiaobei left.

355
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
After the accident,

356
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
you and Xiaoyu were still sleeping.

357
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Your mom and I

358
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
took Xiaobei's ashes

359
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
and went back to Nanqiao Village.

360
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Meiyu.

361
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Do you hate

362
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
me and your dad?

363
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
If you

364
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
see my parents

365
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
and my younger siblings,

366
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
and you

367
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
raise them

368
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
by my side,

369
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I'll put them

370
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
in your grandpa's arms

371
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
and leave them

372
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
in your grandpa's arms.

373
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,500
Then you'll say

374
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
that my parents

375
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
don't care about me at all.

376
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
Right?

377
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
If they don't care about me,

378
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
what I say

379
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
and do

380
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,500
to them

381
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
doesn't matter to me.

382
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Do you think

383
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
that way?

384
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
No.

385
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
No.

386
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
We're not here anymore.

387
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
You can't do this, Fang.

388
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
We have to be good.

389
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
We have Qiongyi and Xiaoyu.

390
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
We have to continue our lives.

391
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Be good.

392
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Let's go to sleep.

393
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
My parents

394
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
didn't agree to Xiaobei's funeral.

395
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
Your brother and I

396
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
didn't agree.

397
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
My parents said no.

398
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
If my dad said

399
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
that we can go to the funeral,

400
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
we don't have to do the funeral.

401
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Right.

402
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
It's ridiculous

403
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
to do the funeral.

404
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Fang Hao!

407
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,500
Fang Hao!

408
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Fang Hao!

409
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Fang Hao!

410
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Fang Hao!

411
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Fang Hao!

412
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,500
Fang Hao!

413
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Why are you here

414
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,500
in the middle of the night?

415
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Wake up!

416
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
Why is it so cold?

417
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
What are you doing?

418
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
What are you doing?

419
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,500
Xiaobei!

420
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
Don't make a scene, okay?

421
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Xiaobei is gone.

422
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,500
She's dead.

423
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
Let's go home, okay?

424
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I'm sorry.

425
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
I'm sorry.

426
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Actually,

427
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
I didn't feel right at that time.

428
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
After I went back to Shunyuan,

429
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
I took her to the hospital.

430
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
Auntie, the doctor has something to tell your husband.

431
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
I'll take you to get the medicine.

432
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Come with me.

433
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
Your husband

434
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,500
has a mild depression.

435
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
He's mainly depressed,

436
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
self-contained,

437
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
slow-moving,

438
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
losing interest in things,

439
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
and losing energy.

440
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
This disease

441
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,500
can cause some physical symptoms.

442
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,500
Sleep disorders, weight loss,

443
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,100
and

444
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,500
pain.

445
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
As a family,

446
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
we don't just take care of patients,

447
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,500
but also accept

448
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
their behavior and emotions.

449
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Accompany them,

450
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
don't blame them too much.

451
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,500
Don't irritate them.

452
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Convert them into a circle.

453
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Depression is a disease.

454
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
It's important to understand it.

455
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Do you understand?

456
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,500
Okay.

457
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
I wanted to write it down for you.

458
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
You can go home and remember it.

459
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Your mom is strong.

460
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
I don't want you to worry.

461
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,500
So,

462
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,500
you don't know about this?

463
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:08,920
How many

464
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:29,500
You sure there's a place here?

465
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
What's wrong?

466
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Nothing, that's it.

467
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Sir, you stay here.

468
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
Okay.

469
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Hello, sir.

470
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Hello.

471
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,500
Mr. He, be careful.

472
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
Thank you.

473
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Hello.

474
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Wang Tian Guo.

475
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,500
I want to find this person.

476
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,500
This is the person.

477
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,500
I'll bring you some soup.

478
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Thank you.

479
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Come here.

480
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Thank you.

481
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Hello, my name is Ming Sheng.

482
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,500
I'm the son of Ming Qing Xin from Huan Zhou People's Hospital.

483
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
Hello.

484
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,500
The adjuster and the family are here.

485
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
What do you want me to do?

486
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,500
At the adjustment meeting,

487
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I hope you can make a short apology to the family.

488
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,500
I've already written down the details of the apology.

489
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Please take a look.

490
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,500
Actually, the situation has reached this point.

491
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
Unless the family of the patient

492
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,500
actively withdraws the complaint and apologizes to us in return,

493
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,500
otherwise, President Ming will definitely be affected.

494
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,500
We will try to minimize the loss.

495
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Okay. I understand.

496
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,500
It's almost time. Let's go in.

497
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,500
President Ming.

498
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Tan Jian Jian's husband?

499
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,500
President Ming, I...

500
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,500
I'm sorry.

501
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
At that time,

502
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
from the county to Huan Zhou,

503
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,500
no hospital dared to take my wife.

504
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,500
Everyone asked us to go home and wait for death.

505
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Only you are willing to take risks for us.

506
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,500
Give us hope.

507
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Before the opening, my wife told me,

508
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,500
whether it was life or death,

509
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:40,500
President Ming is our savior.

510
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,500
After my wife died, I couldn't escape the medical expenses.

511
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
I was so ashamed.

512
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
I secretly went to work outside.

513
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I wanted to pay off the debt.

514
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I...

515
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:57,500
I really didn't think my family could do such a thing.

516
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
Although I don't study much,

517
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,500
I know there is no reason to be so cruel.

518
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
President Ming, don't worry.

519
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
I came back to withdraw the complaint.

520
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
I won't let you suffer anymore.

521
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,500
President Ming, I'm sorry.

522
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,500
I'm sorry.

523
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
Professor Yu Yan Ke told me

524
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,500
that you haven't been to class for days.

525
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,500
I'm sorry.

526
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I don't want to eat what they taught me.

527
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
I thought you went to find your family.

528
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
You know it.

529
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Son, thank you.

530
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,500
Don't thank me.

531
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I don't want your thanks.

532
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
I want to thank you.

533
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,500
How did you find this place?

534
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
When you were little, you ran away from home

535
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,500
because you were angry with your grandpa.

536
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,500
You fell asleep under this tree.

537
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,500
I carried you back.

538
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I always thought it was grandpa.

539
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Why didn't you tell me?

540
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,500
You're a kid.

541
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,500
You always make people worried.

542
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,500
You always try to make them worry.

543
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Come on.

544
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,500
You've always been a kid.

545
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
I can't see you.

546
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,500
I don't have time to worry.

547
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Once, I had a surgery for a whole day.

548
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
I couldn't even stand up.

549
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,500
I wanted to go home and lie down.

550
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,500
I should have a look at my back.

551
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I saw the bed was covered with wet cotton.

552
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,500
I was so angry.

553
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,500
I decided to punish you for not watching cartoons for a month.

554
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Do you remember the sad cry?

555
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
It was so cold.

556
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Of course I remember.

557
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
You got off work late that day.

558
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
I was afraid you'd be hungry.

559
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,500
So I made the last pack of instant noodles for you.

560
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
I waited for you to come back.

561
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,500
But I almost fell asleep.

562
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,500
You hadn't come back yet.

563
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
I was afraid the noodles would get cold.

564
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,500
So I put the noodles in the quilt.

565
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:03,500
I cried because I was angry.

566
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,500
I felt wronged.

567
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:15,500
I've never told you about this.

568
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
I won't tell you now.

569
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
I won't tell you now.

570
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
I'm sorry.

571
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,500
I heard that Ming Sheng had a medical dispute.

572
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,500
His family complained about it.

573
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
They didn't apologize.

574
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,500
Really?

575
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,500
That's a big problem.

576
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
Qing Yu, you know Ming Sheng well.

577
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Do you know why?

578
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,500
I know Ming Sheng well.

579
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,500
Come on.

580
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,500
You're so stupid.

581
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,500
Ming Sheng didn't treat you like a normal student.

582
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Why are you...

583
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
Why am I not angry?

584
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
I'm officially announcing that I have a new goal.

585
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
I just want to study hard.

586
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,500
I've been studying for more than half a year.

587
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
Qing Yu, let's go to the library together.

588
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,500
I have something to do next time.

589
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,500
Let's go together.

590
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Qing Yu, you're here at the right time.

591
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,500
This is the form that requires your signature.

592
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
Okay.

593
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,500
From now on, you will be officially a member of our association.

594
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,500
Welcome, Qiao Qing Yu.

595
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Thank you.

596
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Thank you.

597
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Thank you.

598
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,500
Thank you.

599
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Thank you.

600
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
Welcome, Qiao Qing Yu.

601
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,500
We're doing some results of the rescue activities.

602
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,500
The text is ready.

603
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:18,500
These are some photos of volunteers from previous years.

604
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:28,740
Find some

605
00:39:37,500 --> 00:40:04,500
photos of volunteers from previous years.

606
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Actually, when I saw your name in school,

607
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,500
I was thinking,

608
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,500
are you Qiao Bei Yu's sister?

609
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,500
Mr. Le Fan, do you know Qiao Bei Yu?

610
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,500
We often do anti-pandemic publicity in the association.

611
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
Bei Yu and I met at that time.

612
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,500
As long as we're here, Bei Yu will always show up.

613
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
Dr. Le Fan.

614
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Bei Yu is here.

615
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,500
I'll take the phone call.

616
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,500
Every time, he tried to help others with us.

617
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,500
Until that day...

618
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,500
Hello?

619
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Is this Bei Yu?

620
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
Long time no see.

621
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,500
Do you miss your brother?

622
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,500
I'll wait for you at the old place tonight.

623
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Dr. Le Fan, I'm leaving.

624
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,500
What's wrong?

625
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Not long after, I heard that he was in trouble.

626
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
I often thought,

627
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,500
if I could stop him,

628
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,500
would it be different from everything?

629
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Dr. Le Fan,

630
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,500
do you know how Qiao Bei Yu died?

631
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Do you know how sudden it was today?

632
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,500
At noon, Grandfather and Grandmother called us.

633
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,500
They wanted us to go back and see.

634
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,500
They said they knew it wasn't easy for us.

635
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,500
We're family.

636
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,500
Let bygones be bygones.

637
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,500
Comrade Qiao Qing Yu,

638
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,500
I'm officially informing you.

639
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:45,500
I quit.

640
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,500
I won't cover for you anymore.

641
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:51,500
No matter how much you give me, it's useless.

642
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,500
That little money of yours is not enough for me to lose my mind.

643
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Qiao Bei Yu didn't die of illness.

644
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
He committed suicide.

645
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,500
The more you care, the more you're careful

646
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,500
The more you care, the more you're careful

647
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,500
The more you care, the more you're careful

648
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:54,500
The more you care, the more you're careful

649
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:11,500
In the future, time will reveal the secret

650
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,500
Waiting is a silent promise

651
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,500
But it will never be fulfilled

652
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:36,500
So my heart is your name

653
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:42,500
The only stubbornness in my heart

654
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:50,500
From the first glance, I draw the future

655
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:56,500
The dream starts to become real

656
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:05,500
Your heart is also unknown

657
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:11,500
The same story is hidden

658
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Fortunately, you're not smart enough

659
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:19,500
You didn't have the courage to come
