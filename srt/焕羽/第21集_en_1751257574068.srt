1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Dark night, a guiding light

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just like you, makes light turn bright

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Breaking free from darkness

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You gave me strength, but unfortunately

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I find my pain, drawing on the hope

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That you render me, in this long journey

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I run, unlightly

8
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Dark night, a guiding light

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just like you, makes light turn bright

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I want to owe you

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I will let you pay for what you did, but not now

12
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Do you know? We look like when you escaped from Nan Qiao Village

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We lived in my grandfather's house for a while

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Although we didn't live in Hong Kong for long, I feel like it's been a long time

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Jiang Jin Yu, I really wanted to help you get out of Huan Zhou

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You don't have to say sorry, you don't have to say sorry to anyone

18
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry

19
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Maybe we were afraid of losing each other

20
00:03:51,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Even if we don't talk about our past, you will still be there

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I love you

22
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My heart is your name

23
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The only stubbornness in my heart

24
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,000
From the first glance, I draw the future

25
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The dream starts to come true

26
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Your heart is also unknown

27
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The same story is hidden

28
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Fortunately, you are not smart enough

29
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The courage is also buried

30
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So that time will not be the same

31
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
0823, is Qiao Qing Yu here?

32
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Yes

33
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Qiao Qing Yu, you are next

34
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So-Ok

35
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry, everyone

36
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Something happened to this speaker

37
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

38
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

39
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

40
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

41
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

42
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

43
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm sorry for the poor quality of the video.

44
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and I'm gonna put an end to it just for a bit.

45
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
and I'm gonna put an end to it just for a bit.

46
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and I'm gonna put an end to it just for a bit.

47
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What am I doing on this day&

48
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What are you gonna do with this guy?

49
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What is going to be the reason for him to break his heart?

50
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm sorry.

78
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm sorry.

79
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you leaving right now?

80
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What about the score?

81
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I was a good player.

82
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm not here to be a star.

83
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm just doing my best to be on stage.

84
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,340
You're quite self-confident.

85
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,000
Thank you for what you did.

86
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,880
That's not enough.

87
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,220
Da Xinyu, you owe me a favor.

88
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,840
How do you want me to repay you?

89
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,640
After I pass the language test and go to France,

90
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,800
I don't think we'll get to see each other again.

91
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,800
So I hope you can let go of all your unhappiness and pain today.

92
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,800
And spend the rest of your days happily with me.

93
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,800
Just treat it as a farewell.

94
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I'm not coming down.

95
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:49,800
I feel just like I can fly.

96
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,800
You can't bring me down.

97
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
I'll take a picture for you.

98
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Stand up.

99
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,800
Stand up.

100
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
Okay.

101
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,800
Hello, can you take a picture for us?

102
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
Thank you.

103
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Let's take a full-body picture.

104
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Let's take a full-body picture.

105
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Come on, take a picture.

106
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Okay, thank you.

107
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
You're welcome.

108
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Thank you.

109
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Thank you.

110
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Thank you.

111
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,800
Thank you.

112
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Thank you.

113
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,800
How is it? Does it look like me?

114
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
What are you writing?

115
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
A secret.

116
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Let's go.

117
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Let's go.

118
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,800
Let's go.

119
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Let's go.

120
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
Be careful.

121
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
It's okay.

122
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
It's mine.

123
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Don't waste the time of being afraid

124
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm walking alone on this sad street

125
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,800
How can I forget you?

126
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
How is it? Is this place beautiful?

127
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Xiao Xin Yu

128
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Close your eyes

129
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Why?

130
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Just close your eyes

131
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
Don't open your eyes

132
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
I'll let you prove it

133
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
What?

134
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Don't make a fuss

135
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Open your eyes

136
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,800
Why are you so quiet?

137
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Don't mind me

138
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm going to the hospital

139
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
What wish did you make?

140
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,800
My first wish is to go to the university I like

141
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:44,800
My second wish is to have a healthy and peaceful life with my family

142
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
What about the third one?

143
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
I can't tell you the secret

144
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
Thank you, Dr. Lin

145
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
You're welcome

146
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
I want to go to Jiangzhou University

147
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Xiao Xin Yu

148
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
I'm happy to meet you

149
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Me too

150
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I hope everything goes well for us

151
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
Everything goes well?

152
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Everything goes well

153
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I can change my life with my own efforts

154
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
I can decide my own life

155
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,800
I want to see myself grow up

156
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
Xiao Xin Yu

157
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
It's getting dark

158
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
It's time

159
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I'm sorry

160
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Lin Sheng

161
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Do you think

162
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
when we grow up

163
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
we'll meet many people

164
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,800
and meet many things?

165
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,800
At that time

166
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
our memories

167
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
will become a dream

168
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Do you remember the first time we met?

169
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,800
You bit me

170
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I bit you today

171
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
I'm even now

172
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,800
I'll erase all your memories

173
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,800
I'll erase all your memories

174
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,800
I wish everything goes well

175
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

176
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

177
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

178
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

179
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

180
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

181
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

182
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

183
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

184
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,800

185
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800

186
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

187
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

188
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,800
I hope I can go to the university I like

189
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:34,880
I'll be back with great cover

190
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,640
A year later

191
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,040
That day

192
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,540
If you look at that!

193
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,920
Your fisheries sucks..

194
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,120
I will even teach you crafts benefit

195
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,440
For the second year

196
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,880
I will develop fish Corona

197
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,880
This Zoo shall learn of usual labor

198
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
Now this is out!

199
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,480
They do not have other customers

200
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,080
Then everything will be alright

201
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Didn't your teacher teach you?

202
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
Protect the environment.

203
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,080
Take care of the environment.

204
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
Thank you.

205
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Uncle, don't be so hard on them.

206
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
These kids are not good at everything.

207
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,080
You guys are always running around here.

208
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,080
We can't do business right now.

209
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
What else do you want us to do?

210
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I'll go to the bathroom.

211
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,080
Let go of your husband.

212
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,080
Let go of your husband.

213
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
I was wrong before.

214
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
But I'm not that mean.

215
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,080
I'm here today for a good cause.

216
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Not a bad cause.

217
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
I mean it.

218
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I'm here today to tell you my feelings.

219
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,080
That's it.

220
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Don't come here.

221
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,080
My daughter is still young.

222
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
She's not suitable for you.

223
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Why not?

224
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
What are you doing?

225
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Don't.

226
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
What are you doing?

227
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
I told you to do it.

228
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I told you to do it.

229
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,080
I'm pursuing my feelings.

230
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
How can you call it a mess?

231
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Well...

232
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
What's wrong?

233
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,080
Nothing.

234
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,080
Qingyun,

235
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
you're not young.

236
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,080
If you follow me,

237
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,080
I'll be in trouble.

238
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,080
If you don't follow me,

239
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,080
I'll feel bad if I don't follow you.

240
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,080
I'm afraid I'll be in trouble.

241
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
Let go of him.

242
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,080
Are you following me?

243
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
Let go of him.

244
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,080
Let's go.

245
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,080
Let's go.

246
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,080
Don't do it.

247
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,080
Let's go.

248
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,080
Let go of him.

249
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
Let go of him.

250
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,080
Who are you scaring?

251
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Let's die together.

252
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
I...

253
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
I'm scared.

254
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Are you okay?

255
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,080
Mom!

256
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
Mom!

257
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
Mom!

258
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,080
Mom!

259
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,080
Mom!

260
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
Mom!

261
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,080
Mom.

262
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,080
Mom, what are you doing here?

263
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,080
Qingyun.

264
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,080
It's okay.

265
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,080
I think something fell down.

266
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
What's wrong?

267
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,080
I'm fine.

268
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,080
I'm fine.

269
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,080
I'm fine.

270
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
I'm fine.

271
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,080
You should go home.

272
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,080
I'll stay here for a while.

273
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,080
I'll go home later.

274
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
Mom.

275
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
Mom.

276
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
What's wrong?

277
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Are you sick?

278
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Tell us if you're sick.

279
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Don't stay here alone.

280
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Mom.

281
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Mom.

282
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
I saw the door of the rooftop.

283
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
You're not home.

284
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
I don't know.

285
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
You...

286
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
You...

287
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
I don't know.

288
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Say something.

289
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Qingyun.

290
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,080
You're so young.

291
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
You're not that old.

292
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,080
When you were a kid,

293
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,080
you were only 4.2kg.

294
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,080
You were like a kitten.

295
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,080
You were so small.

296
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,080
You had small nails and small toes.

297
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,080
You were so small.

298
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,080
I didn't dare to touch you.

299
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,080
I was afraid I would hurt you.

300
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
What about your sister?

301
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
When your sister was born,

302
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,080
she had a long head.

303
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,080
She didn't change.

304
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,080
She cried like a baby.

305
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,080
They said she was a big baby.

306
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
You two are both my biological children.

307
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,080
You two are so different.

308
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
Your sister is so good-looking.

309
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,080
She's so bold.

310
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,080
She's so innocent.

311
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
She's different from you.

312
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
You've been so quiet since you were a kid.

313
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,080
You don't know anything.

314
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,080
You're so stubborn.

315
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,080
When we arrived in Hwansu,

316
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
we had a lot of things to do.

317
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,080
You were even more slow.

318
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,080
You were in a new learning environment.

319
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
You didn't drop out of school.

320
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,080
You were under a lot of pressure.

321
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,080
You were getting better.

322
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,080
I was so worried.

323
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,080
You were a good kid.

324
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,080
I didn't know what to do.

325
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,080
You always miss me.

326
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
No, mom.

327
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,080
You didn't miss me.

328
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,080
You didn't miss me.

329
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Every time I see you, I feel like I'm with your mom.

330
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,080
I'm so worried.

331
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,080
My heart hurts.

332
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,080
No.

333
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,080
I'm so worried.

334
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,080
I'm scared.

335
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
I'm scared.

336
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm scared.

337
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,080
Mom, what did you say?

338
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Yuqi.

339
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,080
Mom.

340
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
She's so mean.

341
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,080
She's so mean.

342
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,080
She's so mean.

343
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,080
She's so mean.

344
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,080
She has no one to say good-bye to.

345
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
She's been so nice to her.

346
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
She's a child.

347
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
She can't even bother me when I'm a child.

348
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,080
My mom and I are the ones who have to do this.

349
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
I regret it.

350
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
I regret it.

351
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,080
I regretted that day.

352
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Why?

353
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,080
I wanted to stay, but I had to go back.

354
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,080
I had to go back because of the war.

355
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,080
I don't know why.

356
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,080
I'm not his real mother.

357
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm his real mother.

358
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm begging you.

359
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Jingyu.

360
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,080
I'm so sorry.

361
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
Mom.

362
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,080
I don't want to be a bad daughter to you.

363
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,080
I don't want you to live like your father and I.

364
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
I don't want to ruin your life.

365
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
I don't want to ruin you.

366
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
I don't want to ruin you.

367
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,080
What are you talking about?

368
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,080
I don't want to ruin you.

369
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,080
I don't want you to live like our father and I.

370
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,080
Mom.

371
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,080
Mom.

372
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,080
You said it all.

373
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,080
Xiao Wu and I have to go to college,

374
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
we have to work, we have to get married and have kids.

375
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:32,080
We have to be filial to you.

376
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,080
You have to be happy.

377
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,080
What nonsense are you talking about?

378
00:34:52,080 --> 00:35:08,580
Inя

379
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,920
You just twisted my chances.

380
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,440
Give me back your weight,

381
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,360
That's enough.

382
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,840
When I finally came,

383
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,260
I knew I wasn't unique.

384
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,880
I'm always looking for something that matters.

385
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,880
He's always thinking about things alone and crying alone.

386
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,880
Whatever you tell him, he seems to be deaf.

387
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,880
He used to be a very clean person.

388
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Now he seems to be out of it.

389
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,880
Several times, I saw him standing on the rooftop alone.

390
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,880
Did you notice his mood of self-reflection or suicide?

391
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
Suicide?

392
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,880
According to what you described, your mother's depression may have increased.

393
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,880
I suggest she should be treated as soon as possible.

394
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,880
According to the current situation, it is very likely that you will have a birth.

395
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,880
We as a family should pay more attention to and improve our health.

396
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Otherwise, there is a risk of life at any time.

397
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Suicide?

398
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,880
Junyu!

399
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,880
Hurry!

400
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,880
I'm going.

401
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm going.

402
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
I'll have some water.

403
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,880
Let's split it.

404
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,880
Let's split it.

405
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Let's play.

406
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Did you hear that?

407
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,880
My dad, Qiao Qingyu, had another accident at home.

408
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,880
It's spread.

409
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
I heard that his father was the most powerful.

410
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,880
His father was in the noodle house yesterday.

411
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,880
He almost ordered the gas can.

412
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
Jingyu, are you sincere today?

413
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,880
You didn't bring it for a day.

414
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Let's go and have some milk tea.

415
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,880
If you don't like milk tea, let's eat seafood.

416
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Hot pot is fine.

417
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
Your sister loved it too.

418
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,880
Do you know why your sister was so popular?

419
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
It's all because of me.

420
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,880
I posted the most beautiful picture of your sister on the Internet.

421
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,880
Then there was the title of the most beautiful woman in Shuiyun.

422
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
I'm the real leader behind the scenes.

423
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,880
I'm the one who packed your sister.

424
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,880
Look at how your sister treats me.

425
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,880
She played with my feelings.

426
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,880
She's so good.

427
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
Guess what I found in the hospital.

428
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,880
Your sister is in love.

429
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,880
I love her deeply.

430
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,880
I hate her.

431
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,880
So I posted this news on the Internet.

432
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,880
It was a big hit.

433
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
It's all your sister's comments.

434
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,880
The most beautiful woman in Shuiyun is sick.

435
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,880
All kinds of download photos.

436
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
All kinds of messages.

437
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
It's all your sister.

438
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,880
Your movie is much more exciting.

439
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Qiao Beiyu is sick.

440
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,880
I'm not sick.

441
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Qiao Beiyu is sick.

442
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I'm not sick.

443
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,880
Do you think I'm going to harass you?

444
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Do you know how much I've been suffering?

445
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,880
Do you know how much I've been suffering?

446
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,880
If you didn't post it on the Internet, would Qiao Beiyu commit suicide?

447
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,880
What does it have to do with me?

448
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,880
What does it have to do with me?

449
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
Did you post it?

450
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
If you didn't post it, would you commit suicide?

451
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,880
I'm going to kill you.

452
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
You're the worst.

453
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Stop it.

454
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,880
Black dog.

455
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
Stop it.

456
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
Black dog.

457
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,880
It's okay.

458
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,880
What's wrong?

459
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,880
Are you okay?

460
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,880
The one who caused the death is her.

461
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
What did you say?

462
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,880
She's the one who caused the death.

463
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Brother, I want to tell you something.

464
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,880
She's dead.

465
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,880
I heard it was a child.

466
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,880
Are you sick? Who are you talking about?

467
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Qiao Beiyu.

468
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,880
Who?

469
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Qiao Beiyu.

470
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,880
I didn't expect Black to be the one who killed her.

471
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,880
She killed her sister.

472
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,880
She even killed her sister.

473
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
And she's going to take the college entrance exam soon.

474
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Sheng, don't think too much.

475
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
You have nothing to do with Qiao Beiyu.

476
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
She's good or bad. It's none of your business.

477
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Yes.

478
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm sorry.

479
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm sorry.

480
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I'm sorry.

481
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Yes.

482
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,880
Sheng, aren't you going to Beining to take the exam?

483
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
Yes.

484
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880
Are you ready?

485
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
What time is the flight?

486
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,880
Go to Beining.

487
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,880
Bring me two pairs of sneakers.

488
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,880
Let's play a game.

489
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,880
If you succeed, you'll get the title.

490
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,880
Let's play a game.

491
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,880
The game is over.

492
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,880
The game is over.
