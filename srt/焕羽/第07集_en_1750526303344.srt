You are different from them.

You are that kind of...

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
very pure.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Actually, I know what your sister thought.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
She is good for you and cares about you.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Although you were young at that time,

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
she didn't want you to know someone like me.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But it's useless.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's not too late for us to know each other now.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And,

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
look,

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
she is 18 times bigger than you.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The more beautiful she is, the more beautiful she is.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Don't touch me.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's wrong with you?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't come here.

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I won't.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What are you doing?

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You are mine from now on.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Your sister is mine.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You are mine.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Our car was hit.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Who?

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000

It's not coming up.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You hit his car.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Qiao Jingyu,

52
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
although I don't know

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
why you were fighting with those little rascals,

54
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I think they won't give up easily.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you for reminding me.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I will pay attention to it.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can call me Mumu.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll call you Jingyu.

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000

Come again.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you full?

82
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yes.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's go.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Boss, check please.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What table?

86
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Table four.

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Table four.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Three bowls of rice noodles, 36 yuan.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
100 yuan.

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Stop it.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can't.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's okay.

93
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is Qiao Beiyu your girlfriend?

94
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We are old friends.

95
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
So,

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
you are my half-brother-in-law.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You should take care of our noodle house.

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You should do that.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Why do you need money?

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Right?

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Are you mistaken?

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't know who you are talking about.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I don't want the money.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You can go.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Look,

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I am a big man.

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
How can I talk to him?

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
It doesn't matter if you don't know him.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It doesn't matter.

110
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you still a little girl?

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He didn't come for a long time.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Take the money.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will come again.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Come on.

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Excuse me.

116
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Boss.

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Boss.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are so polite.

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I care about you.

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Go away.

121
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are so rude.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's a misunderstanding, Ma.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He didn't come for you.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
How about this?

125
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This noodle is for us to treat you.

126
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I am so embarrassed.

127
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's okay.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It hurts again?

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's okay.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I will massage it when I go back.

131
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't let Qingli come to the store recently.

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Don't be so rude.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Those little rascals are scaring us.

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Besides,

135
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
we can't get through the store.

136
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I said no.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I am thinking about the store.

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
don't let Qingli know.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Sister, you have a guest.

141
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Xiao Huan.

142
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You work in your own store.

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
If you are tired, tell me.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It's okay.

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And tell me what you want to eat and what you need.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We will buy whatever we need in the store.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't worry.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't need anything.

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I even brought a washing powder.

150
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Have some water.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Okay.

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are so generous.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The building in the city

154
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
is not as comfortable as the old house in the old house.

155
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
How can the countryside be compared with the city?

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The big city is expensive.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Yes.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
There are eight people in the building.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The bathroom and bathroom are all public.

160
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You are back.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Let me introduce you.

162
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This is Qingyu.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
This is Xiaoyu.

164
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
This is your cousin, Qiao Huan.

165
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
This is the daughter of Uncle Pengfei.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Call her.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hello, Sister Qiao Huan.

168
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You played together when you were little.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You don't even know each other.

170
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hello, Qingyu.

171
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Sit down.

172
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Sit down.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Qiao Huan is

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
unable to work in the factory over there.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
So she came to our store to help.

176
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
So from today on,

177
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
you don't have to go to the store anymore.

178
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can go home after school.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll send you two home for dinner.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Really?

181
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Long live the old man.

182
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Qiao Huan,

183
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
you can stay on the sofa for a night tonight.

184
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Okay.

185
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll clean up the store tomorrow.

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We'll move out.

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Who are you going to ask?

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mom, what are you doing?

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Throw away all these clothes.

190
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You can't wear them in school.

191
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Why do you have to throw them away?

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
They're not fancy.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What do you mean they're not fancy?

194
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You threw them away.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What are you wearing?

196
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't you have school uniforms at school?

197
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
This one.

198
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's from Yang Rong.

199
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I bought it recently.

200
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's been two years.

201
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
It's been a long time since I wore it.

202
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's pretty good.

203
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
It's warm.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's warm.

205
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's warm.

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's warm.

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It's warm.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Okay.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What?

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Don't you think something's wrong with Mom today?

211
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's not like she's been acting weird for a few days.

212
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's weird if she's acting normal.

213
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Qiao Huan,

214
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I heard from my mom that you used to work at a clothing factory in Huanzhou.

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Yes.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm an adult like you.

217
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I've been working here for a long time.

218
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
It's been four or five years now.

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Aren't you going to school?

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm different from you.

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm not good at studying.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Besides,

223
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
girls in Nan Qiao Village don't get married

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
before they graduate from middle school.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
They just come out to work and take care of their families.

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
For example, parents who finish high school and college

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and finish college are only left with a bad reputation.

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The result is not as good as ours.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
My dear, I'm not good at talking.

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't take it to heart.

231
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's okay.

232
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But there are so many opportunities to work in Huanzhou.

233
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Why did you come to our small noodle house?

234
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I have a lot of money and I'm close to my family.

235
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Besides, my auntie is in a hurry to hire someone.

236
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I just want to help her.

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I want to hurry over.

238
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So it's not that the factory closed down.

239
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
My mom came to you.

240
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yes.

241
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The factory closed down.

242
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Look at my memory.

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Qing Yu,

244
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Uncle and Aunt really care about you.

245
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Qing Yu,

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
is the guy at the school's door really your boyfriend?

247
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Ch' Ch'

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Howless, why do you feel very happy talking to a big man?

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is so sweet! Doesn't she like it?

250
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Come, taste some, our horoscopes are tattooed.

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Music play!

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What's wrong with you?

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
She has a thing!

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
What's the matter?

255
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What's going on?

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You said he was going to make trouble with Black.

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Black was on the street.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
He's a famous criminal.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He's done enough.

260
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Why is it you?

261
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't know who Han Neng was.

262
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Stop looking, it's just the two of us.

263
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Aren't you going home? Let's go.

264
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You live here? I've never seen you before.

265
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm going to find Wang Mu.

266
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You're leaving?

267
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm leaving.

268
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You're leaving?

269
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm going to the police station.

270
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I won't leave, I'll stay.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:15:06,360
woman ships

272
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,120
The water heater has been broken for three days.

273
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,560
I think we should change it.

274
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,560
We'll have to take it apart

275
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,280
when we don't rent it anymore.

276
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,480
It's not easy to earn money.

277
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,680
We have to save money.

278
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,360
Don't be so careless.

279
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,000
Qiao Jingyu.

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,640
Come here.

281
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,480
He Fei told me that

282
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,040
Qiao Beiyu ran away from home

283
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,560
to Shunyu from Nanqiao Village.

284
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,600
Do you know that?

285
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
I...

286
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,560
I know.

287
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,200
Why don't I remember?

288
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,640
It's my parents who told me not to tell you.

289
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,960
I remember that day was very cold.

290
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,520
It was very cloudy.

291
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,640
It was snowing heavily.

292
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,160
I saw it on my way home.

293
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,320
Go down.

294
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,920
Yu.

295
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,080
Dad.

296
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,560
Mom.

297
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,040
I don't want to go back to Nan Qiao Village.

298
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,040
I don't want to take the college entrance exam anymore.

299
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:44,040
I want to stay in Shun Yun and be with you guys.

300
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,040
I can stay in the store and help.

301
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,040
I won't cause you guys any trouble.

302
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,040
Why do you have to finish high school?

303
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,040
Didn't you plan to go to the college entrance exam?

304
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,040
I don't want to study anymore.

305
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:03,040
As long as I can be with you guys, I don't mind not studying.

306
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Wei Yu Yang, what are you going to do if you don't study?

307
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,040
Didn't you hear what they said?

308
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
All the college students are studying.

309
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,040
We are high school students.

310
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
We can't even get a diploma.

311
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,040
It's embarrassing to say it out loud.

312
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I'm not afraid of embarrassment.

313
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
If you're not afraid, I'm afraid.

314
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Wei Yu, you have to listen to me.

315
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,040
You have to finish this book.

316
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Do you understand?

317
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
I know you're not happy right now.

318
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I know you've been by my side since you were little.

319
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,040
You've suffered a lot.

320
00:17:55,040 --> 00:18:00,040
But you've never suffered in your life.

321
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Sometimes, when you're in a difficult situation,

322
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,040
you have to hold on and hold on.

323
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Think about it.

324
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,040
You can't make fun of your future, right?

325
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:21,040
What your mom said makes sense.

326
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:27,040
It'll be fine once you get into college.

327
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
Mom and Dad, we're here to see you.

328
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Coming.

329
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
I'm sorry.

330
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I've never heard of her running away since then.

331
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,040
She's not running away because she knows no one will save her.

332
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
If at that time...

333
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,040
At that time, we were all kids.

334
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Even if we knew, what could we do?

335
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,040
What are you doing?

336
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,040
I'm going to ask my parents why they didn't save Qiao Beiyun.

337
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
No, you...

338
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:53,040
Don't tell me I told you.

339
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,040
What are you doing?

340
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Call the police!

341
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Call the police!

342
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,040
Call the police!

343
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Hurry!

344
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Call the police!

345
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Call the police!

346
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
Call the police!

347
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Call the police!

348
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
Call the police!

349
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Call your auntie.

350
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,040
Well...

351
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Don't be so rude to that kid.

352
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
What you're saying is...

353
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Qiao Beiyun was behind me and was having a fight with someone else.

354
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,040
I was the one who was wearing the green hat.

355
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I was so embarrassed that I lost my face.

356
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Did she owe me?

357
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Then do you think my sister owes me?

358
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,040
Is it a secret?

359
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
It has nothing to do with her.

360
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
You don't have a calculator?

361
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,040
A calculator?

362
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
Yes.

363
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,040
If...

364
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,040
If she did something wrong, I apologize on her behalf.

365
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,040
But it has nothing to do with Qingyu.

366
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,040
What are you doing?

367
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,040
Stop pretending to be dead.

368
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,040
I'm dating your girlfriend.

369
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,040
I can't let her down.

370
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,040
Besides, your girlfriend Qiao Qingyu contacted me.

371
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
I was the one who seduced her.

372
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Impossible!

373
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Impossible!

374
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,040
You don't know?

375
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Your daughter asked us about it.

376
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
It's not interesting.

377
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Nonsense!

378
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:43,040
Call your girlfriend.

379
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:46,040
Ask her in person.

380
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
Wait.

381
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,040
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,040
You're here.

383
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
The police are here.

384
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,040
It's okay.

385
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Brother, are you leaving?

386
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
It's okay.

387
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
It's okay.

388
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Let's go.

389
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Let's go.

390
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,040
Qingyu.

391
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:52,040
A girl should be careful.

392
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,040
She should stay away from those who are not dead.

393
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,040
Have I told you?

394
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,040
They said you went to them.

395
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,040
What do you want?

396
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,040
I just want to know who killed Qiao Beiyu.

397
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,040
She did it.

398
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,040
It's not her fault.

399
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,040
She's gone.

400
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:25,040
What else do you want to know?

401
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,040
If you keep investigating,

402
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,040
our family will be in trouble.

403
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:35,040
Did Qiao Beiyu tell you that?

404
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,040
What are you talking about?

405
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,040
Qiao Beiyu came to you for help.

406
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,040
But what did you do?

407
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,040
You knew she was bullied in Nanqiao Village.

408
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,040
You knew what kind of life she had.

409
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,040
You didn't save her.

410
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,040
What are you talking about?

411
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,040
I wanted to ask why you didn't save her.

412
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,040
But now I know the answer.

413
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Because you're too selfish.

414
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,040
You think that she didn't save you.

415
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
Qingyu.

416
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Qiao Beiyu.

417
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,040
They said you did it.

418
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,040
Aren't you angry?

419
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,040
Qiao Beiyu, did they say that?

420
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,040
Do you really want them to say that?

421
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,040
I believe you.

422
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Qiao Beiyu, say something.

423
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,040
Qiao Beiyu.

424
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,040
If it's true,

425
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,040
if you don't want to be like me,

426
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
stay away from me.

427
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,040
Qiao Beiyu.

428
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Qiao Beiyu.

429
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,040
Qiao Beiyu.

430
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Qiao Beiyu.

431
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
What are you doing?

432
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,040
I'm here to remind you that it's Uncle Ming's birthday.

433
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,040
What does it have to do with me?

434
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,040
It has nothing to do with you. It has to do with me.

435
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
My mom always bothers Uncle Ming when she's sick.

436
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,040
So I want to take this opportunity to thank her.

437
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,040
I have a rehearsal after school.

438
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
You can help me to talk to Uncle Ming.

439
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,040
Sorry to trouble you.

440
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,040
If you're not free or not happy,

441
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,040
just throw it away.

442
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,040
I won't.

443
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,040
Get a red envelope for four people.

444
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,040
400ml of snow syrup and a 10-person cold drink.

445
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
I understand.

446
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,040
I'm afraid you can't go to the hospital today.

447
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm fine.

448
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,040
A patient just got transferred.

449
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,040
She needs an emergency surgery.

450
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,040
Wait for her in the office.

451
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,040
I'll let you know when the surgery is over.

452
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
Wait for me.

453
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,040
I'm sorry.

454
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm sorry.

455
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,040
It's a medical treatment for people with heart disease.

456
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
It's a type of medicine for various diseases.

457
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,040
And remember that the patient is removed from the right side.

458
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,040
You must listen to the doctor's instructions.

459
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
We have to follow the rules.

460
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
We can't make mistakes.

461
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,040
Get off work.

462
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
I have to go to the ICU.

463
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,040
What day is it today?

464
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,040
Hello, Dean.

465
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
What day is it?

466
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,040
It's your birthday today.

467
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,040
You forgot?

468
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,040
Ming Sheng is here.

469
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,040
I prepared a cake for you.

470
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,040
She's waiting for you in your office.

471
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Go.

472
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Thank you.

473
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,040
Thank you.

474
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,040
It's cold these days.

475
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,040
Shen asked me to get a blanket.

476
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,040
Everything is fine in the city.

477
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,040
Even winter is warmer than ours.

478
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,040
By the way,

479
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,040
did you hear that?

480
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Mrs. Qin is gone.

481
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,040
What's going on?

482
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
After she came out of the fire,

483
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
she has been unwell.

484
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
She has been in a coma.

485
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,040
She has been in a coma for a while.

486
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,040
Her wound hasn't healed yet.

487
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
She spent a lot of money.

488
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
She has no other choice.

489
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
She had to take Mrs. Qin home.

490
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
She has been in a coma for a while.

491
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
She can't go on.

492
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Actually, death is a kind of relief for her.

493
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Mrs. Qin is good-looking and cultured.

494
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
But she is not lucky.

495
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
How can she call a person like her

496
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
a good-looking person?

497
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,040
How can she call a person like her

498
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,040
a good-looking person?

499
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
My mother told me

500
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,040
that Mrs. Qin has a younger brother.

501
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
His parents married their daughter

502
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
to get a wife for their son.

503
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Now I think

504
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
if Mrs. Qin didn't suffer from this,

505
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,040
she might still be alive.

506
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,040
If Qiao Beiyu didn't suffer from this,

507
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,040
she might still be alive.

508
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
Qiao Beiyu

509
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,040
I'm so sorry.

510
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
I've caused you a lot of trouble.

511
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,040
I'll clean up immediately.

512
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

513
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,040
It looks messy.

514
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,040
Qiao Beiyu?

515
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,040
So many kids?

516
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
How can I remember her name?

517
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,000
Xin Yu.

518
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yes.

519
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yes.

520
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Two.

521
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Oh my god.

522
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh my god.

523
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Who did this?

524
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's my fault.

525
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'll help you.

526
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
No, no, no.

527
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Thank you.

528
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Thank you.

529
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,040
Is that all?

530
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,040
Yes.

531
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
I'll do it next time.

532
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
Why is this still missing?

533
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,040
Who hasn't done their homework yet?

534
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,040
Where is he?

535
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,040
I don't know.

536
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
He was like this when I came.

537
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
You wrote your homework and hid.

538
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,040
Yingsheng, it's time for your homework.

539
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,040
You're here.

540
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I'm here.

541
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,040
What are you doing?

542
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
I'm here.

543
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
I'm here.

544
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
I'm here.

545
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
I'm here.

546
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
I'm here.

547
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
I'm here.

548
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
I'm here.

549
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
I'm here.

550
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,040
I'm here.

551
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,040
I'm here.

552
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,040
I'm here.

553
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm here.

554
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,040
I'm here.

555
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,040
I'm here.

556
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,040
I'm here.

557
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I'm here.

558
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,040
I'm here.

559
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,040
I'm here.

560
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,040
I'm here.

561
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,040
I'm here.

562
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,040
I'm here.

563
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Hey.

564
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
What are you doing here?

565
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,040
Are you in class?

566
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
I've heard about your noodle house.

567
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
I thought it was something serious.

568
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,040
It's nothing serious.

569
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,040
It's just a little talk for others.

570
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,040
You're pregnant.

571
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,040
So many things happen every day.

572
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,040
They'll forget you in a few days.

573
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,040
Did Qiao Beiyu feel the same way as I do now?

574
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,040
No.

575
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,040
He should be even more sad.

576
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Sadder than a thousand times, a thousand times.

577
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
I used to hate Qiao Beiyu.

578
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
I thought he was stupid and weak.

579
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
Even death was a burden on our family.

580
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,040
But I understand now.

581
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Because some wounds can never be healed.

582
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,040
He's too sad.

583
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,040
He can't stand the sadness anymore.

584
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,040
So he chose to destroy himself to avoid reality.

585
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
But I don't believe it.

586
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,040
Why should he pay for his choice?

587
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,040
But those who bullied him are still living in peace.

588
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Is there justice in this world?

589
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Yes.

590
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Who's going to solve this question?

591
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,040
It's okay. Let's continue.

592
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
F1 multiplied by F2 is the absolute value.

593
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Who doesn't know this step?

594
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,040
F1 is equal to 2.

595
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,040
It's smaller than F1 multiplied by F2.

596
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,040
It's twice the value.

597
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,040
You can see it from here.

598
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,040
Actually, it's two.

599
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,040
Because this is the zero point.

600
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Zero point is our origin.

601
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:56,040
You guys, don't run away.

602
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,040
Yes, sir.

603
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,040
It takes an hour to go to the gym in the bus.

604
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Why don't we take a taxi?

605
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Can you stop being so stingy?

606
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
It's been a long time since I took a taxi.

607
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Besides, it's a while before the game starts.

608
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,040
But I don't give up.

609
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,040
Why should he pay for his choice?

610
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:23,040
But those who bullied him are still living in peace.

611
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
The car is here.

612
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,040
What are you thinking about?

613
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,040
One for each.

614
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,040
Listen up.

615
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,040
Tie your heads up.

616
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Do you remember the new slogan?

617
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,040
Yes.

618
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,040
I'll shout out the name of the winner.

619
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
You guys shout out

620
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
We'll win the game.

621
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,040
I know.

622
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
You've been pulling us for 800 times.

623
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,040
Today is the final.

624
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,040
The winner is here.

625
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,040
You can't lose the chain.

626
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Okay.

627
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,040
I heard that the first and second place are strong.

628
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,040
There are some good players.

629
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,040
What are you afraid of?

630
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,040
The winner is here.

631
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,040
The champion is ours.

632
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,040
Of course.

633
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
The champion must be ours.

634
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
That's right.

635
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,040
Who are you looking for?

636
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Is Qiao Jingyu from your class?

637
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
Qiao Jingyu is looking for someone.

638
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,040
I'm not looking for her.

639
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Her boyfriend is looking for her.

640
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Her boyfriend is waiting for her outside.

641
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
Dad, mom, have some tea.

642
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,040
When you told me and your dad last time,

643
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,040
you said you had been dating for three years.

644
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,040
You haven't been dating for three years.

645
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
What does he want?

646
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,040
He's a rogue.

647
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,040
How can you say that

648
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,040
about your marriage?

649
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
Then tell me.

650
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,040
When are you going to get married?

651
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Mom.

652
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
I don't want to get married yet.

653
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
You don't want to or he doesn't want to.

654
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
All right.

655
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
He agreed to marry his parents.

656
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
That's good.

657
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,040
Don't be so shy when you meet the president.

658
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,040
Or you'll scare away all the good sons-in-law.

659
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
How can I not know that?

660
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,040
I'm just saying it in front of you.

661
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
All right. Have some tea.

662
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,040
Mr. Xun, why are you looking at us like that?

663
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Listen,

664
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,040
we're all students here.

665
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,040
We're different from you.

666
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,040
You're so interesting.

667
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,040
Who are we?

668
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,040
Say it clearly.

669
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,040
Qingyu is here.

670
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,040
Tao Xiyu, Zanfei's girlfriend.

671
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,040
Qingyu,

672
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,040
here's the noodles we bought.

673
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
It's delicious.

674
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,040
Why don't you go to our house to eat noodles?

675
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,040
What do you want?

676
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,040
Let's go.

677
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I've decided.

678
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,040
I'm going to make friends with you.

679
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,040
I'm not interested.

680
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,040
If you don't listen to me, I'll make trouble for you.

681
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:16,040
I'll pay back for what your sister said to me.

682
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,040
She died for a hundred years. You have to pay it back.

683
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,040
What did you do to Qiao Beiyu?

684
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,040
I'm jealous of you.

685
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,040
You're jealous?

686
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,040
You're jealous of her?

687
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,040
It's okay.

688
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,040
Although you don't look good,

689
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,040
I really like you.

690
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,040
You don't know how much your sister was like?

691
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,040
Shut up.

692
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,040
I said,

693
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,040
you don't know how your sister was like?

694
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,040
Especially when she drank.

695
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,040
She did whatever she wanted.

696
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
Let go of me.

697
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,040
Qingyu, let's go.

698
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
The End

699
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,040
Maybe

700
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,040
The more I care, the more cautious I am

701
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,040
The distance between us is getting smaller

702
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:48,040
One step closer

703
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,040
The future

704
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:04,040
Time will reveal the secret

705
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,040
Waiting is the reason for the sound

706
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:18,040
But it will never be over

707
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:29,040
So my heart is your name

708
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,040
The only stubbornness in my heart

709
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,040
From the first glance

710
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,040
Describe the future

711
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,040
The dream starts to come true

712
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:57,040
I realize that you have a place in your heart

713
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:03,040
The same story is hidden

714
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,040
Fortunately, you are not sensible enough

715
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,040
You didn't have the courage to come

716
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,040
So that the time does not fade each other
