1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Dark night, a guiding light Just like you, makes light to pray

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Breaking free from darkness You gave me strength

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
When lonely thoughts you threw I find my pain

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Drawing on the hope that you render me

5
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In this long journey, I bow, I move lightly

6
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
First love

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
头光

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:40,300
azaleas

9
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,780
Welcome to the game.

10
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,580
Mo Li Kai, come to the game.

11
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,060
Mr. Kang, Mo Li Cha, welcome to the game.

12
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,460
After school,

13
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
there is a basketball game in the school.

14
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,260
As the leader of the East Island,

15
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,180
everyone should cheer for us.

16
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,420
Come on, play chess.

17
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,780
Okay.

18
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,340
Qing Yu, do you want to play the game?

19
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,300
I'm not going.

20
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,940
Qiao Qiang didn't take her as

21
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,820
a part of our dance class.

22
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,780
You're right.

23
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,380
Let's go. Let's start the game.

24
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,580
Let's go.

25
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,540
Hello, welcome.

26
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,100
Thank you.

27
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,300
Wait a minute.

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,780
I need to get me a menu.

29
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
This menu,

30
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,260
do you need anything to drink?

31
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
I want to drink water.

32
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,140
The lemon tea and coffee in our store

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:57,940
are all welcome.

34
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,940
And we have a breakfast this afternoon.

35
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,460
Do you want to have a look?

36
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,500
Give her a lemon tea.

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,460
Okay.

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,500
Thank you.

39
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Thank you.

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,620
I'm going to have a drink.

41
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:08,740
Give her a lemon tea.

42
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Okay.

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,380
You look like your sister.

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,180
But I don't know why.

45
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,020
It looks like

46
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,820
you know the two different people.

47
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,420
Do you hate Qiao Bei Yu?

48
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,420
You asked me out today

49
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,260
to ask about Bei Yu.

50
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,180
Here is the bag.

51
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,780
Argentina has a blessed country.

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,060
There are many kids living in the countryside.

53
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,140
They come back from their childhood.

54
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,140
I've never seen such a beautiful girl before.

55
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,900
Li Hai!

56
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,620
Brother Yirui!

57
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:03,340
My sister is not pregnant.

58
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,020
Let's play together.

59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,740
Hello!

60
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Here you are.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Thank you.

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Brother Yirui!

63
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,860
Brother Yirui!

64
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,180
Brother Yirui!

65
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,660
Every day,

66
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,860
I was more beautiful than you.

67
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,060
I don't know when I was born.

68
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,980
My school classmates started to bully me.

69
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,020
They said I was not a father, not a mother,

70
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
not a family member.

71
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Those rumors are like a plague.

72
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,220
It's like a plague.

73
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,220
People always underestimate the power of rumors.

74
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
Especially in a small place.

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,220
It's too easy to want to destroy someone.

76
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
After I got into school,

77
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,820
I made him a mental guide.

78
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
I've never thought about

79
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,420
making a different choice

80
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,860
when I could go back to that time.

81
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
But I was timid and weak.

82
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,180
I was bullied by the rain.

83
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,180
I didn't even stand up to help him.

84
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,660
What are you looking at?

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,660
What are you looking at?

86
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,660
What?

87
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
You lost your job?

88
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,660
I'm a little bit of a loser.

89
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Nonsense.

90
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Don't move.

91
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,660
I graduated from high school.

92
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,660
I was a little bit of a loser.

93
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,660
I was a little bit of a loser.

94
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,660
I was a little bit of a loser.

95
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,660
I was a little bit of a loser.

96
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,660
I was a little bit of a loser.

97
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,660
I went to the College of Doctoridades at Ham broadcaster.

98
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,660
I also took test at Ham University.

99
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,680
Finally, we gone to Nanxiao Village.

100
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,380
I have been to find it before.

101
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,880
But I don't know how long it's been since,

102
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
It changed.

103
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
It's becoming more and more like

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,060
it didn't come true in the rain.

105
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,260
Run.

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Do as you like.

107
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Don't格i.

108
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,980
Or she could have known of our existence while we were structured.

109
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,700
I will likely be able to

110
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,140
tell you what,

111
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,420
and have you executed all of them.

112
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:38,900
I will be able to answer your questions.

113
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,060
and you will not be able to detach your soul from me.

114
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,060
He's already in trouble.

115
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,420
Does my parents know that Qiao Bei Yu was bullied?

116
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
Once, Bei Yu left home.

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,780
She went to Shunyun.

118
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,300
It was auntie Shu Shu who sent her back to the southern village.

119
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,900
So they know everything.

120
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,220
But they didn't save Bei Yu.

121
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,220
They pushed her back into the fire pit.

122
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,540
I believe they must have their own difficulties.

123
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,740
After all, parents are always good for their children.

124
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,940
So you want to say that

125
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,460
you also have difficulties in saving Bei Yu.

126
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,340
No.

127
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,100
I never wanted to be a burden to myself.

128
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,780
Now that I think about Bei Yu,

129
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,980
I'm still very guilty.

130
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,020
So what?

131
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,420
Qiao Bei Yu is dead.

132
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,940
She won't come back alive.

133
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,180
You told me this.

134
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,540
You just want to make yourself feel better.

135
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,180
You're weak and weak.

136
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,620
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

137
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:46,860
You're a help.

138
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,100
Qing Yu.

139
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,220
Qing Yu.

140
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,140
Qing Yu.

141
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,580
Qing Yu.

142
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,340
Wait a minute, Qing Yu.

143
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,020
Qing Yu, wait a minute.

144
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,060
What else?

145
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,100
This is a dance video

146
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,900
that was filmed in the high school.

147
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,620
I heard that she entered the Starlight Cup

148
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,620
in this show.

149
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,500
It's a pity

150
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,220
that she couldn't join the show.

151
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,860
Isn't that Qiao Qing Yu?

152
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,740
You're right.

153
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,140
I'm a humble and humble person.

154
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,780
So

155
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,180
you're more important to me than me.

156
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm a little bit

157
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,940
in the school.

158
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,620
Do you want to eat?

159
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,540
Yes.

160
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,100
Hurry up.

161
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,140
Let's go.

162
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,140
I'm going to the school.

163
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,340
I'm going to the school.

164
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,540
I'm going to the school.

165
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,740
I'm going to the school.

166
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,780
I'm going to the school.

167
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,980
I'm going to the school.

168
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,220
I'm going to the school.

169
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,500
I'm going to the school.

170
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,580
I'm going to the school.

171
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,780
I'm going to the school.

172
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,980
I'm going to the school.

173
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,100
I'm going to the school.

174
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,180
I'm going to the school.

175
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm going to the school.

176
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm going to the school.

177
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,780
I'm going to the school.

178
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,020
I'm going to the school.

179
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,140
I'm going to the school.

180
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,380
I'm going to the school.

181
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,700
I'm going to the school.

182
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,940

I'm going to the school.

189
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,940

Qing Yu, come to drink some water.

232
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm not thirsty.

233
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,900
Xiao Yu, your sister cleaned up those bowls.

234
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Coming.

235
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,300
Mom, you are so considerate.

236
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,600
I have to deliver the delivery again, and I have to wipe the table.

237
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,900
I have to wash the bowls.

238
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
So many people came here alone.

239
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
I can't do it because I'm not good at studying.

240
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,900
I'm just dirty and tired.

241
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
Let me do it alone.

242
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,900
Xiao Yu!

243
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,100
Xiao Yu!

244
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
What's wrong, Dad?

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:36,100
Here.

246
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,100
I'll take this.

247
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,100
I'll help you.

248
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Dad, did you see that?

249
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,100
This is what you do.

250
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,100
I'm not lazy.

251
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
Then you should be more active.

252
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
Go and wipe these bowls.

253
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Go.

254
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
What's wrong?

255
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
What's wrong?

256
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,100
wired

257
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Hey, sister!

258
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,100
You're not home after the fried noodles?

259
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Is there anyone? I'm from the Qiao family.

260
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
I haven't found your money for the fried noodles.

261
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,100
No need to find it.

262
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,020
Costa Jose

263
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,020
Continuation of theそれは

264
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,020

265
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,140
The score is layout 1

266
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,620
The result is 7 points

267
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,340
Today's database

268
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,500
will be sold

269
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,660
Next class

270
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,100
Let's try!

271
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,940
He is telling you the picture

272
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,900
Is this how he views pictures?

273
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,340
The students used by him

274
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,100
Have godlessцип

275
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,060
Your information has been shared

276
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,840
And you'll soon figure it out

277
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,060
I'm the sister of Qiao Bei Yu.

278
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
Do you have time today?

279
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Miss Su,

280
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,060
I'll talk to you later.

281
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
Okay.

282
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,060
See you.

283
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
Okay.

284
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,060
Bye.

285
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Come on, guys.

286
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
Tell me something.

287
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Next,

288
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,060
we'll change the subject to drawing.

289
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,060
Okay.

290
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,060
What?

291
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,060
You're making that look more and more like a ghost.

292
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
And two more.

293
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,060
I have time now.

294
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
I'm so hungry.

295
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
I want to go home first.

296
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,060
Can you do it alone?

297
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
Okay.

298
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,060
You can go home.

299
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Pack up.

300
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
Go to class.

301
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Su,

302
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,060
you're such a teacher.

303
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,060
You're obviously lying.

304
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,060
Let's go.

305
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
Brother Liu,

306
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,060
don't, don't, don't.

307
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:51,060
We agreed to eat together last time.

308
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,060
Why did you change suddenly?

309
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
You gave Zhang Yue a gift.

310
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,060
I've been pushing two jobs for this.

311
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,060
I have a lot of expenses in my life.

312
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Help me think of a way.

313
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:07,060
I don't want to be the one.

314
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,060
Give me a small house.

315
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
It's a month's worth of money.

316
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,060
Okay, Brother Liu.

317
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
I'll call you later.

318
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Hang up.

319
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,060
Qiao Qing Yu.

320
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,060
Sit.

321
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
Here.

322
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Thank you.

323
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
Drink it.

324
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,060
I'll treat you.

325
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
Thank you.

326
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,060
Your sister always mentioned you.

327
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
She even showed me your photo.

328
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,060
So she recognized it.

329
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Qiao Bei Yu mentioned me.

330
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,060
So you're friends.

331
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,060
Forget it.

332
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:55,060
Bei Yu is a good friend.

333
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,060
But I think she's a different person.

334
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,060
She's like a secret to a huge person.

335
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
She doesn't want anyone to know.

336
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
Do you know her boyfriend?

337
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Boyfriend?

338
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
He's a little cold.

339
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
He's beautiful.

340
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,060
He's been in the TV for a long time.

341
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:23,060
He's become a funny guy from the far-away civilization.

342
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,060
He's a very nice guy.

343
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
Let's go to the club.

344
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
Let's go together.

345
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
I like his man.

346
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
He can make me go around the world.

347
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,060
Xiao Bei Yu.

348
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,060
I have something for you.

349
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Thank you, auntie.

350
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,060
What kind of love is this?

351
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
It's so sweet.

352
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
If you have someone to give me,

353
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
I'll give you something delicious.

354
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
I'll give it to you when you're done.

355
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,060
You're welcome.

356
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
Baby.

357
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
Baby.

358
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Baby.

359
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
It's been a long time since we last met.

360
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Baby.

361
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
Isn't this Bei Yu?

362
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
Isn't she a motorbike?

363
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
How did she become a big fan this week?

364
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,060
She's a big monster.

365
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
She's beautiful.

366
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,060
There are so many people who pursue her.

367
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,060
She's very strong.

368
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,060
It's a pity that

369
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
all the people I met are people.

370
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
Honey.

371
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Honey.

372
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Honey.

373
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
Honey.

374
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Honey.

375
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Honey.

376
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,060
Honey.

377
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
Honey.

378
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Honey.

379
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
Honey.

380
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,060
Honey.

381
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Honey.

382
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,060
Honey.

383
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,060
I don't know how the hell

384
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
we are going to eat.

385
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,060
Please, uncle.

386
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
Let's go eat.

387
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,060
What the hell is this?

388
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,580
What are you doing?

389
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,060
I told you clearly that we have broken up.

390
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,060
What?

391
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,540
You said we broke up, so we broke up.

392
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,100
Did I agree?

393
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,060
Did I ask you if I agreed?

394
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,940
Why did you do that to me?

395
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,780
Don't, don't, don't, don't hit him.

396
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,780
Don't hit him.

397
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,220
Don't hit me.

398
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,860
Don't hit him.

399
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
Don't hit him.

400
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,860
Don't hit him.

401
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,860
Don't hit him.

402
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,460
Brother.

403
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,820
It really has nothing to do with me.

404
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,260
I don't know if he is your daughter.

405
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,820
What's wrong?

406
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,820
He seduced me.

407
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,020
You're afraid of the back of your head?

408
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Shut up.

409
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,820
You can do it.

410
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,220
Come, come, come.

411
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,820
Listen.

412
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,660
Listen to what he said.

413
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,420
You seduced him.

414
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
He likes you so much.

415
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
Really.

416
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,660
You're wearing a green hat.

417
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,460
You let me put this face on you.

418
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,460
You told me.

419
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
You said.

420
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
Say it.

421
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,220
Don't look at me, right?

422
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,820
Come, come.

423
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,860
I'll be with you today.

424
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,620
Come, come.

425
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
Come here.

426
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,420
Look.

427
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
He's called Qiao Bei Yu.

428
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,820
You've done me wrong.

429
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,060
Your sister looks so smart.

430
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:14,660
Actually, she's better than anyone.

431
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,460
Those men

432
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,260
just have to treat her better.

433
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,660
She just wants to live

434
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,060
her life in a happy and sad way.

435
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,060
The more she is like this,

436
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,060
the more she thinks she's a liar.

437
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,460
The more hurt she gets.

438
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,860
You finally come back.

439
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,460
Mr. Tang asked you today.

440
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,460
He said you were a student.

441
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,060
Don't think about it.

442
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,660
You're so stupid.

443
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,460
I've never seen anyone

444
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,860
talk about your father in love.

445
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,060
What's wrong?

446
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
Let me see.

447
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,060
Who did this?

448
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,460
Let's go.

449
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
Let's call the police.

450
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,660
Don't go there.

451
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,860
You've broken up?

452
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,460
I don't know.

453
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,860
Why is everyone

454
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,860
treating me like this?

455
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,460
I've given them so much.

456
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,460
Mom, do you think it's all my fault?

457
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,060
I don't deserve

458
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,660
to be treated well by others.

459
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,060
Qiao Beiyu, what are you talking about?

460
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,460
Can you be more clear?

461
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,260
I know I'm not normal now.

462
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,060
But I have no choice.

463
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,460
I really have no choice.

464
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:36,660
I can't control myself.

465
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,860
But Beiyu is like a heavy shoe.

466
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,460
It hurts when you get hurt.

467
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
I've tried to persuade her.

468
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
I've sold her.

469
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,260
She's useless.

470
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,020
Is there a boy

471
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,460
who can't be called Qiao?

472
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,460
I think

473
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,460
she mentioned

474
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
an old man.

475
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,460
What's his name?

476
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,460
There are too many people.

477
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
I can't remember.

478
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,860
How about this?

479
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,660
I'll ask around.

480
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,060
If I have any news, I'll tell you.

481
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,060
You should go home early.

482
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,260
Don't let your parents worry.

483
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Buy the pills.

484
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Sister Mengmeng.

485
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,260
If Qiao Beiyu is still alive,

486
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,060
will she become a dance actress like you?

487
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Have you seen Beiyu dance?

488
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,660
When music comes to mind,

489
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Wu Zi is out of her body.

490
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,060
She's been shining.

491
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,260
Her professional skills are the best in our class.

492
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,260
She won't be like me

493
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,260
who's in the class.

494
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,060
Beiyu said that

495
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,460
when she closes her eyes,

496
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,860
she'll continue to be a dancer.

497
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,060
She'll be a top dancer

498
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,060
in the future.

499
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,560
DO ON IT!

500
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,060
Hurry, hurry.

501
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,660
Stop dancing.

502
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,060
Stop taking a step.

503
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,660
Stop trying to be a謝謝 you song.

504
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,860
I wanna decode a move.

505
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,860
Remove a move for You You Watch.

506
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,060
Ok, get out of here.

507
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,460
Think of having anything.

508
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Stand there.

509
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,060
What are you doing?

510
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,060
I'm not doing it.

511
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,060
I just want to protect my house.

512
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Look, their house just opened.

513
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,060
We didn't have lunch.

514
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,060
We were watching the business.

515
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,060
We were watching some people who are not in a good mood.

516
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
They have money to harass us.

517
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,060
Right?

518
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,060
One bowl of fried rice with no spicy sauce,

519
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,060
two bowls of beef,

520
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,060
and one bowl of meat with meat.

521
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,060
Wait a minute.

522
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,060
What is this attitude?

523
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,060
You've never heard of Guhe?

524
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
You're so much like Guhe.

525
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
You don't want to earn money.

526
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
I don't have money. You have money.

527
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:23,060
You have money and you're still here to earn money.

528
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,060
Who told you that?

529
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,060
Is this money?

530
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,060
Take it away.

531
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
No, I don't want it.

532
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Forget it.

533
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
I'm a student.

534
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
26, 30, don't look for it.

535
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
I don't have money to earn money.

536
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:56,060
Who does he keep looking at?

537
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,060
Sorry, I'm late.

538
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,060
Sheng.

539
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,060
It's time to eat.

540
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,060
I'm hungry.

541
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
What's up, Xiao Qingyu?

542
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
Are you full?

543
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,060
Thank you.

544
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,060
You're welcome.

545
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,060
As a repayment,

546
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,060
we're in a good mood.

547
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
Well,

548
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,060
you can have another one.

549
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,060
I'll take it.

550
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,060
I'll take it.

551
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
I'll take it.

552
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I'll take it.

553
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,060
I'll take it.

554
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
I'll take it.

555
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I'll take it.

556
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
Have a rest.

557
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,060
Xiao Qingyu.

558
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,060
That day,

559
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,060
the coffee shop,

560
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
who was it?

561
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,060
I know.

562
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,060
Was it your sister's boyfriend?

563
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,060
No.

564
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
Then,

565
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,060
it was your sister's good friend.

566
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,060
I know.

567
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
I know.

568
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
I know.

569
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
I know.

570
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
I know.

571
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,060
I know.

572
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,060
Are you okay?

573
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,060
So, your sister was hurt

574
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,060
because of her first love,

575
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,060
and she was heartbroken.

576
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,060
So, if a man treats her well,

577
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
she'll be a patient.

578
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
She'll be so kind to him.

579
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
I'll find the culprit

580
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
and find justice for her.

581
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
It's raining.

582
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
Hurry up.

583
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,060
I'll take it.

584
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
What's going on?

585
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Why are you still in your hands?

586
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,060
Didn't you take care of it?

587
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
Someone else gave it to me.

588
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,060
Who gave it to you?

589
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,060
Xiao Qingyu,

590
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,060
I'm asking you.

591
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
Why did you leave it?

592
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:51,060
Did she help you learn

593
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,060
or did she give you the money?

594
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,060
I don't know.

595
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,060
I don't know.

596
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,060
I don't know.

597
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,060
I don't know.

598
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Did she help you learn

599
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,060
or did she give you the money?

600
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
You can't keep

601
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
these useless things in the future.

602
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
These are not useless things.

603
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,060
These are dancing videos of Qiao Beiyu.

604
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
You still want to learn dancing, right?

605
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,060
Try it.

606
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,060
I'll never

607
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,060
see you and your sister

608
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,060
become the same.

609
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:31,060
I'll never see you again.

610
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,060
Come on!

611
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Come on.

612
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Shao.

613
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,060
Yes?

614
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,060
Here.

615
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
I've been to the library

616
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,060
and the library.

617
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,060
I'm not hungry.

618
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,060
You're playing football well.

619
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,060
Why are you suddenly cold?

620
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
Yes.

621
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,060
I can't walk for the rest of my life.

622
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,060
Are you going to do

623
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,060
something that you can't see?

624
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,060
Shut up.

625
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,060
Shut up.

626
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,060
I'm sorry.

627
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I'm sorry.

628
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,060
Qiao Beiyu's pretty sister

629
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,060
told me you were looking for me.

630
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,060
Who are you?

631
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,060
I'm your sister-in-law.

632
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,060
You're from Nanqiao Village.

633
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,060
Do you want to know

634
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,060
what's on your mind?

635
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,060
Hello?

636
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,060
I'll take good care of you.

637
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,060
Xiaofang.

638
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,060
How was the thing

639
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,060
I told you last time?

640
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,060
What did you think?

641
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,060
What's the matter?

642
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,060
I'm Lin Qixi's son.

643
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
Have you forgotten?

644
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,060
I don't think it's appropriate.

645
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,060
Why not?

646
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,060
You know I'm a very hard-working person.

647
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:10,060
I have a house,

648
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,060
a car, a job and a stable life.

649
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I used to study abroad

650
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
and I got into a serious problem.

651
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,060
You're not young anymore.

652
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,060
I have something to do,

653
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,060
Chief.

654
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,060
Help me get the money.

655
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
You have to find a chance.

656
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,060
Think about it.

657
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
I'm here to find your dad.

658
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,060
What's wrong?

659
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,060
Are you sick?

660
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,060
The water is coming out.

661
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,060
No problem.

662
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Here, let me go.

663
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,060
37 degrees 1.

664
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,060
No problem.

665
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,060
I've told you.

666
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,060
It's just a normal cold.

667
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,060
You have to check this and that.

668
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,060
Okay, okay.

669
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,060
It's my fault.

670
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,060
Okay?

671
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,060
Here.

672
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,060
This is porridge.

673
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,060
This is medicine.

674
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,060
Go back and eat it.

675
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:08,060
Okay, I'll go first.

676
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,060
By the way,

677
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,060
don't tell that man.

678
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
He won't listen to his dad.

679
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,060
You still have to say.

680
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Thank you.

681
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,060
Have a good rest.

682
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
Okay.

683
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
You're a big man.

684
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
You don't have to call me auntie.

685
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,060
But the surgery is in the afternoon.

686
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Is the surgery going well?

687
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,060
The patient suddenly got out of the surgery.

688
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,060
Luckily, the director found the emergency point.

689
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
It's okay.

690
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
It's going well.

691
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,060
Where's Ming Sheng?

692
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,060
He's gone.

693
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,060
He's gone.

694
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,060
You've given him all the things you've told him.

695
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,060
He told me

696
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,060
not to tell him that he's been here.

697
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,060
You're so ridiculous.

698
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,060
I think

699
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,060
both of them are the same.

700
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,060
They're both honest and kind.

701
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,060
They're both very nice.

702
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,060
You're more like a wife than a wife.

703
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,060
You've been

704
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,060
the one who helped me

705
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
to find Ming Sheng.

706
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,060
You've worked hard.

707
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
I've worked hard?

708
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,060
I'm not working hard.

709
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,060
I've been treated well.

710
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
By the way,

711
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,060
my parents are coming to Huan Zhou

712
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
on weekends.

713
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,060
Do you want to have a meal with them?

714
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,060
You don't want to reveal our relationship.

715
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,060
I understand.

716
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,060
I've told them

717
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,060
that they'll keep it a secret for us.

718
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:48,060
But they don't want to reveal it.

719
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,060
Okay.

720
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,060
Let's have a meal together.

721
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,060
Hurry up.

722
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,060
Let's go.

723
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
Xiao Qiun.

724
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
Who are you?

725
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,060
We've been chatting online.

726
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,060
You forgot me so quickly.

727
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,060
You're Brother Hei?

728
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Yes, Brother Hei.

729
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,060
Let's go.

730
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,060
I'll talk to him.

731
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,060
I have to go home.

732
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Wait a minute.

733
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,060
You've been looking for someone

734
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,060
to call us.

735
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
What's the problem?

736
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
My mom is waiting for me.

737
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,060
You're not going home so early.

738
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,060
What do you mean?

739
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,060
I'll treat you to a meal.

740
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Take your time.

741
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,060
Have some good food.

742
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,060
Do you think it's okay?

743
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
There's a tea shop nearby.

744
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,060
I heard it's good.

745
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Let's chat there.

746
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,060
They look like good people.

747
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,060
Can we make up?

748
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,060
Let's go.

749
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,060
We'll talk about it later.

750
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,060
What are you doing?

751
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,060
You usually drink milk here.

752
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,060
It's a bit too much.

753
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
Listen to me.

754
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
There's a big brother

755
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,060
from Qiaoxing Yu's market today.

756
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,060
Hei Ge bought it.

757
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,060
You can order it.

758
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,060
Order it.

759
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,060
Let me see.

760
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,060
Order it.

761
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,060
I'll pay.

762
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,060
Do you know Qiaoxing Yu?

763
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Sit down.

764
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,060
Sit down.

765
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,060
Here.

766
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
Here.

767
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,060
It's good.

768
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,060
I like milk tea too.

769
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,060
Drink it.

770
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,060
Drink more.

771
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
I'll call you baby.

772
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
I used to call you sister.

773
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
How did you know Qiaoxing Yu?

774
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,060
A hero is beautiful.

775
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Someone stole your sister

776
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
at the KTV building.

777
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,060
I went there and put it on screen.

778
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
When we were in school,

779
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,060
your sister especially liked to sing.

780
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
She always went to my KTV building.

781
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
I took care of her.

782
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
It's been a long time.

783
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,060
We're good friends.

784
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
To be honest,

785
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,060
your sister is really pretty.

786
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
How could she be with me?

787
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,060
Isn't it like a big baby?

788
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I must treat her well.

789
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
Really.

790
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
I love her.

791
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,060
She can say anything.

792
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,060
It's been a long time.

793
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,060
It's not like that.

794
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:00,060
What baby?

795
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,060
Your sister is a fool.

796
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
She can believe anything

797
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,060
that is a man.

798
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,060
And she can be a man.

799
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
No, stay away from me.

800
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Stay away from me.

801
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,060
Don't you have any idea?

802
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,060
I'm your sister.

803
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I'm here to see you.

804
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
But I can see that you're different from her.

805
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,060
You're that kind of

806
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,060
pure and innocent.

807
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,060
So you're meeting in Huanjiao?

808
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,060
Yes.

809
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
Then I'm looking for the wrong person.

810
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,060
What wrong?

811
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,060
Sit down. Let me tell you.

812
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,060
I'm not looking for the wrong person.

813
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
It's me.

814
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,060
We have a fate.

815
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,060
You're looking for me.

816
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Do you know?

817
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,060
I've seen you a few years ago.

818
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,060
When did I see you?

819
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,060
When?

820
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,060
At the gate.

821
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,060
Look.

822
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,060
Baby.

823
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,060
Baby.

824
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,060
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

825
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,060
Come on.

826
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,060
I bought you flowers.

827
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Do you like them?

828
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,060
Thank you.

829
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,060
But I'm still so polite.

830
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,060
So you've been class for the past few days.

831
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,060
Are you tired?

832
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,060
I'm fine.

833
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:22,060
I'm a little hungry.

834
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,060
Let's go eat.

835
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,060
Go, Haixian.

836
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,060
I've already made the order.

837
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
Go.

838
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,060
Look.

839
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,060
Qiao Bayu.

840
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,060
Qiao Bayu.

841
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:35,060
Huanzhou, the barbecue.

842
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,060
This is the fruit

843
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,060
that my mother brought me.

844
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Who are you?

845
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,060
I don't know you.

846
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,060
Are you her sister?

847
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,060
I just said that.

848
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,060
I don't know you.

849
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,060
I'm so hungry.

850
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,060
You look like her.

851
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
I don't know you.

852
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,060
Tell me.

853
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,060
Baby.

854
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Qiao Bayu.

855
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
I've never met you before.

856
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,060
You're the one who's been hurt the most.

857
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Really.

858
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,060
Open it.

859
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,060
I know what your sister was thinking.

860
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
She's been good to you.

861
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
She's been in love with you.

862
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,060
Although you're young,

863
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,060
she doesn't want you

864
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,060
to know me.

865
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,060
But it's useless.

866
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:26,060
We don't know each other at all.

867
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,060
And look.

868
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,060
This woman is 18 years old.

869
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,060
She's prettier.

870
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,060
Don't touch her.

871
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,060
What's wrong with you?

872
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:37,060
Don't come over.

873
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,060
Don't.

874
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,060
Don't touch her.

875
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,060
Don't touch her.

876
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Don't touch her.

877
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,060
You're my sister.

878
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,060
You're my sister.

879
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,060
Don't touch her.

880
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,060
I'm so hungry.

881
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,060
I'm so hungry.

882
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,060
I'm so hungry.

883
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,060
I'm so hungry.

884
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,060
I'm so hungry.

885
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,060
I'm so hungry.

886
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,060
I'm so hungry.

887
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,060
I'm so hungry.

888
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,060
I'm so hungry.

889
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,060
I'm so hungry.

890
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,060
I'm so hungry.

891
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,060
I'm so hungry.

892
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,060
I'm so hungry.

893
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,060
I'm so hungry.

894
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,060
I'm so hungry.

895
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,060
I'm so hungry.

896
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,060
I'm so hungry.

897
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,060
I'm so hungry.

898
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,060
I'm so hungry.

899
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,060
I'm so hungry.

900
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,060
I'm so hungry.

901
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,060
I'm so hungry.

902
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,060
I'm so hungry.

903
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,060
I'm so hungry.

904
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,060
I'm so hungry.

905
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,060
I'm so hungry.

906
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:08,060
I'm so hungry.

907
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,060
I'm so hungry.

908
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,980
original

909
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,120
you
