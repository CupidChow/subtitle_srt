1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
What a lovely day.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,100
A very silent, lively fÃ¡il morning went by...

3
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,820
And still tonight makes the house feel better

4
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,220
Calling my friends morning calls

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,900
Kill makes life, turn pain

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,500
Breaking free from darkness

7
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,100
You gave me strength

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,580
Running for truth

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,380
I find my pain

10
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,500
Drawing on the hope

11
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,260
That you render me

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,980
In this long journey

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,380
I run, I'll make it

14
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,100
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,020
We need to hurry up and fix it.

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,380
The ceremony is about to start.

17
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,260
Let's draw a peach blossom color that looks like a washing machine.

18
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,100
Where's Wenxian?

19
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,780
Ya, did he leave it in the car?

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,860
At the door of the parking lot.

21
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,580
Forget it.

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,220
I'll take you there.

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,100
I'll find you a package.

24
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,660
Okay.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,420
Okay.

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,580
Jingyu, thank you for your hard work.

27
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,180
You and Xiaoying's skirt.

28
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:53,900
It's hard to hang this.

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,860
You can hang it.

30
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,420
Put it here.

31
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,100
Thank you for your hard work today.

32
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,620
Xiaoying, how did you know Jingrui?

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,380
That was when I was in the third grade.

34
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,140
Jingrui invited me to film a short film for the school cinema.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,540
Jingrui played the leading role.

36
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,460
I played the leading role.

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,820
Coincidentally, we played a couple in the film.

38
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,180
I remember I played a girl who was good at dancing.

39
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:31,820
After the film was finished,

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,060
we got to know each other.

41
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,020
We pretended to be real.

42
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,060
We really got together.

43
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,500
What's the story of that short film?

44
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,260
It's a love tragedy.

45
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,060
The leading male and female characters didn't get together.

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,420
Jingrui might feel a little bit of a bad luck.

47
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,860
So he hid all the videos of the film.

48
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,620
He wouldn't show them again.

49
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,660
But I think reality is reality.

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,860
Story is story.

51
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,100
Look, aren't we doing great?

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,900
We're getting married.

53
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,100
Sorry.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,220
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,260
Did you see Jingrui?

56
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,380
I saw him with Xiaoyun's makeup upstairs.

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,220
Put it down.

58
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,180
Okay.

59
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,300
Is this better?

60
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,180
Yes.

61
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,220
Okay.

62
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,100
Okay.

63
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,260
I accidentally hurt my hand.

64
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,020
I made my dress dirty.

65
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:47,980
Are you okay, Qingri?

66
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,620
I'm fine.

67
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,420
It's okay.

68
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,700
Just wipe it off.

69
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,860
Dirty clothes can be wiped off.

70
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,580
But the things can't be wiped off.

71
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:03,820
What?

72
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,340
Xiaoyun.

73
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,820
I hope you can be happy.

74
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,140
Okay.

75
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,780
Cheer up.

76
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:42,300
This is the only thing your dad gave me when we got married.

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,020
Today, you should dress yourself up with your bride.

78
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,700
Take her with you.

79
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,980
After the wedding, we can go back to Huanzhou.

80
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,540
Forget about the bad things.

81
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,100
You should live your life as you want.

82
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,740
Okay.

83
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,580
You should live your life as you want.

84
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,540
Be happy.

85
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,180
Jingrui.

86
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,300
Jingrui.

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,060
Look who's here.

88
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,700
Jingrui.

89
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,500
Long time no see.

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,620
Congratulations, Jingrui.

91
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,500
You're a good boy.

92
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,380
You're a perfect match.

93
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,340
Thank you.

94
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,140
Jingrui.

95
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,900
You finally got out of the single life.

96
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
You should be a cheater from now on.

97
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,940
Don't listen to him.

98
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,460
He can't get a good wife.

99
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,660
He's trying to get you.

100
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,740
Go and sit.

101
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,780
I'll leave two seats for you.

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,420
Okay, we'll go first.

103
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,060
Go.

104
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,340
Didn't you teach the rest of us?

105
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,620
Xiaoyun's parents told us to be quiet.

106
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,940
We're going to get married.

107
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,740
Minghai.

108
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,300
Sit here.

109
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,100
I'll go first.

110
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
Here, it's yours.

111
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:06,700
No.

112
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,060
Qingqing.

113
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,940
The wedding hall is empty.

114
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,820
Help me get it.

115
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,540
Qingqing, Uncle Zhang.

116
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:12,860
Congratulations.

117
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,340
You're here.

118
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,300
Long time no see.

119
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,340
Mom, Dad.

120
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,980
Uncle Zhang is here.

121
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,860
You're here.

122
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,740
Uncle Zhang.

123
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,860
Thank you.

124
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,740
Congratulations.

125
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,620
Mom, thank you.

126
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,660
Congratulations.

127
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,700
Congratulations.

128
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
Congratulations.

129
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,540
Congratulations.

130
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,900
Thank you.

131
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,940
Thank you.

132
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,900
Thank you.

133
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,860
Congratulations.

134
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,980
Congratulations.

135
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,940
Here, take it.

136
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,100
Once we get married,

137
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,860
we can go back to Huanzhou.

138
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,860
Let bygones be bygones.

139
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
You have to learn to live your life.

140
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,380
Qingqing.

141
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,260
What are you waiting for?

142
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,220
We're waiting for you.

143
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,100
Xiaohuan.

144
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,620
There's no board under here.

145
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,740
Let's put this one in.

146
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:02,940
Okay.

147
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,540
Congratulations.

148
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,660
Congratulations.

149
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,580
Thank you.

150
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,300
You're welcome.

151
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,940
It's my pleasure.

152
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,460
The child is very hardworking.

153
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,180
Thank you.

154
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,620
The child is a trouble.

155
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,820
No problem.

156
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,940
Bai Bai.

157
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,220
Why is Qiao Beiyu's family

158
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,660
still here today?

159
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,460
Yeah.

160
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,980
I don't know what they're thinking.

161
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,100
Jinrui is getting married today.

162
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,700
I don't want them.

163
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,620
Isn't this a bet for Qiao's family?

164
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,420
Yeah.

165
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,460
It's a big day.

166
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,900
Jinrui doesn't want to get married yet.

167
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,620
A child like that

168
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,980
is a bad luck for Qiao's family.

169
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,780
Yeah.

170
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,780
Soat sale,

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,640
Slip-slop miscellaneous goods,

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,840
and high- carrying apples.

173
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,600
Yes!

174
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,020
Thank you!

175
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,280
From this point on,

176
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,080
the Bride has taken over the charge.

177
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
Yes!

178
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
She'll work as a â©40,000 bondiddler.

179
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,440
Yes!

180
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,960
Stealing from Dr. Pi's purse!

181
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,760
Yes!

182
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,100
The operating goings on!

183
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,860
ScoringĞ¾Ñbirds are spending money on twins.

184
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,940
I'm begging them!

185
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,940
First bow to heaven and earth.

186
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Second bow to the heaven and the earth.

187
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,940
Third bow to the air.

188
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,940
The heaven is bright and the earth is clear.

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,940
The water is clear and the water is clear.

190
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,940
When you are weak, use a flower as a shield.

191
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Fight against the darkness.

192
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,940
To tell the truth, change your footstep.

193
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,940
Prepare to burn into a fire tree.

194
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:38,940
The ultimate death is forgotten by the living.

195
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,940
But no matter how lively the happy event is,

196
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,940
it can't change the sin of the heaven.

197
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Congratulations.

198
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,940
Congratulations.

199
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,940
Congratulations.

200
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,940
Congratulations.

201
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Congratulations.

202
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,940
Congratulations.

203
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Congratulations.

204
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,940
Congratulations.

205
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Congratulations.

206
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,940
Congratulations.

207
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,940
Congratulations.

208
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,940
Congratulations.

209
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,940
Congratulations.

210
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,940
Congratulations.

211
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,940
Congratulations.

212
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Congratulations.

213
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,940
Congratulations.

214
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,940
Congratulations.

215
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,940
This cowardly man.

216
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,940
He betrayed his family and his family.

217
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,940
It's what happened today.

218
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,940
The groom, Qiao Jingrui.

219
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,940
The family of the widow and the family of the parents.

220
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,940
In fact, they are sisters.

221
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,940
They want to cover up the truth.

222
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,940
They are throwing everything on the back of the head.

223
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Six years ago, all the men of the South Pole

224
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,940
participated in a massacre.

225
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
The victims are not worthy of a soul.

226
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,940
They don't even deserve to have a life.

227
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
It's a coincidence.

228
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,940
The victims are not worthy of a soul.

229
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,940
They don't even deserve a life.

230
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
The victims are not worthy of a soul.

231
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,940
They don't even deserve a life.

232
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,940
The victims are not worthy of a soul.

233
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
They don't even deserve to have a life.

234
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,940
It's a coincidence.

235
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,940
Do you want to go back, Jingxue?

236
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Then let's...

237
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Don't think too much!

238
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,940
Don't think too much!

239
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Tianhe, calm down.

240
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,940
It's already like this.

241
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Yeah.

242
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
There's no one to talk to now.

243
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
We have to find someone first.

244
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Why are you looking for him?

245
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
It's best to die outside.

246
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,940
Jingxue.

247
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,940
Jingxue.

248
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Jingxue.

249
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Jingxue, why are you crying so much?

250
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,940
They killed you!

251
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,940
You're not dead yet!

252
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
They killed you!

253
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
I'm dead!

254
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,940
I can't see you!

255
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,940
Jingxue. Jingxue.

256
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
You're so old.

257
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Jingxue.

258
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Jingxue.

259
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Jingxue!

260
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,940
Jingxue.

261
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Jingxue.

262
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Jingxue.

263
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Jingxue.

264
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
Jingxue.

265
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Jingxue.

266
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,940
Jingxue.

267
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Jingxue.

268
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Jingxue.

269
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Jingxue.

270
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Jingxue.

271
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,940
Jingxue.

272
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Jingxue.

273
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,940
Jingxue.

274
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,940
Jingxue.

275
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
Jingxue.

276
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,940
Jingxue.

277
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,940
Jingxue.

278
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,940
Jingxue.

279
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,940
Jingxue.

280
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,940
Jingxue.

281
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,200
So bad you read it?

282
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,900
Therefore?

283
00:13:52,900 --> 00:14:00,180
Because you didn't follow what the bank told you onantic

284
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,140
The plays would be awesome

285
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,140
The earliest class tomorrow morning is at 6.40.

286
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,140
Then let's go tomorrow morning.

287
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,140
The bus is at the bus stop.

288
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,140
Thank you.

289
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
Thank you.

290
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Is the bus here?

291
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,140
Is the bus here?

292
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,140
Miss, is the bus here?

293
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
We are at the bus stop.

294
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,140
The air conditioning is single.

295
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
It used to be 160.

296
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
It's late now.

297
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,140
I'll count to 80.

298
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
No, thank you.

299
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,140
Miss, how about 70?

300
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,140
Can you take care of the business?

301
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,140
I can't.

302
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,140
You are a young lady.

303
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
It's not good to spend the night at the bus stop.

304
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140

Hello.

348
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,140
I lost my wallet.

349
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,140
How much did you lose?

350
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,140
I lost it on that chair.

351
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:55,140
It disappeared when I woke up.

352
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,140

354
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,140

ID number?

356
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,140

357
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,140
Forget it. I might have made a mistake.

358

371
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,140
Excuse me.

372
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,140
What would you like to eat?

373
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,140
I don't like to eat.

374
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,140
I stole my wallet on the train.

375
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,140

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,140
The number you have dialed is unavailable.

381
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
No one is answering.

382
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Can I have a bowl of noodles?

383
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
But I only have five yuan.

384
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
Can you give me a little less noodles?

385
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
No.

386
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,140
I don't want to add eggs.

387
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,140
I don't have money to add eggs.

388
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,140
Forget it. I'll treat you.

389
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,140
Go home after you finish eating.

390
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,140
It's complicated outside.

391
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,140
A good person will not write on the brain.

392
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,140
You can't see it.

393
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,140
It's dangerous for a girl to stay outside so late.

394
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Go home after you finish eating.

395
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
Your family is waiting for you.

396
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
There is no good home outside.

397
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
Boss.

398
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
Can I stay for two days?

399
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,140
I can cook, wash, cut and cook.

400
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,140
My family runs a noodle house.

401
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I was going to Jiangzhou to work.

402
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:21,140
But I stole my ID card and wallet.

403
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,140
I transferred my money to the road.

404
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,140
I'll leave after I eat and make a phone call.

405
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Okay.

406
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
You can stay and try.

407
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,140
Thank you.

408
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,140
Hello, where are you going?

409
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,140
I'm going to Shunyun's Nan Qiao Village.

410
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,140
From here to Shunyun?

411
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
Yes.

412
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,140
It's 200 kilometers from here.

413
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Hurry up. I'm in a hurry.

414
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,140
I'm going to Shunyun's Nan Qiao Village.

415
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
I'll go to the village.

416
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:32,140
I'll go to the village.

417
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,140
I'll go to the village.

418
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,140
I'll go to the village.

419
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,140
I'll go to the village.

420
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,140
I'll go to the village.

421
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,140
I'll go to the village.

422
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,140
I'll go to the village.

423
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,140
I'll go to the village.

424
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,140
I'll go to the village.

425
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,140
I'll go to the village.

426
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,140
I'll go to the village.

427
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,140
I'll go to the village.

428
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,140
My kongfu is so hot?

429
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:59,140
Break some melee.

430
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,140
I'm going to have to use my holy blood to get it.

431
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,140
Get it?

432
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
Let's start eating.

433
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Get down right now.

434
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Wait a minute.

435
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,140
Sit down right now so you can have some drink.

436
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
Sit down, it's easy to get a miraculous new knowledge.

437
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
Ready?

438
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,640
I'm not going to leave you.

439
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,440
Look at your delicate hands.

440
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,640
They're like a white onion.

441
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,840
You're not even a hand that washes dishes.

442
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,040
Your hands are made of steel.

443
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,740
This isn't a place for you to stay.

444
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,240
You should stay at home.

445
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,740
I'm going to go. Go home.

446
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,040
So your family won't worry about you.

447
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,240
Madam, can you give me another chance?

448
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,940
I'll get used to it.

449
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,840
My family won't mind me.

450
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,440
I won't be able to get rid of them.

451
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,440
Then be careful.

452
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,840
Did you send that letter?

453
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,440
Are you okay?

454
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,840
Where are you?

455
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
I received a letter.

456
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,940
Hello.

457
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,940
Today, around 3 a.m.,

458
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,040
this number called me once.

459
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,140
Who is it?

460
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,640
Hello, sir.

461
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,940
We're not going to Nan Qiao Village.

462
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,740
We're going to Huan Zhou train station.

463
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,140
Okay.

464
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,540
Hello.

465
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,740
Hello.

466
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,940
Excuse me, have you seen this girl?

467
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:55,740
She's about to come to me.

468
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,140
Hello, sir.

469
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,740
Have you seen this girl?

470
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,740
Have you seen this child?

471
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
Have you seen this girl?

472
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,140
I'll leave you a note.

473
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,740
If you find her, contact me.

474
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,740
Okay.

475
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,140
Thank you.

476
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,340
How is it?

477
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,940
Is it good?

478
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,540
It's good.

479
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,240
How is it?

480
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,840
Over there.

481
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,640
There's a place we can go and ask.

482
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Here.

483
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,840
Look. Is this her?

484
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,040
Yes.

485
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,640
This is what you wanted?

486
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,040
To do a blackmail in a snack bar?

487
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,240
What's wrong?

488
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
Are you sick?

489
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,440
I'd rather die here. I won't go back.

490
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,840
Qing Yu, even if you hate them,

491
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,640
you can't do something like this.

492
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,440
You've hurt everyone in the family.

493
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,740
Come on.

494
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:20,540
I'll take you home.

495
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,740
I'm not going back.

496
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,940
Go home.

497
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,740
I said I'm not going back.

498
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,940
Don't call my mom.

499
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,040
Can you stop joking?

500
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,140
Your dad came to Huan Zhou last night.

501
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,440
He went to the train station to look for you.

502
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,940
Your grandpa and your second brother are here.

503
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,140
They're all afraid you'll get hurt.

504
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,940
Are they afraid of me?

505
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,540
They want to take me back and interrogate me.

506
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,940
Fei Hai,

507
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,440
you saw the note in the wedding hall box.

508
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,240
You know what Bei Yu heard.

509
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,440
Don't you feel sorry for her?

510
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,540
Ke'er, you're sick now.

511
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
Your grandma was knocked out at the wedding.

512
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,040
She's still lying in the hospital.

513
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,640
You shouldn't go back.

514
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,440
I won't change my mind.

515
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,940
Don't avoid my question.

516
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,940
Jin Rui bullied her when my sister went to college.

517
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,340
Don't you feel sorry for Bei Yu?

518
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,640
Jin Rui's family ruined Bei Yu's youth.

519
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,340
They ruined her life.

520
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:30,340
Don't you hate them at all?

521
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,340
Everyone makes mistakes.

522
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,340
The truth is that Bei Yu has left us.

523
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Even if I hate Jin Rui, will it help?

524
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,940
I won't be as impulsive as you.

525
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,740
Qing Yue,

526
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,240
this whole thing is going crazy.

527
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,840
Your family has accumulated so many years of fame.

528
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,340
It's all ruined overnight.

529
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,940
Including so many innocent people.

530
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,740
They're all involved in this.

531
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,840
No one is innocent.

532
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,540
My grandparents,

533
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,740
my uncle, aunt, dad, mom,

534
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,440
they're all helping Jin Rui.

535
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,240
They're lying to Bei Yu for Jin Rui's sake.

536
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,740
They're all accomplices.

537
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:21,040
All these years,

538
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,240
I've been very cruel to Bei Yu.

539
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,140
I think he's got the whole family involved.

540
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,040
He ruined our lives.

541
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,740
He caused us innocent people to suffer so much.

542
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:36,740
Until I found out about Jin Rui,

543
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
I realized

544
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:44,240
Bei Yu didn't ruin our lives.

545
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,240
They pushed him into a deadlock.

546
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:55,540
Bei Yu was actually very cheerful.

547
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,140
To be honest,

548
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,040
no one could tell what he went through.

549
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,240
That's because he kept it all in his heart.

550
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,240
Do you remember what he wrote in his diary?

551
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
He...

552
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,440
He was blaming me.

553
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,740
He was timid and cowardly.

554
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,240
When he was bullied,

555
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I couldn't stand up to help him.

556
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,740
On the contrary.

557
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:27,240
What he wrote in his diary.

558
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
Your actions.

559
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Bei Yu.

560
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,740
Bei Yu.

561
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,240
It's the only warmth he's felt in the past few years.

562
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,040
He's already gone.

563
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,040
We still have to humiliate him with such harsh words.

564
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,040
And live a new life like nothing happened.

565
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,040
It shouldn't be like this.

566
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,040
I don't regret telling the truth about Qiao Bei Yu.

567
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,540
Qing Yu.

568
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,040
Qing Yu.

569
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,040
Qing Yu.

570
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,540
Qing Yu.

571
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,040
Qing Yu.

572
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,040
The patient is not well. Don't recognize him.

573
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,040
The large-scale blood transfusion

574
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,040
is caused by the large-scale blood transfusion caused by the Rani-na phenomenon.

575
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:50,040
The blood transfusion has been frequent since January.

576
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Currently, more than 20 entities have been affected.

577
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,040
The Rani-na phenomenon is a phenomenon that has been reported to the public.

591
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,940
...

592
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,040
Wei Yu.

593
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I got justice for you.

594
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,140
But why don't I feel relaxed?

595
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,940
Instead I'm more and more mÃ©sed up.

596
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:05,040
The only thing that's in my heart is your name

597
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:11,040
The only thing that's in my heart is your stubbornness

598
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:19,040
From the first glance, I can see the future

599
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,040
The dream has just begun to come true

600
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,040
So your heart is also unknown

601
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Hiding the same story

602
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Fortunately, you're not smart enough

603
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,040
The courage is also buried

604
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:56,040
So that time never fails to meet

605
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,040
The courage is also buried

606
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:24,040
So that time never fails to meet

607
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,040
The dream has just begun to come true

608
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,040
The courage is also buried

609
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,040
So that time never fails to meet

610
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,040
I know you don't want to be found by your family

611
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,040
So I made a picture for you

612
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,040
A bold and gentle one

613
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:52,040
Aren't you abroad? When did you come back?

614
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Didn't I tell you?

615
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,040
I'll always be with you

616
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,040
I'll always be with you

617
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,040
Don't go!

618
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Don't go!

619
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,040
Don't go!

620
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Don't go!

621
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:21,140
oh

622
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:30,140
ï¿½

623
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,140
What's wrong?

624
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,140
Help!

625
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,140
What's wrong?

626
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,140
She fainted suddenly.

627
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
Help!

628
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,140
Help!

629
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
What's wrong?

630
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
She fainted suddenly.

631
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,140
Put her down.

632
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,140
Put her down.

633
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,140
Auntie.

634
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Did I do something wrong?

635
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:19,140
I don't think you did anything wrong.

636
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:26,140
Then why did I do something right?

637
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:29,140
But I always feel scared.

638
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:38,140
Didn't you say you were not afraid of anything?

639
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,140
I used to be not afraid of anything.

640
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,140
But when I finished doing it,

641
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,140
I found myself very timid.

642
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,140
I didn't dare to go to the wedding.

643
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,140
I was also worried about how my grandparents and uncle would treat my parents.

644
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,140
If the people in the operating room were really Jin Rui and Xiao Lin,

645
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:05,140
what should I do?

646
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:07,140
Don't think too much.

647
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:14,140
Just take good care of yourself.

648
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:22,140
Can you give me some money?

649
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
It's useless to ask for money now.

650
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,140
If you are outside now,

651
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:30,140
it's impossible.

652
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,140
Your parents have put the time notice on the newspaper.

653
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:40,140
You are now a news person.

654
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,140
You don't have to worry about these things.

655
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,140
Just give me some money.

656
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,140
How can I not worry about it?

657
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:53,140
I ran back and forth to watch the fun.

658
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,140
I know there is a place

659
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,140
that I can guarantee that your family will not find you.

660
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:07,140
Let's go.

661
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:35,140
I'm going to the bathroom.

662
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,140
Hello, sister.

663
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,140
I'm here.

664
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:39,140
You came so early today.

665
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
I have no choice.

666
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,140
Are you cold?

667
00:39:46,140 --> 00:40:02,140
This way.

668
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:24,140
It's so comfortable.

669
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:27,140
My grandfather left this cage.

670
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:33,140
I didn't expect that I would have a day like this.

671
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:36,140
Your family has searched the whole Huanzhou.

672
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:39,140
They definitely didn't expect that you would hide under their eyes.

673
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,140
So, in this way,

674
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:56,140
the most dangerous place is the safest place.
