00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,660
I know your love is almost un banget

3
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,660
it's quite cruel

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,660
And sometimes I just want to

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,220
cry my eyes out

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,860
Sing your song

7
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:21,720

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,940
I know you're so According to

00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,360
my toys

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,240
However I wish

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,820
My time

12
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:38,820
Breaking free from darkness You gave me strength

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,820
But in fact, I find my pain

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:54,820
Drawing on the hope That you render me

15
00:00:54,820 --> 00:01:02,820
In this long journey I run, I run like a dream

16
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,820
Hey, it's so cold outside.

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,820
Do you want to take a hot shower first?

18
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,820
It's warm.

19
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,820
I didn't change my clothes.

20
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,820
It's okay. You can wear mine first.

21
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
These clothes have been washed.

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,820
Very clean.

23
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,820
Don't worry.

24
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,820
Don't you want to break up?

25
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,820
I'm not that kind of person.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
Thank you.

27
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Here.

28
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I find my pain

30
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Drawing on the hope That you render me

31
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:14,820
In this long journey I run, I run like a dream

32
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820

Ooh

36
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,820
During the dark night

37
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,820
A guarding light Just like you

38
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,820
Makes light Turn bright

39
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:14,820
Breaking free from darkness You gave me strength

40
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:21,820
But in fact, I find my pain

41
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:29,820
Drawing on the hope That you render me

42
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:37,820
In this long journey I run, I run like a dream

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
Ooh

44
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,820

Ooh

47
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,820
You go to the drawer and take your medicine.

48
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,820
The one on the left?

49
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
Yes.

50
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,820
Is his leg injured?

51
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
Did he fall?

52
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Yes, it's possible.

53
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
Just put the medicine on him.

54
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Be good.

55
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,820
It'll be fine soon.

56
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
Don't move.

57
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,820
Be good.

58
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,820
It's okay.

59
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,820
It'll be fine soon.

60
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,820
You're so good.

61
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,820
I'm not.

62
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
I'm not.

63
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,820
I'm not.

64
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
I'm not.

65
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,820
I'm not.

66
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm not.

67
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
I'm not.

68
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm not.

69
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
I'm not.

70
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
You're so good.

71
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,820
What's the big deal?

72
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,820
My dad is an excellent surgeon.

73
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
No wonder he wants you to be a doctor.

74
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,820
Does it smell good, Jiu Jiu?

75
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,820
What do you think of Jiu Jiu's name?

76
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Jiu Jiu?

77
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Are you calling her Jiu Jiu?

78
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
Because she sounds like Jiu Jiu.

79
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Do you still want her?

80
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
You should call her my name.

81
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Jiu Jiu.

82
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,820
Jiu Jiu.

83
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:35,820
Do you think your name sounds good?

84
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,820
Jiu Jiu.

85
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Jiu Jiu.

86
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,820
Oh, right.

87
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,820
I've asked around about the two new people in the hospital.

88
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,820
They're from the same family.

89
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,820
So, your cousin is fine.

90
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,820
Don't worry.

91
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
Thank you.

92
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,820
You don't have to thank me.

93
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Anyway, I didn't expect you to be so bold

94
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
to defend your sister.

95
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,820
I used to think you hated her.

96
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,820
I have the same blood as Qiao Beiyu.

97
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,820
It's not something you can define by liking or hating.

98
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
I just think she's pathetic.

99
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,820
But our whole family is pathetic, right?

100
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,820
No.

101
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
If I wasn't in this world,

102
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Qiao Beiyu could have a completely different life

103
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,820
and grew up in Shunyun.

104
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,820
So I made her leave.

105
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,820
I don't have the right to hate her.

106
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,820
I'm not that bad.

107
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
I'm not that bad.

108
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,820
She won't hate you.

109
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,820
You don't have to comfort me.

110
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
I know what's going on.

111
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,820
It's because I took her life.

112
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,820
So I think it's my responsibility to get back what I really am.

113
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Even if I don't like her, I'll still do it.

114
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
But I know Jingrui is fine.

115
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
I'm just being nice.

116
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,820
Anyway, I really appreciate your courage and your behavior.

117
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,820
Do you think Jiu Jiu is like me?

118
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,820
We just learned to fly and we fell down.

119
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
You two will get better.

120
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
But before that,

121
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,820
we have to eat first.

122
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Then we can get better.

123
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
Okay.

124
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Thank you.

125
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,820
Hello.

126
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,820
Goodbye.

127
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
I'm Manager Cao's mother.

129
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Yes, I called her a few days ago.

130
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
I want to ask if she has contacted you.

131
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Think about it.

132
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
What else do you want to say?

133
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
You heard it.

134
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
You know a lot of people.

135
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
You must have a way.

136
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
13... 1339.

137
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,820
Ma Mingkai.

138
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,820
Ma Mingkai.

139
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,820
Think about it again.

140
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Think about it again.

141
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,820
Hello.

142
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,820
Hello.

143
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,820
Is this Qingjiang Road Police Station?

144
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Yes.

145
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,820
Are you Qiao Jingyu's family?

146
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,820
Yes, I'm Qiao Jingyu's mother.

147
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
We just caught a girl by the river.

148
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
She's over 20 years old.

149
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,820
If we find her, I'll definitely...

150
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,820
I...

151
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
I'll tell you later.

152
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,820
What's wrong?

153
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,820
Where's my clothes?

154
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,820
What's wrong?

155
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,820
The river...

156
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:04,820
I'm going up.

157
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Girl.

158
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,820
From the car, it's not your family.

159
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,820
I'm scared.

160
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,820
I'm scared to death.

161
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,820
What?

162
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,820
I'm going to see her.

163
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Let go.

164
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Let go.

165
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
I'm going to see her.

166
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
We're not the same age.

167
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Why are we going to see her?

168
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,820
Let go.

169
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
Let go.

170
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,820
I'm going to see her.

171
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Let go.

172
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
I'm scared to death.

173
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,820
It's not a shock.

174
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
I'm so happy.

175
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,820
No, it's not.

176
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
If it's true, the police will tell us.

177
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
Okay?

178
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
Are you okay?

180
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Are you going to leave after you get better?

181
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,820
Where are you going?

182
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,820
I'm going to a place with more people and bigger places.

183
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,820
Beining, Jiangzhou.

184
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Do you have money?

185
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,820
Last time you helped me with the money.

186
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,820
I'm going to the city.

187
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
I'm going to the city.

188
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,820
I'm going to the city.

189
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
Last time you helped me print the information.

190
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
You took me to the hospital.

191
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
You wanted me to stay at your house.

192
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,820
I'll give you money when I get there.

193
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
I just lost my wallet.

194
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
I'll give it to you when I make money.

195
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,820
Qiu Jingyu, what do you mean?

196
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,820
Do you think I'm helping you for money?

197
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Since you've decided to leave, I'll go with you.

198
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Go wherever you want.

199
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
Don't get me wrong.

200
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Anyway, I wanted to leave the house before.

201
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,820
I wanted to leave the house before.

202
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,820
Now I can still be with you.

203
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,820
That's good.

204
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,820
And you always make yourself suffer.

205
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,820
I'm not worried about you going alone.

206
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
I know you're serious.

207
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,820
But I hope you don't be impulsive.

208
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
I'm not impulsive.

209
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
No, I mean,

210
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
thank you for being so warm-hearted to help me.

211
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
You came back to me from so far away.

212
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
I owe you a favor.

213
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,820
I'm not helping you because I'm warm-hearted.

214
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
Anyway, I've decided my own business.

215
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:31,820
It's none of your business.

216
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm going to go with you.

217
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Okay.

218
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,820
I'm going with you.

219
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Okay.

220
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,820
Mom, it's getting dark.

221
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Let's go back.

222
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Have you seen this student?

223
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
She's from the same school as you.

224
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,820
Have you seen this girl?

225
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,820
No.

226
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Let me see.

227
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
Have you seen this kid?

228
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Thank you.

229
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,820
Thank you.

230
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,820
Qingyu.

231
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
Qingyu.

232
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,820
What are you doing?

233
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,820
Drive.

234
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,820
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
Qingyu.

236
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
What?

238
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,820
Mom, this is not Qingyu.

239
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
We've already called the police.

240
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
The police are looking for someone who's not worse than us.

241
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,820
Let's go back, okay?

242
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,820
Okay.

243
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:33,820
Okay, mom.

244
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,820
Let's go back.

245
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,820
Mom.

246
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Mom.

247
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,820
I'm sorry.

248
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,820
How is it?

249
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,820
It's nice.

250
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,820
You can't listen to it for nothing.

251
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,820
What is this?

252
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,820
This is not valuable,

253
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
but it's my lucky charm.

254
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,820
I've always carried it with me.

255
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
It's for you.

256
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,820
Qiao Jingyu, I'm just kidding.

257
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I don't want it.

258
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:49,820
I know.

259
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,820
But now is the most difficult and lonely time for me.

260
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
Only you are with me.

261
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
Thank you.

262
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Okay.

263
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,820
Thank you for receiving it.

264
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,820
This thing will be our token in the future.

265
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,820
But it's not a fixed token.

266
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
I won't take advantage of you.

267
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
What are you doing?

268
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
I'm fine. Wait for me.

269
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Are you going to come with me?

270
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Do you know?

271
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
I saw him when I moved in.

272
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
So, I knew him first,

273
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
then I knew you.

274
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,820
I think I can just stay on the chair for a while.

275
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,820
No need.

276
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:17,820
You can sleep here today.

277
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
You can sleep on the bed.

278
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
And I'll sleep on the carpet.

279
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Oh, right.

280
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,820
This thing is not good for me.

281
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
But I'm a gentleman.

282
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
I won't peek.

283
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,820
Don't worry.

284
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,820
Qiao Jingyu,

285
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,820
how about I tell you a story before you go to bed?

286
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Okay.

287
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,820
I'll go to bed.

288
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Okay.

289
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,820
I'll go to bed.

290
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,820
Okay.

291
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,820
I'll go to bed.

292
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,820
Okay.

293
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
I'll go to bed.

294
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,820
Okay.

295
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,820
I'll go to bed.

296
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,820
I'll tell you a story before you go to bed.

297
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,820
Okay.

298
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
Do you remember the first time we met?

299
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
You were fighting with someone.

300
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,820
You were playing with me by the river.

301
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,820
I lost the game.

302
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,820
But I bit you.

303
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,820
I think we're even now.

304
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Actually, that wasn't the first time we met.

305
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,820
I remember five years ago,

306
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
I went to Hanzhou Theater to see my mom.

307
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,820
Sheng, wait inside.

308
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,820
When your mom is done with her work,

309
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
I'll come back and see you.

310
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,820
Everyone, hurry up!

311
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,820
Let's have a meeting after 10 minutes!

312
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Three, two, three, four, five.

313
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,820
Legs out.

314
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,820
Five, six, seven, go.

315
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

316
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,820
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

317
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,820
Three, two, three, four, five.

318
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,820
Six, seven, eight.

319
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,820
One, two, three, four.

320
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,820
Stop.

321
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,820
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

322
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,820
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

323
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,820
So I didn't expect that

325
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,820
we would meet again in five years.

326
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,820
But

327
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,820
I recognized you at first sight.

328
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,820
You peeked at me.

329
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,820
I didn't peek at you.

330
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
You jumped up on your own.

331
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,820
And you had to feel that I was beating you up.

332
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,820
But

333
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:13,820
you were cuter than you are now.

334
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,820
Others jump on the swan lake.

335
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
But you are a fat duck.

336
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,820
You are a fat duck.

337
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,820
What is that sound?

338
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
Di Zheng.

339
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,820
Di Zheng?

340
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,820
Di Zheng, come here.

341
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,820
Di Zheng.

342
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,820
Don't worry. I read in the book.

343
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,820
As long as Di Zheng is hiding in the corner of the wall,

344
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
nothing will happen.

345
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,820
And I don't think the feeling of the shock was strong.

346
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,820
So it shouldn't be.

347
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
I have a life-threatening condition.

348
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,820
Xiao Jing.

349
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,820
If Di Zheng really died,

350
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:00,820
we would have to go through the same thing.

351
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,820
We won't die.

352
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,820
What do you mean by Di Zheng really died?

353
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,820
You fooled me.

354
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Xiao Jing.

355
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
Don't worry.

356
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,820
If you really die,

357
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,820
I will take you away with my father.

358
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,820
You said

359
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,820
you would let me say that to you.

360
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,820
You are a child.

361
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,820
You can't even take care of yourself.

362
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:50,820
What else can you do?

363
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
Don't just stand there.

364
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
Go and think of something.

365
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,820
Don't be angry.

366
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,320
What's the use of your mother's

367
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:20,820
Three-legged Crab?

368
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
Isn't this looking for it?

369
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,820
Dear audience,

370
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
the place I am now is Chaoyang New Village.

371
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,820
Last night,

372
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,820
we received the help of the citizens of the city

373
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
of Li Da,

374
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,820
saying that her daughter is in the second grade

375
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,820
and suddenly ran away from home.

376
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
We don't know the exact reason.

377
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:33,820
Next,

378
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,820
we will go to Li Da's house

379
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,820
to understand the specific situation.

380
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,820
If any of the citizens' friends have any relevant clues,

381
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:41,820
please contact us in time.

382
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,820
The police have already informed us

383
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,820
about the train station, airport and train station.

384
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,820
They will tell us as soon as they have any news.

385
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,820
Someone in the county said that they saw Guo Qingyu.

386
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,820
They helped to get the surveillance footage.

387
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,820
The scan photo will be transferred to us in the afternoon.

388
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,820
Dad, drink some tea.

389
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,820
This house is all in your hands.

390
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,820
Why are you saying that people are crazy?

391
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
Dad, mom, the reporter is here.

392
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Dad, mom, the reporter is here.

393
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,820
Dad, mom, the reporter is here.

394
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
Actually,

395
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,820
I didn't want to make things worse.

396
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,820
I have tried the method of communication.

397
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,820
But no matter what method we used,

398
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,820
we still didn't seek justice for Bei Yu.

399
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Since now everyone knows the truth,

400
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,820
no matter how angry they are,

401
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,820
they are also the ones who owe Bei Yu.

402
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,300
Greetings.

403
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,780
Pengpeng,

404
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,380
Pengpeng,

405
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,580
Pengpeng.

406
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,800
Goodness, it's not bad.

407
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,760
Relax.

408
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
It's what you should do.

409
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,240
Have you seen Ming Sheng these days?

410
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,240
She went to France to visit her mother.

411
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,760
She'll be back in a few days.

412
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,160
I saw her at the operating room yesterday.

413
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,600
I don't think I saw her wrong.

414
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,800
She didn't come to see you.

415
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,460
Tsuchig qualified.

416
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,200
Hey!

417
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,320
Right there!

418
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,080
Don't talk.

419
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,040
What?

420
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,720
Hey.

421
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,040
What's wrong?

422
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,280
Why don't you pick up my call?

423
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,080
Since when did you go back home

424
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,720
so soon as you heard of electricity shortage?

425
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
I'm not going to tell you anything.

426
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
I'm just tired of playing and I'm back.

427
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
I've grown up now.

428
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I came back to tell you something and to tell you my feelings.

429
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,720
Why are you so cute in the daytime?

430
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
Here's your living expenses.

431
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
Don't always eat instant noodles.

432
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Don't always eat instant noodles.

433
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,720
Remember to buy yourself some nutritious food.

434
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
I'm leaving.

435
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,720
You always say that I...

436
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
say that you haven't grown up.

437
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
Then I'll ask you now.

438
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
What do you think growing up means?

439
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Growing up means freedom.

440
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Freedom of speech, freedom of thought,

441
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
freedom of behavior.

442
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
You understand it too well.

443
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,720
The freedom of growing up means

444
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,720
to fully take responsibility for what you do.

445
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
That freedom is the freedom under responsibility.

446
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
Children are the most free.

447
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,720
Why?

448
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,720
Because they have less responsibility to take.

449
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,720
I'm leaving.

450
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,720
The TV station and the police station are all out of action.

451
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,720
We can't find anyone.

452
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
Where can the little girl from the Qiao family go?

453
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
I'm leaving.

454
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,720
I'm going to check the address.

455
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
I'm leaving.

456
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Did I cause you trouble?

457
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
No.

458
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm going to change the toilet tomorrow.

459
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,720
My dad is a sudden attack.

460
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,720
He's a very scary control freak.

461
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,720
So I don't want to stay with him for one more minute.

462
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
I don't want to go back to that cold house.

463
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
You're still looking forward to the house you used to live in?

464
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
What's there to look forward to?

465
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,720
My mom won't be back anyway.

466
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,720
That house is not a complete one.

467
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Thank you.

468
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Don't you think adults are more reasonable?

469
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
Why are they so indifferent to mistakes?

470
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,720
When we were young,

471
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,720
they taught us to be sincere, kind, and brave.

472
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
But they did nothing.

473
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I thought my parents were sincere, kind, and sincere when I was young.

474
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,720
But then I realized that

475
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,720
they were weak, selfish, and cold.

476
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,720
If I were to grow up and become someone so annoying,

477
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,720
I'd rather not grow up in this life.

478
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,720
I'll grow up to be fat, tall,

479
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,720
beard, and Chinese.

480
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,720
But I'll always be a sincere person.

481
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I'll always be a shining girl in my heart.

482
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
I didn't eat anything.

483
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,720
I'm sorry. I'll get you some chopsticks.

484
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Yang Xiao Li, I'm so sorry!

485
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,720
I'm not here to fight.

486
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:32,720
I'm here to fight!

487
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,720
I want everyone to hear me!

488
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,720
I'm the one who caused the disaster!

489
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
Wait for me inside. I'll go out.

490
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I'll be right back.

491
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,720
You're playing the role of a drunkard to your wife and child?

492
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,720
What kind of man are you?

493
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
You brat, I don't care about your ambition!

494
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
You're crazy!

495
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Leave! Don't care!

496
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,720
I have three companies in Wangcheng!

497
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
More than 100 employees!

498
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,720
Leave!

499
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,720
I'm going abroad to immigrate!

500
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,720
I have to go to school with my kids!

501
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,720
I have nothing left!

502
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
You scared me.

503
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,720
Mumu's family is a bit of a hypocrite.

504
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,720
Her dad was doing well in his business.

505
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,720
But he was cheated.

506
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,720
He's been drinking every day.

507
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,720
He's even had his liver taken away.

508
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Since then,

509
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,720
he's been getting angry every day.

510
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,720
He's been making trouble at home.

511
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Mumu is not easy.

512
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Mumu and her mother have no choice.

513
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,720
I wanted to help her.

514
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,720
But every time I talked about this,

515
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Mumu wouldn't say a word.

516
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,720
From others' point of view,

517
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,720
Mumu is a pretty girl.

518
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,720
She's got good grades, she's a good student,

519
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,720
and she's perfect.

520
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,720
How can she keep so many secrets?

521
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,720
Maybe it's because she's perfect.

522
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,720
So she doesn't want others to see her as a bad girl.

523
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,720
But I heard from my dad.

524
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,720
Mumu's dad might only be able to starve for three or five years.

525
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,720
Three or five years?

526
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,720
What?

527
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
You said I left home.

528
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,720
Will my parents also be three or five years old?

529
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,720
Don't think too much.

530
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,720
You don't know anything about her family.

531
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,720
Mumu hates her family, and I hate...

532
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,720
My dad.

533
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,720
57, 58, 59, 60.

534
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,720
36.7.

535
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,720
A fever is a major problem in the immune system.

536
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,720
Children's fever is a process of self-improvement.

537
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,720
So it looks like a bad thing, but it's actually a good thing.

538
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,720
Congratulations, you passed the test successfully.

539
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,720
If it's just a growing problem, it's fine as a fever.

540
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,720
But it's also very fast to pass the test.

541
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Everything is not as precious as it was.

542
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,720
You've done a great job.

543
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
I'm sorry.

544
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,720
Do you have sugar and pepper?

545
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,720
Why did you pour it in?

546
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,720
You have to eat it like this.

547
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,720
How can it be delicious?

548
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
I've eaten it since I was little.

549
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,720
Try it.

550
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,720
I won't eat it.

551
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,720
Oh, right.

552
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,720
The owner of the breakfast shop asked me why I eat so much every day.

553
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
I told him that I have a good appetite and healthy.

554
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,720
Mingsheng, I think I should go.

555
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm almost recovered.

556
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
Everyone around me knows me.

557
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,720
And you buy so much food every day.

558
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
You'll be suspected sooner or later.

559
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,720
Okay.

560
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
Since you've decided to go,

561
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
let's get ready.

562
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,720
We'll list the list later.

563
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,720
Prepare everything you need on the way.

564
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:37,720
But from tomorrow on,

565
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,720
you have to listen to me.

566
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,720
Why?

567
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,720
Because I have more experience than you.

568
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
Because I'm the only person

569
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,720
who will be with you in the long journey of your life.

570
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,720
Eat it.

571
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,720
We'll go out after you finish it.

572
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Try one.

573
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,720
Try one.

574
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
It's not bad.

575
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,720
Mingsheng, let me go.

576
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
I'll go.

577
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
You go too.

578
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Ah-sheng.

579
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Ah-sheng.

580
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,720
Ah-sheng.

581
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,720
Ah-sheng.

582
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,720
Ah-sheng.

583
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,720
Ah-sheng.

584
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,720
I have no place to go.

585
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,720
Mingsheng asked me to stay here.

586
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,720
I just want to stay here for a while.

587
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,720
It's not good to meet your mother and daughter.

588
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,720
Don't worry.

589
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,720
I'll keep your secret.

590
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,720
Since I left the last time in Nan Qiao Village,

591
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,720
I've been worried about you.

592
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,720
Until yesterday,

593
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
I saw you on TV.

594
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,720
I was worried about you.

595
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
I was worried about you.

596
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,720
I saw your mother looking for you on TV.

597
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,720
I didn't expect it to be so serious.

598
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
Maybe I did.

599
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,720
But I don't know how to face it

600
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,720
if it really happened.

601
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
Although I'm older than you,

602
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,720
I admire your courage.

603
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,720
Will you regret it?

604
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,720
No.

605
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,720
If I have to choose again,

606
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,720
I will do it without hesitation.

607
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
Mu Mu.

608
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,720
We have to cheer up.

609
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
I can't.

610
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,720
I'm not as brave as you.

611
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,720
What are you going to do next?

612
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,720
Leave Huan Zhou.

613
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,720
Leave Huan Zhou?

614
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Where?

615
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,720
Go to Jiang Zhou first.

616
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,720
We'll plan it later.

617
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
Are you going alone?

618
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,720
Ah Sheng will go with you.

619
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,720
Ah Sheng and I grew up together.

620
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,720
When Ah Sheng was still alive,

621
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,720
he took care of me as his granddaughter.

622
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,720
He left me a key in the house.

623
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,720
Then he passed away.

624
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,720
Ah Sheng kept remembering his grandfather's words.

625
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,720
He made me his second home.

626
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
That's how he is.

627
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,720
So he would take the risk

628
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
to hide you in his house.

629
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,720
He's usually very wild at school.

630
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,720
He was the only wild dog

631
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,720
in our yard when we were kids.

632
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,720
And boys are usually a little bit of heroes.

633
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:35,720
They like to be in front of girls.

634
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,720
He might like to help

635
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,720
the poor.

636
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,720
They said I was actually worried.

637
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,720
I was worried that he would hurt you

638
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
for doing something childish.

639
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:00,720
No, he respects me.

640
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,720
I didn't mean that.

641
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,720
Ah Sheng is easily angry.

642
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,720
I was worried that he would do the same.

643
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,720
Ah Sheng was actually very good.

644
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,720
It seems that after his grandfather died,

645
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,720
he had a bad relationship with his father.

646
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,720
He was under pressure at school.

647
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:26,720
He also studied abroad.

648
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,720
He might have been rebellious.

649
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,720
He was going to study abroad?

650
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
Yes.

651
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,720
His parents had already agreed

652
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
on his future plans.

653
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,720
He will study in France

654
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,720
and become a good doctor.

655
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,720
He is usually very good at studying.

656
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,720
He doesn't want to take the exam.

657
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:49,720
He is very strict with Yan.

658
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,720
If nothing goes wrong,

659
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,720
he will definitely study abroad.

660
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

661
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

662
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:28,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

663
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

664
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

665
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

666
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

667
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

668
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

669
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

670
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

671
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

672
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

673
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

674
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

675
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

676
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

677
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

678
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

679
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:36,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

680
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

681
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

682
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

683
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

684
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

685
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

686
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

687
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,720
The more you care, the more you are careful.

688
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,720
You are not mature enough.

689
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,720
You don't have the courage to come.

690
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,720
That's why time is not as easy as it used to be.
