What?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Who told you to say that?

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Nonsense!

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's all rumors!

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
If it's nonsense,

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
why don't you refute it?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Refute what?

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Can I say that much

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
in one word?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What do you know?

31
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You know what?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
But if we don't get married,

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
we'll be bullied everywhere.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
We'll be dragged everywhere.

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who bullied you?

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We moved out.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
We're gone.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's over.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's not over.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Then what do you want?

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I want to get married.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Only by getting married

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
can we stop them.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If we keep thinking about it,

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it'll only get worse.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What marriage?

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Stop reading for a few days.

48
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're just changing cultures with me.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm talking about studying.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're just talking nonsense.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can you just do what you want?

52
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Let me save my mind.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let me have a peaceful life for a few days.

54
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I said

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want to talk about the past

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
after I get to Huan Zhou.

57
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The past has definitely affected her.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And she's grown up now.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So when you talk to her,

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you have to find a way.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't want to talk to you.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Give me a drink.

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Give me a drink.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You're pretty good at writing.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You have my style.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This is the last time

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I've helped you write your homework.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
They're all rushing to help me write my homework.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I thought they were too ugly.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't have the obligation to help you.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's not an obligation.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's compensation.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Were you talking to Ming Sheng?

75
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Did you know her before?

76
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I heard her call you Sister Bei Yu.

77
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You have a sister?

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm the head of the family.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have a brother.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Are you two close?

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I just wanted to say

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
you have to be careful.

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
About what?

85
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
About some girls in our class.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Who is Ming Sheng?

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No one in the whole Huan Zhou

88
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
knows her.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She looks like she's got a good reputation.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She's a big hit in our school.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sheng.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes?

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's play after school.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Sure.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Give me the money.

96
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can't today.

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have to practice.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I've done my homework.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll be in a rush tomorrow.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I've done my homework.

101
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She's so impulsive.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
She's so arrogant.

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're almost as good as Liu Hai.

104
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ming Sheng is a good student.

105
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She's still teaching.

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But that's because she's talented.

107
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
She won the first prize

108
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
in the national biology competition.

109
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
She's so arrogant.

110
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But she's doing well in every exam.

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
She's a good student.

112
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
She's got what it takes.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
She's a good student.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go, go, go!

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Bye.

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Bye.

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Bye.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
They're playing basketball.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Come with me.

120
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't figure out what's going on.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We're obviously in a bad spot.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The boss of the small business

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
hit his chair by accident.

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
He even told the school.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You should tell the village about this.

126
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's not necessary.

127
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
It's not necessary?

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't run!

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hey!

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Get out of the way!

131
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What are you doing?

132
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you doing?

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Where's the bag?

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What's going on?

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Where's the money?

136
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You said this...

137
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Money?

138
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My head hurts.

139
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Auntie, the police have arrested the thief.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The money is here.

141
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Thank you, guys.

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I didn't miss a single penny.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Watch your bags next time.

144
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
My name is Ye Zilin.

145
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll remember that.

146
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a high-end car.

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Hurry up.

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What a bunch of good kids.

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're so handsome.

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're so handsome.

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
One more.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you okay?

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is Qiao Qingyu

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
sent by heaven

156
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to make us unhappy?

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You're really stupid.

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You're so innocent.

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You're blushing.

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Qiao Qingyu.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you okay?

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's none of your business.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What do you mean?

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
If you're being hit by a bomb,

165
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
who's going to help me with my homework?

166
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Take it.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Take it.

168
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you, Qiao Qingyu.

169
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Give me your phone number.

170
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Don't misunderstand.

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm trying to communicate with you.

172
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You'd better reply to me in time.

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Or you'll be a nuisance.

174
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't have a phone.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You don't have a phone?

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How about this?

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Give me your QQ.

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
38250127.

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Remember to write it.

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Write it.

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Ming Sheng.

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Is that really Ming Sheng?

183
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You're good, sister.

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You've only been here for a few days.

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You've met Ming Sheng from Huanzhou Middle School.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Do you know how famous he is?

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Ming Sheng

188
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
won the MVP of the Huanzhou Middle School League

189
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
for three consecutive years.

190
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
He's our idol.

191
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No matter if he's...

192
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Qiao Qingyu.

193
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Can you focus on your studies

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
and not play basketball all day?

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I...

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm just a smart guy

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
who uses basketball

198
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
to get good results.

199
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What's wrong with you?

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You got hit by Ming Sheng?

201
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
No way.

202
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
He wanted to hit me,

203
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
but he deliberately targeted me.

204
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You and Ming Sheng are so close.

205
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Why did he target you?

206
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's because of him.

207
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We've got him back.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Why is he still nowhere to be found?

209
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
He...

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Qiao Beiyu?

211
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Qiao Beiyu

212
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
used to be a popular character in Shunyun.

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Even when we went out,

214
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
people thought we were

215
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Beiyu's brother and sister.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He's like the sun.

217
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We're like the moon.

218
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We can only exist

219
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
when we shine.

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What's the use of being good-looking?

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The more good-looking, the more trouble.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Actually,

223
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
sometimes I feel

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
that you're a little jealous of him.

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I hate him.

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Your sister is good-looking

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and has a good figure.

228
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It'll look good

229
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
when I take a picture of her.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If you're so reluctant,

231
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I can go home with you.

232
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I told you not to follow me.

233
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm not following you.

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm worried about you.

235
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you like it?

236
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Okay,

237
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
you're a celebrity now.

238
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Here.

239
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's make your chin a little bit smaller.

240
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Raise your right hand a little bit higher.

241
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Make your smile a little bit more.

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay, okay, okay.

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This is good.

244
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Let's take a few more.

245
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Little girl,

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
did you get the earrings?

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What earrings?

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The ones with the jewel box.

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The ones you tried on just now.

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I couldn't find them.

251
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Little girl,

252
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
why don't you try them on?

253
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I didn't get them.

254
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But there's no one else in the store.

255
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
What's wrong?

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Sister, I really didn't get the earrings.

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I just tried them on

258
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and put them in quickly.

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I didn't get them.

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Or let's forget it.

261
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Actually, things are not expensive.

262
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Qiao Qingyu,

263
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
if you get them,

264
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
just put them back.

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I really didn't get them.

266
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you don't believe me, just look at them.

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Come on.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Hug.

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hug.

270
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hug.

271
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You're finally out.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hug.

273
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I bought you some flowers.

274
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Look, are you happy?

275
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you.

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You're welcome.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You've been here for a day.

278
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you tired?

279
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's okay.

280
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's go. I'm a little hungry.

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's go.

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Let's eat seafood today.

283
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Qiao Beiyu.

284
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm here to study in Huanzhou.

285
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
My mom asked me to give you this fruit.

286
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Who are you?

287
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know you.

288
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Are you her sister?

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Didn't I just say I don't know you?

290
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let's go.

291
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're so funny.

292
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Qiao Beiyu.

293
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I've never known you before.

294
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Now that I think about it,

295
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
my sister is quite pitiful.

296
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
She grew up in a village in Nan Qiao.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Her parents didn't care about her.

298
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
She's so young.

299
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
She's gone.

300
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
She's dead.

301
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
She can't hear anything Nan Qiao says.

302
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What about us?

303
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why should we take her place?

304
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
We're the ones who are pitiful, okay?

305
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I've been causing trouble.

306
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm dead and I'm dragging the whole family down.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Look at mom.

308
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
She's been torturing me.

309
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She's even afraid of the toilet books.

310
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm bullied and laughed at every day.

311
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
If I could,

312
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'd never have this sister.

313
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
Jasmine

314
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
What are you doing?

315
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Little girl,

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
do you really think I wouldn't dare to do anything to you?

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You're lying.

318
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Qiao Beiyu is Lan Weiyan.

319
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's not like what you said.

320
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Where's the evidence?

321
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You don't have evidence either.

322
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You can't talk nonsense.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I have evidence.

324
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Your sister was treated in the People's Hospital.

325
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The president of the People's Hospital is my father.

326
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
This is my father.

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
If you don't have evidence, don't talk nonsense.

328
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Let's go to the dance studio and get some clothes.

329
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay.

330
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What are you looking at?

331
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Look at Mengmeng.

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
She's looking at our class.

333
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Are you going to fight?

334
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I have evidence.

335
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Your sister was treated in the People's Hospital.

336
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The president of the People's Hospital is my father.

337
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You guys can play first.

338
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Xiao Nian,

339
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
can I borrow your phone?

340
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Lan Weiyan?

341
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Didn't I tell you many times?

342
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You have a disease again.

343
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
You're back.

344
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Brother Xinrui.

345
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm glad you're back.

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Let me introduce you.

347
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
This is your host sister-in-law.

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Hello, I'm Nie Xiaoyun.

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is my cousin, Qiao Jingyu.

350
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hello, sister-in-law.

351
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hurry up and sit.

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Sit.

353
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Sister Xiaoyun,

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
did anyone say you look like a movie star?

355
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
No, no, no.

356
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Fang Hao.

357
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Go and cut some fruit.

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's okay, you don't have to be so polite.

359
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Congratulations, Brother Jingrui.

360
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Thank you.

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Brother Jingrui is capable.

362
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He found such an excellent girl.

363
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm so happy.

364
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
He found such an excellent girl.

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The wedding date is fixed.

366
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Grandpa and my dad said

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
they must come to Uncle's house

368
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
to invite your whole family.

369
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
You're sensible.

370
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
When do you plan to hold the wedding?

371
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
We plan to hold it in the spring festival next year

372
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
in Nanqiao Village.

373
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The old and young couples in Nanqiao Village

374
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
have been watching me grow up.

375
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm getting married.

376
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I want them to be happy with me.

377
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Are you the eldest son and the eldest grandson?

378
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm sure I'll be back to my hometown for the wedding.

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yes.

380
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Brother Jingrui,

381
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
how did you manage to catch up with such a beautiful sister-in-law?

382
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Brother Jingrui,

383
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I heard you were the leader in the unit.

384
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm not the leader.

385
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
The deputy director I just mentioned is a deputy chief.

386
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Isn't that the chief?

387
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Sister Xiaoyun, you don't know, right?

388
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Brother Jingrui is the first person

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
who got into the 211 university

390
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
in Nanqiao Village.

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
And he is the first person

392
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
who became the chief in the state-owned enterprise.

393
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
My family

394
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
has been so fond of Brother Jingrui

395
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
from my grandparents

396
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
to my uncle and my father.

397
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
We are so jealous.

398
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Why don't you learn from Brother Jingrui?

399
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You are all brothers.

400
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You didn't do well.

401
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Sister Xiaoyun,

402
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
you have to look after Brother Jingrui.

403
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Then,

404
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
we'll wait for Brother Jingrui to say goodbye

405
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
and line up from home

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
to the village entrance.

407
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You're joking.

408
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Brother Jingrui is so smart.

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
It's okay.

410
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
My impression of Jingjing and Xiaoyu

411
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
is that we are still together

412
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
in the village entrance.

413
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
We were all children

414
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
when we were in the village entrance.

415
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I've been busy these years

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
and haven't been back to Nanqiao Village.

417
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's been several years

418
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
since I've seen Jingjing and Xiaoyu.

419
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Especially Xiaoyu.

420
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
She suddenly came to mind these years.

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yes.

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Last month, I went back to Nanqiao Village

423
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
with Jingrui.

424
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
My mother showed us

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
a lot of old photos.

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I took some photos.

427
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Look.

428
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
See?

429
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The one in the pants is Xiaoyu.

430
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The one in the pants is Xiaoyu.

431
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
It's me.

432
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
So ugly.

433
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Who is this?

434
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
She's so pretty.

435
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
This is Qiao Beiyu.

436
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Beiyu is...

437
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Beiyu is our distant relative's child.

438
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Fang Hao.

439
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I'll go and see you

440
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
with the fruits.

441
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Okay.

442
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Well, she's sick.

443
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And...

444
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
she passed away last year.

445
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Oh.

446
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I didn't know it was like this.

448
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn't mean to mention it.

449
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
No, it's okay.

450
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Well,

451
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
the wedding is about to start.

452
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
How's the wedding room going?

453
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The two families are working hard

454
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
to make a small house.

455
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
That house was already well-built.

456
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
We just need to clean it up a little bit.

457
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So that the new house can be renovated.

458
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
It's good.

459
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Here.

460
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Have some fruit.

461
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Here.

462
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Jingyu.

463
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Put it on.

464
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Thank you.

465
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
This is your secret little paradise.

466
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
The view is really different.

467
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
With this little rooftop air conditioner,

468
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
it's already very good.

469
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
How is it?

470
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
The school competition is very intense, right?

471
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Yes.

472
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
The students here have very good grades.

473
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Don't be stressed.

474
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Of course, the grades are very important.

475
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Once you get out of society, you'll realize

476
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that a single full score score is too little.

477
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
What do you mean?

478
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I mean,

479
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
life is still very long.

480
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
There are many things that are not in the textbook.

481
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
How do I learn them?

482
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Your experience will teach you.

483
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
This world will eventually teach you to grow up.

484
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
No need.

485
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Don't be so polite with me.

486
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I know.

487
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
It's my brother's duty to visit his sister and give her a red envelope.

488
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You're an adult.

489
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
You love beauty.

490
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You spend a lot of money.

491
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I know that you're too strict with your little aunt.

492
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Giving you money is a secret between us.

493
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Don't tell your little aunt.

494
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Okay.

495
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
When I get a job,

496
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'll also give your son a red envelope.

497
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
You have to pay the interest.

498
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It's windy outside.

499
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Don't stay too long.

500
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'll go down first.

501
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Jingrui.

502
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I want to ask you something.

503
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What is it?

504
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
How did Bei Yu die?

505
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Jingrui.

506
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Do you believe that Qiao Bei Yu died of laryngitis?

507
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
My parents said it was laryngitis.

508
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Can't they just finish the operation?

509
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Actually, I don't believe what they said.

510
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You don't believe it?

511
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Aren't you my mother's repeat?

512
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Why don't you believe it?

513
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Because my parents always say that Qiao Bei Yu is running away.

514
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There's no other reason for running away.

515
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
It's just a guilty conscience.

516
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What do you think the truth is?

517
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I don't know.

518
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
But I asked Jingrui today.

519
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Laryngitis.

520
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
There was a little problem during the operation.

521
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
As a result, such a small disease killed him.

522
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
But everyone says

523
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
he loves to die.

524
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
People always believe what they believe.

525
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But they never care about the truth.

526
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Actually,

527
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I'm also responsible for Bei Yu's death.

528
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It's my brother who couldn't take care of his sister.

529
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's why he's getting worse.

530
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
He's so young.

531
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
His life has just started.

532
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's over so quickly.

533
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Jingrui's answer is exactly the same as his parents'.

534
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Maybe

535
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
parents' escape

536
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
is just because they're sad.

537
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
After all,

538
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
who wants to take the old and hurt themselves?

539
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
What?

540
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
No matter if your father is the president of the People's Hospital,

541
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
what you said is just a lie.

542
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Xiao Jingyu,

543
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
are you really not afraid that I'll tell your secret?

544
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You have a big mouth.

545
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
You can say whatever you want.

546
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
But don't try to threaten me again.

547
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Wait for me.

548
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Ah Xiang.

549
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What did he write for you?

550
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Nothing.

551
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What did he write for you?

552
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Nothing.

553
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Love letter.

554
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What love letter?

555
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Really?

556
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Don't talk nonsense.

557
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Take a look.

558
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
What are you looking at?

559
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Take a look.

560
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Ah Xiang,

561
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
take a look.

562
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Ah Xiang, take a look.

563
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Sit down.

564
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Everyone, please hand in your homework.

565
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Qiao Jingyu,

566
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
please hand in your homework.

567
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'll take a look.

568
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Mathematics,

569
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
grammar,

570
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
physics,

571
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
and chemistry.

572
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You don't have any of these four homeworks, do you?

573
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I've already written them all.

574
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I just finished them all.

575
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Ye Zilin and Chen Hao

576
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
also said the same thing

577
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
when they didn't finish their homework.

578
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I can't wait for you.

579
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm going to hand in my homework.

580
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Monitor,

581
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
the old rules.

582
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
It's the same person

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
who didn't write and didn't bring.

584
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You'll be punished three times.

585
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
What does that have to do with you?

586
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Can we be the same as those who didn't bring and didn't write?

587
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm going to hand in my homework.

588
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Ah Sheng,

589
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
when did you come back?

590
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Why didn't you inform me in advance?

591
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
What do you mean?

592
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I'm leaving right away.

593
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Stop.

594
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
You can come and go as you please.

595
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
This is your home, not a hotel.

596
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
My home is in the old house in Chaoyang Village.

597
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
This is your home.

598
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
This is also your home.

599
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Normally,

600
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I can't see you in this house.

601
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
If you have no money

602
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
and want to spend your living expenses,

603
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
you'll show up.

604
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
How much money did I ask you for all these years?

605
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You've already made it clear to me.

606
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
After I graduate from college,

607
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I'll return all the money I borrowed to you.

608
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
I'm your father.

609
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I only have a grandfather and a mother.

610
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I don't have a father.

611
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I...

612
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Since I was a kid,

613
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
school, school, parent's meeting,

614
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
and tuition fees were all done by my grandfather.

615
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
What about you? What did you do?

616
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I'm too busy with work.

617
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
It's all an excuse.

618
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You deserve to be left by my mother.

619
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Do you know that?

620
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
From others' point of view,

621
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
you're a doctor who saves lives.

622
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
But from my point of view,

623
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
you're a selfish person.

624
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
A person like you

625
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
doesn't deserve to have a family.

626
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You...

627
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Come on.

628
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Hello.

629
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Hurry up.

630
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Move faster.

631
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Move faster.

632
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Keep up.

633
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Keep up.

634
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Faster.

635
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Ye Zilin.

636
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Why are you here again?

637
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Faster.

638
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Teacher.

639
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Qiao Zhenyu is here.

640
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Zhenyu, go to the bathroom and clean up.

641
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Okay.

642
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Get up.

643
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Jiang Nian.

644
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I remember you have a spare jacket.

645
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Can you lend it to me?

646
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm not very convenient.

647
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Xingyu.

648
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Is Qiao Beiyu really a selfish person?

649
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry.

650
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
All Is Well

651
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
What's up?

652
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Did you say that?

653
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What did I say?

654
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Did you say that about Qiao Beiyu?

655
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You're a joke.

656
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
You're not.

657
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Qiao Zhenyu.

658
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Don't make a life-threatening move.

659
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You started it.

660
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
That's why I said you're a joke.

661
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
You don't even understand the situation.

662
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,600
Why are you asking me for advice?

663
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Go borrow clothes from your classmate.

664
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Don't catch a cold.

665
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,000
Look here.

666
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,600
The cancer is mainly transmitted through blood,

667
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,400
sexual contact, or the mother's voice.

668
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
It's not transmitted through air.

669
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Stop talking.

670
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,000
Go away.

671
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I'm going to sleep.

672
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Look here.

673
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,400
There was a girl called Qiao Beiyu.

674
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,400
Her parents had a fight with the hospital.

675
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
She was in the hospital for treatment.

676
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Do you remember?

677
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
Oh.

678
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,400
It seems that your father was responsible for this.

679
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,000
The hospital didn't need to take responsibility.

680
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,600
So, under the advice of the medical committee,

681
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
they gave her some money.

682
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,800
She bought these pants.

683
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,000
She only wore them for a few days.

684
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
And she got this look.

685
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,200
She can't even wash them.

686
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,600
You know that

687
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
your father and I borrowed tens of thousands of dollars

688
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
for you to go to school.

689
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,200
Ji Yuqiao is not sensible.

690
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,400
You are as uncivilized as her.

691
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,800
The class was noisy.

692
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
I accidentally touched it.

693
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
I told you to stay away from them.

694
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,800
I said I was careless.

695
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,200
I told you

696
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,600
to stay away from those random students.

697
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,000
They won't be partial to you.

698
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Now you know what you did wrong.

699
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

700
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
I'm telling you, Qiao Jingyu.

701
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Those who are close to the master are close to the master.

702
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,400
You should be with those who are good at learning.

703
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
It's important to make friends.

704
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
Otherwise, you will suffer a great loss in the future.

705
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,800
It's too late to regret.

706
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
I made a mistake.

707
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
You two are like pants.

708
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
I'll wash them later.

709
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
No.

710
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,800
I'll buy you a new pair.

711
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,800
You are bullied.

712
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Why didn't you tell your parents?

713
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,200
My dad doesn't care.

714
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
You know my mom's temper.

715
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,800
If he knows,

716
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,800
things will only get worse.

717
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,200
What should I do?

718
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,800
Just let them bully you?

719
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
Find evidence.

720
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,800
What evidence?

721
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,800
The evidence about Qiao Beiyu's death.

722
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,800
We just need to find the truth.

723
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I don't know what you are thinking.

724
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,800
I don't know what you are thinking.

725
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Just be confident.

726
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:48,800
She is dead.

727
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,800
There's no need to make more trouble.

728
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800
If you don't want to be bullied,

729
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,800
you have to prove that Qiao Beiyu is dead.

730
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Otherwise, it doesn't matter if it's Shunyun or Huanzhou.

731
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,800
It doesn't matter where you go.

732
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
Let's go.

733
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Let's go.

734
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Okay, students.

735
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
Let's start the class.

736
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
Turn the textbook to page 32.

737
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Let's take a look.

738
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Network database data collection.

739
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,800
As a modern computer,

740
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,800
the database data collection is usually simple.

741
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,800
We can see the data after the operation.

742
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
You can turn on the computer.

743
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
A new X2 table.

744
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
I'm sorry.

745
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
My name is Wang Mumu.

746
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,800
I'm in Class 1 of Grade 3.

747
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
I know.

748
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
I've heard about you from them.

749
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
I've heard about you from them too.

750
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,800
I've seen you in the community.

751
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,800
Qiao Qingyu.

752
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,800
My home is on the 13th floor of Chang'an New Village.

753
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
We're neighbors.

754
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
We met each other.

755
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
Why don't you eat?

756
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
My dad is cleaning the house today.

757
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,800
I'll leave after eating.

758
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,800
Okay.

759
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Qiao Qingyu.

760
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,800
You look so happy when you lie.

761
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,800
You're good at acting.

762
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I didn't lie.

763
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,800
What about the content of the online class you attended today?

764
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Did you forget it?

765
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,800
I warned you.

766
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,800
Don't lie to others without solid evidence.

767
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Even if your dad is the president of the People's Hospital,

768
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
what can he prove?

769
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
What about this?

770
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,800
It's written in black and white.

771
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
It's written in black and white.

772
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Give it to me.

773
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
I don't want to give it to you.

774
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,800
I'm afraid you won't be able to accept it when you find out the truth.

775
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Give it to me.

776
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,800
Give it to me.

777
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Qingyu fell into the water.

778
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
The water is so cold.

779
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
This is not a comedy.

780
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
This is a dance.

781
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Save him.

782
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
I lied to you.

783
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Silly.

784
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Why are you so despicable?

785
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,800
Who knows that you would give up your life for this?

786
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,800
Luckily, I saved you once.

787
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
This time, we're even.

788
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Wait for me to find the evidence.

789
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Be careful.

790
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,800
Remember our distance.

791
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,800
One step closer.

792
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,800
The future.

793
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,800
The future.

794
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Time will reveal the mystery.

795
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,800
Waiting is the reason for the soundless.

796
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,800
But it will never be over.

797
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:44,800
So my heart is your name.

798
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:50,800
The only stubbornness in my heart.

799
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,800
From the first glance,

800
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I draw the future.

801
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,800
The dream starts to come true.

802
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:12,800
Your heart is also unknown.

803
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,800
The same story is hidden.

804
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,800
Luckily, you're not sensible enough.

805
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
You didn't have the courage to come.

806
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:33,800
That's why time doesn't stop.
