1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
Nuev verdrect

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,700
The Lastert of the gang

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,700
Get off!

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:42,700
During the dark night, it got in line Just like you, mix light to bright

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:50,700
Breaking free from darkness, you gave me strength

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:58,700
And unfortunately, I find my pain

7
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,700
Drawing on the hope that you'll render me

8
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:14,700
In this long journey, I run, I will not leave

9
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Oh, Qiao Qingyu

10
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
I remember you right away

11
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
The first two days, I saw Ming Sheng

12
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,700
Bring a girl down from the bus

13
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
That little girl is you

14
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
Qingyu disappeared for two days

15
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Is it because of Ming Sheng's grandfather?

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,700
Are they two good friends?

17
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
Don't talk nonsense

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,700
Those two days, she lived in our distant relative's house

19
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,700
It's none of your business from now on

20
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
Don't talk nonsense

21
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,700
I didn't say anything

22
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,700
I remember clearly what clothes she wore that day

23
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
Really? You're back

24
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Let's go home

25
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
Let's go

26
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
Why are you back?

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,700
Give me a glass of water

28
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
Don't bring a pair of shoes

29
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,700
The teacher insisted that I didn't go to class

30
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,700
I had to come back

31
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
You're so annoying

32
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,700
Think about it again

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,700
What else did you forget?

34
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,700
Don't run around

35
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,700
You're wasting time

36
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,700
I'll leave the key here

37
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,700
I have to go back to the noodle house

38
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,700
Remember to lock the door

39
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
I know, mom

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,700
Send me the key

41
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,700
Okay

42
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,700
Qingyu

43
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,700
What?

44
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,700
Do me a favor

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm going out

46
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Why are you going out?

47
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
Mom won't forgive me

48
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,700
I want to see Ming Sheng

49
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,700
Sister

50
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,700
What's going on between you and Ming Sheng?

51
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
The little girl downstairs is not here

52
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,700
She's not here

53
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,700
She's not here

54
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,700
She's not here

55
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,700
She's not here

56
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,700
She's not here

57
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,700
The little girl downstairs

58
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
The owner of the shop is annoying

59
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
I heard she came to the store for noodles

60
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,700
for the first time in three days

61
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,700
She caught mom and told her

62
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:42,700
the idle talk between you and Ming Sheng

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
Ignore her

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
If she comes again, you'll drive her away

65
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,700
If I make her angry

66
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
she'll say bad things about our family

67
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
Mom said

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,700
The noodle house and the house

69
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,700
have been rented for a year

70
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,700
We'll move in until September

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,700
Then, when you graduate next year

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,700
you'll go to college abroad

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
I'll stay in Huanzhou

74
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,700
to study

75
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Dad and she will go back to Shunyun

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,700
so the economic pressure will be less

77
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Sister

78
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
What happened between you and Ming Sheng?

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
Nothing

80
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Then how did you get to her house?

81
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
I can't say it clearly

82
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
but I have to see her today

83
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
I won't have any relationship with her

84
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
anymore

85
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
Then

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,700
you always have me to blame this time

87
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,700
For the reason that

88
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,700
I didn't ask you to help me

89
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,700
in the last draw

90
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,700
you didn't mind me

91
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:50,700
I helped you

92
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
But you have to remind me

93
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,700
to see Ming Sheng

94
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,700
I have to tell her in advance

95
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,700
I have to return the key to mom

96
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,700
The time of our work

97
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
is only two hours

98
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,700
Enough

99
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,700
I'll send her a message first

100
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
She'll come if you send her a message

101
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,700
I hope so

102
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
I'll see you in the summer

103
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
Now

104
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,700
Give me a tree

105
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,700
This is not yours

106
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,700
This tree is mine

107
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,700
This big tree can talk

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,700
It's saying

109
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
I shouldn't have been angry at you yesterday

110
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,700
I'm sorry

111
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
I'm sorry

112
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,700
I'm sorry

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
I heard that your mom is very strict with you

114
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
I didn't expect you to come out so soon

115
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
My mom said if you harass me again

116
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
she will set your family on fire

117
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
She is not joking

118
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,700
I really find it funny

119
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,700
I have a feeling that I am not in the right place

120
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,700
But if it wasn't for your mom

121
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
I didn't know

122
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
that I was so important to you

123
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,700
Don't talk nonsense

124
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,700
I didn't talk nonsense

125
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Since you read the note

126
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,700
and asked me out

127
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,700
should you explain

128
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,700
why you left without saying goodbye

129
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,700
Why do you think

130
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
I would choose you between family and you?

131
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Actually you want to leave home more than me

132
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Recently he said it was just a game

133
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Yes, I want to bet on the future

134
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,700
and bet on everything

135
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I asked you out today

136
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,700
because I think it's better to say it in person

137
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,700
I am very grateful that you have done so much for me

138
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
But nothing has happened between us

139
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Nothing in the past

140
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Nothing now

141
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,700
It won't happen in the future

142
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
I don't understand

143
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
There is no future between us

144
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,700
What do you mean?

145
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
After graduation from high school

146
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,700
you will go abroad and I will stay in China

147
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,700
Our life is two ways

148
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,700
We shouldn't have any contact

149
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,700
You have your future

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,700
I can't ruin it

151
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,700
When I was abroad

152
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,700
I didn't help you

153
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,700
You were in the train station during the New Year

154
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,700
You had a fever. I took you home

155
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,700
I can decide my own future

156
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,700
But I am different from you

157
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,700
I lost the moment I was caught

158
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,700
I can't hurt my family again

159
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,700
I can't leave home again

160
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,700
You are like last semester

161
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,700
You can treat me as a stranger

162
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
or a person you hate

163
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
I am not a stranger to you

164
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
I don't hate you either

165
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
But without you, my life would be much easier

166
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,700
You are my burden

167
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,700
I hate you from the beginning

168
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,700
You are so arrogant and arrogant

169
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
You are so arrogant

170
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
You are so arrogant

171
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
We are not on the same side

172
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
Qiao Qingyu

173
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
I didn't want to hurt you

174
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,700
I am sorry

175
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,700
It's okay if you don't accept my apology

176
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,700
But can you not hate me?

177
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,700
I hate you

178
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,700
I hate you

179
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Qiao Qingyu

180
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,700
I always thought you and I were alike

181
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
But I was wrong

182
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,700
What will you do?

183
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,700
I will choose freedom

184
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,700
If people don't have freedom

185
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
why would they live?

186
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,700
Qiao Qingyu

187
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,700
Are we still friends?

188
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Yes

189
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,700
It's okay

190
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I didn't say anything

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
It's okay

192
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I am still grateful for what you have done for me

193
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
It's okay

194
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,700
It's all nonsense

195
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,700
Let's go

196
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Let's go

197
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,700
Every choice in life is like a battle between yourself and yourself

198
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,700
The most painful thing is not that others deny you

199
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,700
but self-doubt

200
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,700
My mental world suddenly collapsed

201
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I feel like I have never really touched this world

202
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,700
There is chaos around

203
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,700
I feel like I am standing in a big fog

204
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
My body grows like a dark cloud

205
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,700
But my soul is lost

206
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,700
I am still grateful for what you have done for me

207
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Guan Lang

208
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,700
I only got one point worse than you

209
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,700
You were only one rank lower than me

210
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,700
You got 20 rank lower than me

211
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
I finally understand what you mean

212
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,700
What does one point difference mean?

213
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Come here

214
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Zilin, why are you so anxious?

215
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
You never have any suspense when you are in the shop

216
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Can I help our Ah Sen?

217
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Sure

218
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,700
14 seconds

219
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Full of physical and physical

220
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
You are so excited

221
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
You can't do it, you have to do it in a row

222
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
It's called hard work

223
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Do you understand?

224
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Qiao Qingyu got 13 seconds

225
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
1314

226
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Isn't this a life-long test?

227
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Ah Sen

228
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,700
Ah Sen

229
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Is it funny?

230
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Isn't it funny?

231
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Isn't it funny?

232
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
1314

233
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Half

234
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Half

235
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,700
Qingyu

236
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Teacher Sun

237
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,700
Your composition

238
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Teacher Pan told me

239
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,700
I didn't expect

240
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,700
You look calm

241
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
But you hide something so big in your heart

242
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Actually

243
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,700
I have experienced this

244
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,700
I suddenly found

245
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
These common values

246
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,700
Life principles

247
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,700
It's not quite right

248
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,700
I was also depressed at that time

249
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Because I didn't know if it was my fault

250
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Or the whole world was in trouble

251
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,700
But then I slowly found out

252
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,700
These standards are not always the same

253
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
You have to look at it specifically

254
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
For example

255
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Hiding

256
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
It may not be wrong

257
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
I think

258
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,700
The best growth

259
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,700
Is to face life gently and calmly

260
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,700
The world that once made you sad

261
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,700
It will go with the flow of time

262
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
It doesn't matter anymore

263
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,700
We are experiencing a lot of things every day

264
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:02,700
Meet different people

265
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,700
Unpredictable and uncontrolled

266
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,700
Instead of persistent struggle

267
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,700
It's better to smile

268
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
These two days

269
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,700
The school invited a doctor from the province

270
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,700
To give psychological counseling to the classmates

271
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
If you have any ideas, you can talk to him

272
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,700
He is a professional

273
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,700
In short, the school and the teacher

274
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Hope you can open your heart

275
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Sorry

276
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,700
It's okay, classmate

277
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Come to me at any time when you are ready

278
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,700
I can't talk to Le Fan

279
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
I have too many worries

280
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
I can't see the sun

281
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
Actually I have been insomnia for a long time

282
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Is it because your parents quarreled?

283
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,700
I don't know

284
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
I don't know

285
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
I don't know

286
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I don't know

287
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,700
I don't know

288
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,700
I don't know

289
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
I don't know

290
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
How long do I have to live in this world?

291
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
Mom, after you pass the college entrance exam

292
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
And leave home

293
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
You will get better

294
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Then

295
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
What about my mom?

296
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
What about my mom?

297
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Yes

298
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
I did leave home

299
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,340
But I will always be their child.

300
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,540
They will always be my parents.

301
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,140
I can live without them.

302
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,100
But the relationship between us will last forever.

303
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,100
We will never be able to break free.

304
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,980
So, Qingyu,

305
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,740
I envy you.

306
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,940
You can endure it.

307
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,940
You can live on.

308
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,220
Because in your heart,

309
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,740
there is light.

310
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,900
So you have no fear of the dark.

311
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,420
No, Nanny.

312
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,780
The light in my heart is going to go out.

313
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:27,700
It's good that you're here.

314
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,940
You saved me.

315
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,740
This is the evaluation that everyone has for me.

316
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,740
Warm, kind,

317
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,300
and considerate.

318
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:49,300
Don't you like it?

319
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,100
It's not about whether I like it or not.

320
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:58,860
I feel that the road ahead of me

321
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,700
is very dark. I can't find the light.

322
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,460
So, Qingyu,

323
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,340
I envy your courage.

324
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,140
At least you can do what you want to do.

325
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
There will be light.

326
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,480
《The

327
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:39,720
Life of a

328
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,080
Coward》

329
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:49,960
Morning, Mr. Caterpillar.

330
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,920
Where are you going to play?

331
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,360
Sheng is not here.

332
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,440
Deng Meixi said that he had a physical exam.

333
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,760
He went to the library with Deng Meixi for a lecture.

334
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,800
Library lecture?

335
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,200
He really has a good reputation.

336
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,520
Let's go.

337
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,640
Next time.

338
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,960
Let's go.

339
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,960
Pack up your things.

340
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,360
Sheng said he's going to sing in the afternoon.

341
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,440
Yi Zhong and Xiao Hua?

342
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,560
Let's go.

343
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,600
I have a friend who I've asked to meet several times,

344
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,320
but he didn't show up.

345
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
Sheng and Yi Zhong and Xiao Hua.

346
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,120
Is this a strong alliance?

347
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,640
Is this a history of competition?

348
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,120
Let's go.

349
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,320
There aren't many books to write.

350
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Hurry up.

351
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,520
Are you okay?

352
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,680
Give me a hand.

353
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,520
Your dad is also

354
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,440
so stingy for this 20 or 30 yuan.

355
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,880
Have some tea.

356
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,920
Isn't that the pretty girl on TV a few days ago?

357
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Yes, yes, yes.

358
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,880
The heroine who made a scene

359
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,800
on the TV.

360
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,000
She's pretty.

361
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,560
Look at her.

362
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,840
Isn't she the sister of the most beautiful girl in Shunyun?

363
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,400
Yes.

364
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,080
You've got the wrong person.

365
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,160
How could I have the wrong person, auntie?

366
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,880
You're the owner of the Qiao family noodle house.

367
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,080
We often go there to eat.

368
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,000
What are you doing there?

369
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,520
Let the pretty girl eat with us.

370
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,600
Song, what are you doing?

371
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,280
Isn't that Qiao Qingyu?

372
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,160
Aunt,

373
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,600
what are you doing?

374
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,320
let's make friends with the young people.

375
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,280
Let's go.

376
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:21,960
You're leaving?

377
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,000
What's wrong with you?

378
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,760
What's wrong with you?

379
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,480
What's wrong with you?

380
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
Didn't you say you were going to meet Yi Zhong, Xiaohua and K?

381
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,600
When are we going?

382
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
I'll give you a headache.

383
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,200
Thank you.

384
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,360
You didn't make an appointment?

385
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,760
Then why did you invite us here?

386
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,640
To eat instant noodles and enjoy the scenery with you?

387
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,480
I told my dad that we were going to have a bowl of porridge today.

388
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,000
The difference is too big.

389
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,480
I'll eat yours.

390
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll eat yours.

391
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,960
I'll eat yours.

392
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,720
I'll eat yours.

393
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,480
I'll eat yours.

394
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,320
I'll eat yours.

395
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,280
I'll eat yours.

396
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,320
Song,

397
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,360
why did you pretend to be a man when you saw Qiao Qingyu?

398
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,040
You like to be unfair and drag her down.

399
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:20,880
What's wrong with you?

400
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,560
Did you have a fight with Qiao Qingyu?

401
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:25,600
I see.

402
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,520
You're called

403
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,800
to win the heart and to win the heart.

404
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:29,960
Winning the heart and winning the heart.

405
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,680
Right?

406
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:31,720
I'll eat yours.

407
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,440
You can't avoid eating what you have.

408
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,680
Eat.

409
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,240
Have a bite.

410
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,280
Qiao Qingyu?

411
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,520
The online celebrity Qiao Qingyu

412
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,200
is very handsome and has a very good look.

413
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,560
I'm sorry.

414
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,560
You want to see the original picture or the real me?

415
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
What do you mean?

416
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,080
Hurry up.

417
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,240
Oh my gosh.

418
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,000
Is it that bad?

419
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,120
Did they find out about it?

420
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,360
Is this Qiao Qingyu's clothes?

421
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,080
Did something really happen to her?

422
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,440
Sheng.

423
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,640
Sheng.

424
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,680
Sheng.

425
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
Is a picture enough?

426
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,000
Sheng.

427
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,680
Is it that person?

428
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,960
Sheng, calm down.

429
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,320
Sheng.

430
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,120
I'm sorry.

431
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:13,640
What are you doing?

432
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,320
I'm sorry.

433
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:15,560
I'm sorry.

434
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,680
I'm sorry.

435
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,280
It's not her.

436
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,360
How many more are there in the row?

437
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,760
Let's calm down first.

438
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,880
Calm down.

439
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,600
You hit her.

440
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
You hit her and you came here.

441
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
You scared me.

442
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,560
What's wrong?

443
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,080
What's wrong?

444
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,360
Talk to me.

445
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:34,480
Did you send the picture of Qiao Qingyu?

446
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,200
It's none of your business.

447
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
I mean the picture.

448
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,000
Will you talk to me?

449
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:39,520
Say it again.

450
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,200
Say it again.

451
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,680
What's wrong?

452
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,240
Say it again.

453
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,120
Say it again.

454
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,040
Come on.

455
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,360
Oh my gosh.

456
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,920
Come on.

457
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,120
The picture is her fart.

458
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,080
How can it be so smelly?

459
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,040
It's not good to look at it.

460
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,280
Qiao Qingyu's hair is in the news.

461
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,000
The hair is pasted on the back.

462
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,200
The background is also fixed.

463
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,640
Ye Zilin.

464
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,960
It's me.

465
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,120
Can you blame me?

466
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:21,960
I didn't even touch the picture.

467
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,400
You just went out.

468
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Enough.

469
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,520
The truth is out.

470
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,280
You didn't touch Qiao Qingyu.

471
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,640
So Qiao Qingyu's mother

472
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,800
was scared.

473
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
Only aunt beat her.

474
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,760
I understand why Qiao Qingyu

475
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,440
was so scared of her mother.

476
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,320
She is a cruel person.

477
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,160
Luckily, the police came soon.

478
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,280
Otherwise, I can't stand

479
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,000
so many people fighting.

480
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,800
Because a picture is so impulsive.

481
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,720
It's not like you, Sheng.

482
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
Childish.

483
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
Enough.

484
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,640
Have you said enough?

485
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,920
Enough.

486
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,800
Anyway,

487
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,360
we three have to fight.

488
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,120
I'm sorry.

489
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,040
I'm in big trouble.

490
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,360
The school will know.

491
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,760
I can talk to her.

492
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,360
I'll think about how to deal with your father.

493
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,760
There is no infection.

494
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,720
It's just a case of

495
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,920
keeping people from eating all day long.

496
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,480
I'm so annoyed.

497
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Qingyu.

498
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Qingyu.

499
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,480
Come to the hospital with me tomorrow morning.

500
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Take a blood test.

501
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,680
Qingyu has a math test tomorrow.

502
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,160
It won't affect the college if you don't take the test.

503
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,600
The school has a medical examination every semester.

504
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
It's useless.

505
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,480
You don't understand me.

506
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,080
Take a blood test to make everyone feel relieved.

507
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,200
You can't let people say

508
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,960
what they want to say.

509
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
They have the strength to say it.

510
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,880
It's up to the person.

511
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,560
Don't you know how bad they say?

512
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,080
They say your whole family is sick.

513
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,800
If you go to the hospital and let people see it,

514
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,480
isn't that more idle talk?

515
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,680
Or you go too.

516
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,080
Mom, I'll go.

517
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,080
Isn't it just a blood test?

518
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:16,960
It's quick.

519
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,280
I'll go to class after the blood test.

520
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,720
The school has a medical examination every semester.

521
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,560
The school has a medical examination every semester.

522
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,280
The school has a medical examination every semester.

523
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,520
The school has a medical examination every semester.

524
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,720
The school has a medical examination every semester.

525
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,840
The school has a medical examination every semester.

526
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,200
The school has a medical examination every semester.

527
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,840
The school has a medical examination every semester.

528
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,280
The school has a medical examination every semester.

529
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
The school has a medical examination every semester.

530
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,000
The school has a medical examination every semester.

531
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,320
The school has a medical examination every semester.

532
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,960
Dad is asleep.

533
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,120
What's wrong with mom?

534
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,600
She's insomnia.

535
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
She can't sleep if she's asleep.

536
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,120
She's old. She's like this.

537
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,960
I'll sleep here tonight.

538
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
I don't want to wake her up.

539
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,120
I thought this would pass.

540
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,360
But it turned out to be true.

541
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
I don't want to argue with your mom.

542
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,360
I don't want to argue with your mom.

543
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,360
You're going to take the college entrance exam soon.

544
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
You're going to take the college entrance exam soon.

545
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
You're going to take the college entrance exam soon.

546
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,360
Think about it.

547
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,360
We were pretty close.

548
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,360
We were pretty close.

549
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,360
When we got married,

550
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
they were all my friends.

551
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,360
I was your friend.

552
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Your mom and I

553
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
were in a free love.

554
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,600
But

555
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
I don't know how

556
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,600
I can live my life like this.

557
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,600
Stop drinking.

558
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm sorry.

559
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,840
Jingyu,

560
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
I'm not afraid of your jokes.

561
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
I'm a man.

562
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,840
I'm the pillar of the family.

563
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
But I often

564
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,080
can't stand it.

565
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,080
I'm sorry.

566
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,080
You're really good.

567
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,080
Give me a kiss.

568
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,080
You didn't plan to let Qiao Xin know

569
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,080
about what happened yesterday.

570
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,080
It's okay to avoid her.

571
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,080
Ah Che, your dad is here.

572
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,080
He's in Mr. Sun's office.

573
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,320
Your dad is here.

574
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
He's in Mr. Sun's office.

575
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I thought...

576
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,320
I thought...

577
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
The situation is a bit serious.

578
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,320
Why did Mr. Sun

579
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,320
make your dad so mad?

580
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,320
Mr. Sun made your dad so mad.

581
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,320
Your dad will definitely make you mad tonight.

582
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,320
You're done, Ah Che.

583
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,320
Ah Che.

584
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
Ah Che.

585
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,320
I see you.

586
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,320
Hello.

587
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320
How is it?

588
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,320
Is the signal over there okay?

589
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,320
It's okay.

590
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
It doesn't seem to be lagging.

591
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,320
The show is over.

592
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
It's very good.

593
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,320
It's very successful.

594
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
When I was envious for the last time,

595
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,320
the applause lasted

596
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,320
four or five minutes.

597
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
Do you know how excited I was?

598
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
Oh, right.

599
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
This is from Yuemi.

600
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,320
Mom,

601
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
congratulations.

602
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,320
Good luck.

603
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
Thank you.

604
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
How are you?

605
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
I'm fine.

606
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,320
I learned half of the words

607
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,320
from the school president.

608
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
It's a small achievement.

609
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
Ah Che.

610
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Mom, you don't have to persuade me.

611
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320
I just want to remember.

612
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,320
I won't do

613
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,320
what he wants me to do.

614
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
You're an adult now.

615
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,320
We can talk like adults.

616
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Can you listen to me?

617
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
I really don't want

618
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
your relationship with your father

619
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
to be so different.

620
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,320
I know very well

621
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,320
how he feels about you.

622
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,320
He's not good at growing up.

623
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
You can also

624
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
talk like us.

625
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
You can be honest with each other.

626
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,320
This is good for you.

627
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,320
Okay?

628
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Wait a minute.

629
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
There's something

630
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,320
that's been hidden

631
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,320
in my heart for more than ten years.

632
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
I want to tell you.

633
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Back then,

634
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,320
I left your father

635
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
on my own.

636
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
Your father

637
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
put all his energy

638
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,320
into his work.

639
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
We were a family.

640
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,320
I thought that

641
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,320
it would be a bad thing

642
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,320
for us.

643
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
So I insisted on leaving.

644
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I was very willful

645
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
and impulsive.

646
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,320
I didn't want to leave

647
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
because I didn't want to

648
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,320
be a burden to my family.

649
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,320
I didn't want to leave

650
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
because I didn't want to

651
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,320
be impulsive.

652
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,320
I insisted on leaving with you.

653
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Your grandfather disagreed.

654
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
He was right.

655
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
I was alone in France.

656
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,320
I had no shelter.

657
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,320
I ate too much

658
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
and didn't get enough sleep.

659
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
How could I give you

660
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,320
a normal life?

661
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
He said

662
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
he wanted to keep you

663
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
and leave on his own.

664
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,320
I was selfish.

665
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Because of my selfishness,

666
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,320
I made you and your father

667
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
become like this.

668
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Because of my selfishness,

669
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
you became so rebellious.

670
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
I didn't want you to forgive me.

671
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
I just wanted to let you know the truth.

672
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
I'm sorry.

674
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
Yanqiu.

675
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Dr. Chen's dog.

676
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,320
You've raised it well.

677
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,320
You don't know.

678
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
It's been a mess

679
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
since I came here.

680
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
These days

681
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,320
are just as important as before.

682
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,320
I brought some fruit.

683
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,320
Thank you.

684
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
It's windy today.

685
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Really?

686
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,320
How is your family?

687
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,320
They're doing well.

688
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
The deceased patient's family

689
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,320
has applied for medical confirmation.

690
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,320
The Medical Regulation Committee

691
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
has also joined.

692
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,320
The results will be out in a few days.

693
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,320
Everyone has to face

694
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
the death of a patient.

695
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,320
If they're sick

696
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
or hospitalized,

697
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
if they don't cure the disease,

698
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,320
it's all the doctor's responsibility.

699
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,320
But doctors are not gods.

700
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
Doctors are just the excuses.

701
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
They've suffered so much

702
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,320
and they still have to suffer.

703
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,320
This is probably

704
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
the greatness

705
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
and the sacredness

706
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,320
of our profession.

707
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Everyone

708
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
has his own

709
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
perspective and position.

710
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Everyone is willing

711
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,320
to look at the problem

712
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
from his own perspective.

713
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,320
I've been thinking

714
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
about it for a long time.

715
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
The knot in life

716
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
that can't be untied.

717
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,320
I started to stand

718
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
at the patient's point of view.

719
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
I even stood at the point

720
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,320
of my son, Sheng.

721
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
At this time,

722
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,320
I suddenly understood

723
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,320
why they could be so powerful.

724
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,320
I was so angry.

725
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
When I really started

726
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
to understand them,

727
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
the knot in my heart

728
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
was untied at any time.

729
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,320
No matter what the result is,

730
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,320
I believe in you.

731
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
Don't...

732
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,320
Don't say that.

733
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
It's not that bad.

734
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
It's not that bad.

735
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Even if I can't

736
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
do the surgery anymore,

737
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
I still

738
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
have other things to do.

739
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
I still believe

740
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
in fairness and justice.

741
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,320
I believe in you.

742
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,320
Don't talk about me.

743
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,320
Talk about you.

744
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
How are you recently?

745
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,320
I...

746
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
That nurse

747
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
didn't ask you to go on a blind date, did she?

748
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
I think

749
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,320
she's quite like you.

750
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
She's like me.

751
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
We're both pretty good.

752
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
You're not going to answer me, are you?

753
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
If you have any questions,

754
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
you can ask me.

755
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,320
I'm your father.

756
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
You're a high-ranking police officer.

757
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
This is a community.

758
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
Don't play with me.

759
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
I'm your father.

760
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,320
I'm your mother.

761
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
You're so strong.

762
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
Don't talk to me like that.

763
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
Okay, okay.

764
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,320
I'll go to the car.

765
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,320
I'm warning you.

766
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,320
You bastard.

767
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,320
You bastard.

768
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,320
You're not going to answer me.

769
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,320
I'm so angry.

770
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
I'm going to die.

771
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,320
I'm warning you.

772
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,320
You're not going to answer me.

773
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm warning you.

774
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Momo.

775
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:31,320
I called the police yesterday.

776
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
I called them.

777
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
They said

778
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,320
they were going to call me.

779
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,320
I told them

780
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
that I'm going to go to the police station.

781
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
I called them.

782
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
I want to help mom.

783
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Be brave like you.

784
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Do something.

785
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
The police came

786
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
to ask mom if she wanted to take responsibility for her father.

787
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Mom refused without thinking.

788
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
After the police left,

789
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
dad was even angrier.

790
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
He beat up a Greek in the house.

791
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,320
Mom said I was not sensible.

792
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
How could I send my father

793
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
to the police station?

794
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
He didn't sleep all night.

795
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
It's so obvious that it's right and wrong.

796
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,320
Is there no place to talk about it?

797
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
The police said

798
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
if this happens again,

799
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
you must not be indifferent

800
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,320
and call the police immediately

801
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,320
and apply for legal aid.

802
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
I hate my dad.

803
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
I hate him

804
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,320
for not doing anything

805
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
and only hurting me and my mom.

806
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
But now,

807
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
I hate myself even more.

808
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
I'm sorry.

809
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,320
I'm sorry.
