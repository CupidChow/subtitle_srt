Am I beautiful?

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,520
Am I only beautiful today?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,000
On my way to the oatmeal

4
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:20,380
Find the light

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,300
That aims at the sky

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,300
I'm so happy that I can see you again.

7
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,300

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,300
I'm so happy that I can see you again.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,300
I'm so happy that I can see you again.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,300
I'm so happy that I can see you again.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:11,300

I'm so happy that I can see you again.

23
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,300
I'm so happy that I can see you again.

24
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:23,300
It's not a death. It's an suicide.

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,300
It's not a death. It's an suicide.

26
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,300
The patient found out early and got well on time.

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,300
Actually, he could have lived long.

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,300
Someone posted his situation and personal information online.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Someone posted his situation and personal information online.

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,740
1 week after the lift

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,600
Hello?

32
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,740
Hello?

33
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,040
Bei Yu?

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,000
Who are you looking for?

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,680
It's Qia íbei yu.

36
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,900
Hello?

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,680
Who are you looking for?

38
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,240
Is this Qia òbei yu's call?

39
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:10,940
You called the wrong number.

40
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,480
I didn't expect the call hold.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,440
Stop calling!

42
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,700
Why do you still not answer

43
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,080
Bei Yu's call?

44
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,780
How's his heart?

45
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,980
I'm begging you.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,180
I'm begging you.

47
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
Don't be like that.

48
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,620
Please.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,780
I'm begging you.

50
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,900
Since then,

51
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,300
he's been receiving messages and calls day and night.

52
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,140
There are rascals who harass him.

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,220
More so, those strangers who are self-righteous.

54
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,780
They insult him and force him to do so.

55
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,220
He quit school in Hwanzu.

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,940
Finally, at the end of the year,

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,660
he secretly left the hospital.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,140
unhappy

59
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,740
Old man.

60
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,220
The sea is so beautiful

61
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,220

The sea is so beautiful

73
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
The sea is so beautiful

74
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220

The sea is so beautiful

87
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,220
The sea is so beautiful

88
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,220
Footage is available on Youtube

89
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:36,220

90
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,220
You can download footage after desse laughing

91
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,040
What should we do?

92
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:51,940
Let's just fall shot.

93
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,420
What do you think?

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,880

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,620
but I somehow idealize this Аb際IE̶

97
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,860
floog the law,

98
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,960
which was meant to制补 rough frequency of 부분.

99
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,000
Yes, yes!

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,320
Excuse me,

101
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,740
ibr hill there's a test out tomorrow.

102
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,900
Otherwise, our school is a college entrance exam.

103
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,560
So be sure to keep good rings

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,920
before you go to school.

105
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,460
Got it?

106
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,560
Yes, sir!

107
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,840

110
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,280
And

111
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,120
that's the AA xanax attached to the desk.

112
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,860
There's no AA xanax to rub against!

113
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,220
You're KL ending people of wrong kind.

114
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,600
Yezi Lin,

115
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,420
I'll clean up before

116
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,080
you fight your ship.

117
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm not saying this to you. I just want to give you a chance.

118
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,880
Anyway, the table is clean.

119
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,320
We'll check it in the morning.

120
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,080
I promise to complete the task.

121
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,080
Jin Yu.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,080
Jin Yu.

123
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,680
This is the highlight of my final exam.

124
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,080
You're giving me all of this?

125
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,480
Take it. I'm going to take the exam the day after tomorrow.

126
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,080
You don't need to take it.

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,880
Keep it and read it slowly.

128
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,280
Thank you.

129
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,280
Jin Yu.

130
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
I've decided to treat my dad.

131
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,480
I borrowed money from my aunties and signed the paper.

132
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
It's 200,000 in total.

133
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,880
You've thought it through?

134
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,480
I'm not doing this because of the rumors.

135
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,280
I just realized...

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,280
I still love my dad.

137
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,880
I want to save him.

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I don't want to regret it.

139
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
You want to treat your dad.

140
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,880
Will your mom agree?

141
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,480
Actually, I don't think my mom is doing this because she cares about money.

142
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
She doesn't want to drag me down.

143
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
She's the one who's dragging me down.

144
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,480
If she's the one who's sick,

145
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
she'll choose to give up on treatment.

146
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Jin Yu.

147
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Actually, I've always envied you and Ming Sheng.

148
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:42,480
You don't have the courage to challenge the world.

149
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm responsible for it.

150
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
From now on, I want to be a brave and responsible person.

151
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Mom.

152
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Mom.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Mom, what happened to your foot?

154
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
It's okay. I just got it.

155
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Qin Yu, your mom came to the hospital to see my mom.

156
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,480
To comfort my mom, she told me about the past.

157
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,480
She said that after your sister passed away,

158
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
she almost jumped out of the hospital window.

159
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
It's okay.

160
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Fortunately, two nurses stopped her.

161
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
Let's go.

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Let's go. I'll do it.

163
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
You can't... Can you take her?

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I'm all grown up.

165
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Okay.

166
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
There are many cars.

167
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,480
She also said that if it weren't for you and your brother,

168
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
she would have gone with Qiao Pei.

169
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
I'm going to bed.

170
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Qin Yu, I think you might have missed your mom.

171
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I think your mom loves your sister very much.

172
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,480
But sometimes, adults' love is hidden very deeply.

173
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Hurry up and finish your homework.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Don't wash the dishes. Just put them in the water.

175
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll clean up after I come back.

176
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Mom, you've said that many times.

177
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I'll go back to the store.

178
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
The key.

179
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
It's here.

180
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Mom, don't bring me food anymore.

181
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
I can cook.

182
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
You don't have to pick me up from school.

183
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,480
If you're worried, call me and tell me if I'm back on time.

184
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
I'll be back in a few days.

185
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,480
I'll call you when I get home and see if I'm back on time.

186
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
I was a little immature.

187
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I won't let you worry about me.

188
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,480
I think Qingqing made a good point.

189
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
You're always busy at the store.

190
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Why don't you pick her up?

191
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
It's tiring.

192
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Yes, Aunt.

193
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Jinrui's past is so long.

194
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
But she's still in love with you.

195
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
I don't think she's going to be able to get over it.

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
She's not going to be able to get over it.

197
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
But she's going to be able to get over it.

198
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
She's not going to be able to get over it.

199
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,480
But she's going to be able to get over it.

200
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Yes, Aunt.

201
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Jinrui's past is so long.

202
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Qingqing has learned a lesson.

203
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Didn't you say she was improving in the final exam?

204
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Hello, Qiao's Noodle House.

205
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Hello.

206
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,480
My family called.

207
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,480
They said my grandfather fell down when he went to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

208
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
He couldn't stand up.

209
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
They don't have enough people now.

210
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
So they asked your mother to go back and help.

211
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
My mother is still sick.

212
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
How can I let one patient take care of another patient?

213
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Who's sick?

214
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
I'm not sick.

215
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Put the money in the bag.

216
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Didn't we agree on this before?

217
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
My grandparents' old house belongs to Uncle.

218
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
I'll follow Uncle to grow old.

219
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,480
My family and Uncle are in charge of paying.

220
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Why are you paying and making money now?

221
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,480
There are some things that kids don't understand.

222
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
How can a family be so clear?

223
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
If you want to calculate it,

224
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
You said you were so angry.

225
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
You've lost your job.

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
To be honest, we owe it to them.

227
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I just don't think it's going to work.

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
And my grandparents said,

229
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
They're really sorry for us.

230
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
We're a family.

231
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
We're still in the process of breaking the bones.

232
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Our family is in the south.

233
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,480
I'm old.

234
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Your father and I have to go back.

235
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Besides,

236
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Your sister is still there.

237
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,480
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
I'm sorry.

239
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
I'm sorry.

240
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I'm sorry.

241
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I'm sorry.

243
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,480
I'm sorry.

244
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
I'm sorry.

246
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm sorry.

247
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
I'm sorry.

248
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,480
I'm sorry.

249
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,480
I'm sorry.

250
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,480
I'm sorry.

252
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
I'm sorry.

254
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,480
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,480
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,480
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,480
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I'm sorry.

264
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I'm sorry.

265
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,480
My heart was broken and broken again.

267
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,480
You're my로

268
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
You're my flow.

269
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
How bad can you ever be,

270
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,480
this lucky day,

271
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
what art's path amazingly

272
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
It flows freely.

273
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
There is no one

274
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
who orchestral me like a beggar.

275
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
It seems like the harder we try, the more ridiculous we become.

276
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I think I understand.

277
00:15:41,480 --> 00:16:08,200
Giant

278
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,200
Okay.

279
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,200
I'll go get it.

280
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
You should come too.

281
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,200
Junyuan, your mom is coming back home in two months.

282
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,200
Why isn't she back yet?

283
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
My grandpa's illness is getting worse.

284
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
He can't leave us.

285
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,200
That's why the elderly are afraid of sleeping.

286
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Did you hear?

287
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Last night, Wang left.

288
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Wang?

289
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Which Wang?

290
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Junyuan.

291
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Your good friend, Wang's father.

292
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,200
That's why you should live well.

293
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Health is the most important thing.

294
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,200
The clean sheets are in my closet.

295
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Remember to remove the electric door box in the morning.

296
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Otherwise, it's too dangerous.

297
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
And don't turn the air conditioner too low.

298
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Turn it to 25-60 degrees.

299
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Turn it too low.

300
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I know, mom.

301
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,200
I'll hang up.

302
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,200
Are you done?

303
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Junyuan, I noticed that you've been getting better lately.

304
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,200
You're very patient and filial to your mom.

305
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
Are you a fake Qiao Qingyu?

306
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Do you think I'm real or fake?

307
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
It's still the same smell.

308
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,200
When I was young, my dad would buy me a bottle when I was going to school.

309
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,200
Mom wouldn't let me drink.

310
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I went home after drinking.

311
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,200
This is a little secret between my dad and me.

312
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Mom doesn't know.

313
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:03,200
These days, I've been busy at the hospital, the clinic, the cemetery.

314
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,200
I came back and ran.

315
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I just found out that someone had died.

316
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
There are so many things to do.

317
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I went to the police station and cancelled my dad's household registration.

318
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Now, there are only my mom and I in the household registration book.

319
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,200
When I was packing last night,

320
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I found out that my dad had a birthday card I made for him when I was young.

321
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:41,200
There are seven cards in total, from three to nine years old.

322
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Then, my dad's business failed.

323
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Our family's life changed completely.

324
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Looking at those cards, I thought,

325
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
If time could go back to the past,

326
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
It would be so nice to go back to the past.

327
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Oh, right. I forgot to tell you.

328
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
I got admitted to Yanbei University.

329
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
Congratulations.

330
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,200
I'm going to take my mom to Beining.

331
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I still have some money left from my dad's medical treatment.

332
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:31,200
My aunties said I don't have to pay back the money.

333
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
She asked me to take this money to Beining and settle down with my mom.

334
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Will you come back?

335
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
I don't know.

336
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I'm not sure.

337
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I'm not sure.

338
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I'm not sure.

339
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Will you come back?

340
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,200
I don't know.

341
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I don't have a home in Hwanzhou.

342
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
What if I miss you?

343
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
You can call me.

344
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,200
You can write me a letter.

345
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
When you graduate, you can go to Beining to play with me.

346
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
I won't forget you.

347
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
You can't forget me either.

348
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I promise.

349
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Jin Yu.

350
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Actually, I've always admired Ming Sheng.

351
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I told you not to accept him.

352
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
I actually have a selfish motive.

353
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
I know.

354
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
You know?

355
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm off work now.

356
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Thank you.

357
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
Bye.

358
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
Xiao Huang, I'm off work now.

359
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Okay, bye.

360
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,200
Bye.

361
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
Oh, right.

362
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
Xiao Huang.

363
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,200
The elderly in the sixth bed don't have anyone to take care of them.

364
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Go to the care center and ask them when they can send someone.

365
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Okay.

366
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Please come with me.

367
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Ms. Ye.

368
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
You're here again to wait for your dad to get off work?

369
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Yes.

370
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I'm here to see you.

371
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,200
I'm here to see you.

372
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
I'm here to see you.

373
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
I'm here to see you.

374
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
You're here again to wait for your dad to get off work?

375
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Yes.

376
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
Isn't your original class for the nursing school?

377
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Why do you go to the hospital every day?

378
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,200
I'm here because my dad is the only one in the family.

379
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,200
I'm the only one who cares about the elderly.

380
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Did Yan Qiu leave?

381
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I think he just left.

382
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Mr. Song, are you going to introduce Yan Qiu to her again?

383
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
Yes.

384
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,200
I told her already.

385
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,200
I told her to wait for me.

386
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Ms. Zhang.

387
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Mr. Song, did you see Yan Qiu?

388
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
No.

389
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,200
You're faster than a rabbit when you introduce someone to her.

390
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,200
Ms. Zhang, is this the person you're looking for for Yan Qiu?

391
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Yes.

392
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Look at this.

393
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
This is a graduate from the school of 985.

394
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,200
He's very talented.

395
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
A graduate?

396
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Yes.

397
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
And this.

398
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Although he's not very good at studying,

399
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
he has several houses in his house.

400
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,200
This one looks very cool.

401
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,200
Isn't that very rich?

402
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,200
And this one.

403
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,200
His parents are all college teachers.

404
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
In the future, the family will get along very well, right?

405
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes.

406
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
And...

407
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
And what else?

408
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Why do I have to tell you so much?

409
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm going to look for Yan Qiu.

410
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Okay.

411
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Bye, Ms. Zhang.

412
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Bye.

413
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
He left?

414
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
I'm so scared.

415
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm scared of the nurse.

416
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Let's go.

417
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Yan Qiu,

418
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
you really don't think about it.

419
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Those two were excellent.

420
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
I was moved by them.

421
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,200
I'll beat you if you don't believe me.

422
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,200
But to be honest,

423
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,200
you don't want to go on a blind date because you already have someone you like.

424
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,200
You really do.

425
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Then you have to work hard.

426
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
You have to get a contract as soon as possible.

427
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,200
It's not something that can be said by one person.

428
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,200
You'll understand when you grow up.

429
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Dad.

430
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,200
Why are you here?

431
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,200
Did you eat?

432
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Yes.

433
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,200
I just met Ms. Zhang outside.

434
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm here to introduce you to her.

435
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Don't you think those guys are pretty good?

436
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I think she's very moving.

437
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I can't tell. You're quite gossipy.

438
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
How am I gossipy?

439
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,200
I'm worried.

440
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
You said that Ms. Yang is so gentle and kind.

441
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
She's a good person.

442
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
What if she was cheated by those guys outside?

443
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Are you talking about the Fang Jinqiu I know?

444
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Don't change the subject.

445
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Let me ask you.

446
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
If Ms. Yang really likes someone,

447
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
what would you do?

448
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,200
If she really has someone she likes,

449
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
I'll give her my blessings.

450
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,200
The first medical worker of Hwan Zhou City.

451
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
Dad.

452
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I'll go with you.

453
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,200
I'll do it myself.

454
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,200
Put the spoons in yourself.

455
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,200
I'll do it myself.

456
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I'll do it myself.

457
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Dad.

458
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
You're going to put so much?

459
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,200
Even though we Shuyun people are good at eating spicy food,

460
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,200
but people like us who put sugar in chili oil,

461
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
only you and Xiaobei can eat it.

462
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
And Mei Zi...

463
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Eat it.

464
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Dad.

465
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,200
Do you regret sending Qiao Bei Yi back to Nan Qiao Village?

466
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
We're sorry.

467
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Go home and pick up the phone.

468
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I'll call you later.

469
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Director Ming.

470
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
You're not going in yet?

471
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I'll wait for my son.

472
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Okay, you wait first. I'll go in first.

473
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Okay.

474
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
Where's Ming Sheng?

475
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Ming Sheng told me to come.

476
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
He said he's here to save the country.

477
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Ming Sheng told me to come.

478
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
He said he's here to save the country.

479
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
What channel are you on?

480
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I'm on Mei.

481
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
What are you...

482
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
What are you doing?

483
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Please.

484
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Do you think you and Yan Xiao's underground team

485
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
are really so good?

486
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
No one noticed it at all.

487
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
We've broken up.

488
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I know.

489
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,200
But I can tell that you have someone in your heart.

490
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Dad, you've done enough for the sake of your career and me.

491
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
It's time to face your feelings honestly.

492
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
It's time to pursue your own happiness.

493
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,200
The most important thing is that

494
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
whether it's me or Yan Qiu,

495
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,200
you don't need to sacrifice yourself for your own good.

496
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Only when you're happy,

497
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
will people around you be happy.

498
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Do you understand?

499
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Okay.

500
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Give Yan Qiu the phone.

501
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
I have something to tell him.

502
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Hurry.

503
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Okay.

504
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Hello?

505
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,200
Yan Qiu.

506
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I'll leave my old dad to you.

507
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Also, I won't call you sister anymore.

508
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
Call me auntie.

509
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,200
So you won't mess up your generation.

510
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm hanging up.

511
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Since you're here,

512
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
why don't you come in with me?

513
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
No, thanks.

514
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,200
You're all colleagues.

515
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
We've only met on the street.

516
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Besides, if we go in together,

517
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
it'll be a misunderstanding.

518
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Director Lee, this way.

519
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,200
Mr. Lu Fan, are you looking for me?

520
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
I was sorting out the information at the association a few days ago.

521
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,200
I found the DVD that Bei Yu left behind.

522
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Actually, this is his privacy.

523
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,200
I should keep it a secret for him.

524
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,200
But I'm not sure if I can get it back.

525
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I'll give it to you after I think it over.

526
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,200
I'm Qiao Bei Yu.

527
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,200
I'm 22 years old.

528
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
I'm a person who has cancer.

529
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I heard that

530
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,200
you're a person who has cancer.

531
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I heard that

532
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,200
you're a person who has cancer.

533
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I heard that

534
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
you're a person who has cancer.

535
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,200
I heard that

536
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
when I was born,

537
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,200
my grandparents who were in the ward

538
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,200
knew that I was a girl.

539
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
They didn't even look at me.

540
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,200
They went back to the village.

541
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Now that I think about it,

542
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,200
maybe from that moment on,

543
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
I'm destined

544
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
to be disappointed in my family.

545
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Before I was six years old,

546
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
I lived with my parents.

547
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,200
We lived in Shunyuan.

548
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,200
I didn't have much money,

549
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
but I was the only child in the family.

550
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,200
I enjoyed my parents' love.

551
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,200
That was the most

552
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,200
carefree moment of my life.

553
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
After that,

554
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,200
my parents' love was born.

555
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,200
She's also a girl.

556
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
My grandparents didn't have time to take care of me.

557
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Fortunately, they took me back to Nan Qiao Village.

558
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Mom!

559
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
Mom!

560
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Mom!

561
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Mom!

562
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Mom!

563
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Mom!

564
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,200
Go with your grandma.

565
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Okay.

566
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,200
Don't worry.

567
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Go with your grandma.

568
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Go, go, go.

569
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Mom, I don't want to go.

570
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,200
Okay, okay.

571
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Mom, I don't want to go.

572
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
My dad said

573
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,200
when my brother is born,

574
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,200
I can go back to my parents.

575
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I'm sorry.

576
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,200
My brother, Xiao Yu, is finally born.

577
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
But my parents didn't keep their promise.

578
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm an extra.

579
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,200
I don't deserve to be married.

580
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,200
Come out, Jin Rui.

581
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
You can put it down.

582
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I don't want to.

583
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,200
You can order it yourself.

584
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
Okay, I'll order it.

585
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
It's so pretty.

586
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
It's so pretty.

587
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
Jin Rui.

588
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Xiao Bei.

589
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,200
Why are you back?

590
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,200
We came back after the vacation.

591
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
What's wrong?

592
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I accidentally slipped when I was tidying up the room.

593
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
Let me see.

594
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Let me see.

595
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Let me wipe it for you.

598
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Does it hurt?

599
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
No.

600
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I don't know when it started.

601
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I only know that Jin Rui is my only uncle in Nan Qiao Village.

602
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:15,200
He's my closest friend.

603
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
Jin Rui.

604
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Jin Rui.

605
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
What did you think about when you were in college?

606
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Let me think about it.

607
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,200
I'm still in the first year of college.

608
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm thinking about what I should do after college.

609
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,200
By the way, Xiao Bei.

610
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,200
You should find a job after graduation.

611
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
Xiao Bei is pretty.

612
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I'm pretty good.

613
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,200
We didn't have any blood ties.

614
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
So I thought...

615
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I thought we could love each other forever.

616
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
We could be together forever.

617
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,200
It's still delicious.

618
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
Eat more.

619
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,200
It's a pity that dreams come true.

620
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Go to the hospital now.

621
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Jin Rui left me.

622
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,200
He didn't look back at me.

623
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I don't blame him.

624
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,200
Because I know that this is my destiny.

625
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Let's love.

626
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Hey, beauty, walking by alone. I'll treat you to a late-night snack.

627
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,200
No thanks.

628
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
How lonely you are alone at night, huh?

629
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Who are you? What do you want?

630
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Let's go for a late-night snack.

631
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
No thanks.

632
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,200
Who are you?

633
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
You're so bold.

634
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I didn't know you were this bold.

635
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
I'll hit you.

636
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Are you okay?

637
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm fine. Thank you, brother.

638
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,200
No need to thank me.

639
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,200
What's wrong? Did you drop something?

640
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,200
Yes, I think my phone is stuck inside.

641
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
It's stuck here?

642
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Then it's fine.

643
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,200
I'll find you a phone later.

644
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
I'm sure I can find it.

645
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Did that kid hurt you?

646
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
You can't blame him.

647
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,200
You're really pretty.

648
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,200
Don't be afraid. Let's go.

649
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,200
I'll find you a phone.

650
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,200
That's how people are.

651
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,200
The more you want something, the less you get it.

652
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,200
The less you get it, the more you want it.

653
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm sorry.

654
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm sorry.

655
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
I'm sorry.

656
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
I can't figure it out.

657
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,200
What are you doing?

658
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I told you we were already broke.

659
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I feel like I'm walking into a dead loop.

660
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
I can't see any hope.

661
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,200
I can't figure it out until I'm sick.

662
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Why did you say it was a blue-eyed eye when you were hospitalized?

663
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Why did you become so sick because of him?

664
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
I didn't say anything.

665
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I was alone in the hospital.

666
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,200
I thought,

667
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,200
I'll just let them die.

668
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,200
But then the school found out.

669
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,200
It gave me a lot of encouragement.

670
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:05,200
It made me get back on my feet.

671
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
And then,

672
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Mom and Dad found out.

673
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Mom, don't run.

674
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,200
If anyone can turn around,

675
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Please take me away.

676
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,200
If anyone can accept it,

677
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,200
Please don't hesitate.

678
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,200
Someone envies you.

679
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Please be free.

680
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm willing to be with you.

681
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,200
I'm willing to be with you.

682
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Mom,

683
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I turned off the power.

684
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,200
I left Qingqing and Xiaoyu in the water.

685
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,200
I'm the only one who has a heart.

686
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,200
If the water flows into the river,

687
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,200
I'll be left behind.

688
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,200
If the water flows into my heart,

689
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I won't look back.

690
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
I'm so proud of you.

691
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,200
It's pretty.

692
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,200
Let's go.

693
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
It's pretty, Mom.

694
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
It's pretty.

695
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
Did you give it to me?

696
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
It's pretty.

697
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I'll give it to you.

698
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Sometimes I think,

699
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Life isn't all bad.

700
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,200
During the time I was hospitalized,

701
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
I realized that

702
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Many people love me.

703
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Mom and Dad love me too.

704
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Just like Qingqing and Xiaoyu.

705
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,200
I know.

706
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
My hair.

707
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
It's delicious.

708
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,200
Mom,

709
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
My hair is so white.

710
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,200
Drink more.

711
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,200
I'll go out after drinking.

712
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,200
Doctor Fan said,

713
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,200
When I'm ready,

714
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,200
I can share this dream with the person I love.

715
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,200
I want that day,

716
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
It should be here soon.

717
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:29,200
I won't look back.

718
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I'm so proud of you.

719
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
I'm so proud of you.

720
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,200
I'm so proud of you.

721
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,200
I'm so proud of you.

722
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
I'm so proud of you.

723
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200
I'm so proud of you.

724
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,200
I'm so proud of you.

725
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,200
I'm so proud of you.

726
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
I'm so proud of you.

727
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,200
I'm so proud of you.

728
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm so proud of you.

729
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
I'm so proud of you.

730
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
I'm so proud of you.

731
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I'm so proud of you.

732
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,200
The distance between us is getting smaller.

733
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,200
We're getting closer step by step.

734
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,200
In the future,

735
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:46,200
Time will open the mystery.

736
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Waiting is the reason for life.

737
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,200
But it will never end.

738
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:11,200
It turns out that my heart is your name.

739
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,200
The only stubbornness in my heart.

740
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,200
From the first glance,

741
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Describe the future.

742
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:31,200
The dream is becoming real.

743
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:39,200
It turns out that your heart is also unknown.

744
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,200
The same story is being kept.

745
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,200
Fortunately, you're not mature enough.

746
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,200
You didn't have the courage to come.

747
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:01,200
That's why time is so different.
