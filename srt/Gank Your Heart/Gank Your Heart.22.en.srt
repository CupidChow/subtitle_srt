Congratulations to both contestants
for entering the final commentary round.

5
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:53,580
Next up, random highlights from iConquer
matches will be played on the screen.

And two contestants
will be giving a live commentary.

7
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,590
First up, we will have Qiao Xin
do a live commentary.

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,310
[Commentator, Qiao Xin]

9
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,080
Please come forward.

10
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,230
Thank you.

11
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,570
I will begin my commentary.

12
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:19,850
Soon after the match started,
Pei Xi suppressed Lu Sheng on the lane,

13
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,970
stopping Lu Sheng's Creator from farming.

14
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,829
The match has reached
8 minutes 46 seconds,

15
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,950
and a drastic change happened.

16
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,840
With high amount of gold, Pei Xi
tried to tower dive to kill Lu Sheng.

17
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,210
But he was stunned by Lu Sheng's
Arctic Ground.

18
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,550
Fortunately, Pei Xi reacted quickly.

19
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,710
He chose to fall back
and retreat to the tower.

20
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,300
The biggest surprise was,

21
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,460
Lu Sheng, who always played safe,
seemed to have changed completely.

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,870
He tower dived.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,350
Two players from Legends
also came to Pei Xi's aid in time.

24
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,460
Lu Sheng fought fiercely in this battle.

25
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,040
What do you think, Chairman Guo?

26
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,200
You Xing Video has a great talent.

27
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,500
She has a high chance of becoming
the female version of Luo Tian.

28
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,770
And badly injured
Legends team's two Supports.

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,020
Luo Tian.

30
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,740
What do you think?

31
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,550
-Lu Sheng is fighting three alone.
-Not bad.

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,930
He skillfully avoided the players
from Legends.

33
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,960
Miss Mi Ya, any comments?

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,520
I came here with a mindset to learn.

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,280
I don't know much about commentary.

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,520
But based on what we've seen,

37
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,030
I think Qiao Xin is pretty good.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,710
Which helped Qi Yue earn a triple kill.

39
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,720
Thank you.

40
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,170
That's all for my commentary.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,040
Excellent commentary. Thank you, Qiao Xin.

42
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,800
Everyone, what did you think of
Qiao Xin's commentary?

43
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,120
Was it good?

44
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,200
-No, it was bad!
-It was bad!

45
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:55,460
According to the real-time voting
by the live audiences,

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,770
Qiao Xin still remains in the first place,
while Qiu Ying is in second.

47
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,450
The gap between their votes
is also getting bigger.

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,670
Who will be the champion in the end?

49
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:11,340
Alright. Next up, Qiu Ying
will be doing the live commentary.

50
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,530
The floor is yours.

51
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,830
-Qiu Ying, you can do it!
-Go, Qiu Ying!

52
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,190
Take it easy!

53
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,070
Hello, summoners!
Welcome to iConquer Fall Championship.

54
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,050
Since the start of the Fall Championship,

55
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,100
VNG has fallen into their darkest hour
which lasted for a long time.

56
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,409
The team made bold adjustments
to their composition under great pressure.

57
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,409
They switched Lu Sheng
from top lane to mid.

58
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,970
In the first round, VNG lost the game.

59
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,430
The second round is about to begin. Let's
see if they're able to turn the tables.

60
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:10,960
At the start of the game,
VNG's Double Yue chose to release the fog

61
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,410
and head to the river.

62
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,260
What are they planning?

63
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,410
Let's see. Here comes Lin Yi Xuan!

64
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,670
Looks like VNG figured he would be there.

65
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,710
They've attacked! Shen Yue
trapped Lin Yi Xuan with second skill.

66
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,110
Qi Yue takes over and earns first blood!

67
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,800
What a brilliant move!

68
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
It has helped VNG
gain advantage in the early game.

69
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,460
After a short peaceful moment,

70
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,550
VNG's Double Yue launched
another attack on the bot lane.

71
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,200
They used the same tactic
by having Shen Yue controlling Lu Feng.

72
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,110
And then Qi Yue takes over
and kills Lu Feng.

73
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,570
At this moment,
Qi Yue activates rapid speed.

74
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,700
Tower dive! He dived
and killed Huo Yao in a swift move.

75
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,140
This remarkable double kill
has laid the path to VNG's victory.

76
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,300
Good job, Qiu Ying!

77
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,110
Does this battle tactic
sound familiar to all of you?

78
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,210
That's right.
They used to be called Double Yue.

79
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,890
To have the guts to use
an abandoned tactic in a crucial game.

80
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,840
Perhaps he's the only one in the league
who would do that.

81
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,920
He is the new captain of VNG,

82
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,910
who is known to be
the Battlefield Trickster.

83
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,840
Ji Xiang Kong.

84
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,500
Ji Xiang Kong joined VNG
with an annual pay of 1 yuan.

85
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,100
He brought back Double Yue
despite the pressure of bad criticism.

86
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,350
As VNG's slogan goes,

87
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,650
"Be fearless! Keep going forward!"

88
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,730
In this match, he did it.

89
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,630
He created a brand new VNG.

90
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,510
To always have hope,

91
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,620
and keep going forward,

92
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,790
to reach the top of the world with you.

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,320
[I know you will reach
the top of the world one day.]

94
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:17,100
[Then I hope you'll be the one standing
on the commentator stage that day,]

95
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,900
[announcing to the world that China's team
has won the world champion title.]

96
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,590
[Does Qiu Ying really know you that well?]

97
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,000
[Xiang Kong.]

98

[How much have I missed in your life?]

99
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,830
I'm close to tears.

100
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:37,340
I'd be crying if there weren't
so many people here.

101
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,900
She's pretty good.

102
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,520
But I think Qiao Xin
suits GDV's style better.

103
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,030
Qiu Ying, you're the best!

104
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,480
Go, Qiu Ying!

105
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,200
Keep it up! Keep it up!

106
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,180

107
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,540
Thank you.

108
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,300
That's all for my commentary.

109
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,430
Excellent commentary, Thank you, Qiu Ying.

110
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,780
This way, please. Qiao Xin,
please come to the center of the stage.

111
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,090
Both of them gave excellent commentaries.
It's hard to tell who's better.

112
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,370
Right now, I have the final result
for the audiences' votes.

113
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,980
Qiao Xin is still in the lead
with slightly more votes.

114
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,460
But it's still hard to tell
who will be the winner today.

115
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,419
Based on the rules,
every judge holds one vote.

116
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,020
If you vote for Qiao Xin,
please raise the blue sign.

117
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:44,920
If you vote for Qiu Ying,
please raise the red.

118
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,630
Each vote from the judge equals to
100 votes from the live audiences here.

119
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:52,980
Thus, judges, it's your time to vote.

120
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,690
Those two.

121
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,130
Congratulations!
Qiao Xin has gotten the first two votes.

122
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,780
Okay. What about Summer?
Who are you voting for?

123
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:14,450
Qiu Ying, you're amazing.

124
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,410
-Brother Summer, I love you!
-Nice one, Brother Summer!

125
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,520
Qiu Ying has also gotten one vote.

126
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,290
Mr. Luo, who will you be voting for?

127
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,400
Before I give my vote,
I'd like to say something.

128
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,270
I can't find any flaws
in Qiao Xin's commentary.

129
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,520
Whether it's her tactic analysis
or judgment on the match...

130
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,290
-What is he trying to say?
-Is he voting for Qiao Xin?

131
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,150
As for Qiu Ying,

132
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:44,590
judging by the attention to detail,
she still lacks a little experience.

133
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,870
Are you kidding me?

134
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,530
Qiu Ying did so well.
How is she lacking in experience?

135
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,110
Mr. Luo is being so strict.

136
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,590
So do you think Qiao Xin
performed slightly better as well?

137
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,800
Professionalism isn't just about skills,
but also attitude.

138
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,670
As commentators, we are the bridge
between the public and this profession.

139
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:06,540
If the commentators themselves
fail to show their passion,

140
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,800
then how will the public begin to like
this new competitive sport?

141
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,990
To all the young people
who wish to join this industry,

142
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,400
please remember this.

143
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,240
If you have no faith or vocation,
then don't enter this industry.

144
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,670
-As the path is bumpy, yet glorious.
-What does that mean?

145
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,290
This is also our objective
in organizing Rising Star,

146
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,460
which is choosing a great talent
who truly loves this industry.

147
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,510
Therefore, my vote goes to...

148
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,570
Qiu Ying.

149
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,270
It's a tie now.

150
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,350
I was able to feel Qiu Ying's passion for
this industry in her commentary earlier.

151
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:00,310
Thank you, Mr. Luo.
I'll continue to work hard.

152
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:06,200
Alright. So now, both contestants
have received two votes each.

153
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,870
Though Qiao Xin is now leading
by a slight difference,

154
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,890
the final winner for today
is still a mystery.

155
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,190
Miss Mi Ya now holds the deciding vote.

156
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,610

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,680
[Did you find my resemblance in her?]

159
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,560
A friend of mine is extremely passionate
about this sport.

160
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,480
She has a friend in the E-sports industry?

161
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,680
I learned about this sport long time ago.

162
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,170
Even so,

163
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,960
I've never learned how hard it was
to be a professional player.

164
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,490
Until today,
after hearing the commentary, I realized

165
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,370
that behind those professional players,
there are so many hardships and obstacles.

166
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,110
Therefore,
they truly deserve the highest honor.

167
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:01,560
Thanks to this stage,
I got to learn in such a short time,

168
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,850
that our country also has a team
of courageous players in this industry.

169
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,940
Therefore, my vote goes to...

170
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,780
Qiu Ying.

171
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,430
Awesome!

172
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,490
The winner of Rising Star
Commentator Competition is Qiu Ying!

173
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:41,290
And congratulations to Qiao Xin
for being the runner-up.

174
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,290
Welcome to GDV's commentator team

175
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:55,100
and becoming Luo Tian's partner
in the new show.

176
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,380
Congratulations.

177
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,960
Thank you, Chairman Guo.

178
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,850
Thank you, everyone.

179
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,560
Qiu Ying!

180
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,510
We need an ambulance!
Someone is hit by a car.

181
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,520
Okay, thank you.

182
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,370
Thank you!

183
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,170
Here you go. Thank you.

184
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,950
Hi, Mi Ya.

185
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,400
Hi, Qiu Ying.

186
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,940
Mi Ya.

187
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,670
Thank you so much for giving me your vote.

188
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,100
Your performance earlier deserved my vote.

189
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,490
I really like your songs.

190
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,580
Especially the title song
in your new album. "Beyond The Sky".

191
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,410
Every time I hear this song,

192
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,850
I feel as if I'm experiencing
my first love.

193
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,440
He is my first love.

194
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,750
This is for you. It's my new album.

195
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,990
Thank you, Mi Ya.

196
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,000
You're welcome.

197
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,620
Would you like to come to the
press conference for my song next week?

198
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,160
Of course I would.

199
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,990
But I couldn't get tickets.

200
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,460
Don't worry. I'll save you the best seat.

201
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:19,800
You can even come backstage
to see me before the opening.

202
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,650
Really? Thank you, Mi Ya.

203
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,070
Ladies. How about a picture together?

204
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,310
-Sure.
-Okay, Director An.

205
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:30,930
Here she comes.

206
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,840
Qiu Ying!

207
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,640
Yi Yi!

208
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,750
Qiu Ying, you were so cool today!

209
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,290
You were amazing, Qiu Ying.

210
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,240
-Not anyone can hug Qiu Ying.
-No.

211
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:46,020
Her commentary earlier was so moving.
Whoever says that I'd marry her at once.

212
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,020
Don't be silly. Step aside.

213
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,660
No, I was just speaking
Brother Kong's mind.

214
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,500
Move aside.

215
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,930
Come here. Let me get some good luck
from the champion.

216
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,660
You have stunned the entire crowd today.

217
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,700
-Let's go celebrate at our usual place.
-Let's go!

218
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,250
Let's go celebrate!

219
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,850
Come on! Let's have a toast.

220
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,230
Congratulations, Qiu Ying,
for winning Rising Star

221
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,250
and becoming GDV's intern commentator!

222
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,970
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

223
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,770
Qiu Ying is the best!

224
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,270
It still feels like a dream to me.

225
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,770
Tell me about it.

226
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,190
When Luo Tian gave his comments,
I was having my heart in my mouth.

227
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,640
Luckily things took a turn
in the final moment.

228
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,870
Actually, what surprised me
wasn't just Mr. Luo, but also Mi Ya.

229
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,070
She's a superstar.

230
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:45,030
Not only did she pay attention
to my commentary, she even voted for me.

231
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,520
Moreover,

232
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,310
she gave me her signed album.

233
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,550
Mi Ya's album.

234
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,380
"Monsoon wind towards the ocean,
beyond the sky."

235
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,110
She even signed it.

236
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,780
Qiu Ying, lucky you!

237
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,330
Apparently, Mi Ya wrote "Beyond The Sky"
for her first love.

238
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,270
That's right. I heard of it too.

239
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,870
What's the name of her first love? It's...

240
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,630
-Ren Xu.
-Yes.

241
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,740
She dumped him after she got famous.

242
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,380
But I feel that
it wasn't written for Ren Xu.

243
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,720
It felt like a song
written for a lover and family.

244
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,940
As if they went through a lot together
and supported each other.

245
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,760
Whatever it is, I pity her first love.

246
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,090
She's using him as a gimmick
for her new album.

247
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,070
That poor thing. Right, Brother Kong?

248
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,480
Enough gossiping. Aren't we supposed
to be celebrating for Qiu Ying? Eat up.

249
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,110
-Right.
-Dig in.

250
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,020
-Have some more, Qiu Ying. Have some meat.
-Thank you, Yi Yi.

251
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,620
Send these tickets to Qiu Ying.

252
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,090
Tell her to come see me at the backstage.

253
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,280
Alright.

254
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,040
Tony, can you finally tell me now?

255
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,410
Mi Ya, I'll go send the tickets now.

256
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,400
What exactly did Xiang Kong tell you?

257
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,619
I won't believe
a word you told me earlier.

258
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,050
He promised
that he would come to see me today.

259
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,780
Did you stop him?

260
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,470
It was the opposite.

261
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,070
He came to see me.

262
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:42,190
[Wait a moment.]

263
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,650
[Mi Ya is busy.]

264
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:46,290
[You can tell me
what you want to say to her.]

265
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,190
[I actually came to see you, not Mi Ya.]

266
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,690
[What do you want to tell me?]

267
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,580
[Did you want to tell me that you
and Mi Ya can't let go of each other?]

268
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,100
[And you want me to stop
keeping you two apart?]

269
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:08,940
[No way.]

270
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,870
[Mi Ya sacrificed a lot
to be where she is today.]

271
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,470
[I won't let you ruin her.]

272
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,990
[Then we're on the same page.]

273
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:23,550
[Long before you became her manager,]

274
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,110
[I witnessed her endless failures
and hard work.]

275
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:32,310
[She wouldn't rest even if she got hurt
from practicing her dance and singing.]

276
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,110
[All these happened all the time.]

277
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,940
[As long as there's a chance
to perform, even during winter,]

278
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,130
[she would dress lightly despite the
cold wind and dance in an open square.]

279
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,520
[It's a dream that she has worked hard for
over a decade.]

280
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,590
[I have no right to make her give up.]

281
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:53,470
[Haven't you thought about it before?]

282
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,100
[The day we broke up,]

283
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,440
[I knew we would be living in
two different worlds.]

284
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,000
[Please tell her this.]

285
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,310
[The happiness we shared in the past
is the best gift for each other.]

286
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,400
[Forget the past.
Live happily in the moment.]

287
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,810
[I wish her the best.]

288
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,680
Ji Xiang Kong is right.

289
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,940
You two are no longer living
in the same world.

290
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,680
He never thought of
getting back with you either.

291
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,340
Xiang Kong is doing this for my sake.

292
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,150
He's doing whatever he can
to support my dream.

293
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,640
But the more he says that,
the harder it is for me to let go.

294
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,800
Tony, I have to go meet him now.

295
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,380
What are you doing?

296
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,450
There's a swarm of reporters out there.

297
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,130
Are you determined
to drag Ji Xiang Kong in here?

298
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,830
Sit down.

299
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,380
Sit.

300
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,600
Tony.

301
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,960
We used to be very poor.

302
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,770
We couldn't even afford instant noodles.

303
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,280
Xiang Kong supported me by working
part-time jobs on an empty stomach.

304
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,160
He went to agencies
and begged them to give me a chance.

305
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,610
I wouldn't be where I am today
if it weren't for him.

306
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,820
That is why I'm willing
to give up everything to get him back.

307
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,240
I hope you'll support me too.

308
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,470
Mi Ya.

309
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,330
Get over your wishful thinking.

310
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,630
He already has someone he likes.

311
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,360
I'll be honest with you.

312
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,780
He didn't come to see you
at the backstage,

313
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,990
but he was in the audience
cheering for Qiu Ying.

314
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,480
Ji Xiang Kong has made his choice.

315
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,280
This was taken just now by a netizen.

316
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,920
He's at a barbecue place
celebrating with Qiu Ying.

317
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,760
Take a look for yourself.

318
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,740
-Congratulations! Cheers!
-Thank you!

319
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,950
What should we do later?

320
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,140
What else?

321
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,820
We'll be going back
to our home sweet homes.

322
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,150
We're going home already?

323
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,660
I wanted to treat you...

324
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,920
Treat you all to a karaoke session.

325
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,910
Why are you being so generous today?

326
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,370
I'm always generous. Why you...

327
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,900
Did you mean to treat all of us
or just Yi Yi?

328
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,440
Qiu Ying.

329
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,700
All of you, obviously.
Why would I treat her?

330
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,800
Exactly.

331
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:16,000
It's boring to sing with him.

332
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,550
If it wasn't you
who sang happily that day...

333
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,180
Will you die if you keep quiet?

334
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,120
Xiang Kong.

335
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,050
Thank you.

336
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,480
I probably couldn't have won
if it weren't for you.

337
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,070
That is why...

338
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:37,690
Excuse me. I have to take this call.

339
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,950
He's being so mysterious about a call.

340
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,460
Who was it?

341
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,670
I have no idea.
I won't tell you even if I knew.

342
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,720
Hello?

343
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,520
[Xiang Kong, it's me.]

344
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,180
I'm flying back tonight.

345
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,910
I want to meet you. Just the two of us.

346
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,820
[I'm right opposite.]

347
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,530
Tony has probably told you
what I had to say.

348
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,240
I don't believe it.

349
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,500
Even if you really don't want
to get back together with me,

350
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,490
I want to hear it directly from you.

351
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,690
Alright.

352
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,510
Guys, I'm sorry.

353
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,070
Something came up. I've got to go.

354
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,130
Xuan, take them home.

355
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,280
Okay.

356
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,280
Don't worry about it.
Go ahead if you need to leave first.

357
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,830
Right. What did you want to tell me?

358
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,510
I have a gift...

359
00:23:58,690 --> 00:23:59,930
Excuse me.

360
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,520
[Xia Ling]

361
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,600
Answer it.

362
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,510
He helped you with your votes.
He did a lot for you.

363
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,770
-Hello?
-[Why did you]

364
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,060
[get your brother involved in
your competition?]

365
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:16,560
[He's gotten into an accident.]

366
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:19,900
-What? They're saving Xia Ling?
-[The doctors are still saving him.]

367
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,840
Which hospital?

368
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,120
Okay.

369
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,760
-I have to go to the hospital.
-Calm down. I'll take you there.

370
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,470
-Settle the bill.
-I'm coming too.

371
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,060
Yi Yi, both of them is enough.

372
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,040
This way.

373
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,320
Put on the helmet.

374
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,440
Don't panic. Take it easy.

375
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,500
Hurry.

376
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,710
How is Xia Ling?

377
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,010
-How do you have the nerve to ask that?
-What are you doing?

378
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,040
How could you hit her?

379
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,060
That's my son in there.

380
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:13,980
If something happens to him,
I'll make you pay for it!

381
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:17,410
Auntie, we get that you're worried
after what happened,

382
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,860
but please calm down.

383
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,280
Even if she did wrong,
you shouldn't hit people.

384
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,670
Which one of you is the patient's family?

385
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,030
I am.

386
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,970
He needs a blood transfusion right away.

387
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,300
-But we don't have enough type A blood.
-What?

388
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,900
Such a big hospital and you don't have it?

389
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:35,400
-You've got to be kidding me.
-Stop it!

390
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,120
What should we do, doctor?

391
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:39,320
Please quickly find a way.

392
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,220
I have type A blood.

393
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,760
Take mine.

394
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:52,520
Brother Kong is with Qiu Ying.
You don't have to worry.

395
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:58,590
Qiu Ying must be blaming herself
for what happened to Xia Ling.

396
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,540
To tell you the truth,

397
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:05,280
their families were neighbors at first
and were really close.

398
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,090
Xia Ling often ate at Qiu Ying's house.

399
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,650
They were like real siblings.

400
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,780
Then how come
they're on such bad terms now?

401
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,800
Not long after Qiu Ying's mom passed away,

402
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:23,010
Qiu Ying's father
married Xia Ling's mother.

403
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,300
Are you saying that
before her mom passed,

404
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,710
her dad had been...

405
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,750
-We don't know what really happened.
-You're right.

406
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:38,760
Qiu Ying has always been stubborn.

407
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,830
She couldn't get along
with Xia Ling's mom.

408
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,260
Her dad usually sides with Xia Ling
and his mom during conflicts.

409
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,880
That's why the year Qiu Ying
went to university, she moved out.

410
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,180
She even cut ties with her dad.

411
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:58,520
But Xia Ling is a thoughtful kid.

412
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,070
He always thought that he and his mom

413
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,580
ruined Qiu Ying's relationship
with her dad.

414
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,910
So he's always trying
to be nice to Qiu Ying.

415
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,440
Qiu Ying is aware of his intentions.

416
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,990
But she can't bring herself
to forgive her dad,

417
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,810
let alone forgiving Xia Ling's mom.

418
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,990
That's why she acts coldly
towards Xia Ling.

419
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,650
But judging by
Qiu Ying's reaction earlier,

420
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,120
it seems like she cares a lot for him.

421
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,750
You just donated blood.
You need to replenish your nutrients.

422
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,940
Here.

423
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,900
Listen to me. Drink it.

424
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,050
It's been a whole night.

425
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,080
Why isn't he coming out yet?

426
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,670
Don't worry.

427
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,300
He'll be alright.

428
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,730
You have a show to do at GDV today.

429
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,890
You shouldn't be late on your first day.

430
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,480
You should go now. I'll wait here.

431
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,390
Xia Ling is still in there.

432
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,190
I can't leave.

433
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:40,550
He got into the accident
right outside the competition venue.

434
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,160
He did all that to get votes for me.

435
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,930
He cared for me wholeheartedly.

436
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,540
How could I treat him that way?

437
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,050
I even went to his school
to reprimand him.

438
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:54,760
Alright now.

439
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,390
You didn't mean it.

440
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,780
You can explain to him later
once he wakes up.

441
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,960
Don't worry. I'm sure he'll be okay.

442
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,610
Doctor!

443
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,240
How is my son?

444
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,990
You must be the patient's family.

445
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:17,030
He suffered a slight concussion
and fractured his right tibia.

446
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,460
He went into hemorrhagic shock,
but he's no longer in critical condition.

447
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,010
However,
he still needs further observation.

448
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,030
-Thank you, doctor.
-It's all your fault.

449
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,050
-Leave!
-Auntie, calm down.

450
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,940
Qiu Ying feels just as sad as you are.

451
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:34,360
My son still has
a basketball competition! Leave!

452
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,860
Keep your voice down.

453
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,190
-Son!
-Xia Ling.

454
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,640
Xia Ling.

455
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,530
Xia Ling, wake up.

456
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,450
The car is here. You better get going.

457
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,320
I have a question.

458
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:05,290
Will a fractured tibia affect him
playing basketball in the future?

459
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,520
Don't worry. He's still very young.

460
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,100
He'll be able to heal quickly.

461
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:14,020
It's getting late.
You should hurry to GDV.

462
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,740
Thank you.

463
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,460
You have a match today, right?

464
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,920
You haven't slept the whole night.

465
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,540
It's my fault.

466
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,840
Don't worry. I'm alright.

467
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,480
I can take a nap at the lounge
when I get to the venue.

468
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,910
What about you?
You should find some time to rest.

469
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,890
Perhaps I'd get to see you
giving a commentary with Mr. Luo tonight.

470
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,280
Keep it up.

471
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,940
Go on.

472
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:56,600
Bye-bye.

473
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,080
Mr. Luo, thank goodness
for your quick wits earlier,

474
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,240
or I would have made a blunder.

475
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,530
You are pretty good at improvising.

476
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,650
But you still need to brush up
on your professional knowledge.

477
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,710
Mr. Luo.

478
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,440
Qiu Ying.

479
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,110
Why are you only showing up now?

480
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,440
Mr. Luo waited all day for you.

481
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:34,260
We almost couldn't go on with the show.
Do you know that?

482
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,620
Mr. Luo.

483
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,170
I'm really sorry. Something came up.

484
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,670
Don't apologize to me.

485
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:41,600
Is your apology worth so little?

486
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,550
It's my fault for being late.
I should apologize.

487
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,290
Professional players show up
to the game even when they're sick.

488
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,450
That's what we call having sportsmanship.

489
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:54,060
The same goes for professional commentators.
Being punctual is a basic principle.

490
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:57,890
Don't think you can take it easy just
because you won. You're not qualified yet.

491
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,100
Mr. Luo.

492
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,830
I'll never be late in the future.

493
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,410
Qiu Ying.

494
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,430
From You Xing Video to GDV,

495
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:10,950
you still haven't changed
that halfhearted attitude of yours.

496
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:14,830
Luckily I was here to replace you.

497
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,210
Otherwise, this show
would have faced a problem.

498
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:20,460
You replaced me?

499
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:23,850
Yes. You Xing Video and GDV
have signed a collaboration.

500
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,590
So from today on, I'll be
an intern commentator at GDV as well.

501
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,850
Zheng.

502
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:34,710
-Mr. Luo.
-You'll be guiding Qiu Ying from now on.

503
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,460
Start with familiarizing her
with the place and set up the venue.

504
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,580
You can slowly pass on work
from the logistics team to her.

505
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,030
I'm returning to my office.

506
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,670
Mr. Zheng.

507
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,460
Please guide me if I face any problems

508
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,890
in the future.

509
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,300
You ended up working in the logistics team
with me from being Luo Tian's new partner.

510
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,160
Is this a joke?

511
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,400
Come on. The game is about to start.

512
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,000
After many matches, VNG's core player,
Qi Yue, has been getting stronger.

513
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:39,660
He is likely to become
the top MVP of this season.

514
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,110
As far as I know,

515
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,410
Qi Yue's average kill
for each game is 4.8.

516
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,050
His gold income per minute is 518.

517
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,820
And his experience points
per minute is 521.

518
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,710
Remarkable statistics.

519
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,190
I guess we can look forward to
his next performance.

520
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:57,690
Let's take a look at
the composition for both teams.

521
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:00,510
In this round,
the champion that VNG chose...

522
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,120
Alright. You did a great job today.

523
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,420
Keep it up.

524
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:07,640
I'm leaving. See you tomorrow.

525
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,270
Bye, Mr. Zheng.

526
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:24,139
Why didn't you explain to Mr. Luo
about the reason for being late?

527
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,860
It wouldn't make a difference anyway.

528
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,630
It was still my fault for being late.

529
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,860
Besides,

530
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,880
I still don't have a solid foundation.

531
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:43,630
I might make a bigger fool out of myself
if I did the commentary.

532
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,800
I've joined GDV anyway.

533
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:49,170
I'm sure I'll get a chance someday.

534
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,060
Don't worry.

535
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,469
I'll adjust myself.

536
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,030
Alright. I know.

537
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,920
You're a cockroach that can never die.

538
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,780
But you're not made of steel.

539
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:05,850
Don't shoulder everything on your own.

540
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:14,210
But I really don't want
to cause problems for others.

541
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,040
Because of me,

542
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,910
Xia Ling is at the hospital.

543
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,820
When we were waiting outside
the emergency room,

544
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,710
I kept thinking about the times
when we were kids.

545
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,540
I've thought of him

546
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,150
as my younger brother long time ago.

547
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,120
But over the past few years,

548
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,510
I would scold him
whenever he comes to see me.

549
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,410
The nicer he is to me,

550
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,340
the angrier I would get,
the more I want to ignore him.

551
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,790
Tell me.

552
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,030
How could I be so cold

553
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,710
and so cruel?

554
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:10,220
Silly.

555
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,200
Stop criticizing yourself.

556
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,820
You're the strongest, kindest,
and loveliest person I've met.

557
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,720
Stop crying.

558
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,920
Dad, look how well Qiu Ying did.

559
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:36,220
Many people know her.
They all support her.

560
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,910
Dad.

561
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,460
The accident wasn't her fault.

562
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,760
Besides, she's so amazing.
I'm so proud of her.

563
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,370
Qiu Ying, when did you get here?

564
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,550
I just got here.

565
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,940
Right. I brought you lots of nice snacks.

566
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:54,440
They're all your favorite.

567
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,670
Give it to me.

568
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:03,020
I'll let you two talk.

569
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,350
I'll go fetch some water.

570
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,640
Here.

571
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,240
Let's see what we've got here.

572
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,990
I remember
these are all your favorite food.

573
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,190
Here.

574
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,510
Eat them.

575
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,940
Is your wound getting better?

576
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,880
Does it still hurt?

577
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,410
I'm fine.

578
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,940
I play sports.

579
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,640
These injuries are nothing.

580
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,340
It won't affect the tournament.

581
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,360
Besides,

582
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,950
I've got so many nice snacks.
I can't be bothered with the pain.

583
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,560
You must listen to the doctor.

584
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,790
Take it easy. Have a good rest.

585
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,410
When you have a match next time,
let me know in advance.

586
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,740
I will ask all my friends to come

587
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,980
to be your cheerleaders.

588
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,040
Cheerleaders?

589
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,920
You're such a fool.

590
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,020
Qiu Ying.

591
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:36,870
Don't worry about me.

592
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:40,260
You just joined GDV.
I'm sure you've got a lot to do.

593
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,940
My classmate asked me

594
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,670
when you would get to work
alongside Luo Tian.

595
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,960
I told them it would happen anytime soon.

596
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,630
My sister is the best.

597
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,490
Qiu Ying.

598
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,220
I'm really proud of you.

599
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,280
Because of what you said,
I will fight hard for this.

600
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,360
I mustn't embarrass my

601
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,480
brother

602
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,080
in front of his friends.

603
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,790
You're leaving already?

604
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,760
You spent the night here yesterday
and donated blood.

605
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,120
You should go home and have a good rest.

606
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,100
Go on.

607
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,190
Ying.

608
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,770
What happened to Xia Ling
wasn't your fault.

609
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,950
What did the doctor say about his injury?

610
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,560
He just needs some observations.

611
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:29,110
He should probably be fine.

612
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,050
Why didn't you accept the money
I sent to you?

613
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,670
That's your pocket money.

614
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,310
Take it.

615
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,770
Go on.

616
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,840
The doors will be closing soon.

617
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:54,450
Send me the video of your competition.

618
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:57,490
The one where you won.

619
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,670
-Here's your drink.
-Thank you.

620
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:37,880
Hello.

621
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,860
Why do you have time to come here?

622
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,720
Am I not welcomed?

623
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,480
I haven't got to say goodbye to everyone
since the competition.

624
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:56,370
You came at the wrong time.
Brother Summer isn't here.

625
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,550
It's okay. You're here.

626
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,520
I'm not good at relaying messages.

627
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:20,290
We used to be colleagues after all.

628
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,270
Why are you acting so cold?

629
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:29,220
If Brother Summer knows you're here,
I'm sure he would be delighted.

630
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,200
Actually, I came here today
to bid farewell to everyone.

631
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,410
I also wanted to thank everyone
for looking after me all this while.

632
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,700
But I'll still visit often.

633
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:45,640
I really like this place.

634
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,600
Fancy a cup of coffee?

635
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,800
Sure.

636
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,890
To be honest, I've never got to try
the coffee you made.

637
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,660
I happened to have invented a new drink.

638
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,760
You can be my guinea pig then.

639
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:31,220
Mr. Luo.

640
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:36,760
Training materials.

641
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,930
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

642
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,220
Gosh.

643
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,740
Mr. Luo gives me his notes to study.

644
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,540
Mr. Luo.

645
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,440
Are you regretting giving it to me?

646
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,090
There will be a match today.
You can help out at the analysis desk.

647
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,780
Remember to always listen and learn.

648
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:12,800
Yes, Mr. Luo.

649
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,450
What's going on?

650
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:29,830
How come his attitude towards me
changed completely overnight?

651
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,220
[Since Qiu Ying is your apprentice,
why didn't you listen to her reason?]

652
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,080
[Since when did I accept her
as my apprentice?]

653
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,270
[If not, why are you
teaching her personally?]

654
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,070
[If you weren't fond of her talent,]

655
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,580
[you wouldn't get mad at her
over a couple of posts,]

656
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:03,350
[and voted for her
despite the pressure from Chairman Guo.]

657
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,160
[Can that be a reason to be late?]

658
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:08,110
[A commentating desk is a place
that has no room for error.]

659
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:12,330
[If you still insist on pleading for her,]

660
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,370
[then this will be the end of
our friendship.]

661
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:17,830
[Those posts were made by her brother.]

662
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:21,690
[Qiu Ying blamed him because of this.]

663
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,690
[But he still went around
asking people to vote for her.]

664
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:27,860
[And then he got into an accident.]

665
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,910
[Qiu Ying felt guilty about it.]

666
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,610
[She stayed at the hospital all night
and donated her blood.]

667
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:38,330
[She hurried to the office
once her brother was stable.]

668
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:40,840
[But she still ended up being late.]

669
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,360
[Qiu Ying knows
you don't like hearing excuses.]

670
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,010
[That's why she didn't bother
defending herself.]

671
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,590
[Mr. Luo.]

672
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,640
[She only has passion for commentating.]

673
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,090
[She doesn't take it lightly.]

674
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,440
[Mr. Luo. The weather is getting cold.
Drink plenty of warm water]

675
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:46,990
Baby, you've joined GDV now.
When can we go public?

676
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,000
We're at the company.

677
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,060
I just became Luo Tian's new partner.

678
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:53,840
It will affect my image
if someone finds out about us.

679
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,220
We have nothing to hide about us.
What's there for people to say?

680
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:01,360
You Xing Video and GDV
have signed a collaboration.

681
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:04,530
They will support me and make me
the first female commentator.

682
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,780
For that, I promised Mr. Liu

683
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,360
that I won't be dating for the time being
to avoid any negative factors.

684
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,010
And also establish my professional image
in front of the public.

685
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,100
You are just a commentator, not an idol.

686
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:21,560
Why can't you date?

687
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,890
Besides,
doesn't dating a professional player

688
00:47:24,020 --> 00:47:26,530
-give you more advantage instead?
-Dating?

689
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,740
Commentators need to have professionalism.

690
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:31,850
Popularity alone isn't enough.

691
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,930
Furthermore,
if we go public with our relationship,

692
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,880
I won't be able to participate
in any match you're in.

693
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,840
People would say I'm being biased.

694
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,300
You don't want that to happen too. Right?

695
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:47,070
For the sake of your career, I'll wait.

696
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:48,970
Give me a hug.
