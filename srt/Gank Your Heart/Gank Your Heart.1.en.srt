Why are you so late?

The plane has taken off.
What should we do? You drive me crazy!

7
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,120
The car that my company booked for me
took me to the train station.

Is there any ticket left for
the earliest flight to Vancouver?

Only one business class ticket left.

-How much is it?
-It'll be 31,500.

Look. I can't go any faster.
The traffic is so bad.

-Are you crazy?
-Mr. Liu said that

when we are in a lifestyle program,
you can either make it go home.

58

It's not easy for me to get this chance.

59

I have to go. I can't give up.

60

But you know nothing
about professional gaming.

61
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,710
What can you do there?

-Yi Yi.
-You want to take it from me?

If you buy this ticket,
you can't even pay for your mortgage.

64
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,410
If Mr. Liu finds out that I
missed the plane, he'll fire me.

65
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,909
And then, it'll be even harder
to pay the mortgage.

66

I...

67
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,330

We are now looking at China's
best game commentator, Luo Tian.

127
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,940
We are only two metres away from him now.

128
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:17,340
Even his back looks so charismatic.

129
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,530
Point your camera at the stage,
the glass room, the team members.

130
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,700
The first to leave the game room
is their captain,

131
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,860
Gu Fang.

132
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,650
What happened in there?

133
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,750
Qiu Ying, you are screwed.

134
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,750
You missed the first round of the game.

135
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,490
Mr. Liu said that

136
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,260
you don't have to broadcast film the rest
of the game anymore. What should we do?

137
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,540
I didn't miss it on purpose.
Who knows I would be stuck in traffic?

138
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,310
Do you know how far I ran?

139
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,600
But I still missed it.

140
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,450
I think you need to think of something
to make up for this.

141
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:02,480
Mr. Liu has always wanted me
to interview with Gu Fang

142
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,130
to get an exclusive news report.

143
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,350
It's the intermission time right now.

144
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,040
How about I give it a try?

145
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,850
Gu Fang is so low-key.

146
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:12,150
He has never accepted
any interviews before.

147
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,830
I will pretend that I'm a fan
to get some first-hand information.

148
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,680
How are you going to get inside?

149

[You can't enter the gamer's lounge
even if you're a fan.]

150

Yi Yi. I have to hang up now.
I know how to get in.

151
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,130
[This is your fourth game in Vancouver.
Do you have confidence in winning?]

152
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,130
[Of course.]

153
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,050
[There's a rumour saying that
you are not as good as before]

154
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,720
[and will retire soon. Is that true?]

155
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,730
[We have a competition to get to.
Thanks for coming.]

156
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,420
[Please excuse us.]

157
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,220
[Please excuse us.]

158
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,000
Captain.

159
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm fine.

160
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,370
Is your tenosynovitis bothering you again?

161
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,510
Captain, you are my idol.

162
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,280
When I was at my lowest.

163
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,420
And you gave me a chance.

164
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,280
I still remember that
you always tell me this.

165
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,630
Kid. Don't try to be a hero all the time.

166
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,100
I've got you.

167
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,070
Don't pressure yourself too much.

168
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:15,910
Don't be so sentimental.

169
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,020
I'm the captain

170
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,580
and I'm your older brother.

171
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,490
Don't worry about anything when I'm here.

172
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,440
Okay. Let's get back.

173
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,650
Our brothers are waiting for us.

174
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,650
[This is bad.]

175
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,220
[Will I be caught?]

176
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,570
Wait!

177
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,430
[This is bad. What should I do?]

178
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,280
[Is it too late for me to apologise?]

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,050
-Sorry.
-What?

180
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,680
Take care of your dress.

181
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,570
How is Gu Fang?

182
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,740
His hands are trembling very badly.

183
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,040
If this continues, we'll lose.

184
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,500
Are you saying that
we should change our strategy?

185
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,090
Ask Brother Yao to switch place
with the captain.

186
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,050
Jeffery kept on targeting the captain
and wouldn't let him do anything.

187
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,030
We may be able to win the game

188
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,900
if Brother Yao takes over as the Mid.

189
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,940
Ji Xiang Kong.

190
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,600
What nonsense are you suggesting?

191
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,980
Gu Fang is a world-class idol.

192
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,700
He's the best Mid player and
you want him to be the Jungler?

193
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,150
What are you thinking?

194
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,430
Manager Zhao.

195
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,550
Gu Fang is not in a good condition now.

196
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,050
I can assure you that.

197
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,330
Do you know how many fans
are expecting to see

198
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,700
the battle between Jeffery and Gu Fang?

199
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,020
If Gu Fang changes his position now,

200
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,470
what will others think?

201
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,280
Gu Fang is a coward?
Legends is a bunch of cowards?

202
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,190
This will affect the reputation of
the whole team and our company.

203
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,780
-Do you know that?
-Zhao Yang.

204
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:02,980
If you really want what's best for us,
you should support my decision.

205
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,700
Ji Xiang Kong, watch your attitude.

206
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,450
This is an international championship.

207
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,510
Not a ranking match.

208
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,100
Don't be so childish.

209
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,820
Ji Xiang Kong, remember this.

210
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,280
Gu Fang doesn't represent only himself.

211
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,180
He's representing our team and
our company. Do you know that?

212
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,110
You are the commander of the team.

213
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,750
It's not your job to plan the strategy.

214
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,600
Your job is to carry it out

215
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,120
and win the championship. Okay?

216
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,600
I suggested this for the sake of
winning the championship.

217
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:35,630
Xiang Kong.
What you're saying here makes sense.

218
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,090
But have you thought about it?

219
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,820
What if we still lose the game,

220
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,950
what will other people think of you?

221
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,970
For the team and for the captain,

222
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,680
I don't care what they think about me.

223
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,120
I don't agree.

224
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,540
Forget about it, Xiang Kong.

225
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,180
[Ladies and gentlemen.]

226
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,099
[Get ready to make some noise.]

227
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:08,480
[Because the second round]

228
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,740
[is about to begin!]

229
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,180
Hello everyone. I am your host, Qiu Ying.

230
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,500
Legends lost the first round.

231
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,950
Let's see if they can win the next around.

232
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:23,230
[In the last round,
Legends made many mistakes.]

233
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,300
[None of the five members
could handle Jeffery.]

234
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:28,060
[Yes. So, as soon as
the second round starts,]

235
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,410
[the Legends got rid of Jeffery's
best general, the bunny.]

236
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,540
[On the other hand, the Legends has
a lot of heroes at their disposal.]

237
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,790
[Especially Ji Xiang Kong who is
the Battlefield Trickster of the team.]

238
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,150
[He can master
all 101 heroes in IConquer.]

239
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,950
[But he was killed seven times
in the last round.]

240
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,400
[Some even said that
if they don't replace Ji Xiang Kong...]

241
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,670
Brother Yao. I'll give you Baturu.

242
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,050
Sure. No problem.

243
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:53,480
[Gu Fang is the pioneer who represented]

244
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,290
[China's national team
to win the very first championship.]

245
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,450
[He is a legend.]

246
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,650
Captain. Which character
do you want to use?

247
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:05,070
[Are you saying that
we should change our strategy?]

248
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:07,590
[Ask Brother Yao to switch place
with the captain.]

249
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,150
[Gu Fang is a world-class idol.]

250
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,500
[He's the best Mid player and
you want him to be the Jungler?]

251
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,820
Captain.

252
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,670
I'll take...

253
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Let me give you the Creator.

254
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,930
-Okay.
-[Gu Fang chose the Creator?]

255
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,700
[The Creator is probably the most
difficult Mid hero in IConquer.]

256
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,380
He picked Creator.
What are we going to do?

257
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,090
Okay, listen to me.
I'm going to pick the Worm Queen. Miki.

258
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,460
-What? Okay.
-You are going to take Dictator, okay?

259
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,180
Then, we can counteract his attacks.

260
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,120
-Alright. Everyone ready? Let's do it.
-Ready.

261
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,000
[What would you say about
Gu Fang's conditions right this moment?]

262
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,470
[As a senior player,]

263
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,500
[he knows exactly
what he is going to face.]

264
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:55,240
[Okay. They've chosen their heroes.]

265
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,240
[The second round will begin right now.]

266
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,980
[The battle begins.]

267
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,820
Steady. Don't get caught.

268
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,900
-Got it.
-No problem.

269
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,130
I'll be your eye. Lu Feng,
be careful when you call for backup.

270
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,680
Don't panic.

271
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,580
The bot lane is gone.

272
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,170
Take a look, everyone.
That is Ji Xiang Kong.

273
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:19,670
He is the mastermind, BP
and commander of team Legends.

274
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,090
He is said to be unconventional
and tricky with his strategy.

275
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,910
He is known as the Battlefield Trickster.

276
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,460
Another thing.

277
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:31,200
He is definitely the most
good-looking guy in the team.

278
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,110
He has many fans.

279
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,680
Girls only care about appearances.
That's why you like such a useless player.

280
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:45,290
Why does he look so familiar?

281
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,380
[Look at Ji Xiang Kong.]

282
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,220
[He made it out of the first tower
and started attacking.]

283
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,640
Solo Top? Is he insane?

284
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,730
Blue, come with me. Let's gank him on top.

285
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,000
[What is he doing?
Will he be the first blood?]

286
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,360
Beautiful, Xiang Kong. They took the bait.

287
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,700
Brother Xiang.
They are heading towards you now.

288
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,320
Hit your face, Ji Xiang Kong!

289
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,030
Look.

290
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,450
He let them have the first blood again.
What a burden.

291
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,370
Ji Xiang Kong let them
have first blood again.

292
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:16,500
-Captain, go to the mid lane.
-Coming.

293
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,110
Brother Yao, Xuan,
hide around the mid-lane.

294
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,650
-Coming.
-Follow me. Come here.

295
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,560
-[We can see Jeffery and Gu Fang...]
-Keep going. Get one of those towers down.

296
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,730
[Here comes to the first attack.]

297
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,030
-Boys, are you coming?
-I'm coming!

298
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,500
Alright.

299
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,590
Three, two, one, attack!

300
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,990
Attack him!

301
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,350
[Looks like Lin Yi Xuan and Huo Yao
have a plan.]

302
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:42,180
[He is coming. Lin Yi Xuan is holding
Jeffery back with first skill.]

303
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,230
[Another amazing attack from Huo Yao.]

304
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,820
Nice! Now, the final kill!

305
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,320
[A Fire Meteor from Gu Fang]

306
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,120
[and a Supernatural Attack
from Li Yi Xuan.]

307
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,280
-[Double kill! Brilliant!]
-Darn it!

308
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,100
[Look. Mars is coming back.]

309
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,480
[Triple kill!]

310
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,370
[Is he trying to kill himself?]

311
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,790
Why is he there?

312
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:05,120
The best player, Gu Fang,
has gotten a triple kill.

313
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,800
The place is lit.

314
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,630
-I'm so sorry.
-Legends!

315
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,920
This is spectacular.

316
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,850
[The game has just begun and
Gu Fang already made a triple kill.]

317
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,400
[The teamwork is awesome.]

318
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,700
[No wonder the Legends is at the top.]

319
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,270
[They had it all planned out,
just waiting for Tatan to fall for it.]

320
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,050
Captain, your attacks will be
the highlights this year.

321
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,400
-This is because of our great teamwork.
-One for three is worth it.

322
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,310
Brother Kong is the king of first blood.

323
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,820
What are you talking about?
This is called strategy.

324
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,530
But Jeffery is quite skillful. Be careful.

325
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:37,290
-Protect the captain.
-Don't worry.

326
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,760
They are coming.
-Doesn't matter. We are respawning.

327
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,540
Come on. Keep going!

328
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:46,460
[The Legends is marching on while
the opponents are respawning.]

329
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,440
[And their economy is leading by
1500 points. They have a huge advantage.]

330
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,160
[If Tatan doesn't work hard for it...]

331
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,410
Hi there.

332
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:58,330
Why is it an advantage to
have a lead in the economy?

333
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,830
When you have more money,

334
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,680
you can buy better gears.

335
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,850
They have to buy gears?

336
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,520
You don't know anything.

337
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,930
Why are you here?

338
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,750
Gu Fang's counter-attack just now
is awesome.

339
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:18,170
If it wasn't because of Ji Xiang Kong,
the Legends would lose.

340
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,240
Ji Xiang Kong is always
giving away the first blood.

341
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,410
It doesn't matter that he is useless.
The team has Gu Fang.

342
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,580
I'm sure that the Legends
will not lose this round.

343
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,100
I'm sure that the Legends
will not lose this round.

344
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,390
Lu Feng, continue to get more money.
Harass them even if we can't hurt them.

345
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,830
Lin Yi Xuan, come to the Jungle with me.

346
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,700
-Coming.
-I'll leave it to you.

347
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,790
[Legends is taking over
the enemy's jungle.]

348
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,430
[The scout detected Pan in the Jungle.]

349
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,450
-Captain, I've subdued him!
-Go on! I have a powerful attack for him!

350
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,200
Captain, attack now.

351
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,490
Captain, attack.

352
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,670
[That attack was in vain. No...]

353
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,960
Gu Fang failed to attack his opponent.

354
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,750
[How could he make such a mistake
in the international championship?]

355
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,150
[So shocking.]

356
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,150
[If he didn't fail,
he could've killed Pan.]

357
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Don't attack yet. Defend the Highland.
I'll lead them away. Protect the captain.

358
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,770
[Jeffery from Tatan
is being bold right now.]

359
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,420
-[Huo Yao is fighting Jeffery!]
-[I got it!]

360
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,460
I said I got it!

361
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,330
[Legends is risking their lives!]

362
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,420
-Come on.
-Stop him!

363
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,280
Come on!

364
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:22,970
[Beautiful!]

365
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,700
[Gu Fang used Fire Meteor and
Heaven's Echo to take him down!]

366
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,880
Members of Tatan are still recovering.
It's not looking good for them.

367
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,000
[Now is the best time to attack them!]

368
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,140
[There's still hope for Legends!]

369
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,910
-[The Legends starts to...]
-This is our last chance.

370
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:39,870
-Stay back, Captain. I'll do it.
-I got this. Let me do it!

371
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,440
Trust me. I got this. I said I got it!

372
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,240
Tatan's support is attacking Gu Fang.

373
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,470
[But Gu Fang failed to attack him again!]

374
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,650
-[This is not his usual speed!]
-Protect the captain.

375
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,370
-He has been taken.
-[What's wrong with Gu Fang today?]

376
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,120
[Why isn't he focused on the game?]

377
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,730
[Here comes Ji Xiang Kong!]

378
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:58,370
[He released a huge attack
to protect Gu Fang!]

379
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,600
[Jeffery resurrects himself
and joins the team fight!]

380
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:03,670
-Pull out!
-Let me fight him!

381
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,360
[Huo Yao and Lin Yi Xuan are both
killed by his powerful attack.]

382
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,520
Retreat! Let them in.

383
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,560
-Protect the captain!
-We don't have enough resources.

384
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,200
We don't have enough resources.

385
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,550
[Ji Xiang Kong jumps into the battle and
uses his second skill to cover Gu Fang.]

386
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,700
[Gu Fang managed to escape.
But Ji Xiang Kong and Lu Feng]

387
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:26,480
[can barely take the endless attacks
from Tatan and died on the way back.]

388
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,200
What was that?

389
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:31,830
I said I got it, didn't I?

390
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:36,350
[Jeffery is not stopping.
He's not going to let the Creator live?]

391
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,650
[Although Legends is in an extremely
bad situation, they refuse to give up.]

392
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:43,580
[Gu Fang charges out from the spring alone
to stop them from moving forward.]

393
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,130
-[I can't defend it any longer.]
-[But Tatan is too powerful.]

394
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,270
[Gu Fang is killed under the crystal.]

395
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,290
[He couldn't fight back at all.]

396
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,200
[Now that it has come to this,
although we are reluctant,]

397
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,500
[we have to admit that]

398
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,740
[team China has lost their advantage.]

399
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,500
Captain.

400
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,800
Let's go.

401
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,780
Let's shake hands with them.

402
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,220
Let's do this.

403
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,440
No. Not you.

404
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,970
Just keep going.

405
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,690
Well done. Come on. Good job.

406
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,050
Legends...

407
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,370
The Legends did their best.

408
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,770
In a world-class championship like this,

409
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,220
they've made us proud.

410
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,070
Let's cheer for them!

411
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,430
Legends. Keep fighting!

412
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,200
I'm sorry, everyone.

413
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,220
I didn't do my best.

414
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,810
Don't worry, Captain.

415
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,920
We can win the game next year.

416
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,290
Let's go.

417
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:19,590
[The world of IConquer is ours!]

418
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,050
-Hello, Mr. Liu.
-[Qiu Ying.]

419
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,510
I heard that Gu Fang is most likely
going to retire.

420
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,360
Find a way to do a
live interview with Gu Fang.

421
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,690
Mr. Liu.

422
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,920
They just lost the game.

423
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,950
I don't think it's a good idea

424
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,150
to interview him right now

425
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,330
about his retirement.

426
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:49,560
Qiu Ying.

427
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:52,600
Now is the best time for us
to gain more followers.

428
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,760
[They already lost the game.
Finding the right topic is the key.]

429
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,220
You are a host.

430
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,050
[You should act like a professional.]

431
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,150
[Besides, they are going to hold
a fan meeting for Gu Fang.]

432
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:04,570
We promised that
we will do a live broadcast of that.

433
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,770
Don't mess that up again.

434
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,200
Yes, Mr. Liu. I understand.

435
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,120
I'm sorry, everyone.

436
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,380
We've disappointed you again.

437
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,720
Gu Fang! Never give up!

438
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:16,420
Legends never gives up!

439
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:22,600
Legends never gives up!

440
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:28,700
Legends never gives up!

441
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:36,450
Legends never gives up!

442
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,320
If you want to cry,

443
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,820
just do it.

444
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,790
Look at our fans out there.

445
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,860
They followed us to Vancouver

446
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,830
to see us win!

447
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,920
Remember their tears.

448
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,220
When we go back,

449
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,850
We have to pay them back
by working ten times harder.

450
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,060
We will not quit until
we win that championship.

451
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:38,060
We will not quit until
we win that championship!

452
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,770
Please drive.

453
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,100
Too many fans. I can't move.

454
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,320
How about it?

455
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:01,200
I'll go and console them.

456
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,590
How will you go back then?

457
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,810
We have another car, right?

458
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,020
I'll catch up with you later.

459
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,480
Be careful.

460
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,200
I'll come with you.

461
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:22,270
Legends never gives up!

462
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:25,720
Please quiet down and listen to me.

463
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,170
Don't stand under the rain.
You can talk to me.

464
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:30,000
Okay!

465
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,240
Ji Xiang Kong, we will always support you.

466
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,730
Ji Xiang Kong, we will always support you.

467
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,460
We will always support Legends.

468
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,520
Thank you very much.

469
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,570
Enough. Stop crying.

470
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,110
Captain will be sad to see you cry.
We will keep it up.

471
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,650
There's always next year.

472
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,970
Handsome Ji, I really like you.

473
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:58,380
-You are my fan?
-Yes. I came here specifically to see you.

474
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,750
How specific?

475
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,530
-I only looked at you during the game.
