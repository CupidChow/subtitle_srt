4
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,080
Tong Wu. Buy me my meal.

5
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,259
Hurry up!

6
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,980
It seems like
you'll be having a tough fight.

7
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,770
Sister Wen. Didn't you sign me to fight?

8
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,700
Besides, these players

9
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,150
have competed
many times with me in the games.

10
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,880
It's fine. I'm confident.

11
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,740
Well, you'll stay in room number two.

12
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:20,990
After Pei Xi left,

13
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,310
the room has been empty.

14
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,829
Sister Wen, is there any sharing room?

15
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,860
Lu Sheng's room has an empty bed.

16
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,540
But, he is a little reclusive.

17
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,800
That's okay. I will live with him.

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,110
We can even communicate sometimes.

19
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,630
I'll bring you in then.

20
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,660
There's no need. I'll go on my own.

21
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,780
Hello, Lu Sheng. I am Xiang Kong.

22
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,280
We will be roommates from now on.

23
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,480
Okay.

24
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:58,930
What are you doing?

25
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,390
Why are you here?

26
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,610
I am Legends' new captain.

27
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,280
From now onwards, this is my room.

28
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,779
I don't allow you to live here.

29
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,910
Do you hear me?

30
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,829
Why are you holding
my Brother Kong's notebook?

31
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,460
Didn't he leave this in the room

32
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,960
because he wanted to show me?

33
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,390
Come on. You are so tall.
Can't you be a bit shameful?

34
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,330
Give it to me.

35
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,260
You think it's fun, right?
Give it to me!

36
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,930
You are so tall. You.

37
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,780
What are you doing, Lin Yi Xuan?

38
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:37,960
What's going on?

39
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,630
He is stealing.
He stole Brother Kong's notebook.

40
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,909
Give that back to me.

41
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:43,930
All right. Stop that!

42
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,430
Why don't we have a match?

43
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,659
Okay. I'm not afraid of you.

44
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,830
What do you want to compete in?

45
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:52,690
You decide.

46
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,420
All of you heard that.

47
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,050
I decide what to compete. I decide.

48
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,460
This is a small room.

49
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,010
I will wait for you at the training hall.

50
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,110
Everyone is here.

51
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,330
Nothing important,

52
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,260
I just want you guys

53
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,610
to be the witnesses.

54
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,240
In case someone

55
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,830
is reluctant to admit his defeat.

56
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,350
After all, he is the captain.

57
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,610
Don't use some underhanded tricks.

58
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,160
No.

59
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,260
I decide what to compete.

60
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,810
This was what Captain Pei Xi said.

61
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,980
I just want to give a brilliant idea.

62
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,980
I want you

63
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,940
to have fun and be happy.

64
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,659
It doesn't matter.

65
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,060
Let's begin.

66
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,680
Okay. All the competitions

67
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,780
encourage friendship first,

68
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:48,730
competition second.

69
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,040
Let's have a

70
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,480
friendly smiling competition.

71
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,230
Within a minute,

72
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,880
whoever makes the other person laugh,

73
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:56,980
will be the winner. What do you think?

74
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,560
Not too much, right?

75
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,909
Let's begin.

76
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,560
Do you have facial paralysis, Pei Xi?

77
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:47,850
Do you think it's funny?

78
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,560
It's my turn.

79
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,680
I win.

80
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,440
Where is Li Gan?

81
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,409
Master says that he has a stomachache.

82
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,840
He is not coming.

83
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,260
Okay. Let's start first.

84
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,560
Let me announce.

85
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,830
From today onwards,

86
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,659
Ji Xiang Kong will officially join VNG.

87
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,160
Let's welcome him.

88
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,460
I'm new to the team.

89
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,930
Please take care of me.

90
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,840
Ji Xiang Kong is not only a member of VNG.

91
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,980
He will also be your new team captain.

92
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,810
Sister Wen.

93
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,010
Shouldn't you discuss

94
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:19,190
such an important issue
with my master first?

95
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,940
I am your coach.

96
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,710
My decision

97
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,710
is VNG's decision.

98
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,560
Sister Wen.

99
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,930
It's a good thing to have doubts.

100
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,600
This means that
everyone cares about the team.

101
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,230
It's also a good time to encourage me,
the captain that appears suddenly.

102
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,360
Don't talk nice words.

103
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,510
I am more qualified than you
to be VNG's captain.

104
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,280
Qi Yue!

105
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,060
Do you dare to play a game with me?

106
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,560
Okay. All of you will be in a team.

107
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,110
I'll lead the reserve players.

108
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,910
You said it.
Don't embarrass yourself later.

109
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,130
If I lose,

110
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,810
I will call you captain.

111
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,610
What if you lose?

112
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,060
I'll quit.

113
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,260
Sister Wen. He said that himself.

114
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,030
I'm sure you guys
won't have any disagreement, right?

115
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:11,430
Okay. Do whatever you want.

116
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,830
Brothers. Let's go.

117
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,130
Let's do some preparation.

118
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,460
Let me show him what is a captain.

119
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,490
Don't worry.

120
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,160
We'll do the same.
Four people will protect the Carry.

121
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,680
The jungle's money in Mid is all mine.

122
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,330
All of you just have to follow me.

123
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,140
Do you understand?

124
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,440
Brother Qi. Don't worry.

125
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,660
We will do whatever we can to support you.

126
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,090
A clumsy hand with four reserves.

127
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,530
Why is he being arrogant?

128
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,550
How are we playing?

129
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,910
We can't fight against Qi Yue.

130
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,910
We can't win.

131
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,180
Qi Yue will use
four people to protect the Carry.

132
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,460
Then, we will use the Dual-Core strategy.

133
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,510
Dual-Core?

134
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,940
In short, it's to let our
Top and Carry farm quickly.

135
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,240
Forming a dual-core
that can compete with their ace.

136
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,260
Qi Yue will definitely
put pressure in Mid.

137
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,210
Then, we have to destroy his flanks.

138
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,090
No matter how powerful he is,
he won't be able to do anything.

139
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,740
Come on. Take it easy.

140
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,660
Listen to my command.

141
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,710
Aren't you feeling sick?

142
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,290
It's better now.

143
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,410
Good to know.

144
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,950
This is…

145
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,960
Qi Yue and Ji Xiang Kong
are playing against each other?

146
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
Qi Yue refuses to accept it.

147
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,510
Ji Xiang Kong called four reserves
to join him for this round.

148
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,960
Ji Xiang Kong is
sacrificing the Mid towers.

149
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,510
It's very dangerous.

150
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,230
I don't think so.

151
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,810
Ji Xiang Kong and his teammates
are splitting into two groups.

152
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,960
A tower in exchange for three.

153
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,010
It's worth it.

154
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,960
But Qi Yue's Bug Queen
only relies on the team.

155
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,660
Unlike Ji Xiang Kong's four-one split
that has the advantage.

156
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,860
He can avoid teamfights
and push lanes as well.

157
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,610
We have a strong line-up in this game.
Let's end it in the early game.

158
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,890
I am at Mid. Middle.

159
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,230
Mid lane is farming fast.

160
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,290
I'm coming to support you.

161
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,960
Top lane, be careful.

162
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,180
Jungler is heading there.

163
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,010
Support. Aid the river.

164
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,030
I'm telling you.

165
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,840
Whoever touches my jungle
will taste my wrath.

166
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,140
All right.

167
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,810
Seems like the result
is no longer in doubt.

168
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,510
Qi Yue hasn't farmed yet,

169
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,410
but the equipment

170
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,190
of Ji Xiang Kong's two cores
have already been formed.

171
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,330
His tactic

172
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,760
totally crushes
Qi Yue's "four-guarantee-one".

173
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,280
Seems like you are right.

174
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,760
I hope you understand

175
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,900
that all I did is for VNG.

176
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,630
Take a look.

177
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,730
Ji Xiang Kong's contract.

178
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,560
One yuan?

179
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,990
He said he will fight
side by side with VNG.

180
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:05,440
Li Gan.

181
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,560
I trust Ji Xiang Kong won't let us down.

182
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,410
Okay.

183
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,190
I will submit the transfer application
on the official website later on.

184
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,390
Thank you.

185
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,480
ADC and Carry, keep hitting.

186
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,740
Push them back to base.

187
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,310
Destroy the nexus quickly.

188
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,310
Minions. Minions. Minions.

189
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,030
What is this?

190
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,030
What are you doing?

191
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,390
Who got you in here?

192
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,530
What are you thinking? Qi Yue!

193
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,060
Master.
Let me have another around with him.

194
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,860
I am not convinced.

195
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,810
Are you done?

196
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,030
-Master.
-Shut up!

197
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,960
A nice win.

198
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,210
All right.

199
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:59,630
The result of one game
can't represent anything.

200
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,510
But I hope all of you
can see the importance of tactics.

201
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:06,180
The tactics are more important,
especially in a game.

202
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,140
Qi Yue.

203
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,400
Right now, you should know

204
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,810
why you lost.

205
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,660
Anyone else who is not happy?

206
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:20,960
Okay.

207
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,710
Then, from now onwards,

208
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:24,510
Ji Xiang Kong will be your captain.

209
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,310
You need to listen to his commands.

210
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,040
Train according to his tactics.

211
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,330
Understand?

212
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,010
Xiang Kong.

213
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,380
All of you did really well.

214
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,130
But in terms of tactics…

215
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,200
Let me talk to him first.

216
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,610
Qi Yue! Stop right there!

217
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,260
Master, I don't want to play anymore.

218
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,610
I am not convinced.

219
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,510
When Pei Xi was here,
he let me play "four-guarantee-one".

220
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,890
I am willing to do that.

221
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,680
But right now,
you want me to call Ji Xiang Kong captain?

222
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,130
Impossible!

223
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,310
Can he defeat me in a solo match?

224
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,740
That match already proved that

225
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,690
Ji Xiang Kong is more suitable as captain

226
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,360
despite your strong capabilities.

227
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,110
iConquer is about teamwork.

228
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,410
Master. Why are you
speaking for that clumsy guy too?

229
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,130
Shut up.

230
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,840
Admit your defeat.

231
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,110
Your pride and arrogance

232
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,610
need to have a limit.

233
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,040
You are my apprentice

234
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,730
and also the founding member of VNG.

235
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,790
You need to be more broad-minded,
and responsible.

236
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,310
I hope you can put down
your distracting thoughts.

237
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:49,590
Play well in the competition.

238
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,540
Don't destroy your future
because of a moment of success.

239
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,030
There's still a long way to go.

240
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,180
If you want to prove that you're better
than Ji Xiang Kong, prove it in the game.

241
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,220
Understand?

242
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,480
Why are you here?

243
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,530
What's going on?

244
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,340
Who bullied our Young Master Qi?

245
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:30,030
Who else could it be?

246
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,510
Ji Xiang Kong. I'll kick him out someday.

247
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,580
I heard he replaced you as captain.

248
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,760
He's just a nobody
without Sister Wen protecting him.

249
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,060
What kind of background
do you think he has?

250
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,240
He came so suddenly.

251
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,960
Who knows.

252
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,130
Ji Xiang Kong.

253
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,740
I will make him suffer
for taking my captaincy away.

254
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,760
It's so annoying. Forget it.
Would you like to go on a ride with me?

255
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,730
You are messing up my hair.

256
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,600
What's wrong?
Are you going to meet Pei Xi again?

257
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:06,590
You have such a handsome boyfriend here
yet you are looking for other men.

258
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,560
What are you talking about?

259
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,890
Why do you believe the words of netizens?

260
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,340
Besides,

261
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,110
You should know
what happened during the duo queue.

262
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,560
The thing about duo queue?

263
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:16,880
The thing about duo queue is that

264
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,630
I used his account

265
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,280
to duo play with you
to teach Qiu Ying a lesson.

266
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,280
What's the result?

267
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,790
My girlfriend ended up
as Pei Xi's rumoured girlfriend.

268
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:33,060
All right.
My Young Master Qi is the best. Okay?

269
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,310
How about this? Tomorrow.

270
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,110
My time tomorrow only belongs to you.
How about that?

271
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,510
Today, I am really not available.

272
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,590
I have to meet
the organizer of Rising Star.

273
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,260
You are going to the competition?

274
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,560
I have an acquaintance at GDV.
I'll make a call for you.

275
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,440
There's no need.
I've already found a way.

276
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:56,610
It's late. Time to go.

277
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,760
Bye.

278
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,890
Looks good.

279
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,030
You look the part.

280
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,560
Okay. Let me introduce
our working procedure here.

281
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,760
Anyway, there are
morning and evening shifts.

282
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,960
The morning shift starts at ten
and the evening shift starts at two.

283
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,730
There is an hour of break in between.

284
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,850
It's shift work.

285
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,930
That's all, basically.

286
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,230
Okay. I know.

287
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,180
All right. Let me find someone
to give you a tour.

288
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,160
Okay.

289
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,440
Pei Xi.

290
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,440
Pei Xi.

291
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,530
Come here.

292
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,980
Come quickly.

293
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
Show the newbie around.

294
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,610
I am busy.

295
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,650
You're busy? What are you doing?

296
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,340
I am really busy.

297
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,980
I am creating an opportunity for you.

298
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,530
What opportunity?

299
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,760
I already asked.

300
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,060
Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying
are not a couple.

301
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,680
How do you know that?

302
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,730
Ji Xiang Kong told me in person.

303
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,240
I get it.

304
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,360
What do you mean by opportunity?

305
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,410
Is there water inside your head?

306
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,460
Just listen to me.

307
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,010
Let's go.

308
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,890
Well. Sorry to trouble you.

309
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:39,780
Go.

310
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,410
No.

311
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,080
Why do I have to do this?

312
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,240
Because I am the boss and you work for me.
You have to listen to me.

313
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,960
Go quickly. Go with him.

314
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:55,530
-Thanks, Boss!
-You are welcome. Bye.

315
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,260
Let's go.

316
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,350
Just forget it.

317
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,180
-I can do it by myself.
-This is the procedure.

318
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,190
I have another interview tomorrow.

319
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,240
Then, when you go home later,
send me the information

320
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,700
and email me. Is that all right?

321
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,880
-Okay.
-Thanks!

322
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,840
Yi Yi, I am leaving first.

323
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,610
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye. See you tomorrow. Careful.

324
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,060
-Lu Yi Yi!
-I...

325
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,640
What's wrong with you?

326
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,060
Did I scare you?

327
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,340
I need to buy you dinner then.

328
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,360
Let's go.
I know a very good Sichuan restaurant.

329
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,290
-Trying to bribe me?
-No.

330
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,040
Tell me. Why are you here?

331
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,520
Did I invite you to dinner
because I want something from you?

332
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,440
Am I that kind of person?

333
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,580
No.

334
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,310
Actually, there's something.

335
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,110
I want you
to investigate Zhao Yang for me.

336
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,310
Investigate him?

337
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
He is indeed not a good person.

338
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,330
But am I that close to you?

339
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,110
Why should I help you?

340
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,090
-I am leaving.
-Wait. Come back.

341
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,140
Aren't you a great reporter?

342
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:18,210
Punish evil,
promote good and deliver justice.

343
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,380
Aren't these
the responsibility of reporters?

344
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,660
Besides,

345
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,940
Exposing Zhao Yang's underhanded business

346
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,710
will shock the whole industry.

347
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,340
This is a nice chance
to make a name for yourself.

348
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,440
I won't give it to others but you.

349
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,960
Stop. I can't accept it.

350
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,680
You've already seen.

351
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,110
I am just an editor
of a small magazine company.

352
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:39,530
I don't have such a noble responsibility.

353
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,650
-Bye.
-No.

354
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,990
Grandpa Lu.
Grandma Lu. Beauty Lu.

355
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,390
Beauty Lu, all right?

356
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,740
Are you looking for a fight?

357
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,670
I am telling you.

358
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,310
I'll call the police
if you follow me again.

359
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,160
There is no use to call the police.

360
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,020
After I come out, I will still follow you.

361
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,340
You...

362
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,510
Okay.

363
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,060
I give up. All right?

364
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,510
I'll help you.

365
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,660
How chivalrous of you!
Let's talk while we eat.

366
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,940
That Sichuan restaurant is wonderful.
There is a long line for it.

367
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,310
Right.

368
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,740
Are you close with Shu Wen in VNG?

369
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,680
Shu Wen? Of course.
She is my former sister-in-law.

370
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,790
Former sister-in-law?

371
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,590
Right.

372
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,640
Ji Xiang Kong. This scumbag!

373
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,460
Wait.

374
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,290
How's that related to my Brother Kong?
What happened?

375
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,410
Wait. Why did you hit me?
Are you eating or not, Lu Yi Yi?

376
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,360
Here she is.

377
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,060
Leave it to me.

378
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,180
Hello. These are your coffees.

379
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:48,080
Here you go. Be careful. It's hot.

380
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,580
Isn't this Qiu Ying?

381
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,330
That's weird.

382
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:55,590
Why are you here being a waitress?

383
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,660
We are really curious about
the news about you and Ji Xiang Kong.

384
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,710
Is that true?

385
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,130
It's none of your business.

386
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,510
-Wait. Don't go.
-Don't touch me.

387
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,530
Ji Xiang Kong has Shu Wen now.

388
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,890
Are you being left out?

389
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,010
-You even brought a little notebook.
-Give it back.

390
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,460
What are you doing?

391
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,630
You are not welcomed here.

392
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,590
Get out.

393
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,160
Isn't this Pei Xi?

394
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,410
-What are you being proud of?
-I ask you to leave.

395
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,530
-Let's go. They are driving us out.
-Let's go. Don't play anymore.

396
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,810
Ji Xiang Kong's.

397
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,410
Thank you.

398
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,740
If you have any trouble in the future,

399
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,330
you can ask me directly.

400
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:52,610
As long as I am here,

401
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,210
no one will bully you.

402
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,510
Former sister-in-law!

403
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,830
Lin Yi Xuan told me personally

404
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,340
that Shu Wen is his former sister-in-law.

405
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,540
Ji Xiang Kong is his Brother Kong.

406
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:24,660
Do you know
the relationship between all these?

407
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,110
I'm sure he joined VNG

408
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,680
to reunite with Shu Wen.

409
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,680
This liar.

410
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,230
Yi Yi.

411
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:38,690
Can you stop asking Lin Yi Xuan
about these things in the future?

412
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,830
I asked these things from Lin Yi Xuan

413
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,960
because I am afraid you've been cheated.

414
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,660
You are so silly.

415
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,880
Before you got trapped in this,

416
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,040
I have to…

417
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,110
You think too much.

418
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,310
I don't have time
to think about these things right now.

419
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,290
I sold my house to pay my loan,

420
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,350
preparing for Rising Star,

421
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,630
becoming a waitress at Dream Traveler.

422
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,940
I am very clear about

423
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,140
what I am doing every day.

424
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,360
This might be the only chance

425
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:06,290
to become a professional commentator.

426
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,580
I have to try my best.

427
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,350
I can't waste a single minute.

428
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,410
Okay. Let's not talk about this now.

429
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,280
But you have to promise me

430
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,090
not to see him again.

431
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,860
The most important thing for you now

432
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,760
is to prepare well for this competition.

433
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,690
Don't worry.

434
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,130
You were busy the whole day.
Take a shower and go to sleep.

435
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,130
All right.

436
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,590
You should sleep early too.

437
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,110
You are back?

438
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,010
Do you play basketball?

439
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:08,960
Not anymore.

440
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,510
It has been here for a while.

441
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,860
Let me help you pump it up.

442
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:15,540
No need.

443
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,060
I want to throw this anyway.

444
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,650
Okay.

445
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,580
Right. I have a problem
and I want to speak with you.

446
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,440
Sure. Say it.

447
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,090
I looked up your data recently.

448
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,700
I discovered that you've played
every role and played well in all of them.

449
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:42,330
Do you think your current role suits you?

450
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,060
What do you mean?

451
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,960
Are you saying that I can't do well
in my current role with my standard?

452
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,810
Are you saying that
I'm holding the team back?

453
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,310
Please check the data carefully.

454
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,310
Which game of mine has a problem?

455
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,990
No. That's not what I meant.

456
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,760
Perhaps I didn't make it clear.

457
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,450
My point is that…

458
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,980
I want to say. Every role
and every performance is very stable.

459
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,530
It's even like a straight line.

460
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,560
From another point of view,

461
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:24,840
does it mean that
you can achieve more with your potential?

462
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,810
You just came to VNG as the captain.

463
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,480
I understand that
you want to open the situation up.

464
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,510
But I am this kind of person,

465
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,280
I'm straightforward.
I don't like beating around the bush.

466
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,410
So I advise you
not to spend your energy on me.

467
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,660
Take care of yourself.

468
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,760
I was just checking the data
and want to have a chat with you.

469
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,630
I think you have
great room for development.

470
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,460
Of course, how you tell others…

471
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,730
It's our rest time now.

472
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,380
Can I go to sleep?

473
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,360
Okay. Sorry.

474
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,780
Good night.

475
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:40,930
Tong Wu.

476
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,030
Can you eat all of these?

477
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,410
It's also for
Brother Qi and Brother Shen.

478
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,030
Good morning.

479
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:51,740
Morning.

480
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,960
It's these three types of food again?

481
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,830
Can you be more creative?

482
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:03,910
Buy buns next time.

483
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,810
I want meat buns.

484
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,510
Okay.

485
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,060
Good morning, Captain.

486
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:11,890
Morning.

487
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,710
How can you find the energy to fight me
without eating anything?

488
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,430
Anyway, you will be beaten by me.

489
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,980
Do you know
what will be trending tomorrow?

490
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:21,560
Prince of E-sports
defeats clumsy-handed Ji Xiang Kong.

491
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,360
Sister Wen. Good morning.

492
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:24,950
-Sister Wen. Good morning.
-Good morning.

493
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,740
Your breakfast looks good.

494
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,790
Sister Wen.

495
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,340
Let's go out for a talk.

496
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,740
Okay.

497
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,310
Take your time.

498
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:48,740
Go out for a talk?

499
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,530
What will they talk about in the morning?

500
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,030
I am not eating.

501
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,720
You just came to the team.

502
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,590
You need to give them some time to adapt.

503
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,140
But Qi Yue is rash.

504
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,730
Sometimes, he is too blunt.

505
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,610
Qi Yue is a founding member.
He is proud and arrogant.

506
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:16,590
I guess he doesn't listen to him
when Pei Xi was here.

507
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,790
Shen Yue is a cunning guy.

508
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,610
He is siding with Qi Yue right now

509
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,410
but he is not really convinced by him.

510
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,690
What about others?

511
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,160
Lu Sheng's skill is well-rounded,

512
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,230
But he seems to be
disillusioned with the mortal world.

513
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,290
He only asks for stability
instead of improvements.

514
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,310
Tong Wu is the youngest.
He is also the one with the least courage.

515
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,860
But they have strong ability overall.

516
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,540
Good job. It just took you a few days

517
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,130
to figure out
these people's characteristics and temper.

518
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,280
The autumn season is coming soon.
Time is limited.

519
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,910
But I already analysed all their data.

520
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,210
Next,

521
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:57,980
I'll have to make a proper training plan
according to their characteristics.

522
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,960
Then, you might need to try harder.

523
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,810
Otherwise, it's hard
to employ your training plan.

524
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,230
Don't worry. If you have any problem,

525
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,030
I will fix it for you in the first place.

526
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,840
Thanks, Sister Wen.

527
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,360
I know what to do.

528
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
It might be a little risky

529
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,340
but don't worry, Sister Wen.

530
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,290
No matter what I do,
please let me go through it.

531
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,760
Since I got you here,

532
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,880
I will give you my full support.

533
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,930
Master.
This Ji Xiang Kong is a lovers boy.

534
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:32,230
Sister Wen trusts him so much.

535
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,950
I think he must've enchanted Sister Wen.

536
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,080
It's all made up by the media.

537
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:38,890
You actually believe that?

538
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,410
Master. Don't you worry that
Sister Wen and Ji Xiang Kong…

539
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,330
Enough!

540
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,530
I know Shu Wen's personality

541
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,490
better than anyone else.

542
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,310
Master.

543
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,960
Why are you bearing this?

544
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,580
Qi Yue.

545
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,060
My thing is none of your business.

546
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,140
Just work hard on training
and take the competition seriously.

547
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,890
Showing your true capabilities
is more important than anything else.

548
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,930
Don't forget what I've said to you before.

549
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:09,340
Okay. I know, Master.

550
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,010
I will go to training now.

551
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:12,990
Go.

552
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,130
[Luo Tian's Review]

553
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,260
Pei Xi?

554
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,010
Pei Xi. Why didn't you
reply to my text messages?

555
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,250
I don't have time.

556
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,930
Pei Xi. I know you are busy.

557
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,130
So, I come to see you in advance.

558
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
Why don't we have a chat?

559
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,840
Have you eaten yet?

560
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,710
Don't disturb my work.

561
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,530
I come here to study this time.

562
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,750
I am here for

563
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,760
Teacher Luo Tian's review.

564
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:02,460
Aren't you a hostess?

565
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,760
Why is a game review related to you?

566
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,840
How is it not related?

567
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,310
It's related to me for sure.

568
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,810
I am participating in Rising Star.

569
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,910
I've decided to change from
hostess to professional commentator.

570
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:15,980
In that way, we will be able
to meet very often at the game.

571
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,010
You want to be a commentator too?

572
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,110
Right.

573
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,060
Is there someone else too?

574
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,940
Who else besides me?

575
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:32,890
Waitress. Waitress.

576
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,150
What's wrong with this computer?

577
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:35,880
It's powered off.

578
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,810
Qiu Ying?

579
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,080
Waitress.

580
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,160
Coming.

581
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,930
Okay. I'll bring it to you in a moment.

582
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,990
Hello.

583
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,430
What do you want?

584
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,690
I am a little thirsty.

585
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,260
What do you have for drinks?

586
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:03,750
Please introduce me.

587
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,560
Right. Take a look yourself.

588
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,760
The text on the menu is too small.

589
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,230
Why don't you read it to me?

590
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,960
We have flower tea, juice,
Nongfu Spring, and Scream.

591
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:16,890
What do you want?

592
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,880
Just these few things?

593
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,390
Do you have coffee?

594
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,880
Yes. Cappuccino.

595
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,310
Okay.

596
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,860
Give me a cup of Cappuccino.

597
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,430
Wait a second.

598
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:33,980
I need to do commentary recently.

599
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:37,990
So, don't make it too hot.
My throat can't stand that.

600
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,130
Also, I have a bad stomach.

601
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,860
It can't be too cold.

602
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,310
One more thing.

603
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,280
Recently,

604
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,660
I'm on a diet.

605
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,230
So, I don't want milk or sugar.

606
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,880
Do you remember that?

607
00:33:58,730 --> 00:33:59,890
If you don't want milk,

608
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,540
it can only be Americano.

609
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:04,460
But I ordered Cappuccino.

610
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:05,960
Sorry about that.

611
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,590
We don't know how to make
a cup of Cappuccino without milk.

612
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,130
What's your attitude?

613
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:13,360
Be careful. I will complain about this.

614
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,130
Pei Xi. Did you see that?

615
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,389
That was too much.

616
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,960
We only have one kind of coffee today.

617
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,929
Latte. It's free.

618
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:33,909
Pei Xi.

619
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,659
Thanks for helping me out.

620
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,460
You think too much.

621
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:39,760
I am not helping you.

622
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,900
We have limited staff here.

623
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,510
There are many customers waiting.

624
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,909
Remember.

625
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,760
Just do your job well.

626
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:54,280
I know.

627
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,280
Waiter. Where is the review section?

628
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,580
Here. This way, please.

629
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,510
Let's go.

630
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,510
Waitress!

631
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,690
Coming.

632
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,700
Come and see
what's wrong with my computer?

633
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,640
Okay.

634
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,890
Is it hard to choose?

635
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,740
I don't know what you mean.

636
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
You have to choose one

637
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,040
so I can help you.

638
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,260
I don't need your help.

639
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,260
I think you are too bored.

640
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,510
Do you want both of them?

641
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,760
All right. Bad boy.

642
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,330
You have my grace before.

643
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,860
Do you want any advice?

644
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,760
I've told you. I don't need it.

645
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,910
Good boy. You finally grow up.

646
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,460
You've learnt to think by yourself.

647
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:06,440
Do you want me to advise you
as someone who's experienced?

648
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,130
Are you very free now?

649
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,640
The bar is short of people.

650
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,960
Do you want to help?

651
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,760
Do I look free to you?

652
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,740
I am busy
worrying about your relationship.

653
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,880
Teacher Luo.

654
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,010
Teacher Luo is here.

655
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,960
He is running faster than anyone else.

656
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,910
What did you do to Pei Xi?

657
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,030
He's shy and going through puberty.

658
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:30,440
You are gossiping
about his personal life again, right?

659
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,430
How is that gossiping?

660
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,960
I am his brother. I am responsible
as an elder member of the family.

661
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,760
What time is it?

662
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,760
It's time. Go in there.

663
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,260
You're making it into a big occasion.

664
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:51,240
I put a lot of thought into this.
Let's go. Many people are waiting for you.

665
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,060
Here.

666
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,350
-Teacher Luo!
-Teacher Luo is here!

667
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,610
You are so famous. Teacher Luo.

668
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,190
Summoners, good afternoon.

669
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:07,460
This is

670
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:12,910
the famous commentator in the
e-sports industry, Teacher Luo Tian.

671
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,280
I believe everyone knows him.

672
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,060
Yes.

673
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,940
This is his first time being here
at Dream Traveler.

674
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:21,310
From now on,

675
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,850
Teacher Luo Tian
will come to Dream Traveler

676
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:26,540
to do reviews on past games every week.

677
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,640
Let's welcome him.

678
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:30,730
Teacher Luo.

679
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,080
I'm Qiao Xin, a hostess of
You Xing Video's iConquer edition.

680
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,790
I admire you a lot.

681
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:36,950
Thanks!

682
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,310
I also admire you.

683
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:39,680
Go there. Talk nicely.

684
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,640
I'll leave it to you.

685
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,160
Hello everyone, I am Luo Tian.

686
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,660
Welcome to attend

687
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,160
my offline review on past games.

688
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,760
Today, I will review
the final game of the Beta test.

689
00:37:55,790 --> 00:38:01,580
This game was won against Legends by VNG
with an overwhelming score of two to zero.

690
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,040
Since this is a Beta test match,

691
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,990
every team must choose
at least a new Champion of this version.

692
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,550
But in this game,

693
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:15,660
Legends chose two new Champions,
while they were losing a game.

694
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,430
See.

695
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,240
From the line-up, it seems like

696
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:20,580
Legends actually have the advantage
in this game.

697
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,160
By supporting

698
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,030
the fixed-point control
of Deep Sea Prisoner,

699
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,580
Lu Feng's balance…

700
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,460
It's useless.

701
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:28,980
What?

702
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,480
Writing notes so crazily

703
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:32,710
is useless.

704
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,110
Then, what is useful?

705
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,680
Ask Luo Tian directly.

706
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,410
A professional is just in front of you.

707
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:42,240
Asking him directly
is ten times better than writing notes.

708
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,840
It makes some sense.

709
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,060
Are you trying to be a commentator
with this brain of yours?

710
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,310
Of course, the key is this team fight.

711
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,460
What can you see from this?

712
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:04,930
Teacher Luo Tian. I have a question.

713
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,760
Very active.

714
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,890
Yes.

715
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,360
I want to be a commentator like you
in the future.

716
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,010
So I will definitely
study hard and learn from you.

717
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:15,910
Sure. So, what can you see from this?

718
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,500
I think Ji Xiang Kong entered first,

719
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,210
he is not able to initiate.

720
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,560
After his death,
he can't cooperate with his teammates.

721
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,460
That's the reason for the loss.

722
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:29,780
Anyone else has a different opinion?

723
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,100
Teacher Luo.

724
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,230
I think the key to this loss
is on this team fight.

725
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,980
I think it's not Ji Xiang Kong's fault,

726
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,760
but his teammates
who didn't back him up well.

727
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,480
This caused the bad control on VNG's ADC

728
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,160
and the counter killing.

729
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,100
That's right.

730
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,210
The real reason is Huo Yao's mistake.

731
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,360
At a key moment, he missed his skill.

732
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,890
The Support of Legends fought Pei Xi's
Hell Emissary every time aggressively.

733
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,780
It was not just a simple mistake.

734
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,940
Very negative position.

735
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,830
This led to the later failure of Legends.

736
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,660
Today's review is over.

737
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:19,410
In the future, I will be doing
more reviews at Dream Traveler.

738
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,940
I hope everyone will
continue to support iConquer.

739
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,060
Thank you!

740
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:27,580
Thank you, Teacher Luo.
Can I take a photo with you?

741
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,860
I want one too.

742
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:40,410
-Thanks!
-It's my turn.

743
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,190
Teacher Luo Tian.

744
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:44,610
-Thank you, Teacher Luo Tian.
-Thanks, Teacher. Do your best!

745
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,910
You stepped on me!

746
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,410
Teacher Luo, nice to meet you.

747
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,840
Brother Summer said
he will wait for you at the bar.

748
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:55,760
Okay.

749
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,930
Teacher. Let me take
you to the resting area.

750
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,380
He will be here soon.

751
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,150
-Here.
-I'll just sit here then.

752
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,390
Teacher Luo. Do you want a drink?
We have everything here.

753
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,040
There's no need. You can leave me alone.

754
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,910
Just find me
whenever he is done with his business.

755
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,710
Teacher Luo.

756
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,010
Do you want an autograph?

757
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,910
You are my idol.

758
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,850
I don't just want your autograph.

759
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:42,610
I also have many questions
about commentating for you.

760
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,160
This is my notebook.

761
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,560
Have we met before?

762
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:52,510
Luo Tian. What do you think?

763
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,380
A trainee's practice is so casual now?

764
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,360
I remember you.

765
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,260
GDV's commentary room.

766
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,630
Teacher Luo, I...

767
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I am so sorry.

768
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,930
I didn't mean it that day.

769
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,360
Someone who can't even lift her head.

770
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,280
How can you convince me that you will
be confident at the commentary table?

771
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,110
Okay.

772
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,380
I know.

773
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,500
Not a problem.

774
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,510
Just do whatever I said.

775
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:32,880
All right.

776
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,680
Fine.

777
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,590
I'm hanging up. Someone is here.

778
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:41,030
Okay. I know that. All right. Bye.

779
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:46,110
Teacher Luo Tian.

780
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,650
Your waitress at Dream Traveler

781
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,180
has quite the dream.

782
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,230
You've discovered that.

783
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:56,840
I admit.

784
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,260
I arranged that on purpose.

785
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,540
I don't want you to think that
I'm getting her in through the backdoor.

786
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,710
This is not called
getting through the backdoor?

787
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,610
But, if she can convince you

788
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:11,910
to give an opportunity for her
to get closer to me,

789
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:13,810
she is quite a sly one.

790
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,250
She didn't use any method.
She worked really hard. You know?

791
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,840
To study at my place,

792
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:22,890
she became the regional server's
top player in a month.

793
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,210
She comes in early
and leaves late every day.

794
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:25,460
That's rare.

795
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,440
That was all it takes to convince you?

796
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:29,960
I met too many amateur hostesses like her.

797
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,690
They seem to work really hard
on the surface,

798
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:34,730
but they still need to attract fans
with beauty and talent after all.

799
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,730
She tries whatever she can
to take advantage of other's popularity.

800
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,030
A girl with nothing but a suit
is not needed in our commentary circle.

801
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,460
I understand your worries.

802
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,660
I'm just giving her a chance.

803
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,790
Whether it works or not
depends on her hard work.

804
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:49,370
But I can promise you

805
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,290
that she is definitely not
the kind of person you just said.

806
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,530
How can you be so sure?

807
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:56,810
Summer.

808
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,360
I haven't seen you being keen
on someone for so many years.

809
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:04,160
I really appreciate her.

810
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,430
This little girl looks pretty too.

811
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:08,960
She can rely on her beauty
but she wants to rely on her talent.

812
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:10,970
This kind of girl is very rare now.

813
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,890
Weren't you the one
who said you lack people?

814
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,650
Tell me the truth.

815
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,680
It's Pei Xi.

816
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,780
Do you know? Pei Xi likes her.

817
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,040
Why didn't you say it earlier?

818
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,950
It's your future sister-in-law.

819
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,910
That's not a guarantee yet.

820
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,760
What's more important
is that I appreciate her too.

821
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:37,080
But you know I have a high standard.

822
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:39,860
-I don't simply appreciate anyone.
-I know.

823
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,080
That's why you are the expert.

824
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,210
An expert is different.
You can guide anyone.

825
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:46,970
-Fine.
-Come.

826
00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:48,490
-I'll toast you with tea instead of wine.
-Sure.

827
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:50,590
Let's pretend it to be true.

828
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,040
Hello, Yi Yi.

829
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,860
If I rush in there and find Teacher Luo,

830
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,010
Do you think I'm will be seen
as too eager for success?

831
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,780
I am telling you,

832
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,110
you can only be successful
by being shameless.

833
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,860
-Okay.
-Go.

834
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:08,990
They are coming out.

835
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:10,860
I'll tell you later at home. Bye!

836
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,060
-When will you come again?
-I'll call you.

837
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:14,810
Teacher Luo.

838
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:18,890
Teacher Luo.

839
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,260
I am sorry.

840
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,980
I know I might've given you
a bad impression just now.

841
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,360
But, I really want to
become a professional commentator.

842
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,130
Maybe, you think I am reckless right now.

843
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:33,510
But I insist on doing this.

844
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,710
So...

845
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:37,240
So…

846
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,290
So, what?

847
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:48,410
So,

848
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,240
I want to be your student.

849
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
Everyone can say something beautiful.

850
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:00,440
Everyone can have a resolve.

851
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,060
Tell me.

852
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:03,710
What is so special about you?

853
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,260
It's fine. Nothing else.
I am leaving first.

854
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:12,530
You...

855
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,110
You...
Drive slowly on your way home.

856
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:24,790
All right. It's fine.

857
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,640
He has always been strict with others.

858
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
But,

859
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,960
he never accepts any students.

860
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,330
You are so brave!

861
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,980
Then,

862
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,400
does it mean
I don't have a chance anymore?

863
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,460
That's not necessary.

864
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,330
I think he means

865
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,390
you shouldn't just say something out loud.

866
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:47,140
Make something happen
and show your speciality.

867
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:50,330
-Is that so?
-Yes.

868
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,250
I've known him for many years.
He has always been like this.

869
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:56,340
Then, it means I still have a chance?

870
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,310
Yes, you do. But you have to

871
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,600
earn that chance by yourself.

872
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:04,530
I'll tell you a secret.

873
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,780
Rising Star.

874
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:08,340
Teacher Luo Tian
will be the main examiner.

875
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,030
Didn't you sign up for it?
Prove your efforts in front of him.

876
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:13,960
Then, will he be there?

877
00:47:14,910 --> 00:47:15,900
Don't tell others I said this.

878
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,480
Thanks, Boss! I will try my best.

879
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,130
Okay. Don't call me Boss anymore.
Call me Brother Summer.

880
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,640
Thanks, Brother Summer!
