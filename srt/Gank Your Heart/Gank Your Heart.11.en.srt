00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,250
Miss Lu!

5
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,800
What's the matter?

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,479
Thank you for that.

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,030
Don't thank me. I'm not worthy of it.

8
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,670
I beg you.

9
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,729
Stop messing with Qiu Ying!

10
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,200
She overnighted at the airport
to find you this video.

11
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,970
And she almost had an accident!
Did you know that?

12
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,250
What happened? Where is she now?

13
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,580
She's all right now.

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,720
Listen here, don't ever
try to get at her again!

15
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,520
Well, Brother Kong is being sincere.

16
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,220
You shouldn't have said that.

17
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,260
If he wants to show his utmost sincerity,

18
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,400
just stops hurting Qiu Ying.

19
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,820
Is that what she wants? Or what you want?

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,290
Does it make any difference?

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,550
What I want is what she wants.

22
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,870
Qiu Ying is honest,
simple, and kind-hearted.

23
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,200
Listen here,
don't ever approach her again.

24
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,380
Or I won't let you off the hook!

25
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,210
And you!

26
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,940

Are you leaving?

28

Bye.

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,070
Remember to send me messages on WeChat.

30
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,180
Something's going on between you two.

31
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,440
Interesting.

32
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,150
It's not.

33
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,370
Well...

34
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,920
Is it that obvious?

35
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,660
Only you know yourself.

36
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,290
Are you leaving?

37
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:07,750
I've had a long day.

38
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,050
All right. You don't do anything today.
Get to bed early

39
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,150
You didn't sleep well yesterday.

40
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,640
It's all right.

41
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,880
I slept on the airport bench.

42
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,550
And now my back hurts a bit.

43
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,500
Nonsense! The airport chair was so hard.

44
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,600
Of course your back hurts.

Seeing many apologizing
to Ji Xiang Kong on the Internet,

46
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,140
I guess my hard work isn't in vain.

47

I don't get it.

48

The wrong done to him has been righted.

But what's that got to do with you?

50
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,910
You're concerned about him all the time.

51
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,410
Well, I need to use the washroom first.
I'm having a stomach ache.

-Over there.

Wear these pants and the one in my hand.

102
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,390
You better cover yourself
from head to toe.

103
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,830
You mustn't wear anything so revealing.

104

Where is he going?

111
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,790
A barbecue shop we always frequent.

112

Barbecue shop?

[Hurry up. I'm hanging up.]

Wait. You're having a dinner with me.

122
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,280
But why are you wearing like this?

123
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,150
This is the trend for next year.

124
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:33,510
You know nothing.

125
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:38,570
Next year's trend?

126
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,250
-Keep your voice down.
-Okay.

127
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,000
What would you like to have?

128
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,300
Thank you

129
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,250
First things first, this meal is on me

130
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,270
Thank you for reconciling with me.

131
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,750
That's the right thing to do.

132
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,620
You did me such a big favor.

133
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
by waiting at the airport
for the whole night.

134
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:07,860
So this meal is on me.

135
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,320
-But...
-Don't fight with me over the bill.

136
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,090
Fine. Since you're insistent,

137
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,530
this meal is on you.

138
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,060
The next one is on me.

139
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,310
We've just had our seats here.

140
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,370
And you're already
planning for the next meal.

141
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,220
You're not serious at all.

142
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,520
Quick, order whatever you want.

143
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,800
-Slow down.
-Where are they?

144
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,660
-Here?
-Yes, that's it.

145
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,040
That's Brother Kong's motorcycle.

146
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,290
Why are you looking for him?
He's not here.

147
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,160
-They're not here.
-Get down at once.

148
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,020
-What if they see us?
-Okay.

149
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,380
Well, why are you looking for him?

150
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,120
We need to find him first. Right?

151
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,500
Where is he?

152
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,930
-We're sorry.
-Let's get over there

153
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:54,620
Darn it. Here they are!

154
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,950
We're sorry.

155
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,580
They're sitting all the way inside there.
I'm sure he's up to no good.

156
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,680
Ji Xiang Kong better behaves.

157
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:12,110
Can I ask you something?

158
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,430
What are we doing here today?

159
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,340
Are you stupid? It's so obvious.
Can't you see it?

160
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,980
Are you following them?

161
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,210
I thought you were
asking me out for dinner.

162
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,920
What did you say?

163
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,130
I didn't say anything.

164
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,990
I'm going inside.
I have to hear what they're saying.

165
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,300
They're having a date.

166
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,420
It's very immoral for us
to eavesdrop on their conversation.

167
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,780
Date. You're aware that it's a date.

168
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,590
And it's a dangerous one.
I have to keep an eye on them.

169
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,360
-What's that got to do with you?
-Are you coming?

170
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,570
Yes, I am.

171
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,140
Did we order too much?

172
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,510
In fact, I don't usually eat at this hour.

173
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,890
I'm on a diet.

174
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,420
Do you need to lose weight
when you're so skinny already?

175
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,900
You should at least eat some.

176
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,970
I'll help myself, then.

177
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,660
Let's grill this first.

178
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,430
I'll do it.

179
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,950
We'll have that booth.

180
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,720
Okay. On my count of three, go.

181
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,660
One. Two. Three.

182
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,980
What are you doing?

183
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,500
We're tying our shoelaces.

184
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,030
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,350
What are you two doing?

186
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,270
I'm having gastric pain.

187
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,560
What would you like to eat?

188
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,290
Just get us any of these.

189
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,350
We'll have some barbecue.

190
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,610
Anything will do.

191
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,250
Oh, no. No barbecue.

192
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,680
Well...

193
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,430
I need to have
something hot for gastritis.

194
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,100
Just serve us porridge
with unlimited refills.

195
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,760
Why are you so stingy?

196
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,410
-I've had my dinner.
-I haven't eaten yet.

197
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,170
We'll talk about that later.

198
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,120
Oh yeah, would you like
something to drink?

199
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:35,380
Or alcohol.

200
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,900
I would rather not drink.

201
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,840
It's okay. If you get drunk,
just give me your address.

202
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,210
I'll get you home.

203
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,510
After all, we're friends now.

204
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,150
First of all, I'd like to apologize

205
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,530
for breaking your mother's necklace.

206
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,340
How did you know
that's my mother's necklace?

207
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
On the last night you got drunk,

208
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,490
you mistook me for your mother.

209
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,980
I'm sorry.

210
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:09,660
I wasn't aware that the necklace
was so important to you.

211
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,390
I misunderstood you.

212
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,480
And what I said during the duo queue
and on the reality show.

213
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,670
I'd gone overboard.

214
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,120
I apologize for that.

215
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,660
I don't even know you anymore.

216
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:27,220
The necklace is fixed.

217
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,800
In fact,

218
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,420
I owe you an apology, too.

219
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,490
I should not have
got into your car just like that.

220
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,810
And played the duo queue with you
with some ulterior motive.

221
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,210
You're right in teaching me a lesson.

222
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:42,150
That means we're even now?

223
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,290
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

224
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,230
Something's not right.

225
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,680
Why do I feel

226
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,420
that there's something fishy going on?

227
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,520
Isn't it great?

228
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,720
Do you want them to fight?

229
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,070
We didn't order these.

230
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,730
You did.

231
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,460
It's all right.

232
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,010
Just put them here.

233
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,490
To show you my gratitude,

234
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,120
here's a piece of meat for you.

235
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:28,250
I can't let a lady serve me.

236
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,270
I should be the one serving you.

237
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,940
Here, let me make you a wrap.

238
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,130
Here.

239
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,860
What's wrong? Is it hard to hold it?

240
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:58,790
Do you want me to feed you?

241
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,350
No need.

242
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,570
Oh, right.

243
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,070
I almost forgot about it.

244
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,820
This is for you.

245
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,250
And you're most welcome.

246
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:15,750
What is it?

247
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,270
Though that video

248
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,190
was crudely made and full of mistakes,

249
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,270
it's pretty good for a beginner.

250
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:38,340
It was crudely made and full of mistakes?

251
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,970
Are you the anonymous netizen?

252
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,800
Don't deny it.

253
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:46,780
I'm pretty sure it's you.

254
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,460
The fighting video

255
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,050
has been clarified.

256
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,110
I'll ask the team to explain it
to You Xing Video,

257
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,900
so that you can go back to work.

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,450
and fulfill your mother's wish.

259
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,570
to become an excellent host.

260
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,560
Thank you.

261
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,569
But I don't feel like going back anymore.

262
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,099
If I stay at You Xing Video,

263
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
I will remain an IConquer host.

264
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,420
In fact, I can't learn much from it.

265
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,630
I'm just a nobody.

266
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,700
At the moment I sold my house,

267
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,030
I realized that, no matter what I do,

268
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,170
I have to be the best and
the most professional person.

269
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,170
And make everyone agree with me.

270
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,210
Have you ever thought about

271
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,340
becoming a professional
esports commentator?

272
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,540
Professional esports commentator?

273
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,510
Because many are
paying attention to e-sports.

274
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,070
And there are a lot of good players.

275
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,770
But there are very few good commentators
who can explain a game well,

276
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,350
understand the tactics and the players.

277
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,070
Especially female commentators.

278
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,480
Most of them are nobodies

279
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,930
or female...

280
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,690
No, I'm not talking about you.

281
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,930
I mean, if you're willing to work hard,

282
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,760
I'm optimistic about your future.

283
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,330
Can I really succeed?

284
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,650
Why not?

285
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,110
Even someone like me

286
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,740
could join the finals in Vancouver.

287
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,340
Of course you can make it, too.

288
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,260
I'm so full.

289
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,370
I honestly have no idea
what you're here for.

290
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,000
All you did was eat.

291
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,820
If I hadn't finished it,
it would've gone to waste.

292
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,500
I'm full. How did you find the food?

293
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,020
It's good

294
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,010
Waiter, bill.

295
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,380
Coming.

296
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,390
-Hi. That'll be 460 yuan in total.
-460 yuan?

297
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,030
Okay, thank you.
Together with the next table's bill.

298
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:44,720
-He'll pay
-Brother Kong, what a coincidence.

299
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,770
Brother Kong, what a coincidence.
Qiu Ying, you're here, too.

300
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:49,120
Drop the act already.

301
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,760
Yi Yi?

302
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,320
What are you doing here?

303
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,000
Miss Lu.

304
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,740
I'm returning Qiu Ying
to you in one piece.

305
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

306
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,010
Qiu Ying, it's getting late!
And you're still hanging out here!

307
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,370
Come home with me!

308
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,150
I'll be waiting for you out there!

309
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:13,880
I'm heading home first.

310
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,210
Thanks for the dinner and the notebook.

311
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,810
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

312
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,100
Well, I'm leaving, too.

313
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,340
You go ahead and pay the bills.

314
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,780
Brother Kong, you...

315
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,810
You're making me pay for your date.
I don't find that appropriate.

316
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,270
Are you really leaving, Brother Kong?

317
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,690
No, don't leave. I didn't bring along...
Brother Kong, I...

318
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,590
-Brother Kong...
-Sir.

319
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:33,240
-I'm not leaving. Let me see.
-You haven't paid for the bill yet.

320
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:36,070
-No, he...
-Here, please pay for the bill.

321
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,350
-Let us go through the bill.
-Go ahead.

322
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,710
It's 460 yuan for that table.

323
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,050
And 600 yuan for yours.

324
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,000
600 yuan for mine?

325
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,880
It's all right. Well...

326
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,560
-Sir.
-No, I...

327
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,610
-Don't, brother...
-Don't go.

328
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,810
-Do you know Legends?
-No, I don't.

329
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,190
-Do you play video games?
-No, I don't.

330
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:02,140
I am Lin Yi Xuan.
Can you give me a discount?

331
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,760
-Who are you?
-I'm Lin Yi Xuan.

332
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:05,250
I don't know you.

333
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,770
I'm telling you,

334
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,390
that meal was a reconciliation.

335
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,620
But for your own happiness,

336
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,620
you will block him on WeChat,

337
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,960
and his phone number. And don't meet him.

338
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,340
Do you understand?

339
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,730
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

340
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,950
Hey!

341
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,010
You're ignoring me again.

342
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,320
Yi Yi, I've made up my mind.

343
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:33,750
I want to be a professional commentator.

344
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,370
You're at it again.
Are you having another fever?

345
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,550
I'm being serious. I've made up my mind.

346
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,000
I want to be a commentator like Luo Tian.

347
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,090
Why are you so excited late at night?

348
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,910
I see. Did Ji Xiang Kong fool you
into becoming a commentator?

349
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,180
I've had this idea
the first time I saw Luo Tian.

350
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,990
Starting from today,
I'm going to move toward my dream.

351
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,200
Stop!

352
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,030
Don't talk to me about dream.

353
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:03,750
I know more about it than you do

354
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,530
Let me ask you a question

355
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,940
Are you really satisfied
with your current life?

356
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:11,730
Of course.
I'm having such a comfortable life.

357
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm not like you.
You think about things all the time.

358
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,880
If you were really comfortable
with your current life,

359
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,600
you wouldn't have done that
at the press conference.

360
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:20,980
What did I do?

361
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:24,490
You said, "For my dream,
I'm going to find out the truth!"

362
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,810
Oh my God! Stop it!

363
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,980
I didn't say that!

364
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,530
Just drop the act already.

365
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,840
Listen to me. You can do it
if you believe you can.

366
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,040
Don't you say things like,
"My dream is dead on the road."

367
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,150
Enough. You win, okay?

368
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,540
Stop comforting me.

369
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,040
-Let's go home.
-Are you shy?

370
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,710
I'm not!

371
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,690
-Drop the act already.
-I hate being comforted.

372
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,470
Yes, hurry up. I told you to
get this out of here long ago.

373
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,750
Hurry up

374
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,810
-Director!
-It's driving me crazy.

375
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,900
Director. What day is it today?
Why is everyone so busy?

376
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,170
Lu Yi Yi.

377
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,970
You're finally here.

378
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,060
Check this out.

379
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,390
Isn't that me? Why am I in the picture?

380
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,860
You're on the hot search list.

381
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,810
Me? On the hot search list?

382
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:21,010
Oh my God! That's great, Director!

383
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,100
It's great?

384
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:27,060
Isn't it so?

385
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,660
Come here.

386
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,240
Take a look at this.

387
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,290
The fans of Legends sent you this

388
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,740
as a token of appreciation.

389
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,600
A token of appreciation for me?

390
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,020
You see, Director,

391
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,050
it's such a good thing.

392
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,570
Isn't it? But why do I feel

393
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:50,560
you're a little upset?

394
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,280
Yi Yi. Can't you tell that

395
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,860
I'm criticizing you?

396
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,180
You know what? This is definitely

397
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,810
the biggest challenge I've had
since I started working here.

398
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,600
I've had four or five phone calls
from the superior this morning.

399
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,380
He will come and
pay us a visit this afternoon.

400
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,350
The good old days
when I got to drink tea and read books

401
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,420
are gone forever.

402
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:19,240
Director, I'm sorry.

403
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,380
What's the use of being sorry?

404
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,520
We are a small magazine under the group.

405
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,510
Why did you have to
create such furor, huh?

406
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,060
What's the point of
being visited by the superior?

407
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,670
No matter how many times he visits us,
he can't increase our budget.

408
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,520
And we still can't
head out and do interviews.

409
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,580
You see, GDV wants us to interview them
for a special event this afternoon.

410
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,760
We've been working hard for years.

411
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,930
Has anyone of us ever
headed out and do interviews?

412
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:45,770
Well, Director.

413
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,350
I can give it a try.

414
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,320
You have to be the one to do it.

415
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,080
Whoever caused the trouble
should bear the responsibility.

416
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,690
-Go ahead.
-I'm leaving now.

417
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Go ahead. Take away those flowers.

418
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,400
Oh, right. Where is it, Director?

419
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,550
Where else could it be?
It's the building of GDV.

420
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,140
-Well, I'll go now
-Go ahead.

421
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,300
-See you, Director.
-Go ahead.

422
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,530
What's wrong with this world?

423
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,520
I was criticized for doing a good job.

424
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,380
-[Hello.]
-Hello, Lu Yi Yi.

425
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,010
I've arrived at GDV.

426
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,720
It's too big. Each floor belongs to GDV.
Where are you?

427
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,270
Go inside.

428
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,820
The interview is about to begin.

429
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,880
[If you don't send it
to me now, I'm screwed.]

430
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,720
I know.

431
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,930
But you have to tell me
what floor you're on?

432
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,470
You left without bringing it along.
Luckily I'm here.

433
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,330
[Seventh floor. I'm on the seventh floor.]

434
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,240
Hello?

435
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,400
Hello?

436
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:13,900
No way!

437
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,040
The phone died at the critical moment!

438
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,250
Hi, how can I help you?

439
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:27,740
I'm good. I found her.

440
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,710
-Thank you.
-Sure.

441
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,470
The phone died at the critical moment.

442
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,200
Can Qiu Ying find it?

443
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,610
-Qiu Ying!
-Yi Yi.

444
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,630
-You're finally here.
-Here's the material.

445
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,920
I love you so much.
My phone died suddenly.

446
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,280
It's driving me crazy!

447
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,970
You're a professional journalist.

448
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,360
How could you not
bring along the material?

449
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,120
I was told to do this
on the spur of the moment.

450
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,920
The material is
the summary of what I've learned.

451
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,450
I have to be prepared
for the interview, right?

452
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:00,670
Quick.
Qiu Ying, the interview is about to begin.

453
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,860
I'll get to work now.

454
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,350
Just stay here,
have some drink, and wait for me.

455
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,050
Love you. Bye-bye.

456
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,420
The commentary desk.

457
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,450
Hello, everyone.
I am your commentator, Qiu Ying.

458
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,100
Today, I'm going to show you

459
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,780
the first game of
the spring regular season.

460
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,620
VNG vs. Legends.

461
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,560
Check it out.

462
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,400
Wow!

463
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:34,050
What a fantastic game!

464
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:37,060
Oh my God!

465
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,940
Both teams have
two archers for their line-ups.

466
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,480
Are they going to deal
each other a final blow?

467
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,160
Luo Tian, what do you think?

468
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,010
Do interns these days
practice this casually?

469
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,900
Or do you think a commentary
is just made up of simple words?

470
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,700
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,560
I'm not an intern.

472
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,060
I went the wrong way.

473
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,510
I'm sorry.

474
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:17,830
Qiu Ying.

475
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,730
-My goodness!
-Done? How did it go?

476
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,540
I'm exhausted.

477
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,880
Luckily you sent me the material.

478
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:31,890
Had I been unprepared,
I would've been doomed.

479
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,810
Why are you acting like a fangirl again?

480
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:41,100
Yi Yi.

481
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,270
I've been studying
how to become a commentator, haven't I?

482
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:46,810
And here comes a great opportunity.

483
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,350
Are you aware that GDV

484
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,040
is organizing a competition called
The Stars Of Tomorrow?

485
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,730
The winner will get to host
iConquer with Luo Tian.

486
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:57,870
Luo Tian? Stop dreaming already.

487
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
Tian Luo has a sharp tongue.

488
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,960
If you become his partner,
he'll swear at you.

489
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,780
It's normal for
a capable person to be strict.

490
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,630
Besides, I signed up for it.

491
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,590
Sister, with your current skills,

492
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,620
you will end up getting the last place.

493
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,870
Anyway, I'm not going back to
You Xing Video.

494
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,390
But I don't want to leave the industry.

495
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,210
And I don't want to miss
such a good opportunity.

496
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,020
Well, after you finish your drink,

497
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,410
you will accompany me to the bookstore
to buy books for learning purposes.

498
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:34,020
No, I'm not going. I'm worn out.

499
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,560
Yi Yi.

500
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:40,370
There's an application for everything.

501
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,800
You're looking for esports books, right?
I'll find them for you.

502
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,360
Esports.

503
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,220
All right, pick your choice.

504
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,780
Wow, how cheap they are!

505
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,550
I can buy two to three books from here
at the price of a new one.

506
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,800
Indeed. After all,
it's Zhuanzhuan secondhand trading site.

507
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,950
-It's awesome, right?
-Is it genuine?

508
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,410
Of course. Quick, pick your choice.

509
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,300
This. This. And this.

510
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,190
They're so cheap. I'll take them all.

511
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,840
I'll place an order now.

512
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,840
They're expected to arrive tomorrow

513
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,780
-Done.
-Great.

514
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,390
Now I can acquire
theoretical knowledge in esports.

515
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,640
But how can I gain
practical experience quickly?

516
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,870
Yi Yi, help me figure out a way.

517
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,580
I have no idea.

518
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,990
There's a cyber cafe within the industry

519
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:28,280
that regularly hosts live broadcasts
of games and reviews.

520
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,750
It's especially suitable
for newbies like you.

521
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,520
Really? Let's go check it out now.

522
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,540
Here.

523
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,570
What do you think?
It looks unique, doesn't it?

524
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,870
Look, there are so many people.

525
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,590
Come with me

526
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,970
Wait a minute. Let me tell you something.

527
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,920
I'm sure many inside the circle
come to this place.

528
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,470
We need to be bold.

529
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,080
But remember this.
Talk less and listen more.

530
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:03,270
You don't have to remind me that.

531
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,780
Let's go.

532
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,740
You're going the wrong way.

533
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,940
This way, sister.

534
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,220
How cool!

535
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,680
It's full of iConquer elements.

536
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,110
You've ever been here before, no?

537
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,490
Yes.

538
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,750
It didn't look like this when I was here.

539
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,130
All right.

540
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,810
Look at that skinny guy. I know him.

541
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,530
His nickname is Fat Cat.

542
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,300
He used to be the number one
in the Regional Server.

543
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,970
But he was defeated by
a man called Skinny Monkey.

544
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,420
Skinny Monkey, what do you want to drink?

545
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,170
Oh my God! Skinny Monkey is here, too.

546
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,960
Why don't you know what I like to drink?

547
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,940
I want Jianjiao.

548
00:31:58,090 --> 00:31:59,270
What color do you want?

549
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,130
Blue one. Hurry up.
It's getting late.

550
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,400
The game is about to start over there.

551
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,750
Aren't they enemies?

552
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,740
Why do they look like friends?

553
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,460
Why do you know everything?

554
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,690
Of course I do.

555
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,870
But both of them are funny.

556
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,550
The skinny one is nicknamed Fat Cat.

557
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,430
And the fat one
is nicknamed Skinny Monkey.

558
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,550
They're a match made in heaven.

559
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:22,340
What are they watching?

560
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,430
-Let's go check it out.
-Let's go.

561
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,190
Excuse me. Please make way for us.

562
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,440
Please make way for us. Thank you.

563
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,720
-Go for it!
-Go for it!

564
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,020
This girl is so cool.

565
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,770
What are you doing?

566
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,920
Go for it! Use the top laner pawns!

567
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:49,080
Utilize the skills!

568
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,450
Head back! She's pushing your crystal!

569
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,080
Well done!

570
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,960
Brilliant!

571
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,740
You win.

572
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,030
Is he okay?

573
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:16,480
I've never met a female player
who plays Tujiang as good as her.

574
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:18,160
She's too good.

575
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,490
Sister.

576
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,290
Are you on the Regional Server list?

577
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,090
You meet the job requirements.

578
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,290
Yes

579
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,660
I don't want to be a waiter.

580
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,500
-Get out of my way.
-Okay.

581
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,240
She's cool.

582
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:42,000
She is a little cold.

583
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,360
Cold.

584
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,050
Hello, I know you guys.

585
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,400
You know us?

586
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:50,070
-They must be fans.
-Yes.

587
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,090
What job were you talking about?

588
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,940
Dream Traveler is hiring.

589
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,390
Over there.

590
00:33:57,270 --> 00:33:58,680
[We Are Hiring Waitress.]

591
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,420
My goodness.

592
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,890
To be a waiter here, you have to be
the number one in the Regional Server.

593
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,360
That's insane.

594
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,030
It explains how high standard
Dream Traveler is.

595
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,239
Perhaps the waiters here

596
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,310
are all powerful players.

597
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,280
Hey, Qiu Ying. Look.

598
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,860
Pei Xi?

599
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,780
He's a cold and expressionless man.

600
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,070
During the duo queue, he and Qiao Xiao
didn't stop hunting you down.

601
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,010
-He's not a good person.
-Forget it.

602
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,550
It's all in the past.

603
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,719
Anyway, what is he doing here?

604
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,840
And he's wearing a waiter uniform.

605
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,260
Yes.

606
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,739
Now I remember.

607
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:50,949
Dream Traveler's owner
is his cousin, Summer.

608
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,920
So that's it.

609
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:58,540
A top player is working as a waiter here.

610
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,950
What are they trying to pull here?

611
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,700
Forget it. Leave him alone.

612
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,510
Come, play two games with me.

613
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,880
Let's go

614
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,780
Mr. Jin, were you looking for me?

615
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,540
Xiang Kong. Come here.

616
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:13,820
Have a seat.

617
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,160
I asked you and Manager Zhao to come here.
But it's not a big deal.

618
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,910
During the press conference,

619
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,050
both of you have had some conflict.

620
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,640
On behalf of the company,
I would like to apologize to you.

621
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,750
At the same time,
I hope you could understand me.

622
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,720
Ever since the video incident,

623
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,810
the team has become jittery.

624
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,010
And the company was forced to
make extraordinary decisions at that time.

625
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,820
It's all right, Mr. Jin.

626
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,420
It's all over.

627
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,940
As long as Manager Zhao apologizes to me.

628
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:49,220
Of course. Manager Zhao
would like to apologize to you sincerely.

629
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,400
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

630
00:35:58,190 --> 00:36:01,110
Excuse me.
I have my earphones on all the time.

631
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,250
So I couldn't hear you clearly.

632
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,760
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

633
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,070
It's all right.

634
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:23,240
In fact, everything Manager Zhao does
is for the sake of the team.

635
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,450
We understand you.

636
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,970
Totally.

637
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,190
We're like a family.

638
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,180
Don't take it to heart.

639
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:34,060
Our priority is the
closed beta test finals.

640
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,890
That's right. Rest assured.

641
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,660
I won't let you down.

642
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,020
If so,

643
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,710
we've been waiting for
Handsome Ji's triumphal return.

644
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,340
If we're done here, I'll get going.

645
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:46,880
Manager Zhao, we're like a family here.

646
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:50,290
Have a handshake and
makeup with Xiang Kong.

647
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,310
Manager Zhao, have some tea.

648
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:12,620
I'm not drinking it!

649
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,170
Well, don't be mad.

650
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,820
He's lucky to get away this time.

651
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,900
He made me apologize to him.

652
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,260
Has it been dealt with?

653
