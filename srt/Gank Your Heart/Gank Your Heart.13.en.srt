[Gank Your Heart]

3
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,450
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,370
Okay.

5
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,750
[Let's see.]

6
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,229
[Legends chose Gongxi Chang Qing first.]

7
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,380
Darn it. They chose Gongxi Chang Qing.

8
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,509
[I think they are keeping
a strong support hero for Lin Yi Xuan.]

9
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,190
We'll choose Jin Can.

10
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,670
[Actually, this champion's healing ability
has the game's shortest cooldown.]

11
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,830
[VNG chose Jin Can.]

12
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,090
[Legends has picked
Mysterious Champion, Zhi Heng.]

13
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,840
[Are they using
support champions for a gank?]

14
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,210
[Both of them are support champions]

15
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,400
[but Gongxi Chang Qing is specialised
in healing and buffing teammates.]

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,200
[Comparatively, Jin Can
specialises in a ganking role.]

17
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,230
[He has more damage
among the support champions.]

18
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:20,790
[But I think today's game
is getting more and more interesting.]

19
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,990
[All right. Both teams have finished
their pick-ban session.]

20
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:26,990
[So far, team VNG
is leading by one to zero.]

21
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:30,540
[The second match of
the new beta series begins now.]

22
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,140
It's good, this seat is good
to watch the competition.

23
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,670
I can clearly see the facial expressions
of the players on stage by sitting here.

24
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,040
Why did you take such a long time
to take pictures?

25
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,180
I was looking around but
I didn't expect this place to be so big.

26
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,490
Dummy.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:14,370
A rumour. Apparently, Ji Xiang Kong made
a promise to the board of directors.

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,490
If he loses the game today,
he will leave Legends.

29
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,770
So, this match today is
a life-and-death match for him.

30
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,430
Are you serious?

31
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,900
My news is always reliable.

32
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,190
Do your best!

33
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,170
We'll still focus on Pei Xi in this game
to deal with their protection strategy.

34
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,000
No problem.
We'll finish them in six minutes.

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,250
Avoid initiating. Try to farm.
Clear the creeps and jungle.

36
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,200
Okay. Got it.

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,860
We can gank Pei Xi in Mid.
Yao, follow me to Mid-lane.

38
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,710
I'll lure him. Set a trap.

39
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,370
Okay. I'm coming.

40
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:01,120
There's a trap.

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,770
Shen Yue. Help me.

42
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:05,900
I am trapped by Lu Feng.
Brother Qi, can you go and help?

43
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,660
Qi Yue, come here.

44
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,170
Okay, I'm coming.

45
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,270
[Qi Yue arrived on time and
limited Huo Yao's movement.]

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,830
[He successfully escorts
Pei Xi back to their tower.]

47
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,430
Brother Yao, come here quickly.

48
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,780
Okay. I'm coming.

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,540
-Go! Nice.
-I can finish them! I got it.

50
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,790
-Xuan, protect me.
-[A one-to-one trade.]

51
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,590
Great.

52
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,110
[Ji Xiang Kong's team is trying
to stop Pei Xi's farm in the early game]

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,800
[so Pei Xi is forced to fight them before
he has finished his build in mid-game.]

54
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,880
[Okay. Let's see how
they will deal with the next fight.]

55
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,250
We will still gank Pei Xi
in the next fight.

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,800
Xuan and Li Ri Nan,
steal their jungle creeps.

57
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,140
-Li Nan, follow me.
-I'm going there now.

58
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,909
Captain.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,790
Qi Yue and Pei Xi
are coming to the mid lane.

60
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,870
Qi Yue is protecting Pei Xi.
We can't kill him.

61
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,030
Don't be a coward. We can do it.

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,490
I'll tank. We can do it.

63
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,050
-I'll hold them. Let's initiate.
-Hide in Jungle. Don't come out.

64
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,060
[I think Ji Xiang Kong's decision
to tank is risky.]

65
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,420
Can you hold them?

66
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,210
I can't do it.

67
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,970
[In this fight, Ji Xiang Kong
and Lu Yao's health are getting low.]

68
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,340
[Lu Feng is still waiting for a chance.]

69
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,560
[What were they trying to do?]

70
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,240
They are going back to heal.
There's no pressure in Mid.

71
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,910
Brother Qi, jungle creeps have respawned.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,860
Let's go and clear the jungle. Go.

73
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,600
Qi Yue and Shen Yue went back to Jungle.
Guys, be careful.

74
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,100
-Okay.
-Okay.

75
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,940
Pei Xi must've thought
we went back to base.

76
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,180
Let's gank Pei Xi again.
We can definitely kill him if we gank him.

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,430
[Ji Xiang Kong initiated the fight
and rooted Pei Xi.]

78
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,020
[Another ability has ruthlessly
struck Pei Xi again.]

79
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,200
[Legends is really
making some unpredictable plays.]

80
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,720
Captain, be careful.
They have three over there.

81
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,420
I will handle them.

82
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,170
We can fight.
Brother Yao, I have the ultimate skill.

83
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,550
I will control him first.

84
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,420
Get ready.

85
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,110
You performed well in the last game.

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
I'm not going to betray my brothers again.

87
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,090
But you've already done it.

88
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:39,790
Don't you want to become a captain?

89
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,090
No.

90
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,850
How about your contract?

91
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,200
Don't you want

92
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,090
to renew your contract with the company?

93
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,920
Zhao Yang, you...

94
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:54,180
You better think it through.

95
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,670
I'll give you one last reminder.

96
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,690
If Ji Xiang Kong stays,

97
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,630
you'll be the one to leave.

98
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,830
I'll make it clear too.

99
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,720
Even if you terminate my contract,

100
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,320
I won't betray my brothers again!

101
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,380
Huo Yao.

102
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,250
There's no rush to give me a reply.

103
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,190
Think about it carefully.

104
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,510
-Hit him. Don't be a coward.
-We can attack.

105
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,150
-I can tank.
-Brother Yao, use your ultimate.

106
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,920
-I can hold them.
-Brother Yao, where's your ultimate?

107
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,740
Brother Yao, use your ultimate!
What are you doing, Brother Yao?

108
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,760
What are you doing, Brother Yao?

109
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,040
They are so bad.

110
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,720
[What is Yao doing?
Why did he miss the ultimate again?]

111
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,340
[The cage didn't trap Pei Xi.
They are in a pinch now.]

112
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,440
What a pity.

113
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,290
They got countered instead?

114
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,380
What is happening?

115
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,110
What is Huo Yao thinking?

116
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,990
Why are you so worried?

117
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:04,300
Didn't you say this match
will determine Ji Xiang Kong's future?

118
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,620
-So what?
-I hope he can win as his friend.

119
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,650
No way, Qiu Ying.

120
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,960
Are you worried about him?

121
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,650
I'm not talking with you.
Just watch the competition.

122
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,340
[Lin Yi Xuan arrives
and fully heals Ji Xiang Kong.

123
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,180
[However, Shen Yue attacks.
There's a team fight in Mid. VNG counters.]

124
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,900
[Gongxi Chang Qing is not as good
at ganking as Jin Can.]

125
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,470
[It's also bad in
a "two versus" three situation.]

126
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,470
It's too late! Brother Kong, go!
I'll protect you, go!

127
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,330
I can't leave. Retreat!
We'll lose. We can't fight.

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,020
They were playing so smoothly.

129
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,320
How did it happen?

130
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,180
Huo Yao missed his ultimate

131
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,890
so they can't finish off Pei Xi.

132
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,750
What a pity.

133
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,630
[Let's look at Qi Yue and Pei Xi.]

134
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,280
[They used their abilities
to finish off Ji Xiang Kong!]

135
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,180
[I think that's quite unfortunate.]

136
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:59,180
[Ji Xiang Kong can't dodge
the ultimate combo of Qi Yue and Pei Xi.]

137
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,420
Don't be nervous.

138
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,520
I can't ensure the reliability of my news.
It might be false. Right?

139
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,800
-I have no skills. They're in cooldown.
-Can you hold them off for a while?

140
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,510
They are losing. Push.

141
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,840
-Calm down.
-We got it.

142
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,040
[VNG has pushed to the high ground.]

143
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,630
[The fastest respawn of Legends
is five seconds. It's too late.]

144
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,450
Was your brain stuck, Huo Yao?

145
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:44,150
-What were you doing?
-Xuan, calm down.

146
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,170
[Congratulations to VNG for becoming
the Champion of iConquer's Beta Series.]

147
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,610
[Congratulations VNG.]

148
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,490
Great.

149
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
Why are you clapping?

150
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,840
It was great.

151
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,040
-Don't take it seriously.
-Okay!

152
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,110
Betrayer, you did it on purpose!

153
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,900
Betrayer!

154
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,640
That was a mistake.

155
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,120
Mistake?

156
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:18,690
You were sceptical during the first match
and missed your ultimate in the second.

157
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,090
How dare you call yourself
a professional player?

158
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,120
Do you know Brother Kong will leave soon?

159
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,060
Lin Yi Xuan!

160
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,990
You guys, leave first.

161
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,620
Huo Yao, stay here.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,390
I'm not leaving.

163
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,430
I want to hear
how Yao betrayed my brothers.

164
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:51,730
Speak!

165
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,880
Lin Yi Xuan. Go out first.

166
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,990
No.

167
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,840
Go out!

168
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,720
Xuan. Let's go.

169
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,010
Go.

170
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,240
Yao, give me a reasonable explanation.

171
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,420
I hope I guessed wrong.

172
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,550
I know.

173
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,200
It's too late

174
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:44,120
no matter what I say now.

175
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,740
Zhao Yang came to find me.

176
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
If I don't do as he instructed,

177
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,870
he won't renew my contract.

178
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
That is why you've neglected
your brothers on the battlefield?

179
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,350
No, Coach!

180
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,400
I admit that I was at fault
during the first match.

181
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,730
I really want to stay here, Coach.

182
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,410
Coach.

183
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,480
I am 28 years old.

184
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,560
I've been in this industry for ten years.

185
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,640
I want to win the championship.

186
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,340
If I lose the contract with
Team Legends at the moment,

187
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,180
my professional career will end here.

188
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:46,830
In the second match, I did make a mistake.

189
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,960
Before the match,

190
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,080
I've already vowed
not to betray my teammates again.

191
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:58,290
I'd rather leave alone
than betray my brothers.

192
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:12,670
Xiang Kong, it's all my fault.

193
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,300
I know

194
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,290
it'll always be my fault

195
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:27,280
no matter how I explain to Brother Yao.

196
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,730
I disappoint you.

197
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,420
Don't worry. I'll explain
to the board of directors now.

198
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,780
It's all my fault.

199
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,570
You have nothing to do with it.

200
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,740
What will you say?

201
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,120
You'll tell them Zhao Yang blackmailed you

202
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:55,510
and you lost the game purposely?

203
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,020
We believe you

204
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,200
but will they believe you?

205
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,090
If you tell them,

206
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,610
will you still stay in the team?

207
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,970
Xiang Kong.

208
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,140
The contract is made
according to your requirements.

209
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,040
Please have a look.

210
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,200
When can I go to Team Legends?

211
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,020
You can go anytime as long as you
settle things with Team VNG.

212
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,930
Great.

213
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,810
I'll take a photo and post it on Weibo
to commemorate this important moment.

214
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,170
Come on!

215
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,470
[Are you all right?]

216
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,190
Director Jin.

217
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,770
I'm sure you've seen the data yesterday.
I'm the one responsible for

218
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:10,230
Huo Yao's mistake.

219
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,470
He told me he was not feeling well
before the competition.

220
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,840
But I don't remember it.

221
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,730
You don't need to make an excuse for him

222
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,720
I know what happened in this competition.

223
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,270
To a certain extent, Ji Xiang Kong's
tactical error caused Huo Yao's mistake!

224
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,460
Director Jin.

225
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:33,680
Even if you can't believe me,
you should believe the choice of Gu Fang.

226
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:38,220
In order to keep Ji Xiang Kong, he would
rather sign an unfair retirement contract.

227
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,550
Unfair?

228
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,380
This is business.

229
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,060
Is it unfair?

230
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,300
Coach Luo.

231
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,020
Ji Xiang Kong made a promise
to the board of directors.

232
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:55,840
Director Zhao

233
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,780
I think we should talk when we're free.

234
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,950
Who? Me?

235
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,350
About what?

236
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,130
It is not Ji Xiang Kong's responsibility
in this competition.

237
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,990
Don't you know that?

238
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,530
Why would I know anything?

239
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,970
This is so interesting.

240
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,010
The autumn season is coming soon.

241
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:22,110
I don't know who can be
the team captain besides Ji Xiang Kong.

242
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,790
Director Jin. Please consider it.

243
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,340
Director Jin, this is Pei Xi's contract.
His transfer can be done by next week.

244
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,750
Have a look at it first.

245
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,020
This game

246
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,780
has already shown you

247
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,520
who's capable and who's not.

248
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,840
Brother Xuan.

249
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,810
Handsome Ji hasn't picked up?

250
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,090
Do you think something happened to him?

251
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,360
Brother Xuan, don't...

252
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,280
Huo Yao.

253
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:13,599
Come with me and give an explanation
to the board of directors now. Understand?

254
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:14,619
Brother Xuan.

255
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,180
Our coach is speaking with Director Jin.

256
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:18,650
What if he's settled it?

257
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,500
Don't you know how long he's been there?
If it's settled, he would've returned.

258
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:25,160
You can't speak here.
Don't butt in. Understand?

259
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,280
-Huo Yao.
-Xuan.

260
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,210
You are not a child anymore.

261
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,810
If you are a man, you shouldn't
let Handsome Ji bear the responsibility.

262
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,350
-Xuan.
-Huo Yao.

263
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,960
He doesn't want this too.

264
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,890
Xuan. He is our brother.

265
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,940
Did he see me as his brother?

266
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,020
Did he see Handsome Ji as his brother?
I'm asking you. Get lost!

267
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,980
How could you treat Brother Yao like this?

268
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,810
How did he treat me?

269
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,300
How did he treat Handsome Ji?

270
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,740
Let me tell you.

271
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,000
If you are siding with him,

272
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,020
Then, we will not longer be brother in
the rest of my life. Did you hear that?

273
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,760
I don't want Handsome Ji to leave too!

274
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,690
But I also don't want
Brother Yao to leave as well.

275
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,410
I...

276
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:13,750
I don't want
to lose you as my brother too.

277
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,580
Didn't we promise
to become the champion next year?

278
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,500
Brother Xuan.

279
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,170
Brother Yao.

280
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,710
Handsome Ji can't leave.

281
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,510
This is a great contract.

282
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,020
If Pei Xi comes,

283
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,880
we can look forward

284
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:19,730
to next season's championship.

285
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,170
It's all thanks to
the support of Director Jin.

286
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:23,860
However,

287
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,330
with Pei Xi coming here
and becoming the captain immediately,

288
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,970
I'm afraid someone will be jealous of
his capabilities and boycott him.

289
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,080
Director Zhao, what do you mean?

290
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,200
Nothing.

291
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,640
If a company wants to expand,

292
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,800
it needs to reward and punish
those who are responsible.

293
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:49,050
Shouldn't someone be
taking responsibility?

294
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,350
Everyone knows the responsibility
lies in Huo Yao in the competition's loss.

295
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,160
-It is unrelated to Ji Xiang Kong at all.
-Coach Luo.

296
00:19:56,270 --> 00:20:00,850
As the coach, don't you know Huo Yao's
performance has always been consistent?

297
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,070
Will Huo Yao make a mistake
if it wasn't for Ji Xiang Kong's tactic?

298
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,990
You...

299
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,470
What's wrong with me?

300
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:10,110
We can do that.

301
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,470
Get Ji Xiang Kong and Huo Yao
to talk face to face.

302
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,740
Whoever is wrong will leave the team.

303
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,750
Is that fair?

304
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:24,820
-You want them to talk face to face?
-Yes.

305
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:27,190
Are you trying to break up the team?

306
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,570
Director Jin.

307
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,990
Coach Luo is bad.

308
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:35,150
He can't accept anything.

309
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,980
I don't know what else we can do.

310
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,540
I'll take responsibility.

311
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,360
I made a tactical error in that match.
It's unrelated to the others.

312
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,750
Director Jin. Coach Luo.

313
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,350
Thank you for nurturing me.

314
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,280
I will never break my promise.

315
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,200
Xiang Kong. You don't have to do that.

316
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,700
It's not on you.

317
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,210
Director Jin.

318
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,710
-They lose because of...
-Coach, a loss is a loss.

319
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,240
I will leave according to the bet.

320
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,560
Since he already made his decision,

321
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,110
Director Jin,

322
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,730
let's prepare his termination contract
as soon as possible.

323
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,700
Brother Yao, stay here.

324
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,080
Xiang Kong.

325
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,470
It is all my fault.

326
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,440
I should be the one to leave.

327
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,030
You should know
this is personal between me and Zhao Yang.

328
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:13,370
If I don't leave today, he will
still send me packing in the future.

329
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,410
How about Lin Yi Xuan then?

330
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,140
Won't you be worried?

331
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,760
-Xiang Kong.
-Brother Yao.

332
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,970
Don't say anything.

333
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,780
Stay.

334
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,530
Help me and Gu Fang achieve our dreams.

335
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:31,690
No matter where I go,

336
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,520
we'll forever be brothers.

337
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:19,250
Coach.

338
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,460
Coach, how was it?

339
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,390
Yi Xuan.

340
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,250
We lost the game.

341
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,670
Someone needs to take responsibility.

342
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,160
Is Brother Yao really leaving?

343
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,230
It's not Huo Yao.

344
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,550
It's Xiang Kong.

345
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,510
Lin Yi Xuan.

346
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,740
Lin Yi Xuan, are you crazy?
-You're the one who's crazy!

347
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,790
You said you will be here
until I win the World Championship.

348
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,530
You are leaving alone now.

349
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:08,860
You are a liar!

350
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,170
Handsome Ji, if you leave,
how will we play in the future?

351
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,250
Come with me and explain to Director Jin.

352
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,120
I won't allow you to leave!

353
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,540
I have nothing to say.

354
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,980
You're leaving

355
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,000
without giving any reasons.

356
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:29,660
All of us are waiting for you.

357
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,620
You left without any explanation.

358
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,220
Ji Xiang Kong.

359
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,780
You said you're my brother.
But did you treat me like one?

360
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:42,420
You are a liar!

361
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,040
Lin Yi Xuan.

362
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,320
Let go.

363
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,660
No.

364
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,390
Take him away.

365
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,220
Don't touch me.

366
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:56,900
Let go.

367
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,240
No.

368
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,300
-Let go!
-No!

369
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,410
Lin Yi Xuan.

370
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,560
Let go!

371
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,990
Liar!

372
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,430
You are a liar!

373
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,830
Captain.

374
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,640
How is it over there?

375
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,390
Stop sending pictures to me.

376
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,640
When I see you showing off
your leisurely life, I'm really...

377
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,970
I know you've been terminated.
Don't act like there's nothing wrong.

378
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,800
I've booked a flight ticket for tomorrow

379
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,520
I will contact other teams
for you when I return.

380
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,180
Captain.

381
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:47,280
I was a former Legends team member.
Are you worried that I'll be teamless?

382
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:48,570
Don't worry.

383
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,590
The new season will start in one month.

384
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,820
You have to contact the other teams.

385
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,190
Sorry, Captain.

386
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,760
I can't keep my promise.

387
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,210
What happened?

388
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,700
Don't worry, Captain.

389
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,120
I have to hang up.

390
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,060
You came here just to use your phone?

391
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,580
Why did you ask me to come here then?

392
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,290
Are you serious?

393
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,090
You won't even tell me
about your transfer to another team?

394
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,760
I've told you before.

395
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,990
When?

396
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,120
Last week.

397
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,570
What are you doing?

398
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,910
You want to say something?

399
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:46,400
Tell me.

400
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,110
Initiate a team fight!

401
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,990
What do you think about Team Legends?

402
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:52,000
It's good.

403
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,430
He's dying. Give chase! Hold him back!

404
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:58,000
-I'll sign the contract then.
-The towers are stacked.

405
00:28:58,490 --> 00:28:59,630
Great!

406
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,500
Nice!

407
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,650
That was telling me?

408
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,810
It's not my fault that you didn't hear it.

409
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:15,260
You blew me away.

410
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,440
Why do I have such a weird cousin?

411
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
When did VNG disappoint you?

412
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,260
Shu Wen nurtured you for three years.

413
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,960
How can I face Shu Wen now that
you're leaving as you wish?

414
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,630
Her goal is to win the World Championship.

415
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,690
However, it is impossible for VNG
with their situation at the moment.

416
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,120
Besides, it is so boring to stay at VNG.

417
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,880
Team Legends is interesting?

418
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,770
Yes.

419
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,250
-Because they have Ji Xiang Kong.
-You are friends with him now?

420
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,390
Why are you laughing?

421
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:56,400
You are going there
to compete with Ji Xiang Kong

422
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:59,940
but Ji Xiang Kong vacated
the position of team captain for you.

423
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:02,130
He left after terminating his contract.

424
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,640
Are you still going to Team Legends now?

425
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,900
What do you mean?

426
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,840
He left?

427
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,560
Ask him if you don't believe me.

428
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:13,960
You're just going to ask him?

429
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,550
Don't leave. I'm not done yet!

430
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,830
Pei Xi.

431
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,700
Can you teach me how to play Creator?

432
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,640
I'm busy.

433
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,990
Pei Xi.

434
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,730
Shouldn't you buy us a meal
to celebrate such a happy occasion?

435
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,850
You ousted Ji Xiang Kong to
become Team Legends' captain. Amazing.

436
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,140
Move.

437
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:39,620
-Pei Xi.
-Pei Xi.

438
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,910
-Did you say Pei Xi ousted Ji Xiang Kong?
-Yes.

439
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,160
Pei Xi is now the captain of Team Legends.
Don't you know that? It's gone viral.

440
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,540
I'm telling you.

441
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,460
I knew Pei Xi is the one
to succeed Gu Fang.

442
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,970
Ji Xiang Kong should've retired earlier.

443
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:18,540
Ji Xiang Kong.

444
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,260
Why did you leave Team Legends?

445
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,220
It's not related to you.

446
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,980
I just signed for Team Legends.

447
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,800
I know.

448
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:34,780
You are the new captain of Team Legends.

449
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,370
My brothers are great.

450
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,590
I hope you can lead them to glory.

451
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,260
I can play in any team.

452
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,190
I don't care who my opponent is.

453
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:48,690
No matter how good you are,
iConquer is a team competition.

454
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:53,420
You should lead the team
instead of fighting solo.

455
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,750
Don't forget.

456
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,170
You are the captain.

457
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,890
You are the backbone of the whole team.

458
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,020
This is not my purpose
for joining Team Legends.

459
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,610
I don't need teammates who rely on me.

460
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,280
They are only a liability to me.

461
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,290
Ji Xiang Kong.

462
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,740
Do you know you will
affect everyone's career?

463
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,300
We are professional players.

464
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,800
Please be professional.

465
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,950
Be responsible to my brothers.

466
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,510
Otherwise, I will despise you.

467
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,830
Ji Xiang Kong.

468
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,920
I'll see you in the competition.

469
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,550
Fat Cat.

470
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,730
Fat Cat.

471
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,310
It's half-past seven now.
I am so hungry, let's eat.

472
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,480
-Sure. Let's go.
-Get Qiu Ying as well.

473
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:51,000
-Qiu Ying!
-Qiu Ying!

474
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,720
She's not eating.
Let's go ourselves. I'm starving.

475
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,510
Isn't that too obvious?

476
00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,750
I know a delicious milk tea store.
It has a strawberry flavour too.

477
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,070
I'll buy you one when you're free.

478
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,210
Okay.

479
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,760
Hello, your strawberry milk tea.

480
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,989
-You're here?
-You still remember.

481
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,480
At least you have some conscience in you.

482
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,699
Are you fine?

483
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,520
I'm worried about you.

484
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,850
I was depressed

485
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:46,929
but I'm fine after drinking this milk tea.

486
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:52,080
I can buy it for you every day
if you're happy.

487
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,580
Every day?

488
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:55,800
-You're taking care of me?
-Sure.

489
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,200
If you don't mind
eating instant noodles every day.

490
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,420
Forget it then.

491
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,530
Oh.

492
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,140
You are already in the top 100
in your regional server, right?

493
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,250
Not yet.

494
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,120
I am too clumsy.

495
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,780
You understand yourself quite well.

496
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,080
I'm sure it's easy to play in
regional servers for professional players.

497
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,180
But it's still difficult
for normal players like us.

498
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,270
All right.

499
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,080
I'll guide you
as thanks for this milk tea.

500
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,620
Really?

501
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,480
I'll bring you to Dream Traveler.

502
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,060
They have the best rig.

503
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,100
Forget it.

504
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:47,390
I'm still a rookie.
I don't care about all these.

505
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,260
Why?

506
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,870
Does someone like you in Dream Traveler?
You're scared to cause a misunderstanding?

507
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,100
No. No one likes me.

508
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,980
That means
you feel embarrassed to go with me.

509
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:02,460
No, that's not it.

510
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,680
Let's go then.

511
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,480
All right.

512
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,340
He still has time for love
after being expelled by Team Legends?

513
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,620
I heard Gu fang insisted on
making him captain before he retired

514
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:22,840
I don't know what he saw in him.

515
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,050
Oh, have you been to the VIP room?

516
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,380
No.

517
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,240
I heard it is only open
for professional players.

518
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,700
Today I will let you experience
the treatment of professional players.

519
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,420
-Really?
-Let's go.

520
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,020
How is this an internet cafe?

521
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:57,090
Summer always invites professional players
to have offline matches here.

522
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:03,540
Come. Show me your skills.

523
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,740
Won't you teach me first?

524
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,420
Playing is the best way to learn.

525
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:17,090
Wait. Let me check your data first.

526
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:27,200
Not bad.

527
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,590
It's quite good.
