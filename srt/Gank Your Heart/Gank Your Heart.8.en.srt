[Episode 8]

4
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,380
You want me to switch to Legends?

5
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,610
Your contract with VNG
is coming to an end.

6
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:51,380
If you come to Legends, I'll provide you
with all the best resources.

7
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,850
I'll make you the king of the iConquer,
who's better than Gu Fang.

8
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,400
I come with only the best of intentions.

9
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,850
If you're willing to come,
I'll accept all your demands.

10
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,410
Who will be the captain?

11
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,610
Is it Ji Xiang Kong?

12
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,950
So you're saying that we'll
surely be able to sign Pei Xi up?

13
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,380
Of course, I handled this personally.

14
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,000
And with your power
and prestige in the field,

15
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,329
it shouldn't be an issue.

16
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,770
Indeed.

17
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,660
The star players who can replace
Gu Fang are very limited.

18
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:29,780
True.

19
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,610
Get on with it then.

20
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,200
There's one problem.

21
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,970
He wants to be the captain.

22
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,300
It's the only condition
for us to sign him up.

23
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,060
Chairman Jin, in my opinion,

24
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,720
Pei Xi's ability, reputation
and future prospect

25
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,390
are 100 times better than Ji Xiang Kong.

26
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,270
As you just said,
Pei Xi might be the next Gu Fang.

27
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:03,900
You may not know about this.

28
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,020
The news of Ji Xiang Kong
being the acting captain

29
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,030
has drawn widespread public scorn.

30
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,780
They have zero faith in us now.

31
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,660
But we've already made a promise
to Gu Fang about this.

32
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,600
We'll make Ji Xiang Kong the real captain,

33
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,100
provided that he wins
the closed beta test.

34
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,340
We can't go back on our words, can we?

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,500
Chairman Jin, Gu Fang is gone.

36
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,010
We can't care about
his feelings all the time

37
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,320
and jeopardize the development
and future of our team, can we?

38
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,260
Instead of having Pei Xi
as our strong competitor,

39
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,750
we might as well turn him into our man.

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,670
What do you say?

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,850
Okay.

42
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,570
Sure, Manager Zhao.
Just leave it to me.

43
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,450
-Goodbye.
-Sister Xin.

44
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,830
Here's your coffee.

45
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,710
Thanks!

46
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,430
Just the right temperature.

47
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,970
It also tastes good!

48
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,860
If you like it, I can buy you
coffee every day.

49
00:04:16,029 --> 00:04:19,329
I just got a call from a friend
in the advertising company.

50
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,170
They need a model to
do a lingerie advertisement.

51
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,490
I remember you've done
commercials before, right?

52
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,670
I think you're quite
the right fit for the job.

53
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,160
Lingerie advertisement?

54
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,080
They pay this much.

55
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,020
Three thousand yuan?

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,100
Would I have introduced it
to you if it's only 3000 yuan?

57
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,650
All the hosts in the company want
to transfer to the iConquer section.

58
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,930
But it's not like you don't know
how Qiu Ying is doing now.

59
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:51,180
The ranking of her show has plummeted.

60
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,990
This is a rough ride.

61
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,310
Your situation will only
be worse than hers, right?

62
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:01,020
And I heard that you won't get
any bonus until next year.

63
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,480
I do need money now.

64
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,530
No matter how close a friend is,

65
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,250
if she can't help you when you're in need,

66
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,930
then she's not your real friend.

67
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,240
Yan Yan, I'm a very
straightforward person.

68
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:25,380
Those who don't know me well
think I have a bad temper.

69
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:28,650
But actually, I always do what's right.

70
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,850
Well, I'm your Sister Xin, aren't I?

71
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,070
Just tell me whenever you're in trouble,
I'll definitely help you.

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,810
Thanks, Sister Xin!

73
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,740
Not a problem. Don't mention it.

74
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,140
Let's go!

75
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,660
It's almost impossible to
complete this series of moves

76
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,570
using Creator if you
don't have a high APM.

77
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,730
It seems like Summer's cousin
is even better than Summer.

78
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,360
I am Pei Xi.

79
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,770
What do you say?

80
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,390
Are you interested in joining VNG?

81
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,100
Why should I join you?

82
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:45,600
Because you need a team
that's strong enough

83
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,480
to help you win the world championship.

84
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,830
If you're doing this
because of Summer, I'll pass.

85
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,080
I always let my work speak for itself.

86
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,950
I'll never risk VNG
simply for the sake of Summer.

87
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,070
[A solo can never
play better than a team.]

88
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,920
[This game is all about
teamwork after all.]

89
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,390
[This is why VNG missed
the championship in all these years.]

90
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,500
It's late at night.

91
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,270
Who is it?

92
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,830
It's me. Yan Yan.

93
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,180
Coming.

94
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,250
Yan Yan? Come in.

95
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,750
Come in.

96
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,530
Why are you here so late?

97
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,450
What's wrong?

98
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,920
No need to change shoes.

99
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,630
I had a fight with my boyfriend.

100
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,400
I have nowhere to go
and so I came to you.

101
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,550
He bullied you?

102
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,630
Why didn't you call me?
I could've picked you up.

103
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,190
It's okay, just stay with me tonight.

104
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,450
Take a seat.

105
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,110
Don't you feel cold wearing so little?

106
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,070
Are you hungry?

107
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,159
You haven't eaten, right?

108
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,630
Do you want me to cook something for you?

109
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,640
Alright, just sit here.

110
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,040
I will cook noodles for you.

111
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,060
[Qiu Ying, I'm sorry.]

112
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,080
[I have no choice.]

113
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,080
Yan Yan, can you eat spicy food?

114
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,220
Sure.

115
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,050
I knew it.

116
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,510
I'll add more chili then.

117
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,150
Okay.

118
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:20,670
Yi Yi, you've been working with us
for quite a while.

119
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,760
But your heart is not calm enough.

120
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,700
Director, I really want
to be on the field.

121
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,660
I told you,

122
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,530
all you need to do is to

123
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:36,130
gather information from our peers
and find a unique perspective.

124
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,920
You need skills to do that.

125
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,440
But…

126
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,350
Besides, how can a small magazine like us
possibly get to report some breaking news?

127
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,840
Oh my God!

128
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,100
Director, I've got some big news!

129
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,980
Pei Xi's main champion, Creator,
can do up to three pentakill in one game.

130
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,570
I tried this champion before.

131
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,080
It has high burst damage.

132
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,080
It can also release sunstrike
on the entire map

133
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,710
and kill low HP heroes anywhere, anytime.

134
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,720
Such a powerful champion.

135
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,500
Maybe I should practice
with this champion too.

136
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,910
Forget about it.

137
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,340
You are not Pei Xi.

138
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,340
I think Pei Xi and I are tied.

139
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,170
None of us can beat him
in terms of personal strength.

140
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,150
That's right.

141
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,950
So guys, if we were to run into him,

142
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,280
do not think of anything, just run.

143
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,450
The best Mid.

144
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:37,210
I don't believe there's
no way we can get him.

145
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,310
There is a way.

146
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,500
As the best Mid, a team with him
is truly hard to beat.

147
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,420
But they have a weakness.

148
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,440
You know what that is?

149
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:48,550
Brother Kong!

150
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
You know the answer?

151
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,850
I don't know. Come and see this!

152
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Come!

153
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,560
The second half of this video is fake!

154
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,210
Who made this?

155
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,250
What is this?

156
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,750
It's me, isn't it?

157
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,890
I'm standing next to you.

158
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,830
You weren't there.
That's not what happened.

159
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,260
At that time, we…

160
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,020
Stop laughing!

161
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,640
The closed beta test is about to start.

162
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,110
Yet, they chose to upload
this video at a time like this.

163
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,310
I'm afraid there's more to it.

164
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,530
You've got a point.

165
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,450
Hello, Yi Yi.

166
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,440
Girl, did you just wake up?
Do you know what time it is?

167
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,650
I stayed up all night yesterday.

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,330
I bet you don't know
what's happening right now.

169
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,660
What happened?

170
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:56,950
Go search for Ji Xiang Kong
on the Internet. Hurry up!

171
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,250
The full version of the video?

172
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,320
Who uploaded this?

173
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,520
The netizens are saying that it was you.

174
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,280
How is that possible?

175
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,220
I was in the parking lot of the hotel.

176
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,560
This is totally different from what I saw.

177
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:29,480
Different?

178
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,750
What do you mean?

179
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,930
I didn't see Ji Xiang Kong beating anyone.

180
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,240
How could this video…

181
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,620
[Are you sure?]

182
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,260
Try to remember it.

183
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,620
I am pretty sure.

184
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,570
Ji Xiang Kong just
grabbed Jeffrey by his collar.

185
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,970
If that's the case, it seems like
someone is trying to frame Ji Xiang Kong.

186
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,240
[Served him right!]

187
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,760
[That liar picked on you so hard before!]

188
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,800
[It's nobody's fault but his own!]

189
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:58,050
[Evil people are trapped
in their own sins!]

190
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,450
What's going on?

191
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,200
These netizens are unbelievable.

192
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:09,610
See this one.

193
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,480
Qiu Ying, get out of esports community!

194
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Don't go around and harm people again!

195
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,350
God!

196
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,070
It's so mean!

197
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,680
What about this?

198
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,440
This is so mean.

199
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:24,090
As expected, one shot is all you need.
It's a remarkable plan!

200
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,900
It seems like both of us
have reached our minor goals.

201
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,230
It's because I'm working so well
with a real beauty.

202
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,680
But then again,

203
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,700
the netizens believe that Qiu Ying
is the one to blame right now.

204
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,320
Manager Zhao, don't you think
this lesson is not heavy enough for her?

205
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,230
Great minds think alike.

206
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,540
I've prepared a demand letter for her.

207
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,200
Director Zhao, that's impressive!

208
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,320
Well, if it's alright for you,

209
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,780
should we have a meal together later?

210
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,880
Right, we must celebrate this.

211
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,650
I know, right?

212
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,130
But then, Manager Zhao,
aren't you supposed to

213
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,350
go back to the office and
take charge of the situation?

214
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,670
Should I?

215
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,920
-Right.
-Of course.

216
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,210
Come, I'll give you a ride.

217
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,370
Don't be shy. Let's go.

218
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,250
Manager Zhao,
just tell us what's going on.

219
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,780
Chairman Jin.

220
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,440
What's the matter?

221
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:57,210
Well, here's the thing.

222
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:01,450
The source of that video has been found.

223
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,750
It's the female host from You Xing Video,

224
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,230
the person who live-streamed
the conflict between

225
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,230
Ji Xiang Kong and Jeffrey, Qiu Ying.

226
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,020
Manager Zhao, is this just a wild guess
or you've got real evidence?

227
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:20,320
Chairman Jin, take a look at this.

228
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,710
The IP addresses of this video

229
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,970
and Qiu Ying's live stream

230
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,010
are from the same place.

231
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:33,870
I've already confirmed it.
It's the same address.

232
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,120
What does she want?

233
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,230
What's the matter with her?

234
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,040
Does she have a grudge against us?

235
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,020
I've been swamped with phone calls today.

236
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,930
Everyone was asking about

237
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:01,160
the relationship between
Handsome Ji and Qiu Ying.

238
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:04,560
Also, words are swirling around

239
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,599
that Handsome Ji

240
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,849
has played with the girl's feelings.

241
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,270
Stop it!

242
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,300
I don't believe it either!

243
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,810
I remember you and that Qiu…

244
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,500
-What's her name?
-Qiu Ying.

245
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:20,130
Right.

246
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,569
Didn't you guys play
a duo queue together before?

247
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,960
Yes, I messed her up real bad.

248
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,069
That would explain it.

249
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:32,260
Of course she'd want to
get back to you for tricking her.

250
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,380
Maybe.

251
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,850
Well then, we'll hold a
press conference immediately.

252
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,680
You have to apologize for the conflict.

253
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,500
Also, you need to clarify
your relationship with Qiu Ying.

254
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,330
Xiang Kong, you must protect your image
to prevent rumors from spreading.

255
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,330
Do you understand?

256
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,900
Everyone was there at that time.

257
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,620
Why should I apologize
for something I didn't do?

258
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,360
Besides, the video is obviously fake.

259
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,780
Manager Zhao, if you've got
some real evidence,

260
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,270
just sue Qiu Ying and
make her prove my innocence.

261
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,300
I agree with Xiang Kong.

262
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,250
This thing should be
resolved by legal means.

263
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,230
Otherwise, we'll only make things worse.

264
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,450
Chairman Jin, I need to
get back to training.

265
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,160
I'll be going now if there's nothing else.

266
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,250
Brother Xuan.

267
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,600
How did it go? Is it Qiu Ying?

268
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:29,740
It's her.

269
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:31,830
I heard the legal department
has sent a demand letter to her.

270
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,310
Yi Xuan, did Handsome Ji
and Qiu Ying really...

271
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,150
I have no idea.

272
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,840
I'm going away for a while.
I know who to ask.

273
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,740
Brother Xuan, a crowd of fans
is waiting at the entrance.

274
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,800
It's fine, I have my ways!

275
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,420
Gosh!

276
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,880
What's happening?
There're so many people here.

277
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,690
Whatever. Let me get some photos first.

278
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:14,360
Maybe I should lure out
that fool, Lin Yi Xuan,

279
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,580
and fish for some inside scoop.

280
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,600
Brilliant!

281
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,950
Lin Yi Xuan.

282
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,880
I...

283
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,870
-Quick! Let's go!
-What are you doing?

284
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,270
Let me go!

285
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:34,620
Are you crazy?

286
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,740
What's wrong with you?

287
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,910
What with that look?

288
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:45,960
Listen, I won't put up with this anymore!

289
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,730
Yes, Brother Kong was indeed at fault

290
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,550
for going away from the keyboard
during the duo queue.

291
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,220
But Qiu Ying's revenge is unacceptable!

292
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,320
Wait a second.

293
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,180
-Why are you yelling?
-Hands off!

294
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,660
-What are you shouting for?
-No fighting.

295
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,850
What revenge?

296
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,770
Qiu Ying didn't do anything!

297
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,230
How dare Ji Xiang Kong
slander Qiu Ying after bullying her!

298
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,810
You tell me.

299
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,070
What revenge? What did she do?

300
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,300
Let me tell you about her revenge!

301
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:13,880
Speak!

302
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:14,720
I'm saying...

303
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,970
Qiu Ying wanted to ride
Brother Kong's coattails, right?

304
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,010
She failed and so she bit back.

305
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:21,030
This is revenge.

306
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,800
Say it again, I dare you!

307
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,130
You hit me again!

308
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,050
-You asked for it today!
-No fighting.

309
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,240
-You dodged it?
-No fighting!

310
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,620
-Take this!
-Ouch!

311
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,310
You dodged!

312
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,630
Take that!

313
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,010
Listen carefully!

314
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,730
Qiu Ying doesn't give a damn
about that liar, Brother Kong's free ride.

315
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,050
She'd never play such
a dirty trick to get her revenge!

316
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,450
She's the kindest girl
I've ever seen in the world.

317
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,190
If you dare slander her again,

318
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,420
I'll...

319
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,600
I'll kill you!

320
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,130
Wait! Stop...

321
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,980
-You!
-What are you going to do?

322
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,350
-You want to
-No!

323
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,770
That's not what I mean. Don't hit me.

324
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,390
Hey, I have evidence, okay?

325
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,760
The IP address of the video is the same as

326
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,400
the address of Qiu Ying's live stream.

327
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,300
What?

328
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,570
Legends' lawyer just left.

329
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,920
Take a look for yourself.

330
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:23,770
The IP of the video is the same as
the IP of your live stream at home.

331
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,880
They've provided irrefutable evidence.

332
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,190
Mr. Liu, that's impossible!

333
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,690
This is definitely a set up.

334
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,460
And even if I were to do that,

335
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,330
I know better than to use my own computer.

336
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,500
But your explanation
can't solve any problem.

337
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:48,520
Mr. Liu, please give me some time.

338
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,070
I'll definitely get to the bottom of this.

339
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,700
Get to the bottom of what?

340
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,790
All the evidence is pointing toward you.

341
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,030
Do you know that it has a very bad
impact on the company's image?

342
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,630
I really have no choice.

343
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,510
Mr. Liu, are you saying that I'm fired?

344
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,220
If we don't solve this matter,

345
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,650
Legends would never
cooperate with us anymore.

346
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,290
We are in transition.

347
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,310
We can't offend
the top team in the country.

348
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:17,510
What would you do if you were in my shoes?

349
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,740
I'm sorry, Qiu Ying.

350
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:24,280
I will ask the finance department to
pay your salary this month.

351
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,300
We'll pay you one month's
extra salary as compensation.

352
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,550
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

353
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,170
I’m sorry to trouble the company.

354
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:03,690
Sister Xin.

355
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,350
Trying to get revenge after a breakup?

356
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,470
She should've taken a look at herself.

357
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:14,940
Did she think she's qualified enough?

358
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,180
I heard that Ji Xiang Kong
isn't a good person either.

359
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,030
Birds of a feather flock together.

360
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,970
Perfect match!

361
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,450
Let's go!

362
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,050
Captain.

363
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,430
Hey, Brother Yao.

364
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,660
Still practicing?

365
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,850
I guess I'm getting old.

366
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm feeling tired after only two hours.

367
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,960
You are the most
hardworking person among us.

368
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,400
We should all learn from you.

369
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,150
Right, how did it go with that matter?

370
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,580
Don't let it affect your performance
in the closed beta test.

371
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,870
I'm sorry for causing trouble
right before the closed beta test.

372
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,600
After Gu Fang's retired,
I'm the oldest member of the team.

373
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,500
You know the golden age of
professional esports players like us

374
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,910
is very limited.

375
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,350
I would've less and less
of a chance to join competitions.

376
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:09,980
Handsome Ji, I'm pinning my last hope
on you to win the championship.

377
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,860
You and that Qiu Ying…

378
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,180
Brother Yao, nothing is
happening between us.

379
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,620
I promise, I won't let
anything affect the competition.

380
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,360
Let me practice with you for a while.

381
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,970
Come on.

382
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,800
The news about Ji Xiang Kong
is all over the place.

383
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,650
These netizens are really mean.

384
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,280
But they are quite right.

385
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,530
Ji Xiang Kong has such bad luck.

386
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,980
What bad luck?

387
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,840
He brought this all on himself!

388
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,900
He deserves it!

389
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,850
The day has eyes, the night has ears.

390
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,030
Look at this, the netizen said

391
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:13,600
you've disgraced the entire
iConquer community in China.

392
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,730
Legends is in a mess now.

393
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,100
This thing is getting
more and more serious.

394
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,880
I guess it's hard to resolve this.

395
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,050
Hard to believe that Ji Xiang Kong
has been outsmarted by a woman.

396
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,120
Isn't that perfect?

397
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,080
The competition is competition in two days.

398
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,550
The worse their situation is, the better.

399
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,890
We can just win in a breeze.

400
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,480
Look at this.

401
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,910
He said he was disabled during the game

402
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,460
and made up for himself
by playing dirty afterwards.

403
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,450
And this one.

404
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,390
I was speechless after watching.

405
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,240
These netizens are unbelievable!

406
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,400
We're interrupting Captain Pei's training.

407
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,300
The training room
isn't a place for gossip.

408
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,830
It's six o'clock. Time to go.

409
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,800
Let's go, I'll treat you guys to a hotpot.

410
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,030
Guys.

411
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,780
We have another training game at nine.

412
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,110
Four protect one.

413
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,550
We're already familiar
with the procedure, captain.

414
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,710
Just play solo during the entire game.
That'll do it.

415
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,150
Thanks, Brother Qi!

416
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,550
It's been a while since we had a hotpot.

417
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,040
Let's go, Lu Sheng!

418
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,880
Captain, we'll be back
before the training game.

419
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,630
Let's go, Tong Wu!

420
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:28,630
Don't disrupt Captain Pei's training!

421
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,730
Have some tea.

422
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:37,900
No!

423
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,200
The video has been
exposed for so many days

424
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,210
and yet the party privy
to the video is still hiding!

425
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,350
We're the biggest sponsor of Legends!

426
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
We've invested so much money.
Who do you think we are?

427
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,100
I know.

428
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,450
President Bai, Xiang Kong
has a training game now.

429
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,600
How can he play training game
at a time like this?

430
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,380
President Bai, well...

431
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,530
We're preparing for the closed beta test.

432
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,400
And Ji Xiang Kong is the acting captain.

433
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,900
Who made him the acting captain?

434
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,300
I want a captain who has
an optimistic and healthy image.

435
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,120
Isn't this Ji Xiang Kong?

436
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,700
Trying to put on airs?

437
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,830
What's your relationship with Qiu Ying?

438
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,310
The netizens are saying that
she did this to you

439
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,490
because you played with her feelings.

440
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,870
President Bai, nothing inappropriate
happened between me and Qiu Ying.

441
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,690
I apologize.

442
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,880
I've caused trouble to everyone
due to my mistakes.

443
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,300
I'm really sorry!

444
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,500
I'm here today because
I want to solve the problem.

445
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:43,810
How are you going to solve this?

446
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,560
I want this matter to
die down as soon as possible!

447
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,640
The video online is clearly fake!

448
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,230
We can ask the person
concerned to clarify this.

449
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,330
I'm afraid Qiu Ying will not…

450
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,260
I'm not talking about Qiu Ying

451
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,320
but Jeffrey.

452
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:00,620
Jeffrey?

453
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,330
Right!

454
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,150
If we explain this ourselves,
people wouldn't believe us.

455
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,850
But if Jeffrey is willing to explain this
in person, it'll put a stop to the rumor.

456
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,840
Yes, you didn't beat him up.

457
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,690
But you did quarrel with him.

458
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,250
We'd already offended him.

459
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,630
How could he possibly
clarify the rumor for us?

460
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:21,280
Am I right?

461
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,520
Jeffrey is proud and arrogant.

462
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,990
If he knows everyone
thought he was bullied by me,

463
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,070
he will come out and deny it.

464
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,300
And he just happens to be
coming to China these two days.

465
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,750
Really?

466
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,130
Isn't that wonderful?

467
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,450
President Bai, you may rest assured.

468
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,200
I'll take the most sincere
apology from our company

469
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,700
to Jeffrey and ask him to clarify for us.

470
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,730
Please calm down. Don't worry.

471
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,680
I'm counting on you.

472
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,970
-It's the least I could do.
-Manager Zhao.

473
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,660
My pleasure.

474
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,600
[Close the door!]

475
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,250
When's Jeffrey arriving?

476
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:15,900
Go figure it out.

477
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,650
I already checked. Tomorrow.

478
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,740
Tomorrow?

479
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:25,130
We didn't know this man would come.

480
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,670
Manager Zhao, do you think Jeffrey
will come out to clarify?

481
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,150
Beats me.

482
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,500
What should we do, Manager Zhao?

483
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,710
Listen to me.

484
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,330
Arrange more training games for them.

485
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,100
If Ji Xiang Kong wants to go to Jeffrey,

486
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,830
do whatever you can to stop him!

487
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,550
Do you hear me?

488
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:51,930
Yes.

489
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,020
Let me get this escalated online first.

490
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,630
And one month later,

491
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,230
this matter wouldn't have died down

492
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,880
even if Jeffrey is willing to clarify it.

493
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,610
Brilliant!

494
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,650
Manager Zhao, try this new tea.

495
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,580
No, it's okay.

496
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,730
It'll be fine, I'm here with you.

497
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
Just wait for Lawyer Chen to get here.

498
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,250
There must be a way to solve this.

499
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,640
Who's that?
Why didn't you check the message?

500
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,040
Xia Ling.

501
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,580
Your little brother?

502
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,720
He's not my brother.

503
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:00,650
Even though you guys are not genetically
related, he's legally your brother.

504
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,400
Check the message.
Maybe he has an urgent matter.

505
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,370
[Sister, I saw the online posts.]

506
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,180
[Are you doing alright?]

507
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,530
[I'm worried about you.]

508
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,260
[Dad is also worried about you.]

509
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,750
See, your brother cares a lot about you.

510
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,310
Right, he cares about me.

511
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:33,530
If it wasn't because of them,
I wouldn't be like this now.
