[Episode 34]

4
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,580
You're leaving?

5
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:52,200
I'm leaving tomorrow.

6
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:56,310
The doctor said
Mi Ya can go home and rest.

7
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,550
Focus on the game.

8
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,390
I promised Mi Ya

9
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,930
if I reach the finals,

10
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,630
I will invite her to watch it live.

11
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,810
I might have to trouble you again.

12
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,020
Did Mi Ya come up with it?

13
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,430
Tony.

14
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,470
Is that you?

15
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,290
I'll take my leave.

16
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,860
Please take care of Mi Ya.

17
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,390
Are you seriously
going to lie to him forever?

18
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,780
You told me to keep it a secret.

19
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Fine, I did.

20
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,580
But did you get what you wanted?

21
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,550
I did.

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,530
Xiang Kong promised

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
he'll always take care of me.

24
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,810
He chose to take care of you now

25
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,100
not because he still loves you.

26
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,710
He pities you!

27
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,120
No he doesn't!

28
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,060
I have nothing left.

29
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:32,050
At least the heavens
returned him to me.

30
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,680
Stop lying to yourself, alright?

31
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,100
If he knows
your eyes have healed,

32
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,430
He won't hesitate to leave you.
Do you understand?

33
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,640
No, he won't!

34
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,060
Xiang Kong will not leave me,

35
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,140
You cannot forget Ji Xiang Kong.

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,180
I can understand.

37
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,150
You want to pursue love.

38
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,790
I won't never interfere.

39
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,329
But do you know what you're doing now?

40
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,829
It's moral blackmail.

41
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,810
If you don't become the champion,

42
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,410
Don't come back to me.

43
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:19,360
Understand?

44
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,270
Do you know how strong
the North Americans are this year?

45
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,320
How dare you threaten me?

46
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,050
The competition hasn't started yet.

47
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:29,300
Are you feeling disheartened now?

48
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,500
What a coward.

49
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm feeling disheartened? Says who?

50
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,510
I just want you to talk to me gently.

51
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,200
Gentle?

52
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,060
How?

53
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,830
Qiu Ying's a good example.

54
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,820
Look at her.

55
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,460
She might be strong and persistent,

56
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,180
But in front of Brother Kong,

57
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,990
she is gentle and thoughtful.

58
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,820
What's the use of being gentle?

59
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,830
Tell me.

60
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,160
Qiu Ying is gentle,

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,400
but in the end,

62
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,160
she left after being
defeated by the ex-girlfriend.

63
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,450
I wonder

64
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,550
if you're that generous
after watching too many dramas.

65
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,450
They didn't break up either.

66
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,730
Anyway, Brother Kong feels sad, too.

67
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,310
He's sad?

68
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,960
I don't see it.

69
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,990
How sad is he?

70
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,620
He goes to the hospital
diligently every day.

71
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,760
I think Ji Xiang Kong enjoys doing that.

72
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,580
Qiu Ying was right.

73
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,340
Men are scums.

74
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,450
What are you talking about?

75
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,280
What do you mean by men are scums?

76
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,850
Right.

77
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,800
You are nothing.

78
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,909
Yes!

79
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,150
Lin Yi Xuan.

80
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,909
You're a fool!

81
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:49,790
Lu Yi Yi.

82
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,090
You are so prejudiced against men.

83
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,659
Did a scum cheat on you?

84
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,780
You're the one
who got cheated on by a scum.

85
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,930
Shut up!

86
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,330
[Was I right?]

87
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,100
Lin Yi Xuan.

88
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,680
I can drink more than you.

89
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:17,820
Yes!

90
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,230
Lu Yi Yi can drink more than me.

91
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,840
That was satisfying.

92
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,930
I'm happy. Very happy.

93
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,420
Well, Qiu Ying said

94
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,810
you never had a boyfriend.

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,420
Is that true?

96
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,980
Why? Are you looking down on me?

97
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,909
No.

98
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,130
Is being single a sin?

99
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,370
I dare not look down on you.

100
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,730
I've never had a girlfriend.

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,490
We're both the same.

102
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,720
Poor us.

103
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,620
No, I...

104
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,130
I have a crush on someone.

105
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,940
But I dare not say it out loud.

106
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,200
Why not?

107
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,470
I don't think I'm good enough for her.

108
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,460
Of course you're good enough for her.

109
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,850
I'm from the countryside.

110
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,280
I didn't go to college.

111
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,590
I...

112
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,460
She's better than me in everything,

113
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,250
Then bury your feelings deep down.

114
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,690
Don't ever talk about it.

115
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,380
But I want to say it out loud.

116
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,520
Don't!

117
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,380
The moment you say it out loud,

118
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,790
she'll disappear.

119
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,820
She'll block your phone number,

120
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,050
QQ number, Weibo, and WeChat.

121
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,820
She'll disappear without a trace.

122
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,860
Disappear?

123
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,810
It has been three years.

124
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,100
I've been looking for him for three years.

125
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,950
I just wanted to ask him,

126
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,060
If he doesn't like me,

127
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,490
why did he kiss me?

128
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,240
After kissing me,

129
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,800
why did he disappear?

130
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,820
Why did he disappear?

131
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,380
Why?

132
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,600
He kissed you?

133
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:37,960
Yes.

134
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,990
That was my first kiss.

135
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,260
He kissed me and disappeared.

136
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,050
What a scum.

137
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,500
Yes!

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,950
He is a scum. Scum!

139
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,390
I'm not like them.

140
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,110
If I kiss you,

141
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,410
I'll definitely stay.

142
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,360
I don't believe that.

143
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,630
Men are all the same.

144
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,700
You're all liars.

145
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,110
I won't believe you.

146
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,610
I don't believe you.

147
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,780
You don't believe me?

148
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,550
I don't believe you!

149
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,320
Lu Yi Yi, I'll ask you again.

150
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,560
You don't believe me?

151
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,130
I told you, I don't believe...

152
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,560
Lu Yi Yi.

153
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,830
Lu Yi Yi!

154
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,450
No.

155
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,060
[Hello, the number you've dialed
is temporarily unavailable.]

156
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,400
Why won't she pick up?

157
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,690
Yi Yi.

158
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,610
I've called you many times.

159
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,150
Why won't you pick up?

160
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,740
When you hear this,
please call me back, alright?

161
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,180
She blocked my WeChat account.

162
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,760
She also blocked me on Weibo?

163
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,030
I kissed you once.

164
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,370
Are you seriously blacklisting me?

165
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,230
Are you still asleep?

166
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,190
Talking in your sleep?

167
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,470
I woke up early.

168
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,490
Did you just say
you kissed someone? Who was it?

169
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,100
It can't be Sister Yi Yi.

170
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,150
Yes.

171
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,740
I like her.

172
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,860
I kissed her
and wanted to confess to her.

173
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,900
But she blocked my phone number,
QQ, Weibo, and WeChat.

174
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,040
She disappeared.

175
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,620
Xuan, you're alive.

176
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,850
You should feel lucky.

177
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,480
Let's go.

178
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:52,960
Let's go.

179
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,250
Come on.

180
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,370
[How have you been lately?]

181
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,860
[We are about to depart.]

182
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,680
[See you at the hotel later.]

183
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,890
If I kiss you,

184
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,020
I'll definitely stay.

185
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,600
I don't believe...

186
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,690
Hello?

187
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,280
Yes. He told me before. I know.

188
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,440
Yi Yi, the information you asked for.

189
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,020
Wait a minute, Liu.

190
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:37,600
Can I ask you a question?

191
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,370
If a person...

192
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,010
If he blacklisted you,

193
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,980
will he call you again?

194
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,700
Blacklisted you?

195
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,450
You've blacklisted me.
How could I call you?

196
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,780
-Brother Xuan.
-Go away.

197
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,040
Lu Yi Yi, how could you?

198
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,420
I told you I wouldn't disappear.

199
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,570
Why did you block me?

200
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,570
It was my first kiss last night.

201
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,270
Shut up!

202
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,530
I said I am not a scum.

203
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,070
I will take responsibility.

204
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,490
Lin Yi Xuan, are you crazy?

205
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,490
It was just a kiss.

206
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,110
Everyone found out
after you announced it out loud!

207
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,300
Yes, I shouted on purpose

208
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,360
so the whole world knows
you kissed me!

209
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,350
You're my girlfriend.

210
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,420
If you dare disappear again...

211
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,810
I'll give you her hometown's address.

212
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,430
Director Shi promised

213
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,320
to give me your hometown's address.

214
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,600
Director Shi, you...

215
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,390
I didn't disappear!

216
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,410
So what if I blocked you?

217
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,740
You can...

218
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,800
You can call me
using someone else's phone.

219
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,700
That makes sense.

220
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,260
Nonsense!

221
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,790
-Stop hitting me.
-You are a fool.

222
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,250
Stop fighting!

223
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,510
Both sides are willing. Don't interfere.

224
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,610
Grab your phone and
take a picture as evidence.

225
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,840
Hurry!

226
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,630
-You did it on purpose.
-No.

227
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,260
We're in public. You...

228
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,860
You're recording us? Hurry, let's go!

229
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,930
Quick!

230
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,800
-Okay. I'll go.
-No peeking!

231
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,810
-Hurry!
-Stop hitting me.

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,420
This couple is so enviable.

233
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,880
You might be envious,
but it's between them.

234
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,650
I think there's more to come.

235
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:28,670
Catch up to them.

236
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,060
Record more stuff. Quick.

237
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,010
The rest depends on you.

238
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,480
-Come on.
-Stop pushing me.

239
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,980
People were staring!

240
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:39,610
How could you say it out loud in public?

241
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,900
There aren't that many people.

242
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,150
I'm about to leave.

243
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,820
Are you not upset?

244
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,580
Oh, you're leaving today?

245
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,380
They are waiting for me outside.

246
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,060
Why are you still here? Don't waste time.

247
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,400
Leave now.

248
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,860
You're not going to disappear, are you?

249
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,440
If you don't win, don't...

250
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,380
Just you wait.
I'll return with the gold medal.

251
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,950
I'll wait for your return as the champion!

252
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,060
♫ Time please tick by slowly ♫

253
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,470
♫ Please give me more love ♫

254
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,310
♫ Every day ♫

255
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,030
Mr. Luo, Qiu Ying.

256
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,370
There's an empty seat here. Come, join us.

257
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,500
No, I...

258
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,620
Wang is over there.

259
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,150
I'll join him.

260
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,440
I won't disturb you.

261
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,960
Let's eat.

262
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:27,670
By the way,

263
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,250
I just got a message from Brother Yi.

264
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,650
They have departed.

265
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,830
They should be here soon.

266
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:33,750
I know.

267
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,140
Xia Ling sent me a text.

268
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,300
The preparation is almost done.

269
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,380
Why don't I give you
a break this afternoon?

270
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:41,510
Join them on a stroll outside.

271
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,720
That's unnecessary.

272
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,970
I still have to memorize
the information about a few teams.

273
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,360
I have to hurry.

274
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,980
I'm full.

275
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,210
I'll go back to my room.

276
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,020
Goodbye, Mr. Luo.

277
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,780
Qiu Ying.

278
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,620
Qiu Ying.

279
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,660
-Sister Ying.
-You're here?

280
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,560
Sister Ying, I miss you.

281
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,640
I miss you too.

282
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,130
You look great.

283
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,800
Everything seems to be going well for you.

284
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Thank you, Sister Wen.

285
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,770
You've been working hard these days.

286
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,660
Don't say that.

287
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,150
Qiu Ying, everyone misses you.

288
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,290
Especially Brother Kong.

289
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,690
Oh, right.

290
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,750
I need to make a phone call.

291
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,070
Let me hold that for you.

292
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,450
I'll leave now.

293
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,080
Well, everybody's tired, too.

294
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,430
Let's go upstairs and have a rest.

295
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,050
Come on. Let's go up first.

296
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,560
Sister Ying, I'll leave for now.

297
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,900
I'll leave, too.

298
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,400
Qiu Ying.

299
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,180
Are you okay?

300
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,540
I'm fine.

301
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,940
Everyone takes good care of me.

302
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,020
Qiu Ying, I...

303
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,150
I was talking to Coach Luo yesterday.

304
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,420
He said the North American teams
are very strong this year.

305
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:15,140
Legends might not even pass
the preliminary rounds.

306
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,900
So all hopes are on Phenix.

307
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:21,980
Good luck.

308
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,950
Qiu Ying, I won't forget our promise.

309
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,760
Phenix will be the champion.

310
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,420
We'll be the top team in the world.

311
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,940
I will wait for you at the finals.

312
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,420
I have to get ready. Goodbye.

313
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,060

341
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,800
[Which is quite the honour.]

342
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,380
[Yes.]

343
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,310
[In the finals,]

344
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,960
[there are 16 teams from 12 countries!]

345
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,950
[The teams include
Phenix and Legends from China.]

346
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,550
[This competition]

347
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,800
[is using the double-elimination method]

348
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,350
[to find the ultimate champion.]

349
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,320
[I can't wait.]

350
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,870
[Let us come together to witness]

351
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:04,670
[this exciting and historical moment!]

352
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:07,130
[I think that our teams are]

353
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:09,060
[about ready to set up]

354
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,570
[on their final battles.]

355
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,860
[Let's invite the first team down.]

356
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,570
[Can we please welcome]

357
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,630
[with a big round of applause,
Team Inception!]

358
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,510
[Let's welcome Inception!]

359
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:27,060
[Welcome!]

360
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,500
[Welcome, Team Inception.]

361
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,900
[Okay, now let's welcome
this team from China,]

362
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,400
[Legends!]

363
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,250
[Welcome Legends, on the stage.]

364
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,330
[Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
Ready to start this thing up?]

365
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,740
[May the games officially begin!]

366
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:02,070
[The game starts now!]

367
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,410
[Please head to your respective seats.]

368
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,740
[Gentlemen, please take your seats.]

369
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:14,120
[Team Legends and Inception
are going to kickstart the game.]

370
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,960
[They are both stressed out.]

371
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:19,340
[The winner will be
in the winners' bracket.]

372
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,200
[The loser will be in the losers' bracket]

373
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,950
[and face another round of elimination.]

374
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,110
Don’t attack...

375
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,020
My stamina is still intact.
Don’t worry. I have the stamina.

376
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,780
[Congratulations, Inception!]

377
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,530
[Inception is very strong.]

378
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:52,420
[Previously, Team Tatan
who is doing well this year]

379
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,530
[even surrendered in the game.]

380
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,090
[It is amazing.]

381
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,770
[If so, in the elimination game
of the losers' bracket,]

382
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,040
[Legends and Tatan]

383
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,540
[will battle again after a year.]

384
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,290
Lin Yi Xuan!

385
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,110
It's okay.

386
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,740
-It's only our first year.
-Lin Yi Xuan

387
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,500
It is okay. Don’t be sad.

388
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,080
I am sorry.

389
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:50,360
Why are you crying?

390
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,500
-I'm sorry.
-Why are you crying?

391
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,300
I lost.

392
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,140
Are you going to quit, Lu Feng?

393
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,570
Stand up. Buck up!

394
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:07,820
Will you not come next year?

395
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:09,800
Will you quit?

396
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,280
Stop crying. You!

397
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,380
Stop crying!

398
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,220
Xiang Kong.

399
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,410
I did my best this time.

400
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,310
Now,

401
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,160
it's your turn.

402
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,800
Please win the championship on our behalf.

403
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,030
Stand up...

404
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,940
Don't be a disgrace here. Stand up.

405
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,780
I, Lin Yi Xuan,

406
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,200
will avenge you.

407
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:50,350
Count me in.

408
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,250
Count me in.

409
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,620
Me, too!

410
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,090
Don’t forget the slogan of Legends.

411
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,660
Legends! Never give up!

412
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,900
We can do it!

413
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,870
Attack! Attack!

414
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,800
Come on, Phenix!

415
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:30,810
Wait for me. Wait up.

416
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:31,860
Cooling time needed.

417
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:33,040
Attack now. Let's interchange.

418
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,020
Yes, attack!

419
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,980
[Phenix is doing a great job!]

420
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,180
[Pei Xi and Xia Ling
killed their opponents.]

421
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:42,900
We win!

422
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:50,460
Phenix...

423
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,670
Xiang Kong won!

424
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,430
Really?

425
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,570
Look.

426
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,350
-Go...
-Attack!

427
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,110
Yes, yes!

428
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,110
Go!

429
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,850
Go...

430
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,930
Yes!

431
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,550
I can attack.

432
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,750
I got it. Go, go!

433
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,250
Great, go...

434
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,720
Push...

435
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,970
Lin Yi Xuan!

436
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,900
Take care of your eyes.

437
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,320
Xiang Kong is about to win.

438
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,750
We can attack...

439
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,900
Yes, yes!

440
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,860
Go!

441
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,980
Great!

442
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,830
-Xia Ling, go!
-Go...

443
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,180
Awesome! Great job!

444
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,990
Congratulations, Phenix, for being
the winner of the winners' bracket.

445
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,140
You'll be entering the finals!

446
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,540
Xiang Kong won again.

447
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,300
We can watch him play in the finals.

448
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,030
Do you really want to go?

449
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,320
Of course.

450
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:07,590
I gave him my word.

451
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,290
I must see him
win the championship in person.

452
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,320
Are you going to tell you

453
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,840
you have recovered?

454
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,030
You will help me, won’t you?

455
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,960
Tony.

456
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,090
Please help me, alright?

457
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:33,620
Please, help me just this once.

458
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,970
[Let's congratulate Phenix
for entering the finals.]

459
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:41,370
[They will compete with
the champion last year, Tatan.]

460
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,740
[Let's see who will be
the champion this year!]

461
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:53,190
No, Ji Xiang Kong.

462
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,240
I can't let you enter the finals easily.

463
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:56,550
What are you going to do?

464
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,360
Find a way to ruin their reputation.

465
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,020
Even if they can attend the game,
they'll be in a foul mood.

466
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,180
This way, they can't win.

467
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,340
Are you crazy?

468
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,200
You only received a one-year ban.

469
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,740
If you make a mistake again,

470
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,820
you might get blacklisted by iConquer for good!

471
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,080
I don’t care.

472
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,710
I must do it.

473
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,040
Give me my phone.

474
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,150
Qi Yue, let's stop going against them.

475
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,670
Have you given up?

476
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:27,430
It it weren't for Ji Xiang Kong and
Qiu Ying, will we be in this situation?

477
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,100
We can't blame anyone

478
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,580
for getting into this situation.

479
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,040
Who can we blame, then?

480
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,360
Ourselves.

481
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,800
I used to think

482
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:49,820
I can get everything
after kicking Qiu Ying away.

483
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:51,650
So, I did everything I could.

484
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,900
I resorted to despicable means.

485
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,230
You did the same.

486
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,120
To be the captain,

487
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,000
you got carried away.

488
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,970
I used to not care about this.

489
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,750
But I must be the captain

490
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,650
to be worthy of you.

491
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,440
It's just a title.

492
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,170
I love you for who you are.

493
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:25,070
I've always wanted to be the best

494
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,550
I want to prove myself.

495
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,300
I don't want others to look down on me.

496
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,700
I wanted to be the captain

497
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,630
because I think I'm not worthy of you.

498
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:43,970
If I don't exist,

499
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:47,460
will you still want
to be a professional e-sports player?

500
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,240
Esports has always been my dream.

501
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,500
I don’t want to gain anything.
All I want is to play well.

502
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,570
But I have nothing now.

503
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,250
You have me.

504
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,660
All these years,

505
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,260
the only thing I did right

506
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,400
was being with you.

507
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,060
I have nothing now.

508
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,140
Are you really fine with that?

509
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,330
Qi Yue.

510
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,450
Let's start anew,

511
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:48,800
alright?

512
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:08,940
I haven't seen you so happy in a while.

513
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,520
That's because Phenix won.

514
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,040
I used to be their captain.

515
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,020
It was a tough journey

516
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,770
for Xiang Kong.

517
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:23,500
By the way, I'm going to meet Shu Wen

518
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:26,030
from Phenix.

519
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,440
Do you want to come along to
give them some encouragement?

520
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,469
Me? I don't think so.

521
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,920
I don’t want to disturb them.

522
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,179
Let me take that for you.

523
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,139
I am sorry.

524
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,429
Hello?

525
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,280
Okay. Got it.

526
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,750
That's your ID.

527
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,590
Back then, when you left,

528
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,920
it was on the desk.

529
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,540
I kept it for you.

530
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,880
You can have it back.

531
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,470
Well, thank you.

532
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,180
I'm so careless.

533
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,910
Mr. Luo,

534
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,900
Tomorrow is the day
of the international finals.

535
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,020
It's my first time
hosting such a grand stage.

536
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:37,290
I want to prepare for it.

537
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,280
Do you want to head back without me?

538
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,700
I'd like to go to
the news center this afternoon

539
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,850
to view the videos of Phenix's games.

540
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,310
You don’t need to go.

541
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,970
You have prepared well enough.

542
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,730
But, Mr. Luo,

543
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:52,160
I'm still lacking a lot.

544
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,470
Stop calling me that.

545
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,030
You are my partner now.

546
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,860
You have qualified enough to be at

547
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,580
the stage of the international finals.

548
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,620
Don’t let irrelevant matters

549
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:02,680
affect you.

550
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,010
-But I...
-Alright.

551
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,780
Professional commentators like us

552
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,100
need a break, too.

553
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,620
Dinner's on me tonight.

554
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,850
Only the two of us.

555
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,070
See you at the hotel lobby one hour later.

556
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,100
I...

557
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:16,920
Don’t refuse me.

558
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,280
It's my birthday today.

559
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,680
Birthday?

560
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,110
Don't you believe me?

561
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:26,650
Of course I do.

562
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,170
Okay, I'll be there.

563
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,260
I will return to my room now.

564
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,090
Let's go.

565
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,690
Do you think

566
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:40,300
Mr. Lu is going to
confess his feelings to Qiu Ying tonight?

567
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:41,360
I think so.

568
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,650
No wonder he kept spacing out today.

569
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,560
Really?

570
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,940
They are a power couple
in the commentary...

571
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,160
Handsome Ji.

572
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,580
Are you here for Qiu Ying?

573
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,120
I just happened to pass by.

574
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,380
There was a rumor online

575
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,920
saying Fu Mi Ya left showbiz
as she lost her sight,

576
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:07,250
so Ji Xiang Kong took care of her

577
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,070
and their love was rekindled, right?

578
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,830
But it seems like Ji Xiang Kong

579
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,580
couldn't forget Qiu Ying.

580
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,920
In my opinion, Ji Xiang Kong

581
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,800
still loves Qiu Ying.

582
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:24,260
Ji Xiang Kong dumped Qiu Ying
for his ex-girlfriend.

583
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,080
Mr. Luo has a chance.

584
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,120
Please enjoy your meal.

585
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:43,170
Thank you.

586
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,580
To be honest,
I rarely celebrate my birthday.

587
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,970
Especially with a girl.

588
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,910
Thank you for inviting me

589
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,320
to celebrate your birthday with you.

590
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,820
I know.

591
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,100
You're doing this so I can calm down

592
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:15,070
for tomorrow’s competition.

593
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,520
No, I really want

594
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,290
to celebrate my birthday with you.

595
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,200
To me,

596
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:27,000
you are an important partner.

597
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,060
Right.

598
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,940
Happy birthday.

599
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,820
I thought you didn't know

600
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,100
it's my birthday today?

601
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,400
Why did you prepare a gift for me?

602
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,720
I prepared it ages ago.

603
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:41,370
I didn't get the chance to give it to you.

604
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,200
Regarding the strategy leak incident,

605
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,700
if it weren't for you,

606
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,100
I wouldn't get to clear my name.

607
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,550
As it's your birthday today,

608
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,870
you won't refuse to accept my gift.

609
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,860
Take it.

610
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,980
This is the first birthday gift
I've ever received.

611
00:38:58,010 --> 00:38:58,890
Thank you.

612
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,590
It's because
you don't celebrate your birthday.

613
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,940
So you don't receive gifts.

614
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:11,150
Yes. I don't like socializing.

615
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,340
I don't like owing favours.

616
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,770
Rather than wasting time over those stuff,

617
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,370
I'd rather spend time to improve myself

618
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,190
so I won't trouble others.

619
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:27,220
I'm terribly hard
to get along with, right?

620
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,870
I am strict and heartless.

621
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,190
No. To me,

622
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,340
you're the best teacher.

623
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,400
Why do you always call me teacher?

624
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,360
Of course. From Rising Star to GDV,

625
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,830
You taught me how to review the commentary

626
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,210
personally.

627
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,910
Without you,

628
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,300
I wouldn't have improved that quickly.

629
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,830
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

630
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:10,300
But, I don’t want

631
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,100
to be your teacher.

632
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,600
I want to take this opportunity

633
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,180
to give you a present.

634
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,940
From tomorrow onwards,

635
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,830
stop thinking of yourself as a student.

636
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:33,860
You are Qiu Ying

637
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:36,580
The best female commentator of iConquer.

638
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,380
Good luck.

639
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,790
I will.

640
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:56,450
[Do you think]

641
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:59,190
[Mr. Lu is going to
confess his feelings to Qiu Ying tonight?]

642
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:00,060
[I think so.]

643
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,610
[No wonder he kept spacing out today.]

644
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,530
[Really?]

645
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,570
[They are a power couple
in the commentary industry.]

646
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,520
[Are you free?
Let's drink on the rooftop.]

647
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,510
Happy birthday.

648
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,820
Birthdays are not meant for me.

649
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,020
Was Qiu Ying with you earlier?

650
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,670
You sound jealous.

651
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,430
There's nothing to be jealous of.

652
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,030
She's just
celebrating her teacher's birthday.

653
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:19,210
I can't seem to stop people
from calling me teacher.

654
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,630
To be honest,

655
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,150
I don’t want to be Qiu Ying's teacher.

656
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:35,830
I never knew

657
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,420
you'd be a threat.

658
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,460
Yes.

659
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:46,270
I thought you could make Qiu Ying happy.

660
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:58,770
What's wrong?

661
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,820
At a loss for words?

662
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,700
I never knew

663
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:15,340
someone I have respected greatly
would interfere in our relationship.

664
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,600
Interfere?

665
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,350
Are you admitting that your relationship
with Qiu Ying can be easily interfered?

666
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,750
Qiu Ying has sacrificed a lot for you.

667
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,520
But what did you do?

668
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,390
Because of Mi Ya,

669
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:30,540
you hurt her endlessly
and made her the topic of discussion.

670
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:34,550
Ji Xiang Kong, who do you love?

671
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,400
None of your business. Stay out of it.

672
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,780
As long as it concerns Qiu Ying,
it is my business.

673
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,290
Ji Xiang Kong.

674
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,730
Do you love Qiu Ying?

675
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,860
Of course I do.

676
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,780
I'll never stop loving her.

677
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:01,180
No matter what her choice is,

678
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,600
I'll still love her.

679
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,790
Choice?

680
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,400
She has no choice.

681
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:21,760
You're the only one.

682
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,190
You are right.

683
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,100
I wanted to
interfere in your relationship.

684
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,200
Today,

685
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,370
I want to confess my love

686
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,780
on impulse.

687
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,240
But she refused to give me

688
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,750
a chance to say it out loud.

689
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,960
Don’t let it get to your head.

690
00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:53,200
I'm not giving up.

691
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,590
If you refused to cut ties with Mi Ya,

692
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,960
even if Qiu Ying rejects
me a million times,

693
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:02,520
I'll make sure I get her in the end.

694
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,920
Don’t worry. I will deal with Mi Ya
as soon as possible.

695
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,940
You won't get a chance.

696
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:08,960
No matter what,

697
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:11,340
I won't give up.

698
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:28,180
Do you know why I brought you here?

699
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:29,820
No.

700
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:34,620
Here's a hint.

701
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:36,890
Five years ago.

702
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:40,470
Five years ago?

703
00:45:42,170 --> 00:45:43,460
Five years ago!

704
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,520
We were here for a competition.

705
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,950
I was stressed out back then.

706
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,410
You brought me here so I could relax.

707
00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:50,810
But we sat here all night.

708
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:53,700
Did you forget it?

709
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:55,370
I remember it.

710
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:57,890
You obviously forgot about it!

711
00:45:58,530 --> 00:45:59,520
Silly girl.

712
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,800
I remember everything

713
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,710
I've done with you.

714
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,250
All these years,

715
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,890
I am sorry.

716
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:30,420
From today onward,

717
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,000
we will find

718
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,260
everything we've missed
and lost in the past.

719
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:43,300
For the international championship,

720
00:46:44,930 --> 00:46:46,470
I'll be by your side
until you get it back.

721
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,120
That is our last chance.

722
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,010
We need to find a way
around the shadow tactics.

723
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:08,360
But the shadow tactic is unbeatable.

724
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,540
I don't care at all!

725
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,220
Do it by tonight.

726
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:15,660
Otherwise no one gets to sleep.

727
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,340
Understood?
