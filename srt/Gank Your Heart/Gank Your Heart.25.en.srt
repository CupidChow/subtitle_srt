[Gank Your Heart]

3
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,450
[Episode 25]

4
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,940
Sorry.

5
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,770
I sprained my ankle by accident yesterday.

6
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,750
It's fine.

7
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,450
Take a seat.

8
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,720
Hello.

9
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
Your strawberry milk tea.

10
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,790
Actually, regarding the rumours
about you and Xiang Kong,

11
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,400
I knew about it even before
you joined Rising Star.

12
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,800
When I saw your pictures online,

13
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,320
I have a feeling that

14
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:58,950
you and he are more than just rumours.

15
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,120
That's why I asked you
to come to my fan meeting.

16
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,690
I wanted to talk to you.

17
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,640
He never told me anything
between you and him.

18
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,240
That's why

19
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,200
we're in this awkward position.

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,570
You like him?

21
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:34,850
I do.

22
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,320
I like him.

23
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,850
But so far,

24
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,390
we are just friends.

25
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,750
I know.

26
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,870
Some things...

27
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:57,520
Even he doesn't say it, I know.

28
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,440
That's because we grew up together.

29
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,600
No one knows us better than each other.

30
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,640
Is your relationship with him

31
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,839
really like what you wrote
in Beyond the Sky?

32
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,170
Beyond the Sky is a song for him.

33
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,900
This song

34
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,909
records the hardest moments

35
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,670
yet also the sweetest days we've had.

36
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,470
When I became a trainee,

37
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,590
he applied to become an exchange student.

38
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,120
He rented an apartment

39
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,440
[beside my company,]

40
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,270
[only 12 square metres big.]

41
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,090
[After coming back from campus
every day, he would cook for me.]

42
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,050
[During the weekends,]

43
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,070
[he accompanied me to the theatre]

44
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,690
[for rehearsals and performances.]

45
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,270
I feel so tired.

46
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,520
I can't hold on anymore.

47
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:21,040
Even we might fail and get teased at,

48
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,720
yes, it does feel bad.

49
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,070
But we still have each other.

50
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,400
At that time,

51
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,890
we have nothing

52
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,659
but each other.

53
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,570
Xiang Kong said that

54
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,470
he would always be by my side.

55
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,170
Forever.

56
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,840
Later on, I started to become popular.

57
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,340
My company forbade me from dating.

58
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,620
Xiang Kong chose to leave
for my career development.

59
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,020
Till now, we've never met again.

60
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,400
But, he came to every concert I had.

61
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,070
You see.

62
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,300
Now, I've finally succeeded.

63
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,540
I can support him

64
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
and help him realize his dream.

65
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,550
We accompanied each other
throughout our entire youth.

66
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,450
Qiu Ying.

67
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,330
Can you understand
this relationship we have?

68
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,770
Sorry, Ms. Fu.

69
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
I need to go to work now.

70
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,440
But don't worry.

71
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:48,000
I won't interfere in
your relationship again.

72
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,600
Thanks for your coffee.

73
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,600
Bye.

74
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,060
This version of Holy Princess
seems to have improved.

75
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,120
You did your research.

76
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,570
Qiu Ying.

77
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,300
What's wrong? Your confession failed?

78
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,340
Qiu Ying refused you?

79
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,230
Handsome Ji.

80
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,750
Coach.

81
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,670
Is it because of Pei Xi?

82
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,120
Say something.

83
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,090
This is the line-up of
Polaris in three games.

84
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,440
They often use these two group control
heroes, the Bug Queen and Gorgon.

85
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:48,930
But there is also one weakness.

86
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,830
Their long cooldown period
after using their ultimate skill.

87
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,740
That means we need to fight back
when they're still cooling down.

88
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,880
No problem.

89
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,270
Qi Yue.

90
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,640
Tell us what you think.

91
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,500
Tell us what you think.

92
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,070
It's already very clear.

93
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,550
You are the captain.

94
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,910
You decide the tactics.

95
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,370
We'll just listen.

96
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,400
The captain has clearly
explained the strategy.

97
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,280
The captain and I will lure them
to use their ultimate skill.

98
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,610
Then, Brother Qi will sneak from the back.

99
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,510
During the training session later,

100
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,230
pay attention to your entrance timing.

101
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,960
The match tomorrow is extremely important.

102
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,420
If we lose, we will proceed
into the losers bracket.

103
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,920
Qi Yue.

104
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,600
Do you understand?

105
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,840
Clear.

106
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,190
Are you done?

107
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,750
My mom is at the hotel. Can I visit her?

108
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,050
Mr. Can.

109
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,020
Have you seen the latest shift schedule?

110
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,270
Qiu Ying suddenly got promoted

111
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,450
from assistant to commentator.

112
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,910
Who would believe
she's not pulling strings?

113
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,590
Look at it this way.

114
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,940
Even if Qiu Ying did pull some strings,

115
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,020
it was Mr. Luo who appointed her.

116
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,400
Who can say no?

117
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,950
Even…

118
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,940
Even Mr. Guo needs
to show respect for Luo Tian.

119
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,630
For these few months,

120
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,180
I've learned so much from you
at the commentator's table.

121
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,650
We can't just sit by and watch someone
get promoted using dirty tricks.

122
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,670
I'm your protege.

123
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,040
Can you help me find a way?

124
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,040
Qiao Xin, don't worry.

125
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,720
See, I will definitely help you.

126
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,090
But the playoffs have begun.

127
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:10,850
We can only let it be right now.

128
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,420
Don't worry, later on,

129
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:16,170
I will definitely find
a way for you, okay?

130
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,590
I have to use the washroom.

131
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,100
Go ahead.

132
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,520
Follow me.

133
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,700
Wait. Where are you going?

134
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,190
Let go of me!

135
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,420
Why are you with Can again?

136
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,720
Explain it to me.

137
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,770
What's with you?

138
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,530
What's with me?

139
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,010
Then, what's with you?

140
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,620
Why didn't you reply to my messages?

141
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,830
If I didn't bump into you,

142
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,110
I can't even meet you, right?

143
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,770
Can't you see? I'm at work.

144
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:01,070
Enjoying coffee with some
other guy, is that work too?

145
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,520
Look at yourself.

146
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,610
Don't you feel embarrassed
for yelling like that?

147
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,250
If you're really capable,

148
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,020
do I need to keep some other man company?

149
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,070
I've already told you.

150
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,380
My career development
in You Xing is limited.

151
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,700
I need to secure a spot at GDV.

152
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,620
Right now, Qiu Ying
already has Luo Tian's support.

153
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,660
If I don't find a way to save myself,

154
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,890
would you help me?

155
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,720
You're finally telling the truth.

156
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,040
To you, I am just a loser.

157
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,900
What else?

158
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,270
All these years,
have you done anything for me?

159
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,270
Right now, everyone is staying here.

160
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,640
Don't come to me now.

161
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,010
-Qiao Xin.
-Let go of me.

162
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,150
Qiao Xin!

163
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,920
All these years, I've been
caring for you, and you?

164
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,590
Who do you think I am?

165
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,370
I can't stand it anymore.

166
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,910
Then, let's break up.

167
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,640
I didn't beg you to stay with me.

168
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,810
-Done?
-Mr. Li.

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,080
We are going to train first.

170
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,020
Where is Qi Yue?

171
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,820
Mr. Li, there's something
I need to talk to you.

172
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,470
Qi Yue is your apprentice.

173
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,040
He only listens to you at VNG.

174
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,230
Xiang Kong.

175
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,240
Just speak your mind.

176
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,240
If he is really with his mother,

177
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,740
it's fine for him to take leave.

178
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,380
But, if he's just dating,
which influences his performance,

179
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,670
that's a different story.

180
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,530
Xiang Kong.

181
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,650
This moment can make or break VNG.

182
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,850
Qi Yue and you are both indispensable.

183
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,390
I don't want any conflicts
between you two now.

184
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:34,590
Mr. Li, if I did misunderstand him,

185
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,960
I will apologize to Qi Yue.

186
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,970
But if it's not,

187
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,270
I hope you can talk to him.

188
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,590
Okay. I understand.

189
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,490
I'm going to train now.

190
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,090
Polaris is a relatively aggressive team.

191
00:14:57,170 --> 00:14:58,320
They love boosting.

192
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,940
On average, three players can deal more
than 1000 points of damage in one match.

193
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,120
Nice analysis.

194
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,740
But not comprehensive enough.

195
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,140
Well, let's eat first.

196
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,680
Then, I'll help you organize the data.

197
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,650
Okay.

198
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,180
Xiang Kong?

199
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:25,270
You're here for Qiu Ying?

200
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:28,820
Qiu Ying. Can I talk to you privately?

201
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,970
Sorry. I am busy right now.

202
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,550
Mr. Luo.

203
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,200
I still have some unsolved problems.

204
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,140
I'm going back.

205
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,770
I'm going back to work too, then.

206
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,480
Brother Qi, you're finally back.

207
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,140
Mr. Li.

208
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,270
Is Qi Yue back?

209
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,340
Don't know.
He is probably with his mom.

210
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,400
What is he doing?

211
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,810
He doesn't answer my calls
or reply to my messages.

212
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,750
He probably forgot to bring his phone.

213
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,270
-Then, tell me when he comes back.
-Okay.

214
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,190
-Rest early.
-Bye, Mr. Li.

215
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,970
Why won't you answer my call, Brother Qi?

216
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
Just came back?

217
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,300
I went to Qi Yue's room.

218
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,000
I heard Qi Yue left early today again.

219
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:02,530
Yes.

220
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,290
His mom doesn't know her way around here,

221
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,470
so she needs his company.

222
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,950
Isn't it

223
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,940
because of something else?

224
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:12,069
Do you distrust Qi Yue so much?

225
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,520
-I'm going to sleep.
-Li Gan.

226
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,319
I'm concerned about Qi Yue.

227
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,310
Can we talk?

228
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:25,089
It's late. There's a game tomorrow.

229
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,240
Go to sleep early.

230
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,120
Qi Yue!

231
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,330
What's wrong?

232
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,170
-Why are you so drunk?
-Buzz off!

233
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,870
Qi Yue, tomorrow is the competition.

234
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,820
What's wrong with you? Wake up.

235
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,100
Sister Wen.

236
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,120
Am I a loser?

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,890
Why did Qiao Xin treat me like this?

238
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,780
Qi Yue, you are drunk.

239
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,370
Let me take you to your room.

240
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,230
Tell her this.

241
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,770
Someday, I will let the whole world
know that she is my woman!

242
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,570
Look at him.

243
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,390
Qi Yue, go back.

244
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,720
Shut up!

245
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,160
Why did Qiao Xin treat me like this?

246
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,440
I gave her everything she wanted.

247
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,520
Go away!

248
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:43,700
Li Gan.

249
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,150
Did you hear that?

250
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,850
Tomorrow is the game.

251
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,950
He's utterly drunk.

252
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,650
You'd better not cause any trouble.

253
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,700
Brother Qi!

254
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,450
Get up!

255
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,670
Master, did you see that?

256
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,270
Mr. Luo.

257
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,720
At my first live commentary,

258
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,380
I also stared from here for a long time.

259
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,130
Only by looking down from this angle

260
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,420
can you can feel more responsible.

261
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,100
The competition is about to start.

262
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,390
Let's get prepared.

263
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,500
Okay.

264
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,430
I know that you must be nervous
during your first commentary.

265
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,950
Later, during the commentary,
try to calm down.

266
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Don't rush.

267
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,170
Make sure you report your data accurately.

268
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,760
If you are not confident
with your memory skills,

269
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,470
review your notes first.

270
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,420
Mr. Luo, Director An is looking for you.

271
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,880
Okay.

272
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,020
I need to go. Get prepared.

273
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,400
Let's go.

274
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,020
♫ The most brilliant ♫

275
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,100
♫ And most beautiful vista I've seen ♫

276
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,860
♫ Is in your eyes ♫

277
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,940
♫ From then on ♫

278
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,020
♫ I've never anticipated like so ♫

279
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,860
♫ If it weren't for ♫

280
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,650
♫ that hurried encounter ♫

281
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,170
Qiu Ying. Let's talk.

282
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,660
♫ that appeared in this life ♫

283
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,650
♫ I would have been fearless ♫

284
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,820
Let's talk outside.

285
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,170
♫ Unafraid of losing anything ♫

286
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,780
♫ Love is cautious ♫

287
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,380
♫ Wary of being expressed ♫

288
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,020
♫ A restless emotion ♫

289
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,250
♫ Love doesn't come easily ♫

290
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:08,690
♫ It's too pretty ♫

291
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:11,220
Qiu Ying, do your best.

292
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,370
This is your first time
in the commentator's podium.

293
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,520
You've waited so long for this day.

294
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,050
Don't be nervous.

295
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,720
Unleash your skills.

296
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,200
Thanks.

297
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,990
Good luck on your competition too.

298
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,450
♫ I just want us ♫

299
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,340
♫ To stare into each others' eyes ♫

300
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:37,490
Right.

301
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,650
I love the bike model you gave me.

302
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,170
Thank you.

303
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,840
That's just a gift to thank you

304
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,410
for supporting me all along.

305
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,260
I don't mean anything else.

306
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,520
Okay, I need to go.

307
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,820
You should head to the lounge too.

308
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,870
Qiu Ying.

309
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,740
♫ Love is cautious ♫

310
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,340
♫ Wary of being expressed ♫

311
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:08,180
♫ A restless emotion ♫

312
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,170
♫ Love doesn't come easily ♫

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,860
♫ It's too pretty ♫

314
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,660
♫ Always the subject of obsession ♫

315
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,540
I know

316
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,490
I shouldn't bother you now.

317
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,120
But,

318
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,440
after the game, can we talk?

319
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,090
Sure.

320
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,360
Let's invite Yi Yi and Lin Yi Xuan too.

321
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,350
We haven't gathered for a while.

322
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,270
I mean…

323
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,050
Just the two of us.

324
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:40,130
♫ I just want us ♫

325
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,210
♫ To stare into each others' eyes ♫

326
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,660
♫ Because it's you ♫

327
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,980
♫ I'll hug tightly no matter
how much it hurts ♫

328
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:48,970
Can we?

329
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:54,520
Let's talk about this after the game.

330
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,540
What are you looking for, Qiu Ying?

331
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,900
Zheng. My notebook is missing.

332
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,070
All my scripts and competition
analyses are in there.

333
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,840
You lost such an important thing?

334
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,200
I just went out for a while.

335
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,820
I remember I just put it on the desk.

336
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,790
Let's see how you'll show off.

337
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Qiao Xin?

338
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,070
The game is about to start.
What are you doing here?

339
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,070
Mr. Luo, nothing important.

340
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,510
I was just throwing something.

341
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,920
I'm going up to prepare.

342
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,220
Zheng. The game is about to start.

343
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,600
Aren't you supposed to
prepare at the analysis table?

344
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,190
I will go now.

345
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:44,730
What happened? What are you looking for?

346
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,150
No…Nothing.

347
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,090
Can's partner just took ill.

348
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:52,760
They couldn't find someone to substitute.

349
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,400
So later on, we need to
follow Can's live hosting.

350
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,490
Live hosting?

351
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,040
Right, these emergencies
happen a lot during live games.

352
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:06,910
But, it's fine. just follow my pace later.

353
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,380
Here's the script, take a look.

354
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:10,390
Okay.

355
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,190
Brother Qi. Are you alright?

356
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,430
Drink some water.

357
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,270
Why did you drink so much?

358
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,840
What should I do?

359
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,140
Sister Wen saw everything.

360
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,120
I don't know the details.

361
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,410
But, your relationship with Qiao Xin...

362
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,870
Mr. Li should know by now.

363
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:59,220
I think Sister Wen is okay with it.

364
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,410
This will influence my performance.

365
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,420
Of course not.

366
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,030
You are so important in our team.

367
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,660
How would this influence the game?

368
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,530
You're right.
I am indispensable at VNG now.

369
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,920
The game is about to start. Let's go.

370
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,120
Where is Qi Yue?

371
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,150
He is in the washroom.

372
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,670
Sister Wen.

373
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,690
Master.

374
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:40,260
Play well in the game.

375
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,770
Don't worry.

376
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,000
Trust me.

377
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,100
Turn on your best mode
during today's game.

378
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,570
I have confidence in you.

379
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,550
Don't worry, Sister Wen.

380
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,860
We met Polaris before
during the regular season.

381
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,370
We all know them well.

382
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,500
Okay, keep it up.

383
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,450
Welcome to the live games of
the 2018 Fall Championship!

384
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,870
I am your old friend, Luo Tian.

385
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:12,820
Hello everyone.
I am your new friend, Qiu Ying.

386
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,260
[After two months of battling it out,]

387
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,840
[the top four teams
are now in the playoffs.]

388
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,030
[This is a double-elimination tournament.]

389
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,880
[Two consecutive defeats
result in elimination.]

390
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,380
Today is the first match
of iConquer's 2018 playoffs.

391
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,210
Here, we have VNG,
who wrote a new record

392
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,710
of 11 consecutive wins
in the regular season

393
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,360
[versus the dark horse team, Polaris.]

394
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,940
Mia?

395
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,080
Sister Wen.

396
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,860
Why are you here today?

397
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,580
I am here to support Xiang Kong.

398
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,150
Thanks for your support.

399
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,000
Mia?

400
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,690
Mia, the superstar singer,
is with us today!

401
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,370
[Mia!]

402
00:30:13,170 --> 00:30:14,430
Excuse me. Thanks everyone.

403
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,660
Don't take photos.
Please respect her privacy.

404
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:19,510
Thank you, please sit and watch the game.

405
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,910
Please watch the game first, okay?

406
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,970
Thanks everyone.

407
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,020
Qiu Ying, for your first
commentary, you sure are lucky!

408
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,590
It seems like Qiu Ying is overwhelmed
by the audience's enthusiasm.

409
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,360
This is really a surprise
in today's playoffs.

410
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,840
Can, since we have a surprise,

411
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,480
[we'll leave the interview to you.]

412
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,070
Why would a celebrity
join a fare like this?

413
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:43,190
[Let's welcome the superstar singer, Mia!]

414
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,470
Welcome!

415
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,290
Actually, I'm here as an ordinary
member of the audience

416
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,790
[to experience the atmosphere here.]

417
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,270
I didn't expect everyone
to be so enthusiastic.

418
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,040
[Now that you're here today,]

419
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,750
[I can't miss this opportunity]

420
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,070
for some juicy gossip.

421
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,670
Which team today do you support?

422
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,320
I am a fan of VNG.

423
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,630
[That's because I heard that]

424
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,050
[during the regular season,]

425
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,440
[they set a record
of 11 consecutive wins.]

426
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,390
I really admire a team
with such passion and drive.

427
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,620
[Which player do you
support the most in VNG?]

428
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,420
VNG's captain, Ji Xiang Kong.

429
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,400
[Can't believe that Mia
is also a fan of VNG]

430
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:35,000
[and a fan of Ji Xiang Kong.]

431
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,500
What's wrong with you? Are you ill?

432
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,800
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

433
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,020
I was in a daze just now.

434
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,200
The game is about to start.
Pull yourself together.

435
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,990
Relax. Don't be too nervous.

436
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:58,350
Thanks.

437
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:19,100
[Let's give a round of
applause to our teams!]

438
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,190
[Welcome, everyone.]

439
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,910
[Both teams may
occupy their positions now.]

440
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,620
Based on the points
accumulated in the regular season,

441
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:02,040
Polaris is ranked 4th.

442
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,810
Also, during the regular season,

443
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,590
both teams have competed once.

444
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,420
VNG defeated Polaris by 2 to 0.

445
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,430
Yes, it's a new beginning in the playoffs.

446
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,700
[For all four teams,]

447
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,040
[every game is a life-and-death fight.]

448
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,020
[I believe Polaris today
will not give up easily.]

449
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,170
[Ladies and gentlemen,
show your enthusiasm.]

450
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,970
[Cheer for your favourite team!]

451
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,920
Xiang Kong, go!

452
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,240
-I'm coming!
-Follow!

453
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,800
-Go!
-Fire!

454
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,490
Go farm while I protect you.

455
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,370
I can't farm.

456
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:40,710
Qi Yue, what are you doing?

457
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,310
Why can't you farm after so long?

458
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,410
Mind your own business.

459
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,660
Sorry, my bad.

460
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,400
[Qi Yue is in trouble this round.]

461
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,780
[He's forced to farm in the jungle now.]

462
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,080
[Polaris seems to be hot on his heels.]

463
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,100
[Two supports are
heading into the jungle!]

464
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,200
[Two Level 6 supports!]

465
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:56,430
What is the jungler doing?

466
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,370
Why isn't he ganking now?

467
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,000
Calm down.

468
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,830
I'm caught. Help.

469
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,810
[Qi Yue has been caught.]

470
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,630
[He has been caught by two
heroes from the other side.]

471
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,770
[It seems like Qi Yue
is going to be killed.]

472
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,699
[Yes, he's utterly suppressed now.]

473
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,830
[He can't farm at all.]

474
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,480
[Actually, at around the 10th minute,]

475
00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:21,500
VNG's Double Yue
would usually start to gank.

476
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,940
But, it's obvious that they're
all after Qi Yue this time.

477
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,800
He hasn't even reached
Level 6 in the 8th minute.

478
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,520
The numbers are against him.

479
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,830
According to previous data,

480
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,100
Qi Yue takes seven minutes
on average to reach Level 6.

481
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,360
Six to seven minutes.

482
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,810
Double Yue would start ganking
around the 10th minute mark.

483
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:43,380
They should have already farmed enough.

484
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,449
Their team participation rate is 75%,

485
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:48,000
while Polaris's rate is

486
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,150
75%.

487
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,820
But compared to Double Yue's 93%,

488
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,639
there is still a marked difference.

489
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,330
But this round, Double Yue's
participation rate will decrease.

490
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:03,840
[Now, Polaris's midlaners
is earning 484 gold per minute.]

491
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,710
[They've already surpassed Qi Yue.]

492
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,320
[Usually, he would be earning
around 580 gold per minute,]

493
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,520
[but right now, it's only 465.]

494
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,620
The lack of skills and equipment

495
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,540
may limit Qi Yue's strength.

496
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,390
Initiation will be harder.

497
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,800
Polaris is splitting
Double Yue intentionally.

498
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,410
VNG will be at a disadvantage
in the next team fight.

499
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,640
What? Now that I'm the MVP,
everyone's targeting me now?

500
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,930
Next time, when I call you,
come quickly, okay?

501
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,440
-No, it's you...
-What?

502
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,250
Look at Qi Yue's performance.

503
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,920
The opponent is targeting him, right?

504
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,600
Is this his first time being targeted?

505
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,790
Double Yue has never been a
long-term strategy anyway.

506
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,280
As long as he doesn't mess up,

507
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:54,580
Double Yue has absolute
advantage in this game.

508
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,550
Shu Wen.

509
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,520
In this world, nothing is absolute.

510
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,140
-We can attack here.
-I got it.

511
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,240
Brother Qi, I'm right below you.

512
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,680
Brother Qi, mind yourself.

513
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:11,100
Go back.

514
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,480
Move, move!

515
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:13,740
Back, back!

516
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,540
Fight them, fight!

517
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,640
Push!

518
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,890
Push!

519
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,850
Go!

520
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Congratulation to Polaris
for winning this round.

521
00:36:57,290 --> 00:37:00,290
Next, will VNG catch up
and start a third round?

522
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,770
Let's take a 15-minute break.

523
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:03,690
Looking forward to the next round.

524
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,510
Explain yourself.

525
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,190
You messed up the stats twice.
What's wrong with you?

526
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:26,790
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

527
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,060
I didn't prepare my notes well.

528
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,190
Where are your notes?

529
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,920
They're missing.

530
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,170
Missing?

531
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,120
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

532
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,870
I didn't keep them well.

533
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,830
Lift your head up.

534
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,930
Without your notes,

535
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,690
can't you comment anymore?

536
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,890
No. I don't feel confident without data.

537
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:07,800
To be a good commentator,

538
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:10,270
the most important skill is adaptability,

539
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,970
not relying on data.

540
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:17,350
You don't need to stress too much.

541
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,020
Later on, leave the data to me.

542
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,370
We are partners.

543
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:23,660
Next time, if there is
another emergency like this,

544
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,120
you need to tell me right away.

545
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,190
Since Double Yue is being targeted,

546
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,170
then we'll change tactics
in the next round.

547
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,600
Sister Wen.

548
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,640
Next round, let's fake Double Yue up.

549
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,050
What do you mean?

550
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,610
Since Qi Yue is being targeted,

551
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,620
then we'll pretend to be targeted.

552
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,420
Let Lu Sheng play carry.

553
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,800
I don't care if it's real or fake.

554
00:39:07,890 --> 00:39:09,230
Next round, I will let them know

555
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,170
that I, Qi Yue, am not to be trifled with.

556
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,900
Qi Yue.

557
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,590
Next round is Polaris' game point.

558
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,810
I hope you can pull yourself together

559
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:24,890
and cooperate with us.

560
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,490
Do you understand?

561
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,560
Qi Yue, help me here.

562
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,940
Stop farming in the jungle, help me here.

563
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,840
We can attack at midlane, Qi Yue.

564
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:48,240
Protect Lu Sheng.

565
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,260
Shen Yue, you protect him.

566
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,500
Brother Qi, come to me.

567
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,660
-I'm coming.
-Qi Yue, where are you going?

568
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:54,400
Brother Qi is initiating at midlane.

569
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,560
I am going to kill the dragon.

570
00:39:55,650 --> 00:39:56,950
Why kill the dragon now?

571
00:39:57,050 --> 00:39:58,260
How to play bottom lane without gold?

572
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,600
There's someone at bottom.

573
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,940
We can push at mid.

574
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,840
-I'm caught.
-Help.

575
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,580
-Got it.
-This is a mess.

576
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,510
Shen Yue, come back!
You'll die if you go there.

577
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,870
-We can't take this wave.
-Brother Qi, go back.

578
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,460
[Qi Yue has been killed.]

579
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,730
[Three down at VNG's side.]

580
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,320
VNG is getting wrecked this round!

581
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,430
Qi Yue seems to be driven
by impulse in this team fight.

582
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,270
But, Qi Yue is totally suppressed.

583
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,640
He can't gank, so he's trying
his luck by killing the dragon.

584
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,000
It did seem like Qi Yue
was going for broke.

585
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,260
[But, have you noticed that]

586
00:40:25,350 --> 00:40:27,460
[VNG is not using Double Yue
this round anymore?]

587
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:30,850
[Yes, Ji Xiang Kong seems to be
using Qi Yue to lure his opponent.]

588
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,320
Let's see Lu Sheng's stats.

589
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,980
His stats are the highest in his team now.

590
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,580
Actually, it was probably better
for them to not fight the dragpn.

591
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,740
Yes, but Ji Xiang Kong, Tong Wu and
Lu Sheng are all at the bottom lane.

592
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,960
While Polaris is killing the dragon,
they could use this chance

593
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,370
[to destroy the outer turret.]

594
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,170
Qiu Ying's commentary
is getting better and better.

595
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:55,190
[Qiu Ying sabotages Mia Fu
and Ji Xiang Kong's relationship.]

596
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,100
[Now, she gets to be a commentator
all because of Ji Xiang Kong?]

597
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,300
Why are these people always up to no good?

598
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,730
Even if they're digging up dirt
between Ji Xiang Kong and Mia,

599
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,490
what does it have to do with Qiu Ying?

600
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:14,650
But,

601
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,450
how are Ji Xiang Kong and Mia related?

602
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,610
-Go!
-Attack!

603
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:26,820
Gather here, quick.

604
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,170
The other side is open.

605
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,700
Qi Yue, help us here.

606
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,880
Shen Yue, follow me.
-I know. I am following you.

607
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,630
[Another team fight at midlane.]

608
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,980
What does Qi Yue want to do?

609
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:38,240
He's diving, but
the carry can't follow him.

610
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,870
Replace Qi Yue next round.

611
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:41,850
Who'd replace him?

612
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,350
No. I've been caught.

613
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,380
Who can help me?

614
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,670
I'm coming.

615
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,200
-I'm holding him.
-Help, help.

616
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:54,840
Shen Yue. Where are you, Shen Yue?

617
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,370
Coming. Coming.

618
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,970
Polaris captures Qi Yue again.

619
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,910
What? Are you nervous because
there's a superstar down there?

620
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,500
Polaris's net worth is
much higher than VNG now.

621
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,690
If VNG is aced, there's no
chance for them to come back.

622
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,100
Coach. I need to answer this call.

623
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,320
Go.

624
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,590
Hey. What's wrong?

625
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,830
Lin Yi Xuan, I'm asking you this.

626
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,120
Do you know that Mia is
Ji Xiang Kong's first love?

627
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,500
Brother Kong and Mia? Really?

628
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,490
It's all over the Internet now!

629
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,000
No. Is it a joke?

630
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,550
Brother Kong is Mia's first love?

631
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,240
I might as well say I'm
Mia's long-lost brother.

632
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,150
Jerk, don't play dumb with me.

633
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,820
Why would I play dumb
with you, Reporter Lu?

634
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,410
Brother Kong is Mia's fan.

635
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,640
The whole team knows that.

636
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,570
So, Mia's watching the game live,

637
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,040
and then rumours of them
broke out on the Internet.

638
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,240
[This can't be a baseless rumour.]

639
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:11,220
Then, isn't it possible that
Mia's just a fan of VNG?

640
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,370
It can't be that simple.

641
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,490
Look at that photo of Mia hugging someone.

642
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,140
It's obviously Ji Xiang Kong!

643
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,890
There's even a photo?

644
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,420
Right now, there's also news
about Qiu Ying and Ji Xiang Kong.

645
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:26,470
All the netizens are accusing
Qiu Ying for being a third wheel.

646
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,490
[Listen, Lin Yi Xuan.]

647
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,540
If Qiu Ying gets bullied again,

648
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,600
you and Ji Xiang Kong will be so dead!

649
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,390
Wait. How is this related to me?

650
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,610
[Why are you angry with…]

651
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,020
Hello. Hello?

652
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,500
What's happening?

653
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,190
Seriously?

654
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,660
[Let's congratulate Polaris...]

655
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,120
Brother Kong lost?

656
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,730
[Congratulations to Polaris for
entering the winners bracket.]

657
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,310
Qi Yue made too many mistakes today.

658
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,280
That's how he is.

659
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,330
Once things spin out of control,

660
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,740
he can't control himself.

661
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,480
In the losers bracket, they have
to go back if they lose another game.

662
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:24,690
No, something's not right in this game.

663
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,210
I think there's something
wrong with Double Yue.

664
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:28,970
I've already alerted him.

665
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,750
If a person becomes too arrogant,

666
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,150
losing is a matter of time.

667
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,840
Pei Xi. What do you mean?

668
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:36,540
Don't forget that Brother Kong
has defeated you before.

669
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,430
Look who is saying
that he is too arrogant.

670
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,400
Yi Xuan.

671
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:41,630
Pei Xi is talking about Qi Yue.

672
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,370
He was the MVP every round.

673
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:46,120
He's consumed by arrogance and pride.

674
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,660
If he continues like this,

675
00:44:48,850 --> 00:44:50,390
the future is bleak for Double Yue.

676
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,120
Then, if Double Yue is over,

677
00:44:55,970 --> 00:44:57,120
what about Brother Kong?

678
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,370
I also want to see

679
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,240
how Ji Xiang Kong will handle this.

680
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:04,910
Thanks for watching today's competition.

681
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,460
-I am your commentator, Luo Tian.
-I am your commentator, Qiu Ying.

682
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,940
Summoners, see you in the next game.

683
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,160
Even without your notes,

684
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:20,220
it's not as hard as you think, right?

685
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,340
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

686
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,970
If it weren't for you,

687
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,390
I wouldn't have held on till now.

688
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,050
Commentating takes two.

689
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,940
One person can't do this.

690
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,470
Your performance today was excellent.

691
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:46,420
Xiang Kong, wait.

692
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,160
Please follow me down the stage.

693
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,820
Just a while, let's go.

694
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,870
Just a while.

695
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,760
[Xiang Kong is with us now.]

696
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,590
[We have a fan today
who's related to you.]

697
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:59,790
So, is there anything
you want to tell her?
