4
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,090
Xiang Kong, wait.

5
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,410
Please follow me down
the stage, just a while.

6
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,920
Let's go, just a while.

7
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,380
[Xiang Kong is with us now.]

8
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:54,140
[We have a fan today
who's related to you.]

9
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,890
So, is there anything
you want to tell her?

10
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,640
Wait, crew.

11
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,990
Let me ask Mia first.

12
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,920
Is there anything you want to say
about VNG's performance today?

13
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,170
Xiang Kong, keep it up.

14
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,570
Today's game was a pity.

15
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,780
But, I know you can
perform well next time.

16
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,950
[So, you still believe that
VNG will continue to perform?]

17
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,170
[Of course. I believe in Ji Xiang Kong.]

18
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,180
I will always stay by his side.

19
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,070
Even if he loses the game,

20
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,020
he is the greatest player in my heart.

21
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,720
[Now, I really feel like
digging some gossip here.]

22
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,140
[Why do I feel that your
relationship isn't quite ordinary?]

23
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,990
We grew up together

24
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,920
and achieved our dream together.

25
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,620

Go back and rest early.

[I didn't expect an interlude
like this at the end of the game.]

No wonder you weren't focused.

45
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
So, you're in a love triangle
with a singer and a commentator?

46

Qi Yue.

47
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,700
What nonsense are you spouting?

48
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,670
What?

49
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,450
Can't I scold him for letting
his love life influence the game?

50
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,880
Your superstar girlfriend
was watching your game

51
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,880
while your rumoured girlfriend
was commentating live.

52
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,540
Wow, what now?

53
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,700
Your frazzled nerves
made you a bigger klutz?

54
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,720
Qi Yue.

55
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,850
Stop shifting the blame.

56
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:36,990
Don't you know how we lost the game?

57
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,310
How dare you push me?

58
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,030
You think you really are
the best player in VNG?

59
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,600
Qi Yue, that's enough!

60
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,690
Brother Qi!

61
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,670
See that, Li Gan?

62
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,400
Your apprentice has
no regard for us at all.

63
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,070
Let go of him.

64
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,520
Sit down!

65
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,520
Master, Sister Wen.

66
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,550
The way we lost was just way too bizarre.

67
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,890
I didn't play well,

68
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,750
but there were too
many slip-ups in our tactics.

69
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,770
Ji Xiang Kong is...

70
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,870
I think you're still drunk.

71
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,720
Everyone's unhappy over today's loss.

72
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,030
Qi Yue, apologize to Sister Wen.

73
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,590
Sorry, I shouldn't have drunk.

74
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,280
I've been working outside,
and with my mum visiting,

75
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,920
I was under huge pressure.

76
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,050
That's why I drank too much.

77
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,560
I promise that next round...

78
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,650
Next round?

79
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,010
Are you going to play
in a hangover next round?

80
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,400
Or do you want to bring
your girlfriend on stage too?

81
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,980
I'm not against dating.

82
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,890
But please, don't let it
affect your performance.

83
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,120
All right, that's enough.

84
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,950
We're all tired, let's go back and rest.

85
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,370
We can talk it tomorrow.

86
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,350
What do you mean?

87
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,220
That's all you're doing?

88
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,160
Are you just going to cover up
for your apprentice like that?

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,480
None of us wanted to lose.

90
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,870
Qi Yue knows he's wrong now.

91
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,500
If he really knew he was wrong,

92
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,860
he wouldn't shift the
blame to Ji Xiang Kong!

93
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,620
Qi Yue.

94
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,470
From now on,

95
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,220
you're off the game.

96
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,280
Master, you want me on the bench too?

97
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,350
Ji Xiang Kong...

98
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,300
Qi Yue, stay off trouble for now.

99
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,370
Jerk.

100
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,040
Only you can date, and we can't.

101
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,320
Qi Yue.

102
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,200
You can waste your talent,

103
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,420
but I won't let you ruin VNG.

104
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,500
Shu Wen!

105
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:15,630
Must you do that?

106
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,480
We just lost one game,

107
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,950
and you're grounding Qi Yue.

108
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,780
Qi Yue is your apprentice.

109
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,550
But, even you don't know
what he's up to every day.

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,380
Li Gan.

111
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,980
VNG is my everything.

112
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,480
I won't let Qi Yue ruin it!

113
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,910
Yes, VNG is your everything.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,280
It's also my everything.

115
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,720
Remember, I'm the biggest shareholder!

116
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,240
Before you bench a player,

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,890
have you thought of discussing with me?

118
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,600
What do you take me as?

119
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,780
Fine.

120
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,930
You should also remember

121
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,110
that I am also VNG's coach.

122
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,409
I have the right to deal with players.

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,450
The biggest shareholder, are you?

124
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,940
If you have any problems,

125
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,560
just hold a shareholder's meeting.

126
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,790
I'll be glad to attend.

127
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,630
Master.

128
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,220
I won a lot of games for VNG.

129
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,770
I was the MVP so many times too.

130
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,140
I lost just one game,

131
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,560
and I'm getting benched.

132
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,400
Sister Wen is being unfair to me!

133
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,370
Qi Yue.

134
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,560
You'd better figure out
what you did wrong.

135
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,730
Otherwise, even I, your master,
won't be able to protect you.

136
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,510
Ji Xiang Kong!

137
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,540
When did you start dating Mia?

138
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,440
Did Mia come back to China because of you?

139
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,680
When will you announce your relationship?

140
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,190
-Say something.
-Everyone.

141
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,330
We have a lot of matches coming up.

142
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,630
Please let us go, we need to rest.

143
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,660
Okay?

144
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,700
Qiu Ying is here, quick!

145
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,830
Qiu Ying, you shameless third wheeler!

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,470
Everyone loves Mia, not you!

147
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,770
They are childhood sweethearts!

148
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,580
You sabotaged their relationship!

149
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,300
Xiang Kong!

150
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,660
I have never sabotaged any relationships.

151
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,970
I have never, and will never!

152
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,760
Please stay away from Ji Xiang Kong!

153
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:30,950
Stay away!

154
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,960
What are you doing?

155
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,230
Follow me.

156
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,590
Stay here!

157
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,980
I'm here.

158
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:04,980
Mr. Luo.

159
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,080
Thanks.

160
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,550
Leave your work behind for today.

161
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,560
Don't think about other stuff.

162
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,530
Rest well.

163
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,980
Sorry.

164
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,830
It's my fault.

165
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,860
I created such a mess.

166
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,440
You don't need to say sorry to anyone.

167
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,010
Don't let those crazy noises affect you.

168
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,500
He is my first love.

169
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:04,560
[Now that I have succeeded,]

170
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,740
[I can support him]

171
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,630
[and help him achieve his dream.]

172
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,360
[Xiang Kong said]

173
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,750
[he'd be with me forever.]

174
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,030
Yi Yi.

175
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,680
Why did you come?

176
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,720
If I don't come,

177
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,830
they'd have battered you.

178
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,230
Who would batter me?

179
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:00,210
How was my first commentary?

180
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,350
Don't change the topic.
I'm asking you this.

181
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,810
Did you know about Ji Xiang Kong
and Mia's relationship all along?

182
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,360
You took him to Mia's
fan meeting that day,

183
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,550
and you came back drenched.

184
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,680
Is it because of this?

185
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,360
Mia is Ji Xiang Kong's ex-girlfriend.

186
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,950
She's back for him now.

187
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,530
What does he take you as?

188
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:28,780
Lin Yi Xuan even said that he
booked a place at Secret Garden

189
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,100
to confess his love for you.

190
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,180
I thought he really liked you!

191
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,150
Yi Yi.

192
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,350
Maybe we misunderstood them

193
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,030
since the beginning.

194
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,650
You don't know

195
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,030
how much Mia and Ji Xiang Kong
have experienced together.

196
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,550
They've done so much for each other.

197
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,680
Back at the live games,

198
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,760
when Mia announced their relationship
in front of so many people,

199
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,530
I was really impressed.

200
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,010
Mia can really give up
everything for Ji Xiang Kong.

201
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,510
Wait.

202
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:13,140
Are you stupid?

203
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,300
She is your rival.

204
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,280
Why are you speaking for her?

205
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,410
I'm not speaking for anyone.

206
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,310
Maybe at the beginning,

207
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,500
when I mimicked Mia's dance,

208
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:30,130
Ji Xiang Kong noticed me.

209
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,790
A relationship like this...

210
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,580
Instead of suffering,

211
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,280
I'd rather give up early.

212
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,830
But...

213
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,480
Can you really let it go?

214
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,300
From now on,

215
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,900
I will channel all my energy into work.

216
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,500
Okay, as long as you're clear about it.

217
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,560
Qiu Ying.

218
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,480
When you become the best
commentator for iConquer,

219
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,180
you will have a stadium full of suitors.

220
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,830
Don't cry.

221
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,170
What did you buy?

222
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,330
Your gift.

223
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,480
But, you can't open it now.

224
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,680
Okay, I will deal with it

225
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,160
Yes, okay.

226
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:31,810
Yes.

227
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,730
It is my mistake.

228
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,980
Yes, it is my mistake.

229
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,280
I will handle this.

230
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,030
Yes.

231
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,110
Tony, Mia's lost tens of
thousands of fans on Weibo.

232
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,750
It's still dropping, and some of
them said they want Mia...

233
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,780
How about I explain everything on Weibo?

234
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,630
No, you can't say anything.

235
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,530
I'll handle this. Karen.

236
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,380
Issue a company statement now.

237
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,560
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

238
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,030
Hi, Mr. Li.

239
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,430
Yes, I'll handle it.

240
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,130
Yes, please give me two days.

241
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,440
Yes, it is my fault.

242
00:16:20,530 --> 00:16:21,410
Sorry.

243
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,280
Sorry.

244
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,690
Tony.

245
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,250
What did Mr. Li say?

246
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,630
He said the company wants
to stop producing your new album.

247
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,610
We've also lost some
business engagements.

248
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,730
Don't worry, though.

249
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,550
I'll get everything back.

250
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,550
Hi, yes.

251
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,660
Don't worry about the loss.

252
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,290
We will compensate.

253
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,540
Our next collaboration...

254
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,880
Sorry, I am so sorry.

255
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,930
I want to get some air outside.

256
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,630
Sorry, Tony.

257
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,130
Hello?

258
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,930
Eat up.

259
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,160
You eat first. I'm not hungry.

260
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,120
Brother Kong, what happened
between you and Mia?

261
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,530
Good job, though.

262
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,410
You even kept it from me.

263
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,070
Did you check your Weibo?

264
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,380
Mia lost tens of thousands
of fans in a few hours.

265
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,840
Qiu Ying has it worse.

266
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,650
Everyone's cursing her on Weibo.

267
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,930
Can you give me some peace and quiet?

268
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,340
I am worried about you.

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,190
Although you're my brother,

270
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,060
I'm on Qiu Ying's side this time.

271
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,050
It's not that I'm scared of Lu Yi Yi.

272
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,180
I just feel that you and Qiu Ying

273
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,500
are more compatible.

274
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,760
Put it down.

275
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,060
Don't bother me and go back to your room.

276
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,080
Okay, I won't bother you.

277
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,300
Enjoy your peace and quiet, okay?

278
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,180
Eat up.

279
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,850
[Xiang Kong.]

280
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,830
[Are you okay?]

281
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:24,510
Are you angry that
I created such a huge mess?

282
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,380
I am angry.

283
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:31,290
I'm angry because you
didn't discuss with me first.

284
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,310
At least I could have been prepared.

285
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,930
If I did discuss with you,

286
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,710
would you let me announce?

287
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,050
Mia.

288
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,300
I've been managing you for years.

289
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,550
You still don't trust me.

290
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,460
It's too late now.

291
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,310
You paid a huge price,

292
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,350
but you might not get what you want.

293
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,750
I've gone through so
many things with Xiang Kong.

294
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,930
No matter the result,

295
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,820
I will let everyone know about us.

296
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:06,490
Is it worth it?

297
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,680
For so many years,

298
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,030
I've been living in my
fans' fantasies and dreams.

299
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,720
I was scared that
someone would see through me.

300
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,070
I didn't want to let them down.

301
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,030
But, I want be myself.

302
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,680
I want to date like everyone else does.

303
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,950
When I decided to announce it,

304
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,730
I've prepared myself for the worst.

305
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,910
But, I dragged you down.

306
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,180
I will deal with our company.

307
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,750
We're dealing with
TV stations and ad agencies too.

308
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:09,050
Most importantly, your fans need to
accept your relationship with Xiang Kong.

309
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,080
You know better than me

310
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,030
judging from my current situation,

311
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,260
you don't have to go against
the company for my sake

312
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,860
and affect your future.

313
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,850
When you have no value,

314
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,270
I will naturally leave.

315
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,310
Tony.

316
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,280
I've known you for many years,

317
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,730
but I think I've never understood you.

318
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,980
Sometimes,

319
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,730
you are as cold as a stranger.

320
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,480
But now,

321
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,540
you are the only one
I can depend in adversity.

322
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,600
Qiu Ying.

323
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,410
Qiu Ying.

324
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,210
Can we talk?

325
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,130
♫ The most brilliant ♫

326
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,890
♫ And most beautiful vista I've seen ♫

327
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
I know you don't want to see me.

328
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:40,780
But, some things are not as you see.

329
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,380
♫ I've never anticipated like so ♫

330
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,300
Let us talk, Qiu Ying.

331
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,290
♫ If it weren't for ♫

332
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:52,130
♫ that hurried encounter ♫

333
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,450
♫ that appeared in this life ♫

334
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,380
♫ I would have been fearless ♫

335
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,900
♫ Unafraid of losing anything ♫

336
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,170
[Sorry, give me some time.]

337
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,450
[I will handle it.]

338
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,820
♫ Love is cautious ♫

339
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,180
♫ Wary of being expressed ♫

340
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,660
♫ A restless emotion ♫

341
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,890
♫ Love doesn't come easily ♫

♫ It's too pretty ♫

343

♫ Always the subject of obsession ♫

344

♫ I just want to feel secure ♫

345

♫ Just want to stay in your arms ♫

346
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,530
♫ Nowhere else ♫

Cry if you want.

348
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,900
You can ignore my presence.

349
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,660
Take a breather outside.

350
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,570
♫ Because it's you ♫

351
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:57,290
♫ I'll hug tightly no matter
how much it hurts ♫

352
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,450
Do you feel better?

353
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,170
You broke up with Ji Xiang Kong?

354
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,700
We

355
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,630
have never been together.

356
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,150
Great.

357
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,660
Now,

358
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,700
a lot of people are cursing you online.

359
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,360
Pei Xi.

360
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,410
I thought you only care about games,

361
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,100
and you wouldn't read such gossip online.

362
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,680
I only care about you.

363
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,260
And Ji Xiang Kong.

364
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,260
Pei Xi.

365
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,940
Thanks.

366
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,710
I feel much better now.

367
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,950
You have a game tomorrow.

368
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,310
Go back and rest.

369
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,940
I'm off.

370
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:09,930
Wait.

371
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,230
If you have the need,

372
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,210
I can be your boyfriend.

373
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,080
There are so many girls who like you.

374
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,030
You don't need to waste your time on me.

375
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,800
You think too much.

376
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,350
I don't like you.

377
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,760
I just don't want you
to bother Ji Xiang Kong.

378
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,700
Me?

379
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,760
Bother?

380
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,060
Ji Xiang Kong?

381
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,060
This is...

382
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,260
We don't have much time
to prepare for the games.

383
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,690
He's in the loser bracket now,

384
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,960
so he can't afford to lose.

385
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,850
This scandal will only affect him.

386
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,480
If I become your boyfriend,

387
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,460
the netizens will stop cursing you.

388
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:59,280
Then, he can focus on the game.

389
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,480
Pei Xi.

390
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,830
You're willing to be my boyfriend
for Ji Xiang Kong's sake?

391
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,750
You're thinking out of several boxes.

392
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,580
I admire him the most.

393
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:17,960
I hope to battle him
again in the tournament.

394
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,250
To the extent that
you can sacrifice yourself?

395
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,170
I'm not going to be
your real boyfriend, anyway.

396
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,180
I'm still willing to sacrifice a little.

397
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,950
Since you admire him so much,

398
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,290
why did you kick him out of Legends?

399
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:38,530
I didn't.

400
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,830
At first,

401
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,430
I joined Legends

402
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,360
because of him.

403
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,960
The only condition I stated then

404
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:50,570
was that Ji Xiang Kong
would remain as the captain.

405
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,010
But, Zhao Yang lied to me.

406
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,330
When I knew the truth and wanted to leave,

407
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:57,430
Ji Xiang Kong told me

408
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,070
about the responsibility
of a professional gamer.

409
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,290
I can't abandon my teammates at will.

410
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,430
Why didn't you explain?

411
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:09,600
You know, we all thought
it was you who drove him away.

412
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,100
I don't care about what others think.

413
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,370
I only want Ji Xiang Kong to know.

414
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,380
But, you all didn't give me
the chance to do so.

415
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,230
Say, back at Dream Traveler,

416
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,260
you brought snacks and drinks

417
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,330
just to talk to him?

418
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:38,330
Okay. Don't worry.

419
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:39,950
I won't bother him.

420
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,610
What will you do next?

421
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:51,010
How will you deal with everyone's doubts?

422
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:54,460
Maybe you do need a boyfriend

423
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,330
as a shield.

424
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,430
Even so, I don't need to trouble you.

425
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,180
Or,

426
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,880
you can be my guy friend.

427
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,210
What's with that face?

428
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,210
If only I brought a lollipop.

429
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,250
Lollipop?

430
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,530
I'm going back.

431
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:20,550
Go back in.

432
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,780
Turning off your phone
won't help you, Xiang Kong.

433
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,800
You need to face the problem.

434
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,930
I told her everything I should.

435
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,910
I don't know why she's still doing this.

436
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,510
You can't just let go of
a long relationship so easily.

437
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,990
What's more, she thinks that the problem

438
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,320
was because she couldn't
announce your relationship.

439
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,300
Brother Sun,
should I also tell everyone

440
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:10,670
that we've already broken up?

441
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:12,930
Do you think you could do this?

442
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,450
I heard that her company
terminated all her engagements.

443
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,730
If you tell everyone now

444
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,600
that you're through with her,

445
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:33,180
she would be the biggest joke in showbiz.

446
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,630
Her career would be ruined.

447
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,110
What about Qiu Ying?

448
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,900
She is innocent.

449
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,780
Three of you are innocent.

450
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,980
No matter what decision you make,

451
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,880
someone will get hurt.

452
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,180
Or even all three of you.

453
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,530
Focus on the playoffs.

454
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,700
It's not your fault that you lost.

455
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,750
Qi Yue's temper is terribly short.

456
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,060
Luckily, the problem is exposed now.

457
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,310
You should face it and deal with it.

458
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,780
But, you can't afford to lose anymore.

459
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:16,430
I know.

460
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm sure Sister Wen is
handling the most stress now.

461
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,130
Eat some fruits.

462
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,980
Eat up.

463
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,230
Listen, this joint is expensive.

464
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,950
I've researched for so long
just to bring you out for a meal.

465
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,250
Eat more. Do your best for me later.

466
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,410
I'm not in the mood to eat now.

467
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,790
I don't know if Qiu Ying
is feeling any better.

468
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,810
She is busy now.

469
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,250
I can't disturb her.

470
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:21,750
Brother Kong really kept his lips sealed.

471
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,180
Even when we're buddies,

472
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,460
he never told me
anything about him and Mia.

473
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:30,460
See, that guy is frightening.

474
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,000
He didn't even tell you.

475
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:37,250
You know, everyone is sharing
about Mia and Ji Xiang Kong's history,

476
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,680
like how they're childhood sweethearts

477
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,640
and when Mia was a trainee,

478
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:44,090
how much Ji Xiang Kong supported her.

479
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,780
It was Ji Xiang Kong's love
that elevated her to her dreams.

480
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,250
They separated for five years,

481
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,010
yet they never left each other,

482
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,830
and they're finally together for good.

483
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,060
It is like a romance novel.

484
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,740
They even want everyone to wish them well.

485
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,710
Let me see.

486
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:58,110
Come on.

487
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,920
There's even a video.

488
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,310
Brother Kong is such a loyal guy.

489
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,190
No wonder he never got
a girlfriend after all this while.

490
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,030
Loyal, my foot!

491
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,790
If he's loyal,

492
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,530
why did he disturb Qiu Ying?

493
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,060
Don't get mad.

494
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,040
Of course I'm on your side.

495
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,000
Right?

496
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,080
So what if you're on my side?

497
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,500
The problem is Ji Xiang Kong.

498
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:36,250
What does he take Qiu as?

499
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,890
Mia's substitute?

500
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,860
No.

501
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,150
I can guarantee on his behalf.

502
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,010
He's never made a move on any girl.

503
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,520
Really.

504
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,730
He must be truly in love with Qiu Ying,

505
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,520
or he won't decide to confess.

506
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,610
Now, Mia is confessing
and making statements.

507
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,990
If Ji Xiang Kong has
nothing to do with her,

508
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,760
why didn't he tell the truth?

509
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,160
Good for him now.

510
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,060
Everyone is saying that it was
Qiu Ying who sabotaged them.

511
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,460
They're all cursing her.

512
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,700
This is hard to solve.

513
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,080
Stuck between his new girl and old flame.

514
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,040
This is hard.

515
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,230
New girl and old flame?

516
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,830
Listen.

517
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,670
A man is known by the company he keeps.

518
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,880
You're no good either.

519
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,160
What does it have to do with me?

520
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,360
Pass him my message.

521
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,630
If I see someone cursing Qiu Ying,

522
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,910
I will take my revenge on Ji Xiang Kong!

523
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,740
It has nothing to do with me.
Don't get mad.

524
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,140
Excuse me, bill.

525
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,010
It's my treat today.

526
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,980
I don't need your treat!

527
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:43,700
This isn't right.

528
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,330
Mia and Ji Xiang Kong are compatible.

529
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,860
Someone wants to be the other woman.

530
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,280
They supported each other
through thick and thin.

531
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,510
It's almost impossible to split them,

532
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,480
but someone is trying
to steal for herself.

533
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,400
No matter how fickle in love
Ji Xiang Kong is,

534
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:13,940
he's just playing around.

535
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,929
Taking a fling as true love?

536
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,070
You should look at yourself first.

537
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,639
What are you talking about?

538
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,800
Have you looked through the data?

539
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:23,830
Yes.

540
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,800
Start the meeting.

541
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,760
Look, your fans are returning.

542
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,880
To think someone really understands me.

543
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,760
Public opinion is in our favour now.

544
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,770
Many artistes voiced out
their support for you too.

545
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:59,090
They say that everyone
should be free to date.

546
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,840
The fans can't control every
aspect of an artiste's life.

547
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:05,730
I can finally relax.

548
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,850
Thanks, Tony.

549
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,880
Thank yourself, too.

550
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,310
Everyone is impressed
by your persistence.

551
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,280
To be honest, I also am impressed.

552
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,760
I still must thank you for your hard work.

553
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,560
Tony.

554
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,280
Xiang Kong just lost.

555
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,180
Can I visit him?

556
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,060
Go.

557
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,890
Stay low and come back quickly.

558
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,780
-I'll get Karen to arrange.
-Okay.

559
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:37,600
This is the data of our training just now.

560
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,780
You haven't been training with us,

561
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,240
so there are quite some issues.

562
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,440
You're a speedy jungler,

563
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,210
but you're not good enough in support.

564
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,480
Shen Yue, practice with him
to improve your partnership.

565
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:48,450
Okay.

566
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,710
We don't have much time.

567
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:58,080
Well, did it go well?

568
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,730
Sister Wen.

569
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,880
Sister Wen.

570
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,400
Don't be nervous.

571
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,740
Just practice with everyone.

572
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,180
Mia is here.

573
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,730
Sister Wen, we're still in a meeting.

574
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,430
Then, we have training.

575
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,180
Okay.

576
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,890
I will take care of it for you.

577
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,730
Thank you, Sister Wen.

578
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,680
Go on.

579
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,610
Keep it up.

580
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,450
Let's go on.

581
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:49,990
Sister Wen.

582
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:52,660
Is Xiang Kong okay?

583
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,410
I couldn't contact him
for the past few days.

584
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,000
He lost back then.

585
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,180
I am worried about him.

586
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,880
He's good.

587
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,230
Don't worry.

588
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,450
But, VNG is in the losers' bracket now.

589
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,710
The next game is important for us.

590
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,850
We can't distract the players.

591
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,230
Sister Wen, I just want
to tell him something.

592
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,060
It won't take long.

593
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:23,300
But VNG is in closed training.

594
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,570
Xiang Kong is the captain
and should be leading by example.

595
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,630
Please understand.

596
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,630
You can talk to him after the game.

597
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,950
Okay?

598
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,460
I really don't know how to
express my gratitude to you.

599
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,110
You don't need to.

600
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,980
I like the thermos you gave me.

601
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,300
Qiu Ying.

602
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,480
Mr. Luo.

603
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,930
I found your notebook.

604
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,270
Where did you find it?

605
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,290
The cleaner found it in the garbage can.

606
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,590
But we don't know who tore it up.

607
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:17,930
The garbage can?

608
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,280
I spent so much time
just to take these notes.

609
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,110
Try checking what you can salvage.

610
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,530
We'll talk about it later.

611
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,100
Get ready for the game.

612
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,500
I'll be right back.

613
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:45,480
I'll get ready, too.

614
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,640
Sure, let's watch the game together.

615
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:11,350
I'll bring you there.

616
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,360
Qiao Xin.

617
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:15,230
Mr. Luo.

618
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,880
You can go home. You're not hosting today.

619
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:21,930
Go home?

620
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,850
Why?

621
00:39:25,350 --> 00:39:26,180
Yeah, Mr. Luo.

622
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,030
Qiao Xin is doing really well lately.

623
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,430
That's why I...

624
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:31,410
Why?

625
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:34,830
Do you need a reason
for a normal transfer?

626
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,330
Mr. Luo!

627
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,300
Why, Luo Tian...

628
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,430
What did you do to offend him?

629
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,630
Mr. Luo, I am ready.

630
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,750
Okay.

631
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:02,320
Tell me if you have any problems.

632
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,920
Don't let other people bully you.

633
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,860
Let's start.

634
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,250
Okay?

635
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:23,830
Hello, welcome to the Fall
Championship playoffs of iConquer.

636
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,740
I am today's commentator, Luo Tian.

637
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,030
Hello, I'm today's commentator, Qiu Ying.

638
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,920
Today, Legends and Dragons
will be battling against each other.

639
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,600
The losing team will proceed
into the losers' bracket

640
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,880
and compete against VNG.

641
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:37,010
Yeah, so Qiu Ying,

642
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:39,800
which team do you think have
better winning odds today?

643
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:42,430
Mr. Luo, this is a difficult question.

644
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,260
I can't afford to offend
two excellent teams.

645
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:48,730
Dragons' performance in the
season has been outstanding.

646
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,550
They have a unique playing style.

647
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:54,280
Their top laners have the highest
net worth ratio in professional gaming.

648
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,460
Their core is also resilient.

649
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,960
It has been a difficult
season for Legends.

650
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,520
They have undergone
a change of captain twice.

651
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,490
But, as the season continued,

652
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,790
they've gotten used to
Pei Xi's four-protect-one tactic.

653
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,440
Yes, today's encounter
between Legends and Dragons

654
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:13,230
will be an unusual game
in this tournament.

655
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,880
Let's pass the floor to Can,
who's on the stage now.

656
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,110
Hit it, go!

657
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,130
Wait, I'm here!

658
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,440
Lu Feng, output!

659
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:34,640
Go!

660
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,240
-Come on, attack!
-Midlane, here!

661
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,630
-Lu Feng, here!
-I'll go around the back.

662
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,480
Go, we can win this!

663
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:46,800
Attack!

664
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,630
Sir, you've had much today.

665
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,330
We're closing soon too, so...

666
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,660
What?

667
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,610
You think I can't pay?

668
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,090
I don't mean...

669
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,080
Even you look down on me!

670
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,540
Qi Yue!

671
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,330
Stop drinking.

672
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,880
Sorry, I'll take care of him.

673
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,030
How do you know I'm here?

674
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,580
Aren't you with some other guy?

675
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,580
Didn't you say I have no future?

676
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,650
Qi Yue.

677
00:42:56,250 --> 00:43:00,110
You should know how I feel
about you all these years.

678
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,380
I do want to stand out.

679
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,980
But in the end,

680
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,430
everything I do is for our future.

681
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,450
I can't leave you, especially now.

682
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,480
Unless...

683
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,430
You don't want to see me.

684
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,250
I'll leave.

685
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,240
-Qi Yue.
-Don't leave me.

686
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,260
I have nothing if you leave.

687
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,700
We are alike.

688
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,130
Both of us want to stand out.

689
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,360
But, we are ignored.

690
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:55,280
Everyone looks down on me.

691
00:43:57,230 --> 00:43:59,130
Only you treat me best.

692
00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:02,930
Watch out.

693
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,780
How could they look down on you?

694
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,590
VNG is what it is today

695
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,710
because of you!

696
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:16,830
In the end?

697
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,190
They made you a substitute.

698
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,500
Since they treat me like this,

699
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,680
there's nothing worthwhile for me here.

700
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,400
I'll just leave them.

701
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,860
Are you stupid?

702
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,530
If VNG win,

703
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,100
the honour will be Ji Xiang Kong's.

704
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,230
You won't have anything to do with it.

705
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,640
Do you want to see
something that's rightly yours

706
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,330
get snatched away?

707
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:51,940
If they want to win,

708
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,780
it should be you
who will lead them to win!

709
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,630
I have an idea.

710
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,310
Do you want to try?

711
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:17,800
Master, I am back.

712
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,560
It was my fault back then.

713
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,930
I made you argue with Sister Wen.

714
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:29,030
I promise.

715
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,030
I won't drink anymore.

716
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:36,930
Qi Yue.

717
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,640
I trained you myself.

718
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:40,110
I trust you the most.

719
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:42,530
You should know how VNG is faring now.

720
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,590
I've been thinking for
the past few days too.

721
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,230
Had you not let me join VNG,

722
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,960
I wouldn't have achieved my dream
of becoming a professional gamer.

723
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,200
VNG are in the playoffs now.

724
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,860
We're just one step away
from becoming the champion.

725
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,150
So, as long I can help,

726
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,710
I will listen to everything you say.

727
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:07,000
Master, forgive me.

728
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,570
It's good that you thought it through.

729
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,190
Yesterday, Dragons lost to Legends.

730
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,880
We'll be facing Dragons since
they're in the losers' bracket too.

731
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,080
It is our only chance.

732
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,340
Master.

733
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,230
I've watched videos of
Dragons' matches lately.

734
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:25,910
I'd like to share my
opinions with everyone.

735
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,240
You haven't eaten yet?

736
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,360
Sit down and eat.

737
00:46:29,650 --> 00:46:30,800
We'll talk in the meeting.

738
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:44,010
Mr. Guo.

739
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,030
Have a seat.

740
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,840
What is it?

741
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,280
You replaced Qiao Xin?

742
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,880
Why?

743
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,780
It's just a normal transfer.

744
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,880
In rule, I shouldn't interfere
in commentating work.

745
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,960
But, Qiao Xin has been
performing well there.

746
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:01,980
She's popular, too.

747
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,380
You had her replaced.

748
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,680
I can't accept your reason.

749
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:10,310
We trained Qiao Xin
together with You Xing.

750
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,430
You should give her more chance.

751
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,580
I'll give her when she's capable enough.

752
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,200
Luo Tian.

753
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:20,740
Commentating is our main trade.

754
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,330
Capabilities are important,

755
00:47:23,530 --> 00:47:25,550
but ethics are just as crucial.

756
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,580
You must have heard about it.

757
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:30,150
Qiu Ying's ethics is a problem.

758
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,370
Mr. Guo, these are rumours.

759
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,730
I don't care about rumours or truths.

760
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,280
I only care about GDV's reputation.

761
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,570
With so much negative press out there,

762
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,280
can you guarantee Qiu Ying's work quality?

763
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,360
If there are any problems
in Qiu Ying's performance,

764
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,960
I will take the responsibility.

765
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:52,860
Luo Tian.

766
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,110
Business is business.

767
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,180
I don't want you to bring
your emotions into work.

768
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:02,880
Mr. Guo, I don't understand you.

769
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:12,930
I've never seen you
so concerned about someone.

770
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,330
Mind you, she's just a new commentator.

771
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,080
Qiao Xin, you're early.

772
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:24,380
Good morning.

773
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,280
How's your preparation?

774
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:27,480
Almost there.

775
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,740
Have you heard the news?

776
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,450
Something happened at VNG.

777
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,000
What happened?

778
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,480
Ji Xiang Kong fainted in the meeting room.

779
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:38,150
Shu Wen is going mad.

780
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,290
That serious?

781
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,960
Don't they have a game tomorrow?

782
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,910
Looks like Ji Xiang Kong
can't play tomorrow.

783
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,130
VNG is in danger.

784
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,860
What will they do?

785
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:51,780
What a pity.

786
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,030
Why won't you pick up?
