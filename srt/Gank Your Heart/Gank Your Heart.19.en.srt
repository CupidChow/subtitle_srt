00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,920
Where are you going, Mr. Zhao?

5
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:42,970
Yes, exactly.

6
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,870
-Aren't you something?
-Don't touch me.

7
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,590
-Don't move.
-Where are you going?

8
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,870
-I said, don't touch me.
-Why are you running?

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,670
-Where are you going?
-Yes, where?

10
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,170
-Don't touch me.
-Stand still.

11
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,150
Don't touch me! No one can't touch me!

12
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,250
Shut it!

13
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,310
Stop!

14
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,509
What are you guys doing?

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,980
Causing a riot?

16
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,160
Stand still.

17
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,009
See that?

18
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,389
These are your students.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,760
Is this necessary? Must you be so mean?

20
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,170
Get lost!

21
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,840
Coach.

22
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,940
Watch your step, Mr. Zhao!

23
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,890
So long, Mr. Zhao.

24
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,430
You guys are getting brazen now.

25
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,470
No, Coach. We're not.

26
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,920
-We were just kidding.
-Shut it.

27
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,120
All of you,

28
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,480
including you.

29
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,710
Get to the field
and do 50 laps each at once.

30
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,940
Immediately!

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,390
Fifty laps?

32
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,540
Now!

33
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,680
Let's go.

34
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,710
So energetic.

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,910
Was 50 laps too little?

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,210
Let's take a break.

37
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,110
Take a break. I can't run anymore.

38
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,120
Brother Yao, about today...

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,890
We're still buddies.

40
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,700
Today, I finally got to resolve
this grievance that I've kept in my heart.

41
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,750
We gave that sly Zhao Yang
a good beating today.

42
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,710
But the way Pei Xi stood up
against Zhao Yang today

43
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,730
felt as if he had a grudge against him.

44
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,110
Either they turned against each other

45
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,930
or Pei Xi kicked him when he's down.

46
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,820
Hey, Pei Xi. Pei...

47
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,240
Coach Luo punished us.
Why are you running too?

48
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,630
I was the one who tripped him up.

49
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,240
He did?

50
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,040
Come on.

51
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,900
Our captain is great.

52
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:32,980
Look, Captain.

53
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,710
Zhao Yang deserves getting arrested.

54
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,290
Yes, he deserves it.

55
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,460
This feels great!

56
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,630
Yes, I never expected Zhao Yang
from Legends to be so evil.

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,590
-The article written by Lu Yi Yi is great.
-Of course.

58
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,480
Look how much Lu Yi Yi helped us.

59
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,510
Brother Kong and Qiu Ying
are finally avenged.

60
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,180
Zhao Yang deserved it.

61
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,320
Way to go.

62
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,740
Not bad. It looks pretty neat.

63
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,880
Really?

64
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,180
Great. Then I'll show this
to Mr. Luo tomorrow.

65
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,470
By the way, tell me.

66
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,420
How did you move
the unapproachable Mr. Luo?

67
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,940
What do you mean "move"?

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,840
You have no idea how badly he scolded me.

69
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,260
This was how he reacted.

70
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,840
He was like this.

71
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:35,770
"Qiu Ying's commentary
can't be called a commentary."

72
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,000
"You."

73
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,610
"You're just retelling everything
others have seen."

74
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:44,170
"Don't show me something
so meaningless next time."

75
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,860
You're pretty good at imitating him.

76
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,070
You still want to show him the video
after he scolded you?

77
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:53,500
As long as he's willing to watch it,
he can scold me however he likes.

78
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,170
How about this?

79
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,410
I'm pretty close with Mr. Luo.

80
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,260
Want me to pull a few strings for you?

81
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,700
I wonder who told me this?

82
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,970
"Our industry doesn't need
an opportunistic pretty face."

83
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,490
Who said that?
That person has poor judgment.

84
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,510
What a shallow and childish thing to say.

85
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,020
If I know who said it, I'll make them pay.

86
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,500
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

87
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,260
We only have one cake left.

88
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,290
Since you two are a couple,
why don't you share it?

89
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,070
No.

90
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,060
You got the wrong idea.
We're not a couple.

91
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,470
It's fine.

92
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,240
You can still share it
even though you're not a couple.

93
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,250
Enjoy.

94
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,310
Thank you.

95
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,560
I think you should have it.

96
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,960
It's a strawberry cake.
It's your favorite.

97
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,420
You should have it.

98

How can a gentleman make a girl starve?

99
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:59,940
How about sharing it like he said?

100
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,480
I've cut the cake.

You split a perfect heart into halves.

106

How should I have cut it then?

167
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,730
These dishes are so cute.

168
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,390
Luckily it's not so crowded today.

169
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,680
We went on so many rides this morning.

170
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,590
After this meal,
let's go on the TRON Lightcycle Power Run.

171
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:59,180
What's wrong? You can handle it.

172
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,680
But I didn't expect to have
such a good time with you today.

173
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,830
That really exceeded my expectations.

174
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,240
Really?

175
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:11,450
I'm willing to do anything
as long as you're happy.

176
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,860
Eat up.

177
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,160
Right. I saw some tourists
taking part in a first-time event.

178
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,070
All you have to do is share
fun moments at the theme park online.

179
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,290
Really? That sounds fun.

180
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,540
Since we took so many photos,
let's take part as well.

181
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,910
Sure.

182
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,300
I think this photo is great.

183
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,260
Let's name it

184
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:54,170
"Lighting up the fairy tale world
for the first time".

185
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,710
That's a good one. Use this.

186
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,560
Okay. Let me look through some more.

187
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,650
I think this one's pretty good too.

188
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,890
You even closed your eyes.

189
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,140
Let's go with this.

190
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,660
Let's name it

191
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,050
"So dazzling that I can't open my eyes
for the first time".

192
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,530
You want to use my ugly photo?

193
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,860
You have ugly photos as well.

194
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,530
Show me then.

195
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,110
There are plenty.

196
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,630
Tell me then.

197
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,510
Are you really not afraid of
going on these rides?

198
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,720
I'm not.

199
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,740
I've told you. I'm not afraid.

200
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,230
Is that so?

201
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,680
Look at this photo of you.

202
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,570
You looked so nervous.

203
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:45,480
And you teased me for closing my eyes?
You did too.

204
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,220
That was a coincidence.

205
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,090
But so is this. Coincidence, you say?

206
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,720
Fine. Fine.

207
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,350
Actually,

208
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,390
you're not as bold as you said.

209
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,720
You only went on the rides because of me.

210
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,730
It wasn't entirely because of you.

211
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,460
Ji Xiang Kong.

212
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,180
Thank you.

213
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:25,870
Thanks to you being here.

214
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,940
That's why I had the courage

215
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:32,340
to go on so many rides for the first time
that I never had the guts to try.

216
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,370
Plus,

217
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,130
I had you beside me.

218
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,780
While I screamed,

219
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,860
I felt relieved.

220
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,460
All of my worries got swept away.

221
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,390
I hope you felt the same.

222
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,410
I hope you face future competitions
with fighting spirit.

223
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,050
You were so scared,
yet you stayed with me

224
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:05,330
just to cheer me on.

225
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,700
Qiu Ying.

226
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:08,550
I should be thanking you instead.

227
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,120
Wait here.

228
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,010
Where are you going?

229
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,150
Mickey.

230
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:25,930
Oh my!

231
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:29,840
May I...

232
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,510
May I take a picture with you?

233
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,140
That's great!

234
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,230
Teach me how to pose.

235
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,700
Go, ducky!

236
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,970
Thank you, Daisy.

237
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,080
Thank you so much.

238
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,020
Today is such a perfect day.

239
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,970
I got to take pictures
with so many Disney friends.

240
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,420
Bye bye.

241
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:19,600
You think it's perfect already?

242
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,900
Isn't your princess dream
a little too small?

243
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,330
Oh my. Are these...

244
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,400
Are these for me?

245
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,750
You've been staring at them
the moment we entered Disneyland.

246
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,940
I saw it.

247
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,670
Thank you.

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,480
This, too.

249
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,750
I guess my dream to be a princess
has finally come true today.

250
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,390
Princess Qiu Ying.

251
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,770
This is just the beginning
of your princess dream.

252
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:09,950
♫ If ♫

253
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,300
Come with me.

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,609

♫ I can't be alone ♫

259
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,470
It's the carousel.

260
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,180
♫ That means you ♫

261
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,150
Princess Qiu Ying, your carriage is ready.

262
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,770
Come with me.

263
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:48,350
Let's go.

264
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,090
♫ How come it's sunny all day? ♫

265
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,620
♫ How come the desert
is full of flowers? ♫

266
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,180
♫ Because of you ♫

267
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,730

00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,940
♫ Is enough ♫

283
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:11,680
Qiu Ying.

284
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:15,030
Your look tells me
that you're imagining things again.

285
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,430
No, I wasn't.

286
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:24,440
I was thinking,
we went on so many exciting rides.

287
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,250
It's been really fun.

288
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:31,350
How about going on
the TRON Lightcycle Power Run now?

289
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,520
I don't want you to leave with regrets.

290
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,690
Aren't you afraid? Don't force yourself.

291
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,870
As long as you're here,
I have nothing to fear.

292
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,160
My knight, Ji Xiang Kong.

293
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,450
This is an order from Princess Qiu Ying.

294
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,730
As you wish, Your Highness.

295
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,020
No, I'm not afraid!

296

Has your dream come true today?

303
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,410
Not yet.

304
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,720
I wish that you'll join the competition
with no worries.

305
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,570
You can do it!

306
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,770
Don't worry.

307
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,280
I will reclaim my title as the champion.

308

Ji Xiang Kong.

Well, I...

317
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,920
I was thinking about life.

318
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,220
No, wait.

319
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,150
Let's have a chat.

320
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,230
Make it quick. Don't delay my bedtime.

321
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,100
Well...

322
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,890
Thank you.

323
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,700
Hang on. Don't get me wrong.

324
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,270
Not for putting me back on the team.
I couldn't be bothered coming back.

325
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,550
-If it weren't for Coach Luo...
-Just spit it.

326
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,540
I heard that

327
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:03,760
you secretly did a lot
to bring Zhao Yang to justice.

328
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,070
So I want to thank you for fighting for
justice and putting your interests aside.

329
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,670
Putting my interests aside?

330
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,340
I mean,

331
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,010
I just want to apologize.

332
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,470
I was mistaken.

333
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,970
I thought you were like Zhao Yang.

334
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,650
So

335
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,640
you admit that you were blind?

336
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,230
You were blind. However,

337
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,480
this doesn't mean we've reconciled.
Got it?

338
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,750
That's another thing.

339
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,000
After all,
Brother Kong left because of you.

340
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,190
I'll never forgive you for that. Okay?

341
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:35,920
In the future, we'll go about
our own business as usual.

342
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,980
You...

343
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,140
It's for you.

344
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,700
Thank you.

345
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,590
Lu Yi Yi, look what you've done.

346
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,620
Thanks to the article you wrote,

347
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,080
the whole magazine
is swamped with work again.

348
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,630
What am I supposed to say to you?

349
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,010
-I'm sor...
-What's the point of saying sorry?

350
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,040
Mr. Ren.

351
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,500
[Lu Yi Yi works at your magazine, right?]

352
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,780
Yes, sir.

353
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,940
[She's the one who wrote
the article again, isn't she?]

354
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,500
Yes, that's right. It's Lu Yi Yi again.

355
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,940
[Well, I think the article was great.]

356
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,020
[Our company has decided
to grant more funds to your magazine]

357
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,040
[to make your investigation work easier.]

358
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,500
Really?

359
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,700
Alright.

360
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,590
We will take note. Yes, sir.

361
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,610
Alright. Bye, Mr. Ren.

362
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,320
Director Shi.

363
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,910
It was all my fault.

364
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,890
I'm willing to take full responsibility.

365
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,290
You do?

366
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,750
How so?

367
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,420
I...

368
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,530
What now?

369
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,210
You want to run off after causing trouble?

370
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,460
Then who's going to clean up the mess?

371
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,900
What do you want me to do?

372
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,540
Just now, Mr. Ren

373
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,380
complimented your article and said
it received praise across the industry.

374
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:28,830
He wants us to ride the wave
and do a cover story in the next issue.

375
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:36,090
They are even granting us extra funds
for interviews and fieldwork.

376
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,810
Really?

377
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,880
Thank you, Director Shi.

378
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,430
Here, take this.

379
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,720
If it weren't for you,

380
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,420
our magazine might carry on idling away.

381
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,460
Then we'd shut down in a few years
when we can't run it anymore.

382
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,840
The future of the magazine
depends on all of you.

383
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,800
Don't worry, Director Shi.

384
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,420
Leave it to us.

385
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,100
We will work hard!

386
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,210
-Keep it up.
-Yes, sir!

387
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,920
What's your problem?

388
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,220
That 8 minutes 45 seconds team battle.
Three opponents were badly hurt.

389
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:34,030
You were in ideal state and position.
Why didn't you pursue it?

390
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,540
They entered the tower.
I would've died if I dived.

391
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:37,950
Are you such a coward?

392
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,630
For me, this is just a job.

393
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,440
Why take it so seriously?

394
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,990
You're right. Why take it so seriously?

395
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,510
We've played basketball for half a month,
but you've never scored a goal.

396
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,530
You are the captain.

397
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,470
I had to humor you.

398
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,000
I thought too highly of you.

399
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,790
You seriously think I can't defeat you?

400
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,750
I know.

401
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,110
You went against orders once
and tower dived.

402
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,680
You lost the game
and got kicked out of the team.

403
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:25,420
You switched to four different teams
after that. None of them let you play Mid.

404
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,100
I can't do it anymore.

405
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,730
I can't.

406
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,020
The chance is right in front of you.
It's up to you to seize it.

407
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,160
[2018 iConquer Fall Championship]

408
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,030
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

409
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,670
I am Luo Tian, your host for today.

410
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,060
Hello, everyone.
I am Can, your host for today.

411
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,680
After a short break,

412
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:14,110
The 2018 iConquer Fall Championship
Regular Season has begun as scheduled.

413
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,380
The strong teams are gathered again
at this championship.

414
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,460
They are also destined
to face a fierce battle.

415
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,320
Points system will continue to be used.

416
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,590
The top four will advance to the playoffs
and compete for the championship title.

417
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,630
The champion team will get tickets
that lead them straight to

418
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,960
the International Championship
in Vancouver!

419
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,360
Is everyone excited about it?

420
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,100
Let's have the two teams
for the opening match.

421
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,780
The glorious team, Polaris,

422
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,260
and the team that never gives up, Legends!

423
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,980
Let's welcome them!

424
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,210
Without further ado,

425
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,600
we announce that the game
officially begins!

426
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:14,850
We'll be facing Polaris
in our first round-robin match.

427
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,310
I'd like to hear your opinions.

428
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:20,830
Stick to the old rule.
Four protect one. I'll play Mid.

429
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,410
It's a safe strategy.

430
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:26,070
Legends used this strategy earlier
and won.

431
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,550
Tong Wu, what do you think?

432
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,240
I'm fine with the plan.

433
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,910
What about you, Lu Sheng?

434
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,780
I want to hear
the captain's opinion first.

435
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,740
We couldn't even achieve
his plan in a month.

436
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,100
Why bother listening to him?

437
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,910
I won't embarrass myself in the game.

438
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,760
I think we should focus on Champion
selections for our match against Polaris.

439
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,900
How so?

440
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,390
At the start of the Fall Championship,
most teams will use their previous Champion.

441
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,910
If we team up using new Champions,

442
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,230
they can't figure out our tactical plan.

443
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,510
So they'll play safe.

444
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,750
First, we encircle them
and attack the sides.

445
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,780
Once they come to defend,
we'll destroy the tower in Mid-lane.

446
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:18,420
Qi Yue, how's your training using Xin?

447
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,800
Sister Wen, I am strongly against
the use of new Champions.

448
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:30,220
It's the Fall Championship,
not closed beta test.

449
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,460
We're also not familiar
with the new Champions.

450
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,660
Don't joke around with my career.

451
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:38,270
Even if I do,
I wouldn't put VNG on the line.

452
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,170
We must use new Champions
and form new pairings.

453
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,250
We might not win
if we stick to the old strategy.

454
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,200
If we lose,
it's because of your lousy skill.

455
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,520
Captain is right.

456
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:53,800
I think it gives us more advantage
to use new Champions as soon as possible.

457
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,570
Even if Polaris doesn't use
a new champion this round,

458
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,080
other teams might do it in the next.

459
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,810
If that's the case,
we'll be losing out from the start.

460
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,830
Why are you so full of bull lately?

461
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,550
Mind your own business.

462
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,800
If you're afraid to play Mid using Xin,

463
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,920
-Just say it. I'll play.
-What do you mean?

464
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,100
Enough.

465
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:14,440
Sit down.

466
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,470
Qi Yue.

467
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,840
Sit down.

468
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,980
We do gain more advantage
using new Champions sooner.

469
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:35,730
This time, we will train
according to Xiang Kong's plan.

470
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,240
So what now?

471
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,700
You are all teaming up to go against me?

472
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,250
Sister Wen, you are a professional coach.

473
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,850
Can't you tell
that this is a ridiculous strategy?

474
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:48,890
Do you really want to see
VNG get embarrassed in public?

475
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,050
Mind your manners.

476
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,790
Qi Yue.

477
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:59,010
This isn't your competition alone.

478
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,750
And please master your new Champion

479
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,390
before you come telling me
about what's embarrassing.

480
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,880
Keep in mind.

481
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,210
You are a professional player.

482
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,540
Meeting dismissed.

483
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:27,960
Captain, we'll be training.

484
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,320
Thanks.

485
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,790
You're welcome, buddy.

486
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,760
Shu Wen.

487
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,610
Take it easy.

488
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,940
I'll make sure Qi Yue trains hard.

489
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,570
I finally get it.

490
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,960
He doesn't listen
to anyone in VNG but you.

491
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,070
Qi Yue was out of line earlier.

492
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,410
But don't you think that
you're trusting Ji Xiang Kong too much?

493
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,180
We've worked together for so long.
Don't you know my style?

494
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:23,130
Once I've picked someone,
I'll put my faith in them.

495
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,050
But it's too risky this time.
It's unlike our style.

496
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,320
So sorry, then.

497
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,780
-It is now.
-Shu Wen.

498
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:33,470
From now on, VNG stops playing safe.

499
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,230
This is what I hope.

500
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,470
-Shu Wen.
-I have work to do.

501
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,480
Go to bed.
It's our first match tomorrow morning.

502
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,100
Just a while more.
It's our first match after all.

503
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,850
Don't push yourself so hard.

504
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,670
No one will blame you even if we lose.

505
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,880
Go to bed. The most important thing
is being in top condition.

506
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,350
Alright.

507
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,720
Thank you.

508
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,940
What for?

509
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,750
It isn't your competition alone.

510
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:14,400
Sleep well.

511
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,179
Good night.

512
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,199
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

513
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,790
I'm your old friend, Luo Tian.

514
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,080
Hello, everyone. I'm your old friend, Can.

515
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,190
The teams that will be battling later
are VNG and Polaris.

516
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,100
VNG has gone through
major personnel changes.

517
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:57,870
Their main player changed from Pei Xi,
who plays Mid,

518
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,250
to the controversial Ji Xiang Kong.

519
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:04,250
Will VNG collapse
due to Pei Xi's departure,

520
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,790
or be reborn with Battlefield Trickster
joining the team?

521
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,680
Let us wait and see.

522
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:12,750
Let's welcome both teams!

523
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:13,800
Welcome!

524
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,150
We have a passionate crowd today.

525
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,150
Without further ado,
the game official begins!

526
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,660
Players, please take your seats.

527
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:50,540
Fat Cat, which team do you think will win?

528
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:53,400
It's hard to say. It depends on
what Champion they picked.

529
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,210
I think Ji Xiang Kong will win.

530
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:03,650
His strategies are mysterious and
unpredictable. Players like him are rare.

531
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,150
That might not be the case.

532
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,140
Just wait and see.

533
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:15,310
Pei Xi.

534
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,920
Both teams are at the pick-ban segment.

535
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,600
Let us see who everyone chose.

536
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,290
[Okay, let's take a look at VNG.]

537
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,800
[Qi Yue chose Xin.]

538
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,920
[That is unlike him.]

539
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,500
[Yes. He seldom chooses...]

540
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,780
They'll lose.

541
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:35,770
That can't be. They've barely started.

542
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,750
Pei Xi is always right.

543
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,910
Just wait and see.

544
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,800
[I hope he'll surprise us.]

545
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,310
Don't you have a match later?

546
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,160
Why aren't you getting ready?

547
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,800
I am getting ready.

548
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,170
Lu Sheng. Hold back.
Don't fight with them.

549
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,590
-Got it.
-Shen Yue, assist Qi Yue at Mid-lane.

550
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,970
-There are two people across.
-I'll hold them off.

551
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:08,110
Hurry up, Shen Yue.

552
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,250
Okay.

553
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,930
Qi Yue, watch your own back.

554
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,250
Shen Yue.

555
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,660
Shen Yue!

556
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,650
What took you so long?

557
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,230
Sorry, Brother Qi.

558
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,380
[Polaris is starting
to destroy the crystal.]

559
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:41,390
[Polaris has destroyed VNG's crystal.
Nice one!]

560
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,760
[Congratulations to Polaris on
the first victory in the Regular Season.]

561
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,020
-[Congratulations!]
-[It ended too fast.]

562
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,670
The match seemed to be
beyond our expectations.

563
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,900
It was so short.

564
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,850
[Yes. It was over
before we got enough of it.]

565
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,910
Are you happy now?

566
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,810
[Hopefully VNG can adjust themselves]

567
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:03,590
[and show us a more exciting performance.]

568
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:11,250
It's just the first round.
They need time to familiarize themselves.

569
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,960
But Pei Xi's team
won during the first round.

570
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,640
-Go away. It's none of your business.
-Exactly.

571
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,030
Ji Xiang Kong doesn't care about
winning this round.

572
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,580
What do you mean?

573
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,130
I have to go.

574
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,820
Sit back and watch me win
two rounds in a row.

575
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,800
Good luck, Pei Xi.

576
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,110
Brother Qi.

577
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,040
Calm down.

578
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,490
Are you alright, Brother Kong?

579
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,180
I'm good. It's not a big deal.

580
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,740
You guys are up later.

581
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,010
Good luck.

582
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:05,240
Xiang Kong, keep it up.
We're waiting for you to turn the tables.

583
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,230
I will.

584
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,360
Pei Xi.

585
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,440
You've done a great job this season.

586
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,300
Thank you, Sister Wen.

587
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,680
Good luck.

588
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,670
Let's go.

589
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,520
[Keep it up! A single match
doesn't define anything.]

590
00:39:36,690 --> 00:39:37,880
[I believe in you.]

591
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,460
[Don't worry.]

592
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,170
What's going on?

593
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:30,200
They lost again.

594
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,860
What's going on with VNG today?

595
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,150
They've lost four rounds
in a row this season.

596
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,260
They were last year's runner-up.

597
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:40,320
Exactly.

598
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,760
At this rate, there won't be
any hopes left to enter the playoffs.

599
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,510
Brother Sun,
what's going on with VNG today?

600
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,450
They lost four rounds in a row.

601
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,820
-For crying out loud.
-Mind your own business.

602
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,080
Wait, Brother Sun.

603
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,060
It's...

604
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,240
Ji Xiang Kong! You useless piece of trash!

605
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:05,090
We lost thanks to your stupid line-up.

606
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,770
-You think I wouldn't hit you?
-What are you two doing?

607
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,370
Will fighting solve the problem?

608
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,650
Ji Xiang Kong.

609
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,600
We have lost four games now.

610
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,760
We're the last one in the standings.

611
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:39,230
If we carry on losing,
we can kiss advancing goodbye.

612
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,530
Don't you owe everyone an explanation?

613
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:46,620
It's not necessarily a bad thing
to lose a few games.

614
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:48,210
I've compiled the statistics.

615
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,590
Everyone's statistics have increased
substantially with our new line-up.

616
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,710
-Tong Wu's...
-Enough with statistics.

617
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,130
So what if it has improved? We still lost.

618
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,290
Because of you! Everyone isn't
in the most suitable position.

619
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,020
Mid needs building up first
and cause great damage later.

620
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:04,620
But you keep wandering off
to chase down others.

621
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,550
You're not suitable to play Mid at all.

622
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,470
That is why I'll move Lu Sheng
to Mid-lane in the next match.

623
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,550
At the same time, reassemble Double Yue.

624
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,450
Come again? Double Yue?

625
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,870
You've got to be kidding me.

626
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,040
I'm saying this one more time.

627
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,900
Stop coming up with stupid ideas
if you lack the skills.

628
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:38,720
Everyone knows our Double Yue team
has been deciphered.

629
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:40,430
I meant a new Double Yue team.

630
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,020
Play Jungle with a new Champion,

631
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:44,350
while Shen Yue helps you
invade the enemy's land.

632
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,470
Lu Sheng will advance in Mid
and force our enemy to join the fight.

633
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,860
Meanwhile, Double Yue team will
circle back to Mid-lane to take them out.

634
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:54,030
We will gain a huge advantage
in these four minutes.

635
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,420
I think you're making huge assumptions.

636
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,340
I think this strategy
is a brilliant smokescreen.

637
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,630
It is indeed a little risky,

638
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,500
but this strategy is a better fit
for our players.

639
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,320
Before Pei Xi joined VNG,

640
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,220
Double Yue has always been
our magic weapon.

641
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:15,720
Qi Yue.

642
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,140
I have faith in both your skills.

643
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:21,880
Plus, we have a new
Champion strategy this time.

644
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,960
I agree to bring back Double Yue.

645
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,020
Sister Wen. Even so,
do you really think Lu Sheng can play Mid?

646
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,340
I can.

647
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,960
The competition is near.

648
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,100
Sudden changes in position
and adopting new strategies.

649
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,610
I'm afraid this is too risky.

650
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,970
Mr. Li.

651
00:43:48,590 --> 00:43:50,790
No one knows Legends better than I do.

652
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,650
And no one knows Pei Xi
better than you do.

653
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,330
Do you really think
we have no chance of winning?

654
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,970
Don't talk big.

655
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:02,710
You can't afford to have us
losing this championship.

656
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:09,440
If we lose, I will give up
my position as the captain.

657
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:34,790
Is it okay to let Lu Sheng play Mid?

658
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:36,550
Besides, Double Yue was...

659
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:39,450
Li Gan, I know what you're worried about.

660
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:42,180
It is now crunch time.

661
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:46,970
As their leaders, we should give
our players more confidence.

662
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,790
But, Shu Wen,
we can't afford to lose again.

663
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,050
If we do, all our efforts
over the past six months will be in vain.

664
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,850
We can't afford to lose.

665
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,150
We have overcome all sorts of hardships.

666
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:01,180
Don't tell me you're losing confidence
over a Regular Season.

667
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,380
I just don't get it.

668
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,460
Where does your faith in
Ji Xiang Kong come from?

669
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,720
Is it because Sun Ze Yi
thinks highly of him?

670
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,250
-What are you trying to say?
-Nothing.

671
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,540
I'm just worried.

672
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,190
If you have already decided,
then proceed with your plan.

673
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,060
I'm going home.
You should head home as well.
