Thanks for taking me here
for such a delicious meal.

00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,090
So, what's the surprise you're giving me?

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,720
No rush. You will know soon.

00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,950
Mr. Ji, your cake.

8
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,100
Why is there a cake?

9
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,470
Cut the cake.

10
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,250

Last time,

14

I waited for you here until closing time.

Fortunately, you are here now.

Hello everyone, I am Mia.

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,900
A lot of things happened recently.

26
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,490
I know people are very
curious about my love life.

27
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,540
I think that everyone should go
through this moment at least once

28
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:20,329
where you forget about
yourself over someone else,

29
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,550
where you don't expect results

30
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,570
or to be together

31
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,560
or to own that person.

32
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,620
Or even not expecting him to love you.

33
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,770
I want to tell him this.

34
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,040
You've been with me
through the darkest days of my life.

35
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,000
But when you needed someone the most,

36
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,150
I wasn't there.

37
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:51,620
You have a new relationship now.

38
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,070
Best wishes to you.

39
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,820
This song, Beyond the Sky,
was written for you.

40
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,270
Today,

41
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,540
I will sing it to you for the last time.

would give us her blessings.

♫ And one day ♫

47
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:32,320
Mr. Guo, here's is the
quarterly report of this season.

48
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,990
Originally, after this season,

49
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,560
the organization committee
would continue collaborating with us.

50
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,130
And now?

51
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,270
The strategy leak scandal happened.

52
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,290
The committee is very
dissatisfied with us.

53
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:56,030
I think during the season break now,

54
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,090
we need to review
our internal affairs too.

55
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,670
Yes.

56
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,750
It's my fault that
something so serious happened.

57
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,390
Luo Tian.

58
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,180
You don't have to take
everything as your responsibility.

59
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,300
This is all Qiu Ying's fault.

60
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,460
She's already affected GDV's reputation.

61
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,910
She can't stay here any longer.

62
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,920
Mr. Guo.

63
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,820
You mean you want to fire Qiu Ying?

64
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,330
But investigations are still ongoing.

65
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,260
Even there's no sufficient evidence,

66
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,020
it's almost certain that she did this.

67
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:31,090
I saw how hard and dedicated she has been.

68
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,690
Before we figure out the truth,

69
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,770
I won't let you fire Qiu Ying like this.

70
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,820
-Luo Tian...
-If you insist on firing her,

71
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,040
then please fire me first.

72
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,810
Do you have any idea that

73
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,510
people are spreading rumours
about you and Qiu Ying?

74
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,470
If the committee hears you,

75
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,150
what would they think of you?

76
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,210
An innocent man will be innocent.

77
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,909
I don't care whatever they think.

78
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,070
Can't you think for your own reputation?

79
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,940
Compared to her career,

80
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,940
my reputation is nothing.

81
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,690
Not bad.

82
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,850
You're the best barista of all
professional gamers, really.

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,840
I invite you here today
not to have coffee.

84
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,090
You want to ask me again
which team I'm going to?

85
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,120
Later on, what's your plan?

86
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:35,200
Well, I have something in mind.

87
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,460
You pay your network
admins well, don't you?

88
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,430
Dream Traveler's network admin?

89
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,950
You can't do it.

90
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,070
Right, I forgot to congratulate you

91
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,680
for winning the Fall Championship

92
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,520
and a ticket to the world finals.

93
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,090
Whether China can
win the top spot again

94
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,010
is up to the Legends.

95
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,140
You and I both know...

96
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:00,020
With how the Legends are faring
now, winning is impossible.

97
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,570
There's half a year left.

98
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,770
If you find a tactical breakthrough,

99
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,240
hope is still there.

100
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,750
What they need is you.

101
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,070
Qiu Ying told me before.

102
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,850
You went to Legends because of me.

103
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,820
Yes.

104
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,570
But when I came, you left.

105
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,220
What exactly are your plans?

106
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,820
I haven't figured out yet.

107
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,000
Anyway, next season,

108
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,620
no matter where you go, I'll follow you.

109
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,440
Wait, Pei Xi.

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,730
You must be kidding me.

111
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,669
I mean it.

112
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,549
All this time, I don't
care who the captain is.

113
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,530
My dream is to be the world champion.

114
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,950
Your tactics and my skills

115
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,020
can make this dream come true.

116
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,870
So,

117
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:55,120
I want you to be my teammate.

118
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,120
No matter where you go, I will follow.

119
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,990
Thank you for thinking highly of me.

120
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,140
But with my current situation,

121
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,150
which team would accept me?

122
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,110
If no team wants you,

123
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,870
then build your own team.

124
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,970
Please, building a team is not a game.

125
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,490
Even if I build a team,

126
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,100
I can't afford to hire you.

127
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,240
Thank you for your coffee.
I'll meet you some other day.

128
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,490
[My previous dream]

129
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,310
[was to win the championship
for the second time.]

130
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,090
But now, my dream

131
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,070
is to see you guys win.

132
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,970
But, I'm sure that I'll find
the perfect team one day.

133
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,410
If no team wants you,

134
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,090
then build your own team.

135
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:30,800
Brother Sun.

136
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,460
What's wrong?

137
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,970
No team has contacted Brother Kong yet.

138
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,100
What should we do?

139
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,030
Hasn't he told you about his plans?

140
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,990
No.

141
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,040
You didn't ask him either.

142
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,640
Why don't you ask him yourself?

143
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,670
I don't want to agitate him.

144
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,860
Then, wait for him to think it through.

145
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,510
He would tell us then, right?

146
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,080
When Brother Kong left Legends,

147
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,260
you couldn't even sleep.

148
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,990
Now, you're behaving
as if everything's fine.

149
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,100
That's because Xiang Kong understands that

150
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,730
there's only one way in front of him.

151
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,210
And it's harder than ever.

152
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,320
What way?

153
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,570
When he comes, ask him yourself.

154
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,020
They're here. I'll bring them in.

155
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,940
Qiu Ying, come here quickly.

156
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,220
Yi Yi, why haven't you gone upstairs?

157
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,160
You're not there yet,
and it'd be weird if I go alone.

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,090
Reporter Lu.

159
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:23,850
Hey, hey.

160
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,490
I don't care if you two
are lovey-dovey at home.

161
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:30,550
But, no PDAs in front of
a hopeless bachelorette like me.

162
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,110
Affection is meant to be displayed.

163
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,080
Kiss me.

164
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm not looking, not looking!

165
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,920
I say, Brother Kong,

166
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,870
you used to hate PDAs.

167
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,660
A man in love is so fickle.

168
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,630
Exactly.

169
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:45,970
Don't touch me. Stay away from me.

170
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,620
Are you jealous?

171
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,730
Yes, Xuan. You need to hurry up.

172
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,560
Otherwise, this girl is
going to find someone else.

173
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,870
Who are you going to find?

174
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:56,550
Find, my foot!

175
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,700
You... Don't tease me, you guys.

176
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,900
Qiu Ying. Let's go.

177
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,120
So annoying, really.

178
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,910
Nice to meet you, Brother Sun.
I'm Lu Yi Yi, it's an honour.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,880
We didn't talk much last time.
It's good to see you here.

180
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,350
Make yourself at home here.
Eat and drink all you want.

181
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,730
-Help yourself.
-Sure, don't worry. I will help myself.

182
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,570
Eat and drink all you want.

183
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,690
I say, kid.

184
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,380
You won the championship,
and you didn't treat me to a meal?

185
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm...

186
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,360
I was worried that I'd upset you,

187
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,740
so I didn't dare to show off.

188
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,840
You're even blaming me.

189
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,430
You're crying? When did you
become a drama king?

190
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,820
I learned it from her.

191
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,290
What are you talking?

192
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:40,110
Well, congratulations on getting
a ticket to the world finals.

193
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,110
You must win.

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,480
-I'll try my best.
-Good luck.

195
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,410
You'd better give it your all.

196
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,420
Teach Jeffrey a lesson.

197
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,550
Still, the Western and Korean teams
are all pretty strong this year.

198
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,820
If Legends don't have
any tactical breakthroughs,

199
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:55,870
it's hard to go far.

200
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,680
Even if Legends can make it
to the finals this year,

201
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm sure we can't win the championship.

202
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,420
If VNG didn't land in trouble,

203
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,440
Brother Kong is sure to beat Jeffrey.

204
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,720
The leak scandal is just the last straw.

205
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,390
Li Gan's and Shu Wen's differing ideals
was the fatal reason.

206
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,520
Don't be so upset.

207
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,620
I believe China's iConquer
team will not stop here.

208
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,990
A perfect team will
appear sooner or later.

209
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,240
Yes, come on.

210
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,670
Cheers.

211
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,950
Right, how's the investigation
on the scandal coming along?

212
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,980
Still investigating.

213
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,270
How long do you still
need take the blame?

214
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:52,020
Yeah, you can't let
Qiao Xin take advantage of you.

215
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,350
When I interviewed Can today,

216
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,160
Qiao Xin looked so smug.

217
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,850
I... I was so pissed.

218
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:00,770
That's too much.

219
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,470
Brother Sun.

220
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,550
Isn't Luo Tian familiar with
the members of the committee?

221
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,580
Why?

222
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,760
Get him to put in
a good word for Qiu Ying.

223
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,510
No need, Mr. Luo has helped me so much.

224
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,070
Don't worry. I will handle this.

225
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,680
Alright., we're all hungry. Let's eat.

226
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,400
Eat up.

227
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,800
Ji Xiang Kong.

228
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,510
Later on, what's your plan?

229
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,440
How's that your business?

230
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,520
Watch your mouth.

231
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,540
What's your plan next, Brother Kong?

232
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,390
Haven't figured it out yet.

233
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,860
What do you mean,
you haven't figured it out yet?

234
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,830
Yi Yi.

235
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,560
Why are you holding me back?

236
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,310
If he isn't your boyfriend,
why would I care?

237
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,670
Ji Xiang Kong.

238
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:55,840
Are you really going to stay
at Brother Sun's place forever

239
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,040
and be a network admin?

240
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,400
What are you talking about?

241
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,250
What?

242
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,190
I mean, this is impossible.

243
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:04,170
Brother Sun told me today

244
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,340
that Brother Kong is thinking of a way.

245
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,570
But this way is harder than ever.

246
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,840
Isn't it, Brother Sun?

247
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,960
Then, tell me, what way?

248
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,090
Come on.

249
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,220
What way, Brother Kong?

250
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,010
Bathed in flames,

251
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,390
the phoenix rises from the ashes.

252
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,210
I'm going to terminate
my contract with Legends.

253
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,540
Are you sick?

254
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,390
You are not having a fever.

255
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,490
I'm serious.

256
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,890
Serious, my foot!

257
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,090
How will this benefit you?

258
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,470
Don't you want to enter the world finals?

259
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,820
In the world finals,

260
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,870
I will win with Ji Xiang Kong.

261
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,590
What else did you dream about?

262
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,830
Which team would accept Ji Xiang Kong now?

263
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,840
He'll build his own team.

264
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:59,930
-He told you that?
-No.

265
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,710
Then, how do you know
he wants to build a team?

266
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,970
I just know.

267
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,270
I know him.

268
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,740
Buddy.

269
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,620
It's not easy to build a team.

270
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,010
Let's take a thousand steps back.

271
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,690
Even the team is built,

272
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,530
are you sure that it will
enter the world finals?

273
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:17,620
It will.

274
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,820
I don't understand you right now.

275
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,930
You and Ji Xiang Kong are rivals.

276
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,700
Now, you're trying
to suck up to him, why?

277
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,600
I just admire him.

278
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,980
You know that I joined
Legends because of him.

279
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,770
Can you afford the termination penalty?

280
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,300
No.

281
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,090
But you can.

282
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,880
Get out.

283
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,270
Get out. Get out!

284
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,650
Why do I have a cousin like you?

285
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,440
Tomorrow,

286
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,819
I'll resign from GDV.

287
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,560
Why?

288
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,339
I don't want to bring
more troubles to Mr. Luo.

289
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,220
Since I joined Dream Traveler,
I've never had a good night's sleep.

290
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,870
Now I can finally take a rest.

291
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,420
I miss the feeling of waking up naturally.

292
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,290
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,390
I can't help you with anything.

294
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,240
As long as you stay with me,

295
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,340
I will go back to the
commentary podium one day.

296
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,890
I didn't forget the deal between us.

297
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:04,060
Qiu Ying.

298
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,140
If I really become like what Lu Yi Yi said

299
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,440
and work as a mere network admin,

300
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,700
would you look down on me?

301
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,920
I would.

302
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,500
I wouldn't look down on your choice,

303
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,820
but the fact that you didn't
respect your own wishes.

304
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,320
If you've already decided in your mind,

305
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,300
just go for it.

306
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,400
But if it fails,

307
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,740
I will lose everything.

308
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:38,040
Like Brother Sun said,

309
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,590
bathed in flames,

310
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,590
a phoenix shall rise from the ashes.

311
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,820
Even if you break your bones,

312
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,020
I'm sure you'll stand up again.

313
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,200
No matter how hard this path is,

314
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,360
I will stay with you.

315
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,300
Bathed in flames, a phoenix
shall rise from the ashes.

316
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,670
How about naming the team Phenix?

317
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,090
Phenix?

318
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,840
Phenix, rising from the ashes.

319
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,930
I think it's really good.

320
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,070
Also, it fits your current situation.

321
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,890
Let's just use it.

322
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,170
Well, Phenix lacks a manager now.

323
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,670
Commentator Qiu, will you
accept this humble position?

324
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,320
Guess.

325
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,120
I heard your heartbeat saying yes.

326
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:24,020
Hello, everybody.
I'm the commentator, Qiu Ying.

327
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,360
Today, I'm bringing you the first
match of the spring regular season.

328
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,010
Why I can't feel your passion for
iConquer from your commentary?

329
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,850
If I don't love iConquer,

330
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,970
I…I wouldn't be standing in front of you.

331
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,970
Hello, everyone.
I am your new friend, Qiu Ying.

332
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,700
Mr. Luo.

333
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,670
Why do you have to go?

334
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,370
You've helped me too much.

335
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,140
I don't want to involve
you in this anymore.

336
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,050
GDV can stand without me,

337
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,070
but not without you.

338
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,320
Qiu Ying.

339
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,540
I know you've been mistreated.

340
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,350
But they will find the truth eventually.

341
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,670
To stand on this commentary podium,

342
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,270
you've done so much.

343
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,340
You're just giving up like this?

344
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:35,040
From the moment I decided
to be a commentator,

345
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,170
I knew it's going
to be my lifetime career.

346
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:41,990
I loved it back then,
and I still love it now.

347
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,370
I love commentating.

348
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,800
Even I leave GDV,

349
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,550
I'm not going to give up.

350
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,520
This is a summary of this season.

351
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,140
Have you really decided to leave?

352
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,110
From Dream Traveler to GDV,

353
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,770
you've been my guide all the time.

354
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,420
I hope you can continue
to advise me later on.

355
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,590
One review video a week.

356
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,620
No problem.

357
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,300
Then, I'm leaving.

358
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,140
-I'll send you off.
-No need.

359
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,440
Xiang Kong is waiting for me downstairs.

360
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,920
Goodbye, Mr. Luo.

361
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,420
♫ If the light fell into a black hole ♫

362
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,380
♫ I shall make a crack with my dream ♫

363
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,810
♫ As long as my heart is scorched ♫

364
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,620
♫ Then it will start a new spark ♫

365
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,350
♫ Waking up from a dream,
traces of injuries ♫

366
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:24,300
♫ All these are honours of youth-hood ♫

367
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,640
♫ Without the courage to bathe in flames ♫

368
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,610
♫ How will you see a miracle? ♫

369
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,650
♫ Traversing to wake up from a dream ♫

370
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,100
♫ Don't stop, to the summit, here we go ♫

371
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:35,990
♫ Yes, here we go ♫

372
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,290
♫ Deciding to go to the top of the world ♫

373
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,650
♫ It's the most exciting adventure ♫

374
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,020
What took you so long?

375
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,620
It's hard to find a training base now.

376
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,790
I'll check a few more places later

377
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,690
and find something more cost-effective.

378
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,980
Anyway, good news.

379
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,580
Our team uniform has been delivered.

380
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,080
I've seen it, it's really nice.

381
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,220
Really? Thanks.

382
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,400
Our manager is an efficient worker.

383
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:13,440
That's for sure.

384
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,240
-I'll treat you to a nice dinner.
-Okay.

385
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,190
Right, when are you going
to tell Xuan about our new team?

386
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,160
I don't want to tell him now.

387
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,830
Yes, Xuan is in Legends now.

388
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,710
He's already qualified
for the world finals.

389
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,790
There's no need for him
to take the risk with us

390
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,870
and start anew.

391
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,570
Also, if I tell him now,

392
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:43,400
he'd insist on joining us.

393
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,660
Yeah, he's the top support player now.

394
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,000
We can't afford his salary.

395
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,670
Then, do we have new candidates now?

396
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,220
What game is this?

397
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,590
An expert random battle.

398
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,670
Look at him.

399
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,360
The way the Creator moves here...

400
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,750
He's obviously a top professional player.

401
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,760
He is the first person I'm looking for.

402
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,730
Also, you know him.

403
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,420
I know him? Who is he?

404
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,370
Guess.

405
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,770
Don't make me guess. Just tell me.

406
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,840
Silly girl.

407
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,420
I've already given you an obvious clue.

408
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,970
Think about it again.

409
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,240
The Creator.

410
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,190
Pei Xi's inner hero.

411
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,940
Could it be...

412
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:28,150
Hi.

413
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,130
What's wrong?

414
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,570
Disappointed to see me?

415
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,750
Yes.

416
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,250
What, are you waiting for Ji Xiang Kong?

417
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,470
So, I've already asked around.

418
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,250
I asked Luo Tian, Brother Sun and Shu Wen.

419
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,280
They all said that they've never heard

420
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,560
Ji Xiang Kong planning
to build his own team.

421
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,480
So, your judgment is wrong.

422
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,300
Ji Xiang Kong won't build his own team.

423
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,690
Can you give up now?

424
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,770
I've already discussed with Mr. Jin.

425
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,700
I will terminate my contract tomorrow.

426
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,770
Remember to prepare the money.

427
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:11,150
You're a pain in my arse.

428
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,270
I'm not drinking!

429
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:32,660
Cool, Xiang Kong.

430
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,570
Finally setting up your own team?

431
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,170
Phenix is a good name.

432
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,690
Of course.

433
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,770
Brother Sun, you inspired me.

434
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,180
Bathed in flames,
a phoenix rises from the ashes.

435
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,990
Hence, it's called Phenix.

436
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,870
Then, if you win later on,
will the credit be mine?

437
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,400
Of course.

438
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,820
Also, we want you to wear this.

439
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,800
You will be the first member of Phenix.

440
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,520
You must be kidding me.

441
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,770
Brother Sun, I'm not kidding.

442
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,650
But, you don't have to
refuse me so quickly.

443
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,890
Ask yourself.

444
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,250
Don't you want to go back there

445
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,250
and try one more time?

446
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:25,090
I was already the oldest
member in the Pioneers.

447
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,700
Even an evergreen player like
Gu Fang has already retired.

448
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,600
Besides, I haven't
competed for almost six years.

449
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,380
What?

450
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,310
Is this you?

451
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,320
Brother Sun,
you're still as sharp as ever.

452
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,920
Your APM and alertness
have never decreased.

453
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,020
And, it's just as good as
Gu Fang three years ago.

454
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,910
You're absolutely qualified to compete.

455
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:02,850
Yeah, Brother Sun.
We really need you right now.

456
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,270
This is just a random battle.

457
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,670
It's different from
a real professional game.

458
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,970
It's impossible for me, who hasn't
competed professionally for years.

459
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,160
Besides, what's your goal?

460
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,000
To be the global champion.

461
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,230
Not joining random battles.

462
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,050
But, Brother Sun…

463
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,020
Qiu Ying, as the manager,

464
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,270
you should know how hard
it is to set up a team.

465
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,990
Once my professional
heyday is over, it's over.

466
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,620
Why do you two have confidence in me?

467
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,820
No. Brother Sun.
-Don't you want to get the trophy back?

468
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,460
Leave.

469
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,560
Both of you, leave.

470
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,320
Don't waste time on me.

471
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:56,170
Don't risk the future of the team

472
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,120
in a gamble.

473
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,840
Why is Brother Sun angry?

474
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:18,570
Maybe he's still upset over
the tournament back then.

475
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,710
[Come here.]

476
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,310
Fight.

477
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,670
Move.

478
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,820
Go!

479
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,420
Fight!

480
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,120
-Summer, buy back!
-Bought it!

481
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,250
You take this.

482
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,840
Almost there!

483
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,770
Coming.

484
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,090
Championship trophy!

485
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,340
We're coming!

486
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:17,450
Why isn't Pei Xi here today?

487
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,470
He's a golden kid.
He doesn't need to train.

488
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,420
Faster, run.

489
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,440
Come on. Brother Yao. Run.

490
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,950
-Go!
-Don't pull me.

491
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,670
[I'm leaving.]

492
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,470
[Should I say goodbye?]

493
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,200
[They don't care
if I leave or not, right?]

494
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,040
[Then, goodbye.]

495
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,580
♫ Perhaps after tonight ♫

496
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,780
♫ I will see myself ♫

497
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,580
♫ My heart protected by the sun ♫

498
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,570
♫ Shining brilliantly ♫

499
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,130
♫ Every star with a name ♫

500
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,150
♫ Is incredible ♫

501
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,450
What's wrong?

502
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,050
Goodbye?

503
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,430
Goodbye? What goodbye?

504
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,060
Pei Xi sent this in the group chat.

505
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,360
What a bizarre message.

506
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,330
What does he mean?

507
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,100
What does he mean?

508
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:21,290
This morning, I heard he's
terminating his contract with the team.

509
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,740
It's actually real?

510
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,670
He is leaving?

511
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,220
Let's go back.

512
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,620
Anyone here?

513
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,860
Not even a shadow.

514
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,980
He's not here, and not in the dorm.

515
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,020
Where he could be?

516
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,570
He should at least tell us in person.

517
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,520
I don't know what's in his head.

518
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,699
Pei Xi is actually a nice guy.

519
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,389
He just gets cocky sometimes.

520
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,650
When he drove Zhao Yang away for us,

521
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,190
I thought he was really loyal to us.

522
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,630
Then, why do you keep
complaining about him?

523
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,370
You were a jerk too,
always refusing to cooperate.

524
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,820
After all, he is the captain.

525
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,270
Sometimes, when you think about it,

526
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,170
I feel reluctant to see him leave.

527
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,340
I forgot to take my uniform.

528
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:25,320
I also forgot to say goodbye.

529
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,920
Thank you very much.

530
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,170
Thank you.

531
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,620
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,670
Captain.

533
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:48,500
Thanks.

534
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,640
I learned a lot from you.

535
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,610
We won't forget you.

536
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,260
Yi Xuan.

537
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,520
Come on.

538
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:11,680
Captain, don't forget that
we were your teammates.

539
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:14,250
Legends will always welcome you back.

540
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,670
Keep it up.

541
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,890
Let's keep it up.

542
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,340
I'm leaving.

543
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,890
Hey.

544
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,600
About what happened before,

545
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,760
I'm sorry.

546
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,490
Goodbye.

547
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:12,820
Captain.

548
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,400
See you at the game.

549
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,030
This guy doesn't cut it too?

550
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,700
You're not satisfied with this either?

551
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,070
You're not satisfied
with all these people?

552
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,900
Be it their skills,
experience or overall ability,

553
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,690
at most, they can only
make it to the preliminaries.

554
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,270
It'll take them at least
two years to mature.

555
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,140
Then what can we do?

556
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,750
Or, we'll find a way

557
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,670
to convince Brother Sun join us.

558
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,670
I think right now,

559
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,120
only one person can convince him.

560
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:47,970
You mean Sister Wen?

561
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,530
Let's go and meet her now.

562
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,360
Wrong.

563
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,030
We should find Brother Summer first.

564
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,850
Brother Summer?

565
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,050
Why?

566
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,370
Sister Wen wouldn't forgive Brother Sun

567
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,100
because before they went
to Vancouver back then,

568
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,470
Brother Sun left the team for no reason.

569
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,070
For no reason?

570
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,120
Wait, didn't he leave
because of family issues?

571
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,490
I think that is just an excuse.

572
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,910
There must be something
inside that no one knows.

573
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,670
Brother Summer must know.

574
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,270
A heroine, indeed.

575
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,670
Don't think I don't know
you're going easy on me.

576
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,720
Then, don't expose me.

577
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,290
I just want you to come out and relax.

578
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,290
Actually, after leaving VNG,

579
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:49,690
I feel more relaxed.

580
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,950
You've worked so hard for so many years.

581
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,520
Don't you find it a pity?

582
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,270
Why should I?

583
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,780
Different minds pursue different goals.

584
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,640
I should've known that.

585
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,870
Then, what exactly is going on
between you and Li Gan?

586
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:14,420
I hope he can find the right person.

587
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,240
Any plans in the future?

588
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,600
I'm going to Singapore for
an exchange study for a while.

589
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,390
It's to recharge myself.

590
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,290
Have you ever thought of
talking it out with Brother Sun?

591
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,240
-After all, both of you...
-Alright.

592
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,830
It'd still be the same.

593
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,770
I just want a change of environment
and start anew now.

594
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:40,460
You just can't keep your
mind off gossip, can you?

595
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,620
I'm not gossiping. I mean it.

596
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,000
-It's a pity between you and him.
-Enough.

597
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,340
One more game.

598
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,730
I'm going all out now.

599
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,020
You'd better.

600
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,020
Are you looking for me?

601
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,050
No. We are here for your cousin.

602
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,910
Pei Xi.

603
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,420
Where are you going?

604
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:23,420
I just terminated my
contract with Legends.

605
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,250
You've left Legends?

606
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,900
We can build a new team now.

607
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:34,370
We?

608
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,700
This must be our uniform.

609
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,490
Phenix.

610
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,670
Interesting.

611
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,340
Wait, Pei Xi. What do you mean?

612
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,590
I am joining you.

613
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,160
Really?

614
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,670
That's wonderful, Xiang Kong!

615
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,280
Pei Xi.

616
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:02,310
You are the most talented player
of the new generation in China.

617
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,210
I also admire you
the most as an opponent.

618
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,380
But I'm sorry.

619
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,480
You're not the right one for Phenix.

620
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,720
Are you refusing me?

621
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,770
Stay in Legends.

622
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:15,270
You've got a ticket to the world finals.

623
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,060
You don't have to take the risk.

624
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:19,620
I've told you before.

625
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,720
My goal is to win the world championship.

626
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,360
Staying in Legends
and using the same tactics

627
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,770
won't make my dream come true.

628
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,790
In that case,

629
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,400
I'd rather take the risk.

630
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,720
Right, Xiang Kong.

631
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,900
Actually, Pei Xi is really good.

632
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,120
Let's just give it a shot.

633
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,840
What are you still hesitating?

634
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,310
Are you going to tell me

635
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:51,550
that you are not prepared for this?

636
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,250
It's you who're not
prepared to join the team.

637
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,490
Others always say
you can beat nine at once,

638
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,710
namely five opponents

639
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,570
and four teammates who hold you back.

640
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:03,960
As a solo player, you are outstanding.

641
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,110
But, you couldn't
cooperate with your teammates.

642
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,220
What do you think?

643
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,200
I've always won on my own.

644
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,950
That's why I'm looking
for you to be my teammate.

645
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,070
I hope that in future games,

646
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,270
your tactics will make things different.

647
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,000
No matter which team you join,

648
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:30,090
it will be the same.

649
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,600
Shouldn't you find your own problem first?

650
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:35,220
If you're a player who
doesn't know how to cooperate,

651
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,410
then any strategy would still turn
into four-protect-one in your hands.

652
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,990
Even if you choose me,
the result will be the same.

653
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:46,250
Xiang Kong.

654
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,010
Let's think it over.

655
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,090
Qiu Ying. Don't forget.

656
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,540
What we want is a perfect team.

657
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,070
Ji Xiang Kong.

658
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,610
Besides me,

659
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,070
you can't find a better candidate.

660
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,150
No matter who you find,
you need to adjust.

661
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,320
Why can't I join?

662
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,730
Unless...

663
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,950
You can't control me.

664
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:14,820
Before questioning me,

665
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,940
let me see your determination first.

666
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:22,950
You're refusing even my cousin.

667
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:27,100
Looks like Phenix
is really a marvelous team.

668
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:29,740
Brother Summer.
-Brother Summer, you're finally back.

669
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:32,940
I will not give up.

670
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,890
Alright, don't look at him.
That's how he's always been.

671
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,240
Let's talk in the office.

672
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:48,510
Brother Sun refused to join Phenix.

673
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,000
He said he had given up
professional gaming.

674
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:52,520
So I want to know

675
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:56,570
what made him give up
before the world finals that year?

676
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,280
I didn't know about this
until Shu Wen's birthday.

677
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,520
I, Li Gan,

678
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:08,320
won the world championship.

679
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,070
That...

680
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,660
That was just a coincidence.

681
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,270
Every dog has his day.

682
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:17,820
She doesn't even know

683
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,540
how we got 300,000 yuan to go to Canada.

684
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,610
How did you get it?

685
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,840
How?

686
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,540
I mortgaged my house

687
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,990
to borrow that money!

688
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:38,820
Didn't you say that
you got it through sponsors?

689
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:41,320
Buddy.

690
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,970
Who's stupid, you or me?

691
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,210
Who would sponsor us?

692
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,420
Does Brother Yi know about this?

693
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,070
Brother Yi left the team because he knew

694
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,840
you mortgaged your house?

695
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,120
That year, when Brother Sun left the team,

696
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,170
we all thought it was
because of family issues.

697
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,520
Li Gan has always been our sub.

698
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,610
Since he got someone to
sponsor us 300,000 yuan,

699
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,400
he naturally became part of the team

700
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,640
and won the championship.

701
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,490
But we didn't expect that…

702
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,290
You didn't expect that
it was actually Li Gan

703
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:48,190
who used 300,000 yuan to kick
Brother Sun out of the team

704
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,770
and made him leave Sister Wen.

705
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,520
Li Gan really loves Shu Wen.

706
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,170
At that time, we all knew.

707
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,370
But, Shu Wen and Brother Sun
were already together then.

708
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,990
But, since Li Gan wanted
to win the championship

709
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,320
and stay with Shu Wen...

710
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,040
So, in the end,

711
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,750
Brother Sun fulfilled your dreams

712
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,790
by taking everything on his own.

713
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,210
He didn't even explain to Sister Wen.

714
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,020
Even after so many years,

715
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,420
he's been hiding in The King,

716
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:24,140
keeping his distance from you guys.

717
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,740
He should return to gaming.

718
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,610
We all owe him a trophy.

719
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,870
How about this?

720
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,470
Shu Wen is going to Singapore tomorrow.

721
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,730
Both of you find a way to keep her here.

722
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:41,960
Leave the rest to Pei Xi and me.

723
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,020
Thank you, Brother Summer.
