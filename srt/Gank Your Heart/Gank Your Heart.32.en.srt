00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,270
Since yesterday,

5
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,950
Xia Ling

6
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,810
didn't talk to us.

7
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:53,830
I don't know how

8
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,890
his recovery was.

9
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,430
We should do something

10
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,789
to cheer him up.

11
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,340
I want to retort upon all the netizens

12
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,090
who scolded

13
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,370
Brother Kong and Xia Ling.

14
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,830
Look at Pei Xi's post on Weibo.

15
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,360
Xia Ling is a newcomer and also a fighter.

16
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:14,580
We won't back down

17
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,510
as we reached this stage.

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,910
Five of us

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,900
would never leave

20
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,060
and won't retreat

21
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,300
in the battlefield.

22
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,590
Pei Xi

23
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,520
always keeps a straight face.

24
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,400
At this crucial time, he's quite faithful.

25
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,329
Right.

26
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,860
Yes.

27
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,579
He doesn't usually use Weibo.

28
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,820
For Xia Ling,

29
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:30,690
he even created an account.

30
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,100
I have to respond to it.

31
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,370
Repost.

32
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,900
The rearrangement of roles was

33
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,270
the decision made by the whole team.

34
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,380
Please respect

35
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,560
the tactical choice of Phoenix.

36
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:40,810
Please

37
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,220
give us some more time.

38
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,430
Xia Ling.

39
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,310
Stop there!

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:53,170
You were beaten by

41
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:53,970
just a game?

42
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,480
It's none of your business.

43
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,730
All of us believe in you.

44
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,590
Why can't you trust yourself?

45
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,980
I don't want to be a drag.

46
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,180
Since your first day in our team,

47
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,390
you already dragged us down.

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,760
I passed you the role of Mid Laner.

49
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,330
But look at your performance.

50
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,600
You let me down.

51
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,680
You let our whole team down.

52
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,260
Pei Xi.

53
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,970
Good-for-nothing!

54
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,790
Pei Xi, are you crazy?

55
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,110
What are you doing?

56
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,450
Don't help him.

57
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,120
-He's just a good-for-nothing.
-Get up.

58
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,410
A good-for-nothing

59
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,760
who doesn't even dare to stand up.

60
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,890
Shut up!

61
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,120
Don't talk nonsense!

62
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,280
And you, Qiu Ying.

63
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,880
Do you understand iConquer?

64
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,440
You don't even know what iConquer is.

65
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,490
I really don't know

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,430
how you became a commentator.

67
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,960
If it wasn't for Ji Xiang Kong,

68
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,630
you're nothing today.

69
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,980
You're useless! He's useless!

70
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:51,520
Useless.

71
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,990
Pei Xi, you're going too far.

72
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,050
Shut up, Pei Xi!

73
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,970
You stood up.

74
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,340
Xia Ling.

75
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,290
We're back.

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,010
You don't need a crutch anymore?

77
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,070
Well, Pei Xi.

78
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,730
His leg has recovered.

79
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,990
What's wrong with your face?

80
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,110
He's young and thoughtless.

81
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,670
I saw

82
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:36,370
what you posted on Weibo.

83
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,450
I'm not easy

84
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:38,480
to be defeated.

85
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
All right, buddy.

86
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
You pull yourself together quite fast.

87
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,040
Xuan, let's have a game.

88
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,120
Call me Brother Xuan.

89
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,230
You're more immature

90
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,690
compared with him.

91
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,170
And yet want him to call you brother?

92
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,190
All of you bully me.

93
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,470
Fine, I don't want to engage with you.

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,010
-Who is this?
-Brother Summer.

95
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:00,870
Pei Xi.

96
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,220
Captain, why are you here?

97
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,530
Thank you, bro.

98
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,070
Stop thanking me.

99
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,550
I'm scared to hear that now.

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
Sorry, Xiang Kong.

101
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,660
Why did you say so suddenly?

102
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,540
We shouldn't tell you to
give up shadow tactics

103
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,780
because of a game.

104
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,580
And even doubted our teammates.

105
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,260
I know.

106
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,840
You're doing it for us

107
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,870
as well.

108
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,790
Alright, don't chat anymore.

109
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,230
Let's get started.

110
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,310
Let me feel

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,640
your shadow tactics.

112
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,420
After all,

113
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,210
we used to be the world champion.

114
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,020
Although you are young,

115
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,010
we won't go easy on you.

116
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,430
I haven't practiced for so long.

117
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,760
I don't know if I'm rusty.

118
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,730
You must be rusty.

119
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,390
Masters will be

120
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,400
our training partners?

121
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,390
Pei Xi should take the blame.

122
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,280
This little boy

123
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,020
wanted to treat me to dinner.

124
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,480
It's the first time
he treated me to dinner.

125
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,640
But actually let me be a training partner.

126
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,550
Bravo.

127
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,610
You invited all the five ancient masters.

128
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,810
Steady.

129
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,010
All it took is just a meal.

130
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:04,790
All right.

131
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,240
Let's see if these old buddies

132
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,910
are still in the best state.

133
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,010
You're an old buddy too.

134
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,590
Don't you

135
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,340
short of one player?

136
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,270
Add a computer player will do.

137
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,000
Add a computer player?

138
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,490
Four versus five will do as well.

139
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,560
Let Qiu Ying to join you.

140
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,090
Come.

141
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,860
Who?

142
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,520
Who is this?

143
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,010
My goodness, he's Li Xiao Feng.

144
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:37,950
Xiang Kong,

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,310
he's China's top e-sports player.

146
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,240
That's him?

147
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,290
He is the first in China

148
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,159
draped in a five-starred red flag

149
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:43,650
standing on the world's highest peak.

150
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,390
He won the world champion

151
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:45,970
for two years in a row.

152
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,290
China's top e-sports player.

153
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,300
Li Xiao Feng, gosh.

154
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,820
Be afraid!

155
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,690
Am I dreaming?

156
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,040
Pinch me.

157
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:00,750
Let me introduce.

158
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,240
Li Xiao Feng is my good friend for years.

159
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,140
He's been starting a business recently

160
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,890
and doing research on e-sports equipment.

161
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,200
Wow, it's hard to invite him.

162
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:10,740
I made a special appointment

163
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,110
for your training.

164
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,290
Well, captain.

165
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,190
How come you never

166
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:14,830
told me that?

167
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,510
I can't

168
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,690
tell you everything.

169
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,190
What's wrong?

170
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,860
You don't seem to be welcoming me.

171
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,960
Should I go back now?

172
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,110
No, no.

173
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:23,880
Please don't.

174
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,910
Xiang Kong, introduce yourself to him.

175
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,880
Hello, Brother Xiao Feng.

176
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:28,170
I'm Ji Xiang Kong.

177
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,790
I'm the captain of Phoenix.

178
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,390
We're too surprised.

179
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,530
We didn't expect you would come.

180
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
Ji Xiang Kong.

181
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,880
Gu Fang mentioned you to me a few times.

182
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,900
The so-called Battlefield Trickster.

183
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,220
I'm here today

184
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:40,880
to see

185
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,290
how strong you are.

186
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:43,380
Oh, please don't.

187
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,650
Please don't say so.

188
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,450
You're our senior.

189
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,990
We should learn from you.

190
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:50,870
Well.

191
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,090
Brother Xiao Feng.

192
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,920
Let me hold your hands again.

193
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:00,550
I'm so lucky.

194
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,000
We've been watching

195
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,140
your games

196
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,200
since young.

197
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,970
You're

198
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,190
the idol of all e-sports players.

199
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,620
I'm so honored and excited

200
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,800
to be able to train with you.

201
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,980
Lin Yi Xuan.

202
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,340
Do you know me?

203
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,210
Yes. From your appearance,

204
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,530
I can tell that you're a Support.

205
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,660
See, my idol knows me!

206
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,730
Of course. It's not just you.

207
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,490
I know

208
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,310
Pei Xi, Xia Ling and Sun as well.

209
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,990
You're the dark horses

210
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,020
this year.

211
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,160
It's hard not to know you all.

212
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,730
I saw you win a world champion

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,630
back then.

214
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,830
I made up my mind

215
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,210
to be a professional gamer.

216
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,640
I'm also a fan of yours.

217
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,590
Xia Ling, you're a fan of mine.

218
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,990
Do you have your phone with you?

219
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,890
Okay, go ahead.

220
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,730
All right.

221
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,750
If you want a signature or take a picture,

222
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,740
we'll talk about that later.

223
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,040
Hurry up now.

224
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,300
Let's go training.

225
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,730
Let's start!

226
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,310
Welcome.

227
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,930
You're only doing the commentary now.

228
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,840
How's your skills?

229
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,560
Are you rusty?

230
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,150
I'm better than you.

231
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,120
Be careful. Go.

232
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,410
Summer, you don't have to come over.

233
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,310
Ji Xiang Kong and I

234
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,580
are doing fine here.

235
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,290
Watch out for Luo Tian.

236
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,620
Mr. Luo is still blocking me.

237
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,060
Mr. Luo.

238
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,240
You've got a pretty good guess.

239
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,050
How did you know I'm here?

240
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,580
I can give the commentary
since I know you well.

241
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,230
Okay, no problem.

242
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,140
I saw Summer.

243
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,000
Chase back?

244
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,000
I've been waiting for long.

245
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,680
Summer, don't chase.

246
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,410
Look at him.

247
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,140
Summer came again.

248
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,730
Save me.

249
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,680
Shame on you.

250
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,120
Not bad, buddy.

251
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,620
They're

252
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,390
going to have a team fight. Come on.

253
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,810
Come on, let's take revenge.

254
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,800
How childish.

255
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,620
All right, cut the crap and get started.

256
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,450
Congratulations to Phoenix
for winning two games in a row

257
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,080
and breaking away from the loser group.

258
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:31,110
Next, they'll have a final battle

259
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,440
with VNG for the championship.

260
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,620
-We gave wayÂ to you.
-Bravo!

261
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:36,260
Let's go.

262
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,590
But really

263
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,640
thank you very much.

264
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,960
Without your special training,

265
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,010
we can't

266
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:41,790
improve this much

267
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,730
in such a short time.

268
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:44,840
We're not that important.

269
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,990
The greatest meritorious statesmen

270
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,170
are still you.

271
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,470
When I look at you all,

272
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,970
it reminds me of us back then.

273
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,280
Our training environment in those years

274
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,170
was worse than yours.

275
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:54,990
There was no sponsorship

276
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,070
or encouragement.

277
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,900
Passion and faith

278
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,560
towards game

279
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,320
supported us to keep playing.

280
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,470
Brother Xiao Feng.

281
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,680
Do you have any tricks or something

282
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,050
that can help us to be
the champion at once?

283
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,270
Or even be the champion for twice.

284
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,240
Trick?

285
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,740
The most important thing is practice.

286
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,080
Focus on your own weaknesses.

287
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:11,880
Keep practising

288
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,270
so that you can surpass others.

289
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,200
Make your weaknesses

290
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,350
be your strengths.

291
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
Apart from that,

292
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,880
your understanding and attitude

293
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,500
towards e-sports,

294
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,120
balance in abilities,

295
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,980
and teamwork

296
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,860
can also be

297
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,760
a crucial point

298
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,890
in the game this time.

299
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,560
Indeed.

300
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,940
Our practices back then

301
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,770
were so boring.

302
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,840
We wanted to give up.

303
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,080
Summer and I

304
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,470
once even tried to escape .

305
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,390
There're so many people here.

306
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,670
Are you sure once only?

307
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:38,840
There're many times.

308
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,840
Every time,

309
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,170
I got you both back

310
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,350
and gave you psychological counseling.

311
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,400
Put the blame on him.

312
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,700
He was the drag.

313
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,460
When did I become a drag?

314
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:46,790
He seems nice but actually bad inside.

315
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,930
Do you know that?

316
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,760
I really envy you

317
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,340
to have

318
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,900
a group of like-minded brothers

319
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,030
going hand in hand.

320
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,680
iConquer is the battlefield of brothers.

321
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,300
As long as five of you

322
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,530
work together,

323
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,570
you must be invincible.

324
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,070
Don't worry.

325
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,680
We won't

326
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,490
let you down.

327
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,700
Let China e-sports

328
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,590
be the top of the world again.

329
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,600
I'm sure you can do it.

330
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,990
Tomorrow will be the finals.

331
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,230
We're waiting to celebrate.

332
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,680
Fight for it!

333
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,730
What are you doing?

334
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,830
Brother Qi, don't go over yet.

335
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,930
Don't go to the top lane.

336
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,180
Go to the middle lane.

337
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,780
Don't let me die alone, okay?

338
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:33,200
Top lane.

339
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,040
What? Middle lane!

340
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,070
Tong Wu, come help me.

341
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,480
Brother Qi, don't go over yet.

342
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,100
Where did I go?

343
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,440
Just follow me.

344
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,610
And you, don't fight!

345
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,680
What are you doing?

346
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,410
You all are really useless!

347
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:53,610
Especially you, Wu Tong.

348
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,430
Why didn't you come and help me?

349
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,870
If I came over,

350
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,900
I would die for nothing.

351
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm the captain.

352
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,050
You must come as I told you to.

353
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,600
I'm sorry.

354
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:08,350
Sorry.

355
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,310
Qi Yue, even if you're the captain,

356
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,980
can you stop hitting?

357
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,180
What's wrong with blaming him?

358
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,320
Go away if you're not satisfied.

359
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,690
You're not qualified to be the captain.

360
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,270
What are you talking about?

361
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,600
What did I say?

362
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,940
I said watch yourself.

363
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,760
VNG has a captain like you.

364
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,000
We're done for.

365
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,140
Lu Sheng, stop hitting.

366
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,220
Stop it!

367
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,700
If you hit someone again, I'll report you.

368
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,530
What are you going to report me on?

369
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,690
What are you going to report me on?

370
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:43,220
Don't think that

371
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,390
no one knows the thing
about the meeting room.

372
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,280
I saw it.

373
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,620
I saw everything!

374
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,310
Tong Wu.

375
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,230
Don't run away, Tong Wu.

376
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,540
Brother Sheng, thank you.

377
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,650
Are you all right?

378
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,690
I knew you were hiding here again.

379
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,030
Qi Yue is looking for you everywhere.

380
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,560
What do you mean by what you just said?

381
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,080
Why is Qi Yue so nervous?

382
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,720
What did you see?

383
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:01,130
Nothing.

384
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,280
Was it the leak of tactics?

385
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,280
I've long suspected that he did it.

386
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,200
He just wanted to get rid of
Ji Xiang Kong.

387
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:17,790
When we were

388
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,860
in the meeting room that day,

389
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,770
I saw it with my own eyes.

390
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,620
He turned on the recorder.

391
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,140
After the meeting ended,

392
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,230
he even looked for Qiao Xin.

393
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,270
Why didn't you say back then?

394
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,470
I didn't dare to say it.

395
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,150
When I was about to say it,

396
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:33,270
Ji Xiang Kong and Sister Wen have left.

397
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:40,180
Ji Xiang Kong has left.

398
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,190
But if

399
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,380
you don't explain it,

400
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,400
it'll become

401
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,720
a stain forever in his career.

402
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,560
And Qiu Ying.

403
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,050
She has been fired by GDV

404
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,530
because of this.

405
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,000
Tong Wu.

406
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,790
If you still regard Ji Xiang Kong

407
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,560
as your brother,

408
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,510
I think you should step up.

409
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,710
Why are you hesitating?

410
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,100
Are you afraid that Qi Yue will expel you?

411
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,240
How much further do you think

412
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,430
VNG can go now?

413
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,310
I'm not afraid to leave VNG.

414
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,700
Nor am I afraid of Qi Yue.

415
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,310
But you know what?

416
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,400
I have no proof.

417
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,890
Even if I said it,

418
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,910
would the organizing committee believe me?

419
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,720
How about this?

420
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,410
Look for Luo Tian.

421
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,190
He's looking into this matter.

422
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,740
What are you hesitating about?

423
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,670
I'll go with you.

424
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,140
Just leave together.

425
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:45,800
Mr. Luo.

426
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,180
What you two said is true?

427
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,600
Did Qi Yue really record it

428
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,080
and pass the recorder to Qiao Xin?

429
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,430
I saw it with my own eyes.

430
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,100
They were at the door of the hotel gym.

431
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,780
Let's go to the hotel now.

432
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,160
Watch the hotel surveillance video.

433
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,300
Let's see if we can find the proof.

434
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,530
Come with me.

435
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,890
Mr. Luo, you're so busy

436
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,430
and yet come to practise with us.

437
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,359
We haven't been playing together

438
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,740
for a long time.

439
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,200
It reminds me of that time.

440
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,700
When we were here

441
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,140
fighting together.

442
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:30,900
By the way,

443
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,890
there's progress with the matter of

444
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,760
the leak of tactics.

445
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,890
The organizing committee

446
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,360
will soon come out with the result.

447
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,950
Thank you

448
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,750
for always helping me.

449
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,250
I promised you that

450
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,740
I must prove your innocence.

451
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,320
The matter

452
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,320
is over now.

453
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,120
Would you like to come back
and do the commentary?

454
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,730
Of course I would.

455
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,910
But now,

456
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,840
Phoenix needs me too.

457

[iConquer Spring Playoffs 2019]

458
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,620
We want Pei Xi back!

459
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,700
We want Mid Laner back!

460
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,700
Replace Xia Ling!

461
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,380
We want Pei Xi back!

462
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,450
We want Pei Xi back!

463
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,120
Replace Xia Ling!

464
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,860
We want Pei Xi back!

465
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,710
Dear summoners,

466
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,240
welcome to the the finals of

467
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,290
2019 iConquer

468
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,610
Spring Championship.

469
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,860
I'm Luo Tian, today's host.

470
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,130
I'm Can.

471
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,710
Welcome all.

472
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,500
Today's game

473
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,080
is the ultimate battle between

474
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,880
the new dark horse, Phoenix

475
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,330
and old-yet-gold VNG.

476
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,010
Only one of them

477
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:34,880
can be the winner

478
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,330
to get the only ticket

479
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,050
to

480
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,900
the global finals.

481
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,600
Yes.

482
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:41,060
iConquer will finally hold

483
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,640
the global finals in China.

484
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,690
I hope

485
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,800
our China team

486
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:47,280
can win glory for the country at home.

487
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:48,660
Now let's

488
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,040
give a big round of applause

489
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,840
to welcome both teams.

490
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,080
Phoenix and VNG.

491
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,380
Our audience

492
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,960
are very enthusiastic.

493
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,020
I declare that the race

494
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,620
begins now.

495
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,870
Please take your seats.

496
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,800
All good.

497
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,180
Go, go.

498
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,050
Watch out.

499
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,860
Now we can't get the vision.

500
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,800
Don't be afraid of him.

501
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:43,790
Ji Xiang Kong only has these two tactics.

502
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,520
Lu Sheng

503
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,600
has no economy at all.

504
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,050
-Let's press him down.
-Okay.

505
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,770
Mid lane is particularly stable.

506
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,900
Xia Ling. It's Xia Ling.

507
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,260
He got a triple kill

508
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,280
in the mid lane.

509
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,820
Xia Ling was not the newbie

510
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,850
we used to know.

511
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,630
Let's go, Shen Yue.

512
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,740
Take down Xia Ling who's over-confident.

513
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,050
-All right.
-Come on, quickly.

514
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:00,880
The location of Pei Xi.

515
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,660
I don't know where he is now.

516
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,390
Be careful.

517
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,320
We can beat them.

518
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,230
We can beat them!

519
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,450
Leave it to you.

520
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,370
Chase quickly.

521
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:07,560
Let's see.

522
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,870
Xia Ling's support was too timely

523
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:09,830
with his current economy.

524
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,430
Xia Ling, come and harvest.

525
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:12,900
Xia Ling, it's your showtime.

526
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,140
We can win at once.

527
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,810
Win at once!

528
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,470
I tank the tower. Don't wait for the line.

529
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,890
Start the team fight. Shen Yue, quick!

530
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,610
Congratulations to Phoenix

531
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,120
for winning a round.

532
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,680
Congratulations to Phoenix!

533
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:37,740
Young man.

534
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,060
My son is inside.

535
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,500
Can I go in and have a look?

536
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,780
Do you have a ticket?

537
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,030
Did you buy the ticket?

538
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,830
No, the tickets were sold out long ago.

539
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,530
I just called Ying.

540
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:48,710
She'll come out to meet us soon.

541
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,110
Ying.

542
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,640
Hi, it's my work permit.

543
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,300
Dad.

544
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,300
Why are you here suddenly for the game?

545
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,780
I can't understand it at home.

546
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,800
And she's worried about Xia Ling.

547
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,220
Let's go in.

548
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,790
Aunt, Dad.

549
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,550
Come in quickly.

550
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,180
-Sorry for bothering you.
-It's okay.

551
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,930
Xia Ling is over there.

552
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,240
Look.

553
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:24,770
Xia Ling.

554
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,430
I saw him.

555
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,300
Aunt, come here.

556
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,170
Thank you.

557
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,530
Dad, have a seat.

558
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,390
Thank you very much.

559
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,310
Now it's a tie.

560
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,300
1:1.

561
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,420
1:1?

562
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Yes, it's the match point.

563
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,130
Which one is Xia  Ling?

564
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
The one in the mid lane, Zhi Heng.

565
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,750
Which one?

566
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,450
The one with the purple hair.

567
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:51,520
Did you see it?

568
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:52,640
The one in red.

569
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,460
Right.

570
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,560
The one in the middle.

571
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,490
I've seen it.

572
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,230
Why don't you talk less?

573
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,590
The game is about to start.

574
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,380
Get us vision.

575
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,870
Okay, I'm on my way.

576
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,510
Be careful.

577
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,430
Okay.

578
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,600
I'll go to the top lane.

579
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,500
He handed in his skills.

580
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,150
He handed in his skills.

581
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,010
We can win this time.

582
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,770
There're only four of them.

583
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,570
Let's start the team fight.

584
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:08,860
Aunt, don't worry.

585
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,770
Xia Ling is still short of

586
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,740
300 of money.

587
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,980
As long as he bought

588
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:12,770
all the items,

589
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,700
he can beat the others.

590
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,430
How much does it cost?

591
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,200
It's fake, Aunt.

592
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,600
Let's go. We can push it.

593
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,850
I can push it.

594
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,730
We can push it.

595
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,430
I'll go first.

596
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,800
Let's go, I saw Xia Ling.

597
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,810
Qi Yue and Shen Yue

598
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,630
are in our jungle.

599
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,190
Do we need to kill them?

600
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,120
No.

601
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,900
Let's return and make a fake move.

602
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:30,630
Okay.

603
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,400
Xia Ling, you can be the bait.

604
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,280
Let's watch again.

605
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,730
Xia Ling is in a dangerous position.

606
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:35,870
Is Xia Ling

607
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,030
be the bait this time?

608
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,140
But Double Yue

609
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:38,830
won't let the chance slip.

610
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,900
It's such a good opportunity.

611
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,870
They took the bait. Nice.

612
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,380
Xia Ling, I'm here to help you.

613
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,630
Pei Xi is coming from behind.

614
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,920
The opponent was caught off guard.

615
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,150
Nice.

616
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,840
This is a risky move.

617
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,590
Lure the enemy in deep.

618
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,840
Just wait and see, Pei Xi.

619
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,010
We can't fight.

620
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,670
There're only two of us.

621
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,600
The output is not enough.

622
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,250
Double Yue escaped with a little blood.

623
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,400
Ji Xiang Kong.

624
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,070
Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan are coming.

625
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:02,890
Based on this condition,

626
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,120
VNG will lose the tower.

627
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,840
Phoenix made

628
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,070
a little money.

629
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,870
What does that mean?

630
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,090
He went around this way.

631
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,530
They'll win by just

632
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,880
pushing the tower.

633
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:15,560
Retreat a bit.

634
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:16,470
I'll retreat first.

635
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,540
Let's farm first.

636
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,490
Don't fight.

637
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:19,070
Let's farm first.

638
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:19,670
Talk less.

639
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,150
We've lost so much this wave.

640
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,340
Xia Ling, switch the position with Pei Xi.

641
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,420
Let's go for the mid lane.

642
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,030
I got it.

643
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,600
Okay.

644
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:25,930
I'm coming to the mid lane.

645
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,970
Let's see.

646
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,470
VNG may be on the spur of the moment

647
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,610
and yet not about to give up.

648
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,500
Shen Yue and Tong Wu

649
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,610
caught up with Pei Xi who ran away.

650
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,690
Phoenix gave the support immediately.

651
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,110
I think that the top teams

652
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,250
always give the support quickly.

653
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,450
Yes. Lin Yi Xuan and Sun Ze Yi

654
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,010
cooperated with Ji Xiang Kong

655
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,320
and came almost instantaneously

656
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:40,990
beside Pei Xi.

657
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,300
VNG has to run.

658
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,410
If not, they'll be in trouble.

659
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:44,480
They'll be done for.

660
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,190
Did they win?

661
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:47,760
Not yet.

662
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,640
Now they're in the outer tower.

663
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,830
Just destroy their Nexus

664
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,570
will win.

665
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,550
We can fight against them.

666
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,200
We can fight.

667
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,430
We can fight against them.

668
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,590
I'll take the lead.

669
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,590
Phoenix is good in supporting.

670
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,810
But VNG is not easy to be defeated too.

671
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,360
They're coming.

672
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,210
The remaining three people of VNG
were transferred directly.

673
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,180
Five of them are together.

674
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,300
Are they going to have team fight
this wave?

675
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,570
They won't start a fight first.

676
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,620
After all, the output aren't there.

677
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,920
But they didn't realize

678
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,900
the Mid laner

679
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,290
should be Pei Xi now.

680
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,190
Isn't Pei Xi

681
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,730
the jungler?

682
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,540
That's the shadow tactics.

683
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,750
They switched positions

684
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,130
and caught the opponent off guard.

685
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,330
And look carefully

686
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:18,390
at the position of Xia Ling.

687
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,170
If VNG starts the fight first,

688
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,710
they'll surely lose.

689
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,650
There're only four of them now.

690
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,760
Let's start the fight. Come on.

691
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,720
Come quickly.

692
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:24,870
You all come up.

693
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,200
The output can't keep up.
Go a little further back.

694
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,260
Wait a minute for me.

695
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,340
They're starting a fight.

696
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,390
Fight with them.

697
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,270
Shen Yue.

698
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,420
Shen Yue started the fight.

699
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,340
I've controlled one.

700
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,210
I've controlled one.

701
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,570
Shen Yue, you're too close in the front.

702
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,910
Pei Xi's moves are very amazing.

703
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,060
He killed Shen Yue

704
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,070
with a set of skills.

705
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,220
At the same time, he retreated

706
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,110
behind Lin Yi Xuan

707
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,780
to prepare for the next wave.

708
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,210
Slow down a little bit.

709
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,320
Hold on, Shen Yue.

710
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,740
Xia Ling, come to harvest.

711
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,890
There're four of them.

712
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,940
It's your showtime.

713
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,080
The lawn mower is turned on.

714
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,610
Oh, wait.

715
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,330
Where did

716
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,590
Xia Ling come from?

717
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,120
How come

718
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,170
he already appeared
in the back row of VNG?

719
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,250
VNG is in danger.

720
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,230
Double kill. Cool!

721
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,700
Triple kill. Quadra kill.

722
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,670
It's not over yet!

723
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,620
They're about to win!

724
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,860
VNG was aced.

725
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,660
The moves of Xia Ling are amazing

726
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,470
and deceptive.

727
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,150
And it really

728
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,470
caught us off guard.

729
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,630
Phoenix is advancing all the way.

730
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,920
Destroy the inner tower,
then the base tower.

731
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:18,790
They're halfway

732
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,530
to get the ticket

733
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,180
to the finals.

734
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:22,780
No.

735
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,460
Wait a moment first.

736
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,480
Let's look at VNG again.

737
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,390
The shortest respawn time is 8 seconds.

738
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,410
Let's see if there's a chance

739
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,260
to get another team fight.

740
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,670
Invisible Spirit has

741
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,280
three seconds to the respawn.

742
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,730
Let's see where Xia Ling is.

743
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:33,720
What's he going to do?

744
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,270
He drew a bow

745
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,000
and shot the arrow of fire.

746
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:36,750
Does he want to stun

747
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,500
Qi Yue who just respawned
from the Fountain?

748
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,880
Xia Ling is going to dive the Fountain
to kill me.

749
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,950
What's he doing?

750
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,710
He unleashes his skills

751
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:42,520
to kill Qi Yue

752
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,480
and jumps out of the Fountain again.

753
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,650
This move is too amazing!

754
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,090
Ling Xia worked alone

755
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,050
and blocked VNG

756
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,100
from respawning.

757
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,680
Who dares to say Xia Ling

758
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,920
is a bad Mid Laner?

759
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,590
Fight for it, Xia Ling!

760
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:53,760
Phoenix

761
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,200
destroyed the base tower straight away.

762
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:55,930
They don't give VNG

763
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,050
any chance to win.

764
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,760
Great!

765
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,050
Are you a bunch of crap?

766
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,690
What are you playing? Idiot!

767
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:15,380
Phoenix is the champion!

768
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,250
Congratulations to Phoenix

769
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,600
for becoming the winner

770
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,310
of the spring finals this season.

771
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,620
Congratulations to Phoenix

772
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:13,090
for becoming the champion of

773
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,900
iConquer Spring Championship

774
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,810
and getting

775
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,230
the last ticket

776
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,670
to the global finals.

777
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,350
Phoenix has received

778
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,390
a lot of criticism

779
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,690
along the way,

780
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,010
especially in tactics.

781
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,670
So I'm going to ask the captain,

782
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,610
Ji Xiang Kong,

783
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,420
what makes you stick with

784
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,230
shadow tactics?

785
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,740
Because I trust my teammates

786
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,980
all the time.

787
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,900
Trusting teammates

788
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,660
is giving the opponent the most damage.

789
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,820
That's great.

790
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,790
Oh right, Brother Yi.

791
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,170
Since you were back in the game again,

792
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,930
I'm sure

793
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,000
you faced a lot of pressure

794
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,010
and doubts.

795
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,610
It wasn't easy for me

796
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,090
to be back in the game again.

797
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,100
Brother Yi, I'm rooting for you.
Keep it up!

798
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,910
Thank you all.

799
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,100
I purely enjoy the process

800
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,560
on the battlefield.

801
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,500
Thank you all!

802
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,060
I believe Phoenix

803
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,520
still has a long way to go.

804
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:06,580
Just enjoy

805
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,810
the game belonged to you.

806
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,300
Let's take a look at the MVP of the game.

807
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,320
It's Xia Ling!

808
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,620
Xia Ling!

809
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,040
For just one season,

810
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,420
he got the MVP.

811
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,460
Xia Ling.

812
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,370
Do you have

813
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,440
anything to say?

814
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,680
I actually...

815
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,870
Xia Ling, you're the best!

816
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,270
I

817
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,840
want to tell my parents

818
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,940
and my sister that

819
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,220
I win the championship.

820
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,790
I proved myself!

821
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:40,290
Xia Ling told all the fans
who love iConquer

822
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,430
with his own action that

823
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,500
Life can crush your body

824
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,570
but

825
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,550
it can't crush your will.

826
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,160
Congratulations, Xia Ling!

827
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,420
The former players of Pioneers,

828
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:54,660
Summer and Shu Wen

829
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,900
also came on stage.

830
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,400
There're also

831
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,040
the captain of Phoenix, Qiu Ying.

832
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,860
Let's follow Phoenix

833
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,100
to get on a wider stage.

834
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,090
Let's hope they can

835
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,160
be the champion for the sake of China.

836
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,640
Going to the peak of the world together!

837
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,680
What's their slogan?

838
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:32,870
Rebirth of Nirvana!

839
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,560
Cheers!

840
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,690
It's cold.

841
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,500
Well.

842
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,330
Let me say something.

843
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,980
While everyone is here today

844
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,050
and so happy,

845
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,400
as a journalist,

846
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,460
I have some questions

847
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,850
to ask everyone.

848
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,240
Alright, cooperate with you.

849
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,460
Let's start now.

850
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,880
Let's start with

851
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,480
Ji Xiang Kong.

852
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:00,930
Okay.

853
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,590
As the captain,

854
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,790
do you have anything to say

855
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,880
seeing Phoenix

856
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,190
come along this way?

857
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,980
I'd like to ask first.

858
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,700
Is it official

859
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,740
or unofficial?

860
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:13,310
She's doing the interview officially.

861
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:17,960
I want to say

862
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,850
Phoenix came along this way

863
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,400
from nothing.

864
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,570
I've always wanted to

865
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,590
thank my brothers.

866
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,190
It's really official.

867
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,610
Brother Xia Ling.

868
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,080
As the youngest talented player

869
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,640
in the whole league,

870
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:35,810
do you have anything to say?

871
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,380
My earliest dream

872
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,850
was to become

873
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,840
a hero on the basketball court.

874
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,670
But now I have you all.

875
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,320
With Phoenix,

876
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,100
I can still be a hero.

877
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,680
Great!

878
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,010
Look.

879
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,510
Qiu Ying as his sister is going to cry.

880
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
Don't cry.

881
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,880
Let's continue.

882
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,790
Pei Xi.

883
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,780
A lot of people said you've changed.

884
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,280
You're not as selfish as

885
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:10,750
you used to be.

886
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:13,060
Compared with the former,

887
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,620
which one do you like better?

888
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,520
The current me, of course.

889
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,490
Can you tell us

890
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,140
why?

891
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,710
Fine.

892
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,490
Why do you ask so many?

893
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:23,040
I'm prepared.

894
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:23,640
Ask me.

895
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,070
Don't rush. I haven't finished asking.

896
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:26,110
By the way, Pei Xi.

897
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,010
I've always wanted to ask you.

898
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,170
Why do you always like

899
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,530
working as a waiter at Dream Traveler

900
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,180
and making coffee for everyone?

901
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,450
Right.

902
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,010
Because

903
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,790
I like being with everyone.

904
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,220
I like the feeling of

905
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,880
being needed by everyone.

906
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,890
Now I have

907
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:58,360
a more important thing than
winning the game.

908
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,950
I have a group of

909
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,900
true and sincere

910
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:07,400
brothers

911
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,310
to join the game together.

912
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,730
Thank you.

913
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,600
Brother.

914
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,080
Seeing how much you've changed

915
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,030
and made many

916
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:18,870
true friends,

917
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,980
I'm really relieved.

918
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,760
When you need to open the shield
next time,

919
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,610
tell me.

920
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,450
You're also my hero.

921
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,140
Rest assured.

922
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,540
With "bad" friends like us,

923
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,990
you'll never be alone again.

924
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,860
How affectionate.

925
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,110
Let me say a few words too.

926
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,330
Thank you, Brother Kong.

927
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,730
I became

928
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,750
a professional player all the way

929
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,480
from a delivery boy

930
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,610
and even joined the world finals.

931
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,090
Thank you everyone here

932
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:00,820
for tolerating

933
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,010
all my bad habits.

934
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:05,250
Thank you, Phoenix.

935
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,230
Because of Phoenix,

936
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,120
I have the confidence

937
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,489
to go for the peak of the world.

938
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,000
Phoenix is not just a team,

939
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,690
but is also a home.

940
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,280
Thank you very much for letting me,

941
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:23,210
the oldest player in the league

942
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,540
to come back and play.

943
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,290
Hopefully we can keep going

944
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,670
and reach the peak step by step.

945
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,159
Something I wanted to do before

946
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,190
now has been realized in Phoenix.

947
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,159
Congratulations, Xiang Kong.

948
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:46,340
Finally you found

949
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,190
the perfect team belonged to you.

950
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,510
Come on, don't get emotional.

951
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,770
I'm starving.

952
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,490
Come on. Cheers.

953
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,830
Say something, Xiang Kong.

954
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,250
Okay, I'll cut it short.

955
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,640
Let's meet at the world finals.

956
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,090
Bottoms up.

957
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:14,950
What are you thinking?

958
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,150
I'm thinking of

959
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,920
you standing on the stage

960
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,140
in the world finals.

961
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,990
It must be very cool.

962
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,430
I'm sorry.

963
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,800
Why do you say sorry?

964
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,400
I didn't help you

965
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,430
accomplish your dream.

966
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,240
Yesterday,

967
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,340
Tong Wu and Lu Sheng came to meet me.

968
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,850
They said Qi Yue and Qiao Xin

969
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:46,910
fabricated the matter of

970
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,020
the leak of tactics.

971
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,880
I got you into trouble

972
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,490
that you can no longer do the commentary.

973
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,240
How can I blame you?

974
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,640
If there was no Qiao Xin,

975
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,740
Qi Yue couldn't

976
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,210
make it alone too.

977
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,510
But if

978
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,660
it wasn't for this matter,

979
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:03,760
maybe you can

980
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,840
stand on the world finals stage

981
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,910
and comment on every game of Phoenix.

982
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:13,100
Now I'm going as the team lead.

983
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,860
Isn't that nice too?

984
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,580
But doing the commentary is your stage.

985
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:18,510
-It's your dream.
-It's okay.

986
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,670
After the organizing committee
investigated it,

987
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:23,870
I will be

988
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:24,880
back to the commentary table.

989
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,530
It's okay. Just pick it up.

990
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,940
I'm not that narrow-minded.

991
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,520
Ji Xiang Kong.

992
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,150
It's me.

993
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,160
Something happened to Mi Ya.

994
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:54,940
What?

995
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,530
When she was rehearsing,

996
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,260
she fell from the wire.

997
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,280
Now she was admitted to the hospital.

998
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,850
Hello, Miss.

999
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,120
How can I get to room 1709?

1000
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,270
Thank you.

1001
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:27,990
How is Mi Ya now?

1002
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,230
Let's talk outside.

1003
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,560
How is she now?

1004
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,630
She just fell asleep.

1005
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:44,400
But

1006
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,140
she has extravasated blood in her head.

1007
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,240
It's pressing on the nerves.

1008
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,060
We need to

1009
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,370
wait for the results from the doctor.

1010
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:52,740
What exactly was going on?

1011
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,180
This concert is very important to her.

1012
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:58,590
And it took a long time to prepare.

1013
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,810
Originally, she didn't have to use wire

1014
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,920
for this rehearsal.

1015
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,060
But

1016
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:08,450
she didn't want any mistake in details.

1017
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,530
I didn't expect that

1018
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,880
the operator made a mistake.

1019
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:18,560
It happened so suddenly.

1020
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,720
Mi Ya has no family member.

1021
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,210
So I had to call you to come.

1022
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,810
I hope you can understand that.

1023
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,620
Let's meet the doctor later

1024
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,600
and ask again.

1025
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,710
Her condition is not so good.

1026
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,580
Look.

1027
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,720
The extravasated blood in her head

1028
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,310
has pressed on the optic nerve.

1029
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,950
She may go blind.

1030
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,470
What? Go blind?

1031
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:57,670
How did that happen?

1032
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,040
It's temporary, right?

1033
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,560
If she really goes blind,

1034
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,420
it's hard to say if she'll recover.

1035
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,020
The patient has an old wound to the head.

1036
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,270
What I'm worried about right now is

1037
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,800
two injuries can aggravate

1038
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:10,950
the extent of damage to the optic nerve.

1039
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,420
You have to be prepared

1040
00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:13,450
for permanent blindness.

1041
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,000
Xiang Kong.

1042
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,340
Mi Ya's injury was an accident.

1043
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,990
Don't be like this, okay?

1044
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,860
Let's figure it out together.

1045
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:06,940
She'll get recovered.

1046
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,670
It's not your fault.

1047
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,110
No, I should take the blame.

1048
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,210
If it wasn't for me that year,

1049
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,060
she wouldn't have an old wound.

1050
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:32,070
You worked as a stuntman

1051
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,680
just to get me a computer?

1052
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,630
Sit here.

1053
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,800
You want to be a professional player.

1054
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,770
Of course you need
a professional computer.

1055
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,430
With this computer,

1056
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,090
you can practise well.

1057
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:48,470
You'll be able to

1058
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:49,500
become a professional player

1059
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:50,830
and join the world finals

1060
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:51,990
to get the world champion.

1061
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:56,990
Thank you.

1062
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,050
Promise me

1063
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,250
not to

1064
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,460
do such a dangerous job again.

1065
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:04,830
You copy that?

1066
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:06,950
Okay.

1067
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,590
It's getting late.

1068
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,730
Xiang Kong and you

1069
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,740
can go back early to rest.

1070
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:28,920
I'll call him.

1071
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:44,460
Xiang Kong.

1072
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,780
Go home early.

1073
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:49,790
When she woke up,

1074
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,750
I'll call you again.

1075
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,340
Nevermind.

1076
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:56,290
I want to keep her company.

1077
00:42:38,110 --> 00:42:40,760
Sir, what's the matter?

1078
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,370
Qi Yue.

1079
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,390
They're the staff of
the organizing committee.

1080
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,580
They want to talk to you

1081
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,670
about the leak of tactics.

1082
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:52,600
Why?

1083
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:53,970
Didn't Qiu Ying do it?

1084
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,040
I'd like to ask you

1085
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,110
from the organizing committee

1086
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:56,750
that why such a person

1087
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:57,980
can get to the finals.

1088
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,960
We didn't investigate on

1089
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:02,400
Qiu Ying this time,

1090
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,360
but you instead.

1091
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:06,520
Please come with us

1092
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,830
to the organizing committee.

1093
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:09,900
Investigate on me?

1094
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,780
Just go and ask Ji Xiang Kong.

1095
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,430
Sir.

1096
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,670
I still have a lot of training.

1097
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,590
May I go out first?

1098
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,110
Qi Yue, it's just an investigation.

1099
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:20,710
I always

1100
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:24,060
have high hopes for you.

1101
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,100
There's still a long way to go.

1102
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,110
Conduct yourself well.

1103
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,110
If it's really related to him,

1104
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,250
I won't have objection with

1105
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,050
whatever you do with him.

1106
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:49,620
Thank you.

1107
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,160
Thank you.

1108
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:55,370
Mr. Can.

1109
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:57,110
Have a look at some of my analysis

1110
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,750
about the world finals.

1111
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,600
Just leave it here.

1112
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:00,470
Okay.

1113
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,390
Let me help you sort it out.

1114
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:08,550
Mr. Can.

1115
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:09,950
I heard that

1116
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,340
about the list of going to
the world finals,

1117
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:12,460
Mr. Luo

1118
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,130
doesn't seem to have been decided yet.

1119
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,490
You also know

1120
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:15,980
the style of Luo Tian.

1121
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,480
If there's no one suitable,

1122
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:18,730
he'd rather leave it blank.

1123
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,250
We've been working together for so long.

1124
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,750
Can you help me to ask?

1125
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,990
I'm busy. I'll excuse myself first.

1126
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,250
Mr. Can.

1127
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:30,020
Wait a minute, Mr. Can.

1128
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:34,960
Did I do something wrong?

1129
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:36,510
Why do you

1130
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,450
have this attitude towards me?

1131
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,160
Mr. Luo.

1132
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,510
Qiao Xin, this is Lucy
from the organizing committee

1133
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:45,860
of iConquer.

1134
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:46,870
She wants to talk about something
with you.

1135
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:48,120
Miss Qiao.

1136
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,990
About the leak of tactics,

1137
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:51,040
we want to talk to you

1138
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:51,860
to learn about it.

1139
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,270
Hasn't it been verified last time?

1140
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,280
We have some evidence

1141
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:59,380
and it proves that you're involved
in the matter.

1142
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:02,580
Me?

1143
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,080
It has nothing to do with me.

1144
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:07,560
Mr. Luo.

1145
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:09,170
They must have misunderstood me.

1146
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,850
Miss Qiao.

1147
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,720
Please cooperate with me.

1148
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,380
Who's that?

1149
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:37,970
Mi Ya, it's me.

1150
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,720
Xiang Kong.

1151
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,370
I bought you a bunch of lilies.

1152
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:44,820
Smell if it's good.

1153
00:45:50,170 --> 00:45:51,120
It smells good.

1154
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,360
What time is it now?

1155
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:08,850
4:30 p.m.

1156
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:11,250
4:30 p.m.?

1157
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,170
It's only 4:30 p.m.?

1158
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,790
Why does the time pass so slowly?

1159
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
Don't worry. I'll accompany you.

1160
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,320
Okay.

1161
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:33,900
Xiang Kong.

1162
00:46:35,110 --> 00:46:36,520
I think I'll really

1163
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:38,990
go blind

1164
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:39,960
this time.

1165
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,340
I can't get on the stage again.

1166
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,520
Mi Ya.

1167
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:51,930
Your eyes will be all right.

1168
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:57,800
But I'm so scared.

1169
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,520
It's so dark around me.

1170
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:02,760
Endless darkness.

1171
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,860
I'm very tired.

1172
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,650
I don't know what to do.

1173
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,160
Sleep for a while.

1174
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,430
You need more rest now.

1175
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:25,190
I can't fall asleep.

1176
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,170
Be good. Take a nap.

1177
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:30,130
I accompany you.

1178
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:33,880
Don't go then.

1179
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:36,370
Don't worry.

1180
00:47:36,470 --> 00:47:37,240
I won't leave.
