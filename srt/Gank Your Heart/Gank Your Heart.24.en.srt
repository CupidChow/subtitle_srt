This is so cool.

Of course, Brother Sun
designed everything here.

-This...
-Look out!

Be careful not to break it.

8

Brother Sun.

00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,330
Qiu Ying?

10
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,920
Yes.

11
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,450
Xiang Kong often
mentioned you in front of me.

12
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,669
I didn't.

13
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,750
-I'm hungry, let me find something to eat.
-Wait.

14
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,860
Were you a starving ghost
before you were born?

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,360
I haven't introduced myself yet.

16
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,240
No need. I know who you are.

17
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,140
You are one of the
Five Ancient Masters, Sun Ze Yi.

18
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,700
This brat here told you that, right?

19
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,280
No, I've watched all of your competitions.

20
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,290
You were the captain
and tactical commander,

21
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,420
literally the soul of the team.

22
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,240
Your girlfriend is making me blush.

23
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,180
Have a seat and chat.

24
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,630
I'll whip up something for you.

25
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,750
Thanks, Brother Sun.

26
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:47,040
What are you thinking?

27
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,490
No… Nothing.

28
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,440
Show me your competition analysis.

29
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,650
Okay.

30
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
Then...

31
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,050
Looks good.

32
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
You have improved.

33
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,200
Well...

34
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,200
When you look me like that,

35
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,070
I can't concentrate.

36
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,140
Are you thirsty?
Let me grab a bottle of water for you.

37
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,140
Yi Yi, I'm back.

38
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,140
You're back. Come here.

39
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,190
Why are you so happy?

40
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,920
Well, I am looking at the
competition analysis you uploaded.

41
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,510
It's wonderful!

42
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,420
You saw it already?

43
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,860
It's trending online.

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,190
Can I not see it?

45
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,210
But, I just posted it on Weibo.

46
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,720
How did it become a trend?

47
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,580
That's because this afternoon,

48
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,140
Qiao Xin also posted
a competition analysis.

49
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,820
The netizens compared both your articles,

50
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,400
and they all said that

51
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,690
yours is the better one.

52
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,690
-Let me see.
-Here you are.

53
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,570
See.

54
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,640
I'm sure Qiao Xin

55
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,740
is blowing up right now.

56
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,380
Really, your competition
analysis slapped her in the face.

57
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,150
Nice work! Here.

58
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,790
Qiao Xin only knows how
to put on a show all day long.

59
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,450
Actually, she just hired a ghostwriter.

60
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,210
She deserves a harsh slap on her face.

61
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,720
Ghostwriter?

62
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:30,120
So, that means she didn't write all these?

63
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,900
It's clear that Can
is ghostwriting for her.

64
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,340
Look at the style and word choice.

65
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,010
It's Can for sure.

66
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,500
The reason why I am telling you this

67
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,670
is to remind you

68
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,520
to be careful of Qiao Xin and Can.

69
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,850
Right now, they're
literally partners in crime.

70
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,010
You need to be on guard.

71
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,490
I know.

72
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,380
But, right now,
I don't have time to think about them.

73
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,350
Let them be.

74
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,830
Right. Don't think about them.

75
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,520
Here. Are you hungry?

76
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,690
Eat a piece.

77
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,410
This self-cook steamboat is the best.
I'll make one too.

78
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,550
Just sit here.

79

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,030

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,210
And her backstage, too.

94
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,580
I can't believe she really sent me.

95
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,320

96

Let me introduce him.

107
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,350
This is VNG's new captain, Ji Xiang Kong.

108
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,950
Hello.

109
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,409
Hello.

110
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,700
I've been following VNG's competitions.

111
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,630
I also admire your game strategies.

112
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:54,200
Actually, I am a fan of iConquer.

113
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,670
I hope we get to play as a duo someday.

114
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,090
It would be my honour.

115
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,950
But, Ms Mia, you're a busy lady,

116
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,350
and you are a public figure,

117
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,180
so you need to pay attention
to what you say and do.

118
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:07,030
I'm afraid you won't have much chance

119
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,490
to play iConquer.

120
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,870
That may be how it was before,

121
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,970
but I've already talked with my agency.

122
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,750
I'm shifting my work focus
to the domestic market,

123
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,100
especially collaborating
with iConquer sports.

124
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,700
Here's the picture.

125
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,290
Mia has been endorsing
multiple brands lately,

126
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,940
and she specifically requested for VNG.

127
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,900
VNG is my favourite team.

128
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,340
I hope I can attract
better resources for you

129
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,159
so you can focus more on your games.

130

Our captain is your super fan.

135
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,440
He must be overwhelmed by joy now.

136
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,220
Xiang Kong.

137
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,150
Say something.

138
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,620
Hope we'll get along.

139
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,500
Why didn't you say anything just now?

140
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,900
Did I upset you because
I visited your team?

141
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,470
No.

142
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,430
I was thinking about something else.

143
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,190
You should go back.

144
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,560
Xiang Kong.

145
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:50,840
I was too selfish before.

146
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:54,110
I only wanted you to
support my career development,

147
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,900
but I forgot that you were
going through a career slump

148
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,150
and needed someone by your side.

149
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,790
That won't happen anymore.

150
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,450
Now that I'm back,

151
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,910
I hope to use everything
I've accumulated all these years

152
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,760
to support you

153
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,470
and help you achieve your dream.

154
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,050
If two people want to stay together,

155
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,080
it's not necessary to have
one sacrifice for another.

156
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:31,620
It's about accompanying and
complementing each other.

157
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,100
Your success today
is not because of me.

158
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,120
So,

159
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,810
you don't have to
consider making up to me.

160
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,370
When I see you beaming on the stage,

161
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:48,220
I would feel that I was right
to make that decision back then.

162
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,890
But I regret it.

163
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,750
I once visualized reaching
the peak of my dreams,

164
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,410
but when I really got there,
only then I realized

165
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:00,390
that no matter how
breathtaking the scenery is,

166
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,240
it's meaningless without your company.

167
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,290
Xiang Kong.

168
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,010
Could you do me another favour?

169
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,170
Wait me for a second.

170
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,470
Don't leave.

171
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,450
Xiang Kong.

172
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,930
Do you still remember this guitar?

173
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,510
I've had this Taylor for many years.

174
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,920
It looks old, but the tone is perfect.

175
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,590
Take a look.

176
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,560
Can I pay in installments?

177
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,750
I can also work for you.

178
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,410
It's a Taylor guitar!

179
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,890
Where do you get the money
to buy such an expensive guitar?

180
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,140
Actually, it's not
as expensive as you think.

181
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,010
It's a second hand guitar.

182
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,070
But the tone is fantastic.

183
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,200
Listen.

184
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,400
Its tone is nice indeed.

185
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,550
It's just that it's a bit old,
so it's hard to tune.

186
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,800
But don't worry,
I've learned from the shopkeeper.

187
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,720
In the future, before you play it,

188
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,140
I will tune it for you.

189
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:21,090
Then I need to play
this guitar throughout my life

190
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,110
so you can be my full-time tuner forever.

191
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,210
Well?

192
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,470
Sure.

193
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,620
You said you would tune it for me forever.

194
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,060
Right now, could you still
tune it one more time for me?

195
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,770
Okay.

196
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,590
♫ The most brilliant ♫

197
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,200
♫ And most beautiful vista I've seen ♫

198
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,240
♫ Is in your eyes ♫

199
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,120
♫ From then on ♫

200
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
♫ I've never anticipated like so ♫

201
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,920
♫ If it weren't for ♫

202
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,880
♫ that hurried encounter ♫

203
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,400
♫ that appeared in this life ♫

204
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
♫ I would have been fearless ♫

205
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,040
♫ Unafraid of losing anything ♫

206
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,790
♫ Love is cautious ♫

207
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,960
♫ Wary of being expressed ♫

208
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,440
♫ A restless emotion ♫

209
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,400
♫ Love doesn't come easily ♫

210
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,400
♫ It's too pretty ♫

211
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,870
♫ Always the subject of obsession ♫

212
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,680
♫ I just want to feel secure ♫

213
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,800
♫ Just want to stay in your arms,
nowhere else ♫

214
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,770
Xiang Kong.

215
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,120
♫ But the world is too crowded ♫

216
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,940
Sorry.

217
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,700
I've forgotten how to tune.

218
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,110
I'm going.

219
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,290
Xiang Kong.

220
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,040
♫ I just want us ♫

221
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,600
♫ To stare into each others' eyes ♫

222
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,150
♫ Because it's you ♫

223
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:32,120
♫ I'll hug tightly
no matter how painful it gets ♫

224
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,570
♫ The monsoon wind blows to the sea ♫

225
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,910
♫ Beyond the sky ♫

226
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,190
♫ You think that birds ♫

227
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:57,440
♫ know no exhaustion,
always flying ahead ♫

228
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,290
♫ And one day ♫

229
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,680
♫ We both know we still
need to love each other ♫

230
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,440
♫ Go back to that tree,
get rid of our ego ♫

231
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,690
♫ Swallow our pride ♫

232
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:16,240
♫ The monsoon wind blows to the sea ♫

233
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,000
♫ Beyond the sky ♫

234
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:24,960
You just had to insist.

235
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,760
You just had to accept those
endorsement gigs to help Ji Xiang Kong.

236
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,230
And now?

237
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,260
Did he thank you after
knowing what you did?

238
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,250
It's not important.

239
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,900
I've already made my decision.

240
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,120
No matter how long
Xiang Kong had waited for me,

241
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,990
I will try twice as hard to
make it up to him and get him back

242
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,960
until he is willing to accept me.

243
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,990
Your stubborn personality

244
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:01,920
will make you regret someday.

245
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,810
Didn't you choose me because
of my persistence back then?

246
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,040
You even kept me company
through those hard times until now.

247
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,240
Tony.

248
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,360
Don't stop me.

249
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,330
Even if I'm a moth flying into the flame,

250
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,990
let me be crazy just once more.

251
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,110
Okay?

252
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,630
Mia.

253
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,880
Some people are not coming back
even you are willing to wait.

254
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,060
Ji Xiang Kong made it clear.

255
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,390
You two are no longer
how you were in the past.

256
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:55,970
What's more, there's that girl
called Qiu Ying with him.

257
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,510
Qiu Ying is just a substitute of me.

258
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,340
I can see myself in her.

259
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,970
So, in today's new song press conference,

260
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,520
you're arranging her to meet you backstage

261
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,960
to reveal everything

262
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,640
about your past with Ji Xiang Kong

263
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,630
so she would leave voluntarily?

264
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,860
Thanks.

265
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:44,760
Mr. Can.

266
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,650
I'm not a petty girl.

267
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,400
but just when we wrote a game analysis,

268
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,500
Qiu Ying posted another one immediately.

269
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,040
What is she trying to do?

270
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,650
She's a newbie.

271
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,540
It's understandable that
she wants to attract some attention.

272
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,530
But now, the netizens are saying

273
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,860
that her analysis
is accurate and professional.

274
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,820
Instead, they say ours
is not up to standard.

275
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,120
What's happening?

276
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,090
My article is not up to standard?

277
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,030
When I came to GDV,

278
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,960
she didn't even know what a commentary is.

279
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,470
Me, not good enough?

280
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,000
Mr. Can.

281
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:27,440
Actually, you don't have to be so angry.

282
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:30,550
It's clear that Qiu Ying
bought those good reviews.

283
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,690
When she was in You Xing,
she also did this.

284
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,180
She loves stepping on others

285
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,210
to elevate herself.

286
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:38,970
Alright.

287
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,240
Right now, this newbie

288
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:44,890
is acting disgracefully even before
stepping into the commentary podium.

289
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,630
I need to let her know
how to respect her seniors.

290
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,440
I'll teach her a lesson.

291
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,310
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

292
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,530
Mr. Guo. Are you looking for me?

293
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,590
Take a seat.

294
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,730
Was it you who wrote
this article on Weibo?

295
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,190
Yes. I wrote this.

296
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,610
What's the problem?

297
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,820
There is no problem with the article.

298
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,970
But, Qiu Ying,

299
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,740
you are still a newcomer.

300
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,510
You may not be familiar with
how things work in GDV.

301
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,510
GDV is what it is today

302
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:42,190
because everyone is united.

303
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:45,170
I don't want someone
to sabotage our camaraderie.

304
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,310
No, Mr. Guo.

305
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,690
I don't understand what you said.

306
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,520
I did write this article,

307
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,640
but I am not trying to
sabotage our camaraderie.

308
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,140
Qiu Ying, don't get too ambitious.

309
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:08,100
You're attracting attention
by stepping on your colleagues.

310
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,490
How would others think of GDV?

311
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,410
Mr. Can.

312
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,160
I was just concluding the regular season.

313
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,840
I don't mean to step on anyone.

314
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,390
Alright. No need to explain yourself.

315
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,730
When Qiao Xin's paper was published,

316
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,060
you posted another one

317
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,250
from almost the same analytic angle.

318
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,810
It's just so obvious that
you're trying to compete.

319
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,040
I don't want to see internal fights
like this happening again.

320
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,470
Do you understand me?

321
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:36,470
Mr. Guo.

322
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,690
Mr. Guo, here's the information you want.

323
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,950
Excuse me,

324
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,120
I just happened to hear your conversation.

325
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,040
Why is it that I don't feel
Qiu Ying's article was attacking anyone?

326
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,410
Qiao Xin posted her article.

327
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,040
Does that mean no one else can too?

328
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,410
So, Qiu Ying's article
is better than others.

329
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:59,110
Does that mean she's attacking anyone?

330
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,080
Mr. Guo.

331
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,430
In GDV, including our interns,

332
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,970
we have 17 commentators in total.

333
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,530
If you want to sit at
the commentator's table,

334
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:08,070
you need solid skills.

335
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:12,090
Besides, Qiao Xin's article
is a load of crap.

336
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,630
Can.

337
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,250
From a professional angle,
what do you think?

338
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:20,450
Mr. Luo.

339
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,230
Everything you say is right.

340
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,420
Alright. Don't mention this again.

341
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,640
Get back to work.

342
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,860
Brother Kong.

343
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,610
Now that we finally have a few days off,

344
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,660
why don't ask Qiu Ying out
for something like karaoke?

345
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,030
Just ask Lu Yi Yi out if you want.

346
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,100
Don't bother me here.

347
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,810
Who says I want to ask her out?

348
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,440
I am worried for you.

349
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,890
Pei Xi has already confessed.

350
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,640
Secret Garden?

351
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,310
Isn't that the trending restaurant
where people confess their love?

352
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:22,020
Are you going to confess to Qiu Ying?

353
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,750
Brother Kong is finally grown up.

354
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,530
-I say, this wasn't easy.
-Go away.

355
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,680
Go and help Brother Sun.

356
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,450
Don't close the web page.

357
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,680
It's hard to book a spot there.

358
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,670
They only accept reservations
every day at 3 pm for the same night.

359
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,290
Hurry up, or it'd be fully booked.

360
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,090
Buzz off.

361
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,960
Don't bother me here.

362
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:39,750
One computer might not be enough.

363
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,990
Hey, everyone.

364
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,750
Cheng Qi Meng, Chai Hao Wei.

365
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,020
Today,

366
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,740
whoever gets a spot at
Secret Garden for Brother Kong

367
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,570
gets to play here free for three days.

368
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,650
-Is that okay, Brother Sun?
-Sure.

369
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:52,670
See?

370
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,010
Which cute girl is dating Ji Shuai?

371
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,890
Is it Qiu Ying?

372
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,640
[Good news.]

373
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,560
[Mr. Luo told me that I can work
at the commentator's table now!]

374
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,060
[Perfect, I've prepared
a fancy dinner for you tonight.]

375
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,570
Love is in the air.

376
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,340
Go away.

377
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,390
Aren't you going to help me book? Go.

378
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,470
Okay.

379
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,210
You scared me.

380
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,890
What time is it? You're late.

381
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,370
Late?

382
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,390
I am not late.

383
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,480
Exactly half past six.
Neither more nor less.

384
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,410
Anyway, you need
to arrive earlier than me.

385
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,150
What did you buy?

386
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,790
A present for you.

387
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,320
For me?

388
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,050
Let me see.

389
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,550
But you can't unwrap it now.

390
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,650
Why can't I?

391
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,930
You can't unwrap it anyway.

392
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,400
Otherwise, I will be angry.

393
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,550
Let's go.

394
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,540
You haven't told me
where you're bringing me.

395
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,870
Forget it.

396
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,970
-Hurry up.
-There are so many people!

397
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,630
-This way.
-Isn't the entrance over there?

398
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,850
Forget it, just follow me.

399
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,120
You're stepping on me.

400
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:18,300
Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

401
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,130
Right now, I am reporting at Mia Fu's
first domestic press conference

402
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,560
for her new song, Beyond the Sky.

403
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:24,530
Quick.

404
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,970
What are you up to?
You're acting secretively.

405
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,500
You even led me in
through the back door.

406
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,600
You can finally meet the person
you've been dreaming of.

407
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,920
Is this surprise big enough?

408
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,260
Are you sure you know
who I've been dreaming of?

409
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,600
Of course. Look.

410
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,870
Well?

411
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,340
This is Mia's...

412
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,640
Mia is releasing a new song today.

413
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,570
She gave me two VIP tickets

414
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,980
so we can meet her at the backstage

415
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,300
and ask for her autograph.

416
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,070
I need to leave.

417
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,650
Look, you're blushing.

418
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,840
Let's go in.

419
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,290
Don't be shy. Here.

420
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,160
Go in.

421
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,400
Xiang Kong.

422
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,670
Why didn't you tell me that you are here?

423
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,200
Or did you see the message I sent you?

424
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,810
Qiu Ying?

425
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,520
You two...

426
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,820
Do you...

427
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,090
know each other?

428
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,100
Here.

429
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,440
Do you remember our
conversation at Rising Star?

430
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,870
I told you about a friend of mine

431
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,040
who likes e-sports really much.

432
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:17,990
He is Xiang Kong.

433
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:20,940
Also,

434
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,120
we literally grew up together.

435
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,410
Right, Xiang Kong?

436
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,200
Mia.

437
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,600
Let me introduce to you.

438
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,320
Qiu Ying.

439
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,820
She is my girlfriend.

440
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,770
Xiang Kong.

441
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,660
Are you still blaming me

442
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,860
for not holding on to our
relationship back then?

443
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,890
Did you choose Qiu Ying

444
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,570
because you see me in her?

445
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,470
Is it because she looks
exactly like me five years ago?

446
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,080
Is it?

447
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,940
She does look like you.

448
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,370
But…

449
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,130
Enough.

450
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:47,370
Your relationship with her

451
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:50,460
has nothing to do with me.

452
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,940
Please don't involve me in this anymore.

453
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,310
I don't want to be a tool for you two

454
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,240
to test each others' feelings.

455
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,690
-Qiu Ying.
-Xiang Kong.

456
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,550
Xiang Kong.

457
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,650
Give us one more chance.

458
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,620
Let's start again, OK?

459
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,370
Sorry. I already have someone I like.

460
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,570
Qiu Ying. Listen to me, Qiu Ying.

461
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
Qiu Ying.

462
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,660
Sorry, listen to me.

463
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,670
You are Mia's first love, right?

464
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,440
She composed Beyond the Sky for you.

465
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,990
Right?

466
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,230
It wasn't Ren Xu who
hugged her at the pool.

467
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,060
It was you, right?

468
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,740
Why didn't you tell me?

469
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,390
Why must you embarrass me?

470
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,340
Qiu Ying, I am sorry.

471
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,390
But, it's not what you think.

472
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,120
Why did you tell her I am your girlfriend?

473
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:07,490
Who do you think I am, Ji Xiang Kong?

474
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,540
You can't forget her.

475
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,210
Why must you give me
the illusion that you like me?

476
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,460
Qiu Ying. I really like you.

477
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,420
I want you to be my girlfriend, really.

478
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,580
But, I really can't believe all this.

479
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,720
Ji Xiang Kong, you can't forget her.

480
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,270
You befriended me

481
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,600
only because you see her in me.

482
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,070
I am just a substitute.

483
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,280
Qiu Ying. It's not what you think.
Listen to me.

484
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,650
Let go of me!

485
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,060
I don't want to listen to you!

486
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,640
Qiu Ying!

487
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,400
♫ Face the music calmly ♫

488
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,290
♫ As if you have never been here ♫

489
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,730
♫ Rain falls, rain stops, rain goes away ♫

490
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,760
♫ Is it because I miss you a lot? ♫

491
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,720
♫ Wishing that you'd pass by again ♫

492
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,240
♫ Won't say anything sentimental ♫

493
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:21,570
♫ Read through every single word ♫

494
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,770
♫ The reason all too clear ♫

495
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,970
♫ Everyone came to me, advising ♫

496
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:36,080
♫ Me who doesn't belong to you ♫

497
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,480

499
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,960
♫ This scenario, going on for infinity ♫

500
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,360
♫ At some point, it mocks me ♫

501
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:55,250
♫ Why don't you listen to me quietly ♫

517
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,590
Sir.

518
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,570
Sir.

519
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:37,040
Should we serve your meal later?

520
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,190
Thanks.

521
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,220
Okay.

522
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,570
Ji Xiang Kong.

523
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:22,800
I believe you will definitely
stand on the global stage.

524
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,140
Then, I hope that by then,

525
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,180
you will be at the commentator's table

526
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,710
to announce to the whole world

527
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,320
that China wins the world championship.

528
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,620
Deal.

529
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,940
Deal.

530
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,050
[Thanks for carrying me]

531
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,040
[through the darkest days of my life.]

532
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:01,850
[If this is written in destiny,]

533
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,720
[I hope I can hug you tightly]

534
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,560
[and accompany you
to the peak of the world.]

535
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,139
Qiu Ying.

536
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,310
You need to pull yourself together.

537
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:44,770
Finish this note.

538
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,719
Just forget everything
that had happened today.

539
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,040
From tomorrow on,

540
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,490
it's a new day.

541
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,540
It's late. What are you doing?

542
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,890
Mr. Luo.

543
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,710
Why are you in such a wreck?

544
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,210
I'm leaving.

545
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,250
Wait.

546
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,300
I'll send you home.

547
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:54,600
Sir, I'm sorry.

548
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,790
We are closing.

549
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,400
Okay.

550
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,570
Sir.

551
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:09,930
The deposit you paid

552
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:12,490
includes our restaurant's
special Secret Garden cake.

553
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,890
If your friend can't come today,

554
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,150
we can make another one for you next time.

555
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,390
Thanks.

556
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,040
That time probably won't come.

557
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:07,270
I haven't had the chance to thank you.

558
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,890
I like the mug.

559
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,090
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

560
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,660
You had to see me like this.

561
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,990
It's fine.
Everyone gets unhappy sometimes.

562
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,060
But, I still hope

563
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,970
that you'll pull yourself together soon.

564
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,430
You should know how unforgiving
the commentator's table is

565
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,240
after interning here for so long.

566
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,460
If you can't manage the playoffs later on,

567
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:43,190
I'm afraid you won't even
have the chance to step inside.

568
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:49,850
I understand, Mr. Luo.

569
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,670
It's here, right?

570
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:12,950
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

571
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,820
Sorry for bothering you.

572
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,170
It's okay.

573
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
I'm going home.

574
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,360
Right.

575
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,720
Take these.

576
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,830
Take the pills when you reach home.

577
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,210
If you really catch a cold,

578
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,490
how would you face
the camera and the audience?

579
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:35,790
Thanks.

580
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,540
Goodbye, Mr. Luo.

581
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:40,960
Bye.

582
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,910
You are finally back.

583
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,630
I thought you've been
abducted by Ji Xiang Kong.

584
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,070
Spill the beans.

585
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,790
What did you two do today?

586
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,740
What happened?

587
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,090
Why are you all drenched?

588
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,450
Give me your bag.

589
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,770
What happened?

590
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:21,730
It's fine.

591
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:26,020
It was raining.
I forgot to bring an umbrella.

592
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,630
Then what was Ji Xiang Kong doing?

593
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,140
He left you like this?

594
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,730
I'm going to take a shower.

595
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:34,420
Qiu Ying, tell me.

596
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,170
Did Ji Xiang Kong bully you?

597
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,510
Tell me, and I'll teach
him a lesson if he did.

598
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:41,490
No.

599
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:46,390
Yi Yi, I'm cold.

600
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,390
I am going to take a shower first.

601
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,820
That's not right.

602
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,740
There must be something.

603
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,540
Hey, Reporter Lu.

604
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,770
You're finally calling me.

605
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,580
[Do you want to go out for supper?]

606
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,090
What supper?

607
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,270
[Here's a question.]

608
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,010
Did your Brother Kong
go on a date with Qiu Ying tonight?

609
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,130
[Yes. I booked the restaurant for him.]

610
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,090
Secret Garden. It's really hard to book.

611
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,230
It's where people
go to confess their love.

612
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,200
Confess?

613
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,860
[Don't you know that?]

614
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,450
Right. How is it?

615
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,960
Did they have…

616
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,970
Can you stop thinking of dirty things?

617
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:54,010
[When Qiu Ying came back,
she was soaking wet.]

618
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,070
[She was really upset too.]

619
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,120
When I saw her like that,
I was afraid to ask.

620
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,420
So, did your Brother Kong
bully Qiu Ying again?

621
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:04,970
Impossible.

622
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,240
Brother Kong is very gentle with girls.

623
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,060
[Why would he bully Qiu Ying?]

624
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:16,520
Could it be that
Qiu Ying refused Brother Kong?

625
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,810
Qiu Yang likes him so much.

626
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,020
-[She won't reject him.]
-Wait, wait. What?

627
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,630
Forget it.
It was a waste of time asking you.

628
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,840
I'm hanging up. Bye.

629
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,660
You're an adult, and you
still can't take care of yourself.

630
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,150
Drink a hot bowl of ginger soup.

631
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,790
No wonder Mia tripped
during the press conference.

632
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,720
Didn't you see the news?

633
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,320
It seems like Mia won't give up easily.

634
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,270
Brother Sun.

635
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,260
What should I do right now?

636
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,540
Although I've only met Qiu Ying once,

637
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,720
but I can see that

638
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,980
when it comes to her love life,

639
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:06,570
she can never tolerate
even the slightest blight.

640
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,740
She won't even listen to me now.

641
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:15,420
Right now, both of you need to calm down.

642
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,520
The playoffs will begin in a few days.

643
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,280
This is important for
both you and Qiu Ying.

644
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:26,680
Be it for yourself

645
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,200
or for each other,

646
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:31,940
you should focus on the playoffs first.

647
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:34,950
But, I still hope

648
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,800
that you'll pull yourself together soon.

649
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,970
If you can't manage the playoffs later on,

650
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,270
I'm afraid you won't even
have the chance to step inside.

651
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,660
Hello.

652
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:56,330
[Sorry.]

653
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:58,940
[I know this is abrupt.]

654
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:01,460
[But I really want to see you.]

655
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,440
[Can you come?]
