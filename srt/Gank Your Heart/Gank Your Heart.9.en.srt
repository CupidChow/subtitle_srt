Yi Yi.

5
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:41,830
Lawyer Chen, here you are.

6
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:43,440
This is Qiu Ying.

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,140
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you, Lawyer Chen.

8
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:46,650
Sorry to keep you waiting.

9
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,600
No worries.

10
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:48,850
Please, have a seat.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,500
Have a seat too.

12
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,789
-Coffee.
-Thanks!

13
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,220
Lawyer Chen, what's the situation now?

14
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,930
The situation doesn't look good for you.

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,480
No evidence can prove your innocence.

16
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,380
And the thing has come to a boil.

17
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,460
They're going to claim
compensation as well.

18
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,570
I guess they'll ask for
a huge amount of compensation.

19
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,820
Then, what should we do now?

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,010
Do we just sit and
wait for this to happen?

21
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,420
Your best option now is to reconcile.

22
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,890
I guess Ji Xiang Kong wouldn't
want to reconcile with me.

23
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,350
Lawyer Chen, other than going to him,
is there anything else I can do?

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,550
The demand letter was sent by Legends,

25
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,210
and Ji Xiang Kong is a member of Legends.

26
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,880
He would have to do what Legends says.

27
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,510
You might want to try talking
to the head of Legends.

29

Why are you here?

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,270
You're in big trouble and yet
you didn't reply to me on WeChat.

31
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,180
How could I not be here?

32
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,230
Qiu Ying, you don't have money
to pay the mortgage?

33
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,300
That's none of your business.

34
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,410
Qiu Ying, I've been following your news.

35
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,950
I know you were fired by You Xing Video.

36
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:49,900
And that Legends is going to sue you.

37
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,950
Not only me, but Dad is also
worried about you.

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,970
Come home with me.

39
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,079

Xia Ling, I'm not as lucky as you.

43

-Sister.
-Don’t call me sister!

45

I don’t need your charity.

46
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,870

Yes, Dad.

50

I'll leave it here for you.

51

52

No, nothing's going on.

No?

55

But you seem distracted
since you got back.

Do you have conflicts with your classmate?

57

Don't worry, your mom is asleep.

58
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,050
Tell me if there's anything.

59
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,880
It's not about me actually.

60
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,300
It's about my sister.

62
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,260
Right.

63
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,260
Dad, my sister is
in real trouble this time.

64
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,920
What trouble?

65
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,110
She was fired by You Xing Video.

66
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,560
That's perfect.
It's not a proper job anyway.

67
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:11,830
But she's still carrying a huge mortgage.

68
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,970
Mortgage?

69
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,900
She asked for this.

70
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
She thought she's very capable.

71
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:26,170
She left the family and moved out
without a second thought.

72
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,900
Dad, it's my fault that she moved out.

73
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,260
Don’t blame it on her.

74

Don't speak for her.

75

It has nothing to do with you.

76

Don't contact her anymore after this.

77
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,780
Consider her gone for good.

78
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,900
Dad, don't say that.

79
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,820
All these years,
I know you still care about her.

80
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:51,170
Besides, she needs our help now.

81
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,950
It's late. Get some rest.

82
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640

-Sister.
-Didn't I say...

Why are you here?

85
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,850
Dad wanted to see you.

86
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,620
Are you not going to let us in?

87
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:20,930
Why would you keep the curtains
closed during the daytime?

88
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,289
I've heard what happened to you.

89

Back then, you refused the job
I recommended to you.

90

You wanted to spend
all your time playing this.

91

And now what? You're fired.

92
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,420
I bought this place by playing this.

93
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,120
It's a small place, but it looks great.

94
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,000
You don’t have a job now.

95
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,030
Do you have the money to pay your loan?

96
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,840
Xia Ling, you're good.

97
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,320
You turned around and told on me?

98
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,020
No, I didn't.

99
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,450
I was just trying to help, but...

100
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:17,450
Your brother cares about you.

101
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,810
I don’t have a brother.

102
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,250
I'm the only daughter of my mom.

103
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,700
Dad, Sister.

104
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,330

106
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,700

107
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,190
I know you might

108
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,080
resent me.

109
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,580
But I'm your father after all.

110
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,010
Don’t worry about being fired.

111
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,300
It's just as well,
let's find a proper job now.

112
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,180
What's improper about my job?

113
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,400
Do you know what the netizens
said about you now?

114
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,650
No matter what they said about me,
it has nothing to do with you!

115
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,460
How I feel is my own business.

116
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,680
I remember I've already severed
ties with you when I left the home.

117
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,020
You have no right or obligation
to tell me what to do.

118
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,560
I'm not trying to tell you what to do.

119
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,650
But think about your mother,
if she knew how you're doing now...

120
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,080
Don’t mention my mom.

121
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,450
She knows what I've been through
all these years and she's proud of me.

122
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:46,500
But you, you should've
known what you've done.

123
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,720
What have I done?

124
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:52,700
When my mom was lying alone
on the hospital bed,

125
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,120
you just left her behind.

126
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,170
You and that woman even…

127
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,200
It's not what you think!

128
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,300
I don't want to hear your explanation!

129
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,620
If you're going to act like this,

130
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,680
well then...

131
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,450
I'll leave my debit card here.

132
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,700
Pay the loan with it.

133
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,560
No need.

134
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,040
I've told you before.

135
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,760
I'll walk the way I choose.

136
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,780
It has nothing to do with anyone.

137

138

Thanks baby.

143
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,810
When I was 18 years old...

144
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,320
At that morning,

145
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,080

148
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,080
Cause and effect.

149
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,200
Correct!

150
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,930
Good job!

151
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,020
Come here. Have a rest.

152

153
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:00,920

Thank you.

161
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,300
Is it because of me and my mother…

162
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,080
It has nothing to do with you two.

[I'll be right there.]

168
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,260
What were you thinking?
Where are you going?

169
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,240
I'm going to buy some coffee.

170
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:51,720
Brother Yao, what would you like to drink?

171
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,840
I don't want anything.

172
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,620
Weirdo.

173
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,300
Where is he going?

174
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,130
I don’t know.

175
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,350
Brother Yao, you want some coffee?

176
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,560
Here's your coffee.

177
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:28,530
Well, I'm wondering if you can give me
Manager Zhao's phone number.

178
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,830
Brother Xuan, drink some coffee.

179
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,120
Don't even try.

180
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,170
Listen, no one can help you now.

181
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,420
Do you know how much trouble
we've had from our sponsors?

182
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,220
Right now, the only solution

183
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,390
is to ask Qiu Ying to

184
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,700
come clean and make a public apology.

185
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,400
How many times do I have to tell you?

186
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,930
With regard to the video,

187
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,680
Qiu Ying was framed!

188
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,850
Do you have any evidence?

189
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:03,990
Not yet.

190
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,130
Why should I trust you then?

191
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,100
What with that attitude?

192
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,100
Come on.

193
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,740
This is not up to me.

194
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,270
There're so many people above us.

195
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,450
You have to make the whole team
believe what you said.

196
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,220
When I find the evidence,
I'll cut off Ji Xiang Kong's head!

197
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,250
Keep your voice down!

198
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,010
How could you scold Brother Kong?

199
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,490
Do you know how much
he has suffered because of this?

200
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,390
How miserable can he be?

201
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,950
Is he doing any worse than Qiu Ying?

202
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,010
Do you know that Qiu Ying
has been fired by You Xing Video?

203
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,350
Fired?

204
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,080
How dare he say that Qiu Ying
was using him to get attention.

205
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,710
She's lost her job for this.

206
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,950
What's the use of all the attention?

207
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,050
Are you all stupid?

208
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,380
Also, Qiu Ying is just a little girl.

209
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,050
You think she has the ability
to make that fake video?

210
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:56,090
Take a step back.

211
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,050
Even if she has the ability to do so,

212
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,870
would she be dumb enough
to upload it with her own computer?

213
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:06,190
I'm telling you, someone is clearly
doing this to frame your brother Kong.

214
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,930
Qiu Ying is just a scapegoat.

215
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,750
Can't you just use your head?

216
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,099
You seem to have a point.

217
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,069
Of course!

218
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,089
Try to remember.

219
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,099
Has Brother Kong offended anyone?

220
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,310
Well, he's offended quite a lot of people.

221
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,250
Let's see.

222
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,380
Hey, Qiu Ying. I'm...

223
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,170
What?

224
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,880
Wait! Just wait till I get back!

225
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,000
Where are you going?

226
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,780
Qiu Ying sold her apartment.

227
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,400
I hope Ji Xiang Kong is happy now!

228
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,540
Wait, don’t go!

229
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,390
You're not going to finish your coffee?

230
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,610
She's fired and she has to sell her house?

231
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,570
That's right.

232
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,340
I heard Qiu Ying and
Lu Yi Yi talking on the phone.

233
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,980
Also, Lu Yi Yi asked for
Zhao Yang's phone number.

234
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,520
She said they want to
talk settlement with him.

235
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,560
Brother Kong, I'm starting to think that
Qiu Ying didn't do this.

236
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,930
I think something's wrong too.

237
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,750
This thing is getting more serious.

238
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,950
Someone is clearly pulling the strings.

239
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,260
Brother Kong, do you remember

240
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,430
Qiu Ying once said that
her computer was hacked?

241
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,670
I'm wondering if it was done
by our competitor.

242
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:43,520
Even if it wasn't her, I don’t think
the culprit is our competitor.

243
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:48,230
On the other hand,
Zhao Yang is acting pretty strange.

244
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,900
What did Zhao Yang do?

245
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:55,600
He has strong public relations ability
in times of crisis.

246
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,240
But strangely,

247
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,390
the official Weibo account hasn't
posted even a single statement until now.

248
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,750
He was all proactive
when I mentioned Jeffrey.

249
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,550
He told me to focus on my training
and let him take care of it.

250
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:09,070
Obviously, he doesn't want you
to meet Jeffrey.

251
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,530
You've got a point.

252
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
I don't understand.

253
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,800
It was a big decision for you
to buy this place.

254
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,080
And yet you just sold it
without a second thought.

255
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,270
Perhaps I was too desperate
to have a home.

256
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,350
But I've realized something now.

257
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,990
A house isn't necessarily a home.

258
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,920
But…

259
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:02,200
This house has always been your dream.

260
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:05,260
Are you willing to crush it
with your own hands?

261
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,790
My dad and Xia Ling came today.

262
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,370
What? Your dad was here?

263
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,330
You hadn't seen him since you moved out
during your freshman year, right?

264
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,940
It was my first time
seeing him after all these years.

265
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,750
He said he could help me with my mortgage.

266
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,950
But he wanted me to
give up my indecent job.

267
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:37,860
Your father treats you very well actually.

268
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:42,660
So don’t sell this house
in a fit of pique.

269
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,320
I'm not doing this out of anger.

270
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,400
Other than selling my house,

271
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,330
I have no other choice.

272
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,180
So I must prove myself.

273
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,250
I can handle all these things.

274
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,960
That's why, after so many years,

275
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,730
I've never been impressed
by anyone but you!

276
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,800
But now, you've become homeless.

277
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,100
I'm going to be generous and take you in.

278
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,270
I know you're the best.

279
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:33,570
Of course, nobody will treat you
as well as I do.

280
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,380
Silly girl.

281
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,170
All right, let me help you with this.

282
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,370
Come on!

283
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
What are they doing?

284
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,970
Having a tactical discussion.

285
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,750
I'm going out in a while.

286
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,950
If someone comes to see me,
just tell him I'm out to see Jeffery.

287
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,550
Okay.

288
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,510
Manager Zhao.

289
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,330
You scared me.

290
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,620
Sorry, I didn’t knock on the door.

291
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,630
It's okay. Come in and take a seat.

292
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,570
It's fine.

293
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,730
I won't stay long.

294
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,680
I just want to know if you've
gotten in touch with Jeffrey.

295
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,360
Yes, we'll have dinner tonight.

296
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,750
We'll talk about the matter.

297
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,070
I'll come with you later.

298
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,320
If someone needs to apologize,
it should be me.

299
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,940
Okay, sure.

300
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,550
Sure.

301
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,930
Manager Zhao, I forgot to tell you.

302
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,300
I've set up two training games
for Handsome Ji today

303
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,710
but I forgot about that.

304
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,400
Look what you've done.

305
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,450
Xiang Kong.

306
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,820
I know we had some arguments before
due to some minor things.

307
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,450
But just trust me on this one.

308
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,190
You and I are on the same side.

309
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,890
Even if I have to
risk embarrassing myself,

310
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,050
I'll ask Jeffrey to come out
and clarify things for you.

311
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,130
This is not just for you,
but also for the whole company.

312
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,770
Tonight, you just have to
focus on the training.

313
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,000
Make sure you win this closed beta test!

314
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,950
Good luck!

315
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:26,020
Do your best and shut the mouths of
those people who once looked down on you.

316
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,640
Thanks, Manager Zhao.

317
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,800
-I'll get back to my training now.
-Sure.

318
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,840
I'll leave everything to you then.

319
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,550
It's the least I can do.

320
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,990
Bye.

321
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,500
Goodbye.

322
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,160
How did it go?

323
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,760
Zhao Yang set up
two training games for me.

324
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,550
He was clearly trying to hold me off.

325
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,310
Play the training games
with the reserve players later.

326
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,090
I'd like to see if he's really
meeting up with Jeffrey.

327
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,920
Got it.

328
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,770
Alright, put on the pillow.

329
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,030
We're almost finished.

330
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,950
I'll help you unpack your things
in the next few days.

331
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,470
And this will be your room.

332
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,180
The room is a little small.

333
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,330
I hope you don't mind.

334
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,340
I can't thank you enough for taking me in.

335
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,000
I have nothing to give you.

336
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
I'll give you this mask as a gift.

337
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,360
Great, I wanted to buy masks anyway.

338
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,240
Thanks a lot!

339
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,650
I went to find Lin Yi Xuan yesterday.

340
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,390
But that guy wasn't willing to help us.

341
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,610
It's fine.

342
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,790
I can go to Legends by myself
and look for Zhao Yang.

343
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,900
Are you not afraid of the people 
in Legends swallowing you up?

344
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,600
See.

345
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:04,190
What is this?

346
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,890
Zhao Yang's car.

347
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,820
Zhao Yang's car?

348
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,880
What does that mean?

349
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,400
You'll know soon.

350
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,310
So many cars.

351
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,920
How am I going to find it?

352
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,720
Well...

353
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:41,840
Ji Xiang Kong,

354
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,790
there you are.

355
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,700
86186.

356
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:24,340
Right?

357
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:27,860
What? You stood me up?

358
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,570
Yes, I already booked the suite.

359
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,520
Whatever.

360
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,800
Fine, alright.

361
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,790
Hi, Manager Zhao.

362
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,350
I am Qiu Ying.

363
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,350
-Qiu Ying.
-Yes.

364
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,320
What's the matter?

365
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,470
I would like to take
just a few minutes of your time.

366
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,800
Do you have time to talk now?

367
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,870
Sure, what is it about?

368
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:59,090
I want to talk about the demand letter
that Legends sent me.

369
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:17,910
Are you not coming?

370
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,490
Manager Zhao.

371
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,410
I didn't upload the online video
of Ji Xiang Kong.

372
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,440
Could you please help me
explain it to your company?

373
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:15,130
Please, Manager Zhao.

374
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,820
As a matter of fact,
I've had a feeling that

375
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,690
a little girl like you
can't do this kind of thing.

376
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,030
How about this?

377
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,990
I can post a statement to prove that
Ji Xiang Kong didn't beat up anyone.

378
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,280
What's the rush?

379
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,380
Have you eaten yet?

380
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,000
This is a club owned
by a good friend of mine.

381
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,940
Why don't we go inside
and eat while we talk?

382
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,650
Stop it, Manager Zhao.

383
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,120
How about this?

384
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,850
I know there's a nice
steak house in the front.

385
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,660
I can treat you to dinner.

386
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,690
Let's go. It's not far away.

387
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,350
Qiu Ying.

388
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,370
You're pretty.

389
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,530
You should know how to behave.

390
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,240
You think having a meal

391
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,350
can solve the problem?

392
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,050
No, Manager Zhao.

393
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,220
-What?
-Stop it!

394
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,080
What are you doing? Please stop!

395
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,700
What are you doing?

396
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,910
Don't touch me! Stop it!

397
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,600
Let me go!

398
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,800
Stop it, or I'll call the police.

399
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,890
Do it then!

400
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,000
I'll call the police! Don’t touch me!

401
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,710
Stop it!

402
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,850
Let me go!

403
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:09,870
Who is that?

404
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,290
You!

405
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,810
Ji Xiang Kong, are you out of your mind?

406
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:26,900
How dare you hit me!

407
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,800
Manager Zhao.

408
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,540
Aren’t you going to see Jeffrey?

409
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,300
Qiu Ying!

410
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,230
Are you alright?

411
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:42,720
Don’t touch me!

412
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,020
Ji Xiang Kong!

413
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,570
You and Qiu Ying...

414
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,330
You two will pay for this!

415
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,520
Qiu Ying!

416
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,490
Qiu Ying.

417
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,640
Let go of me.

418
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,790
Miss, are you okay?

419
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,310
Beer.

420
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,580
No, you can’t drink anymore.

421
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:02,220
Why don't you pay the bill first?

422
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,830
Pay the bill? Sure, I have the money.

423
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,770
Stop drinking, Qiu Ying!

424
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,280
Why are you pushing me?

425
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,860
I'm paying the bill.

426
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,930
I'm sorry, I'll pay the bill later.

427
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,080
Okay.

428
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,990
Easy.

429
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,340
How about this?

430
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,880
Tell me its price and I'll pay you back.

431
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:41,780
Do you know what the word
'priceless' mean?

432
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,790
Go pay the bill.

433
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:51,180
[This is her mom's necklace.]

434
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,400
[She wasn't pretending.]

435
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,180
Pay the bill for me.

436
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,360
Okay.

437
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,050
I'll pay the bill for you.

438
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,650
Would you mind getting up
from the ground?

439
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,430
The floor is cold.

440
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,050
Leave me alone.

441
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,290
I'll pay the bill for you first.

442
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,620
Come, sit on the chair, will you?

443
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,620
Stand up.

444
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,280
Don’t touch me!

445
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:15,449
Sit tight, okay?

446
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,900
I'm going to pay your bill.

447
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,179
Sorry about that. How much is it?

448
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,409
Qiu Ying!

449
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,949
-Where is the door?
-Keep the change.

450
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:26,900
Please come again.

451
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,870
Don’t touch me!

452
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,550
Fine, I won't touch you.

453
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,250
Tell me where you live.

454
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,320
I'll take you to your house.

455
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,489
I don’t have a home.

456
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,250
It's all your fault,

457
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:45,820
you cocky, disgusting bastard.

458
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,199
Wait, I just saved you, didn't I?

459
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,750
Ji Xiang Kong,
if it wasn’t because of you,

460
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,390
I wouldn't have gotten into this mess!

461
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,780
All I did was...

462
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,890
All I did was pretend
to be a fan of Gu Fang

463
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:09,270
and get a ride with you.

464
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,570
Do you really have to do this to me?

465
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:18,250
Ji Xiang Kong.

466
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:23,130
You made me

467
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,870
lose my home and my job!

468
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,480
All my efforts went in vain!

469
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,530
Are you happy now?

470
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,820
Are you finally satisfied?

471
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:32,550
Sorry.

472
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,750
It's my fault.

473
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,750
You can say whatever you want.

474
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,040
Don’t say sorry to me.

475
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,430
I've got nothing to say to you.

476
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,450
You,

477
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,430
and that Zhao Yang...

478
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:51,620
There's no good man in your team!

479
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,900
Don’t you want to sue me?

480
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,180
Come! Sue me!

481
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,930
I, Qiu Ying, have never been
afraid of anything!

482
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,910
One day,

483
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,980
I will make all of you

484
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:12,190
apologize to me one by one!
