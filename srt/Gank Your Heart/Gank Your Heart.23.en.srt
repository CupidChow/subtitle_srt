00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,610
-Qiu Ying.
-Xuan.

5
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:51,860
Pei... Pei Xi.

6
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,600
Qiu Ying, Xiang Kong wants me to tell you
to see him when you have time.

7
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,690
[To think Pei Xi
has been cheated for so long.]

8
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,100
[Qiao Xin sure is going overboard.]

9
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,760
Why are you staring at me like this?

10
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,460
No, nothing.

11
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,210
I have to go first, bye.

12
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,950
[Pei Xi has a match today.]

13
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,610
-What are you looking? Go.
-[Should I tell him?]

14
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,310
Listen, that's Brother Kong's girl.

15
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,210
Don't you try making a move on her.

16
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,410
Forget it. It has nothing to do with me.

17
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,610
But, Pei Xi is my friend.

18
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,480
Besides, he's helped me a lot.

19
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,980
No, I'm taking this in my own hands.

20
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,810
Pei Xi, Pei Xi.

21
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,660
What's up?

22
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,640
I have something to tell you.

23
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,240
Perfect, I also have
something to tell you.

24
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,510
Arrogant jerk.

25
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,329
Brother Kong,
someone's taking your girl away.

26
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,829
You speak first.

27
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,740
Pei Xi.

28
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,150
Actually, I want to tell you

29
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,850
that there's no right or wrong in love.

30
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:37,360
Sometimes, when you find out
that you're on the wrong path,

31
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,960
you have to turn back in time.

32
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,020
When you fall in love
with the wrong person,

33
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,640
you need to stop in time.

34
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,020
It's just that for some things,

35
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,990
no matter how much you like them,

36
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,540
they won't belong to you.

37
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,260
Even if you pine over someone,

38
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,380
you have to learn to give up.

39
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,410
Are you sure you want
to be a professional commentator,

40
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,860
not hosting some
relationship advice show?

41
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,290
Speak your mind.

42
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,230
I'll say it, then.

43
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,530
It's just that

44
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,839
your girlfriend

45
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,510
My girlfriend?

46
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,190
Yeah, your girlfriend.

47
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
Well...

48
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,810
You get it.

49
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,130
I don't have a girlfriend.

50
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,170
You don't have a girlfriend?

51
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,280
So, you've broken up with Qiao Xin?

52
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,260
I'll say it again.

53
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,990
I don't have a girlfriend.

54
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,310
Are you having a
relationship with Ji Xiang Kong?

55
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,950
No, we are not.

56
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,480
That's good.

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,710
If anything happens to you,
don't approach him.

58
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,760
You can come to me straight away.

59
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,760
What do you mean?

60
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,970
He's confessing.
Are you still ignoring them?

61
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,780
Xiang Kong.

62
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:21,330
You heard what I said just now?

63
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,610
I heard everything
I should and shouldn't hear.

64
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,910
But, listen to me.

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,270
You'd better put your
heart into the competition.

66
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,910
VNG is catching up to Legends.

67
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,880
That's what makes it fun.

68
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,659
Right, here's a reminder.

69
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,800
Be careful with Qi Yue.

70
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,670
He tends to get over-confident.

71
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,090
Thanks for reminding.

72
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,760
You're welcome.

73
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:55,990
Does Brother Kong look
handsome when he's jealous?

74
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,930
Lin Yi Xuan, look at yourself.

75
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,130
What's with you recently?

76
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,640
-Do you still want to play?
-Not so hard.

77
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,140
You keep lagging behind Tong Wu,

78
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,870
and you can't support Qi Yue.

79
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,840
Ji Xiang Kong, are you really jealous?

80
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,220
-Son.
-Mom.

81
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,580
Are you feeling better today?

82
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,440
Why on earth did she
bring so many things?

83
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:23,710
To show her father?

84
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,840
Mom.

85
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:26,600
Stop talking about her like that.

86
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,380
She brought these out of goodwill.

87
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,390
Goodwill?

88
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,760
If she has goodwill,
would she break your leg?

89
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,630
After so many years,

90
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,460
has she been kind to me?

91
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,490
Forget about calling me Mother.

92
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,990
She even doesn't call me Auntie.

93
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,510
Mom, it's all in the past.

94
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,030
Don't mention it all the time.

95
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,409
Don't talk about my sister like that.

96
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,380
Also, I was the one
who broke my leg by accident.

97
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,080
It has nothing to do with her.

98
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,490
Mom.

99
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:56,220
The school's basketball
league starts next month.

100
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,980
When can I leave the hospital?

101
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,940
Son.

102
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,490
They say, rest for 100 days
if you hurt your bones.

103
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,680
Just rest well here.

104
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:07,840
I applied leave for you.

105
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,180
The coach said you can
go back when you recover.

106
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:13,300
My classmates are about
to get in the national team

107
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,400
while I'm resting here.

108
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,580
Till when should I rest?

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,740
Don't worry, just rest.

110
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,670
Xia Ling's family?

111
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,460
Doctor Zhang is calling you.

112
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,240
Coming.

113
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,610
I'm going.

114
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,159
-Here.
-Okay, thank you.

115
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,560
Compare these two photos.

116
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,930
There's an obvious protuberance here.

117
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,590
Qiu.

118
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,560
Hello, I called you here today

119
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,540
to talk about Xia Ling's condition.

120
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,490
After observation, his head injury

121
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,060
won't cause any after-effects.

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,810
However, his leg is more
than just a tibia fracture.

123
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,290
Look.

124
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,030
His nervus peroneus communis
has been damaged.

125
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:17,210
-So...
-Can this be cured?

126
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,510
Sure, it can be cured.

127
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,700
But, his ankle motions
will be limited in the future.

128
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:27,790
Doctor, what do you mean by
his ankle motions will be limited?

129
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,510
It might influence
the way he walks or works.

130
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,679
-Well...
-Doctor.

131
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,900
Will I be able to play
basketball in the future?

132
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,309
Doctor, I just want to know
if I can still play basketball.

133
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,010
I'm afraid not.

134
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,730
The nervus is fragile.

135
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,480
Even if it recovers,

136
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,960
it might cause foot drop.

137
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,980
You can't engage in intense sports.

138
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,360
Thank you, Doctor.

139
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,230
This is funny!

140
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,450
Qiu Ying, come here.

141
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,950
Let me show you something funny.

142
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,570
Qiu Ying?

143
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:52,810
What are you doing?

144
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,190
Qiu Ying.

145
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,640
You scared me.

146
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,610
You ignored me first.

147
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,770
I called you several times.

148
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,740
A penny for your thoughts.
You were ignoring me.

149
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,010
I'm wearing earphones, couldn't hear you.

150
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,660
What are you looking at?

151
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,010
A commentary?

152
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,690
It's two o'clock. Why are you cooking?

153
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,810
-I'll turn the gas off.
-Stop, don't touch.

154
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:38,680
Don't turn it off yet, Yi Yi.

155
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,300
The longer you cook the pigeon soup,
the more nutritious it gets.

156
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,480
Xia Ling is so blessed.

157
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,230
If only I had a nice sister like you.

158
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,690
Having a brother
like Xia Ling is also great.

159
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,760
You're cooking while
watching game recordings.

160
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,010
How diligent.

161
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,530
That Luo Tian won't even let you
work at the analysis table.

162
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,460
Why are you still so hardworking?

163
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,420
Actually, it's good that
he doesn't let me work there.

164
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,660
I still lack knowledge,

165
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,210
so I have to learn more.

166
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,180
It's not a bad thing, right?

167
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,230
Yeah.

168
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,140
Xia Ling.

169
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,720
Sister.

170
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,490
I've brought you pigeon soup.

171
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,510
How come you have
time to come today?

172
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,060
There aren't any games today.

173
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,220
What about you?
How's your recovery coming along?

174
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,780
Not bad.

175
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,130
I'm going to the
rehabilitation room later.

176
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,240
I'll go with you.

177
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,260
No need.

178
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,210
Sister, you stayed up
late again, didn't you?

179
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,740
Your eye bags are saggy.

180
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,790
I'm fine.

181
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,200
You should drink the
soup before it gets cold.

182
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,820
It won't taste good when it's cold.

183
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:20,910
Sister, you're also busy.

184
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,230
After this, you don't
have to visit me often.

185
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,810
Xia Ling.

186
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,040
Is there something
hanging on your mind today?

187
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,560
You seem kind of weird.

188
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,480
No, I'm just tired.

189
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,960
You should go back.

190
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,160
I want to sleep.

191
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,060
I'll help you.

192
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,310
Watch your legs.

193
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,200
Have a good rest.

194
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,060
I will visit you some other day.

195
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,880
Remember to drink
the soup while it's warm.

196
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,630
Captain, not leaving yet?

197
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,680
Are you reading
Handsome Ji's notebook?

198
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,980
During the entire Fall Championship,

199
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,410
VNG's Double Yue was overwhelming.

200
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,400
I'm reading Ji Xiang Kong's notebook

201
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,150
to see if I can get any inspiration.

202
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,720
Do you remember when we
fought against VNG last time?

203
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:36,700
Coach Luo used Ji Xiang Kong's
method to counter VNG.

204
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,710
In the end, Ji Xiang Kong beat us instead.

205
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,060
He knows too much about us.

206
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,830
On the other hand,

207
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,840
you know much about him as well.

208
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,440
What do you mean?

209
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,940
Do upon him as what he has done upon us.

210
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,100
What you know about him

211
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,630
is our best weapon.

212
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,500
[I won't be back today.]

213
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,680
[Help me deal with it.]

214
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,970
Where's Qi Yue?

215
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:27,820
His mother came all the way
from Taipei to visit him.

216
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,010
He's with his mom.

217
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,720
He asked me to inform you.

218
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,090
Why didn't he tell me in person?

219
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,130
He was probably too caught up
and forgot to tell you.

220
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,110
Four of us will practice 2v2 first.

221
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,770
Qi Yue and Qiao Xin?

222
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,030
-I don't know, later?
-Tell me where you go.

223
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
Your turn.

224
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,190
-Hurry up.
-Someone might see us.

225
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,750
-Go.
-Be good.

226
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:25,990
Bye.

227
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,110
Let's have a short meeting.

228
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,550
We're fighting against
Newland this afternoon.

229
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,080
You guys have to win this game.

230
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,570
If we win the game,

231
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,910
we'll enter the playoffs
while holding first place.

232
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,140
We would then get
the priority when choosing sides,

233
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,210
which would give us
an advantage in selection.

234
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,310
More importantly, if we win the game,

235
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,060
we'll break Legends' record
of 10 consecutive wins.

236
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:14,680
Master, Sister Wen.

237
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,740
With me here, don't worry.

238
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,960
I will definitely
break the record tonight.

239
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,220
From now on,

240
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,829
I will make Legends call us Big Brother.

241
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,590
What is it, Qi Yue?

242
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:31,200
Didn't you have enough sleep yesterday?

243
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:37,450
No, my mom came from
Taipei to visit me, and then...

244
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,440
I picked her up and kept her
company for the entire day.

245
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:40,720
That's why I'm a bit tired.

246
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,030
You haven't went back
home for a long time.

247
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,580
If you have time,
spend it with your family.

248
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,680
Master, it won't affect the match later.

249
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,940
There's a break before the playoffs.

250
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,150
You can go back home then

251
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,250
to be with your family.

252
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,600
Thank you, Sister Wen.

253
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,230
Qi Yue, you didn't show up
to practice yesterday.

254
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,510
We made some slight
adjustments on our tactics.

255
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,440
Newland's star player, Cheng Chen,

256
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,270
has been showing explosive
output in the past few games.

257
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,930
-So...
-Cheng Chen, Cheng Chen.

258
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,840
I have fought against him many times.

259
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,520
All he's got is a trick or two.

260
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,780
You don't have to tell me,
I will beat him later.

261
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,020
Okay.

262
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,260
One more thing.

263
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:26,240
You didn't forget
what day it is today, right?

264
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,240
I remember, it's Sister Wen's birthday.

265
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,090
Glad you remember that.

266
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,870
We've been too busy recently.

267
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,210
After the game, we'll celebrate it.

268
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,930
Master has even prepared a gift.

269
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,010
Alright.

270
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,420
Winning the game

271
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,010
is the best gift for me.

272
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:48,840
Do you have confidence?

273
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,040
Yes!

274
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,110
What are you jotting down?

275
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,110
I'm writing down the key points
of VNG versus Newland.

276
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,230
What key points?

277
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
Tell us.

278
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,260
Actually, every team has
its own style and tactics.

279
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,550
When to attack,

280
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,010
on what condition to attack,

281
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,680
when to fight the dragon,

282
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,410
whether they should fight
the dragon in a disadvantage.

283
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:25,060
After getting these key points,

284
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,580
it will help my commentary afterwards.

285
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,530
I remember it's Newland's habit

286
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,890
to fight the dragon at the beginning

287
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,540
and get an early upper hand.

288
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,560
As for VNG, their tactics are dynamic,

289
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,730
making it easy for their enemies
to expose their weaknesses.

290
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,960
Oh my.

291
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,270
Qi Yue is running berserk here.

292
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,460
It's all messed up.

293
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,710
Fortunately,
Ji Xiang Kong arrived in time.

294
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,070
It all depends on this group fight now.

295
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,160
Although it's risky,

296
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,780
the results are worthwhile.

297
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,800
Even though it's just fighting the dragon,

298
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,830
for a conservative team like Newland,

299
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:11,630
it's a fatal hit.

300
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,820
Let me look at your notebook.

301
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,290
Sure.

302
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,320
So many points?

303
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:26,440
You've taken every note of each game?

304
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,680
Qiu Ying.

305
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,740
I thought you were just
pretending to jot something down.

306
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,360
I didn't realize you are so hardworking.

307
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:37,920
Looks like you are more qualified than
Qiao Xin to analyze the games.

308
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,110
-VNG wins!
-Excellent!

309
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,210
What do we do now?

310
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,370
Regroup at midlane.

311
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,730
Steady.

312
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,160
Skill, skill!

313
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,520
Keep pushing him.

314
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,300
-Push now.
-Nice.

315
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:04,860
Creep control.

316
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,100
Today, VNG has set a new record

317
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,470
in the regular season
with an 11th consecutive win.

318
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,320
This is legendary.

319
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,240
Let's see who's the MVP in this match.

320
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,140
Qi Yue!

321
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,700
11 consecutive wins,
MVP for 20 rounds.

322
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,000
He has surpassed Pei Xi

323
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:26,960
to become, undoubtedly,
the best MVP in this season!

324
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:28,790
Congratulations, Qi Yue!

325
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:30,590
You're here.

326
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,760
Good job, Qi Yue.
That's my good apprentice.

327
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,430
No big deal.
I can even win 30 consecutive matches.

328
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,890
Xiang Kong, thank you for your hard work.

329
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,240
No, Sister Wen.

330
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,170
This is the result of
everyone's hard work.

331
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,140
Okay, okay.

332
00:21:44,310 --> 00:21:45,960
I've arranged tonight's dinner venue.

333
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,410
Take Sister Wen there first.

334
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,460
Aren't you coming?

335
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,090
Sure, we'll go prepare first.

336
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,510
Go, go, go!

337
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,670
Okay, let's go first.

338
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,210
Faster.

339
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,540
Happy birthday.

340
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:19,790
Brother Yi.

341
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,460
Li Gan.

342
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,060
Why are you here?

343
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,360
Congratulations on VNG's win today.

344
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,460
Right, it's Shu Wen's birthday today.

345
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,080
Do you still remember?

346
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,220
Today's your lucky day.

347
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,510
That's why I'm holding
a party to celebrate.

348
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:40,560
I want to invite you to come.

349
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,310
I can't leave here.

350
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,390
Summer and Luo Tian are also coming.

351
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,320
I know you might not like
to go such crowded places,

352
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,490
so I'm inviting you in person.

353
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,460
I'm the only one here.

354
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,260
I really can't leave.

355
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,360
Brother Yi.

356
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,510
Shu Wen has always
wanted to find a chance

357
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,710
to reunite the Trailblazers.

358
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:10,510
I want to fulfill her
dream on her birthday.

359
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,570
Right, she also said

360
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,110
that you're also responsible
for VNG's victory today.

361
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,760
Brother Yi, come with me.

362
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,180
Have a good time.

363
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,730
I really can't go.

364
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,390
Brother Yi.

365
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,740
After so many years,

366
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,270
haven't you gotten over it?

367
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,460
Happy birthday!

368
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,000
Happy birthday!

369
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,460
I'm just about to text you two.

370
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,820
Here.

371
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,610
Here, have a seat.

372
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,910
It's special for the birthday girl.

373
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,170
The birthday girl always looks so young.

374
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,720
I don't see you like this usually.

375
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:12,800
Smooth talker.

376
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,090
We don't have to introduce ourselves.

377
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,410
-Hi, everyone.
-Hello.

378
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,470
You did a good job in today's match.

379
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,020
It was brilliant.

380
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,860
It's because of our captain's tactics.

381
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,690
It has nothing to do with the captain.

382
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,010
I think the coach is better.

383
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,910
Cherish this moment.

384
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,110
Both of them don't praise easily.

385
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,010
It really was great.

386
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,470
They're almost on par with us back then.

387
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,010
-Serve the wine now.
-Okay.

388
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,490
Xiang Kong, help me.

389
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,030
Where's Li Gan?

390
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,800
He called us here. Where is he?

391
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,650
He might be preparing Sister Wen's gift.

392
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,540
Not so much, less wine.
-I know how much you can drink.

393
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,400
I'll make you drunk next time.

394
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,060
He's here.

395
00:24:57,290 --> 00:24:58,170
Brother Sun.

396
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,080
Happy birthday.

397
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:08,490
Thank you.

398
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,890
Okay, don't just stand.

399
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,090
Sit down, sit down. Come here.

400
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,300
Long time no see, Brother Yi.

401
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:15,110
It wasn't easy to invite you, hurry up.

402
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,060
Sit down, everyone.

403
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,360
Great.

404
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,460
Li Gan, have a seat too.

405
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,760
I'm going to prepare.

406
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,800
How's your store doing?

407
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,950
Is business good?

408
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,920
Same as usual.

409
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,770
Gu Fang is not here today.

410
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,010
If he comes, five of us will be reunited.

411
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,740
Okay, drink up.

412
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,090
Here, Xiang Kong.

413
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,060
Cheers.

414
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,270
He likes you.

415
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:51,690
He likes you.

416
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,250
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

417
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,580
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

418
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:14,170
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

419
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,060
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

420
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,010
I wish that everyone here

421
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,330
can achieve your dreams.

422
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,260
Happy birthday!

423
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,810
Say yes, say yes!

424
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,510
Say yes, say...

425
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,710
Shu Wen.

426
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:03,060
Please say yes.

427
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,070
Li Gan.

428
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,210
This is such an expensive gift.

429
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,340
I really can't accept it.

430
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,260
Now we should focus all our
energy on the upcoming matches.

431
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,800
Didn't we have a deal?

432
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,500
We have to win the
world championships together.

433
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,340
Today,

434
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,390
I really like what you've done for me.

435
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,940
Thank you.

436
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,160
Sister Wen, it's not conflicting at all.

437
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,490
Okay.

438
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,430
After we win the world championships,

439
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,240
I will place this ring
myself on your finger.

440
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,780
Come, let's drink.

441
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,490
Come.

442
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
Hurry up.

443
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,990
Drink up.

444
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,440
Here, Brother Yi.

445
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,540
Look at you.

446
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,810
Why must you leave no mercy?

447
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,940
Don't you know how Shu Wen is?

448
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,460
I'm curious.

449
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,880
I'm curious to know

450
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,710
what I am in her heart.

451
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:03,380
If you want to prove
what you are in her heart,

452
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,010
there are so many ways.

453
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,580
Why did you invite her ex-boyfriend?

454
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,360
She can't forget Brother Yi.

455
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,110
Okay, okay.

456
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,440
The reason why Shu Wen refused you

457
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,490
isn't all because of Brother Yi.

458
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,960
They have broken up for many years.

459
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,620
If it weren't because
Ji Xiang Kong joined VNG,

460
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,710
they wouldn't even have a chance to meet.

461
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,210
You think too much, brother.

462
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,280
After so many years,

463
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,480
you all know what I've done for Shu Wen.

464
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,940
Yeah, we all know.

465
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,630
Shu Wen knows it as well.

466
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,560
She knows? No, no, no.

467
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:47,900
She doesn't understand.

468
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,310
Enough.

469
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,410
A few years ago,

470
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,030
because of her,

471
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:05,760
I declined an invitation
to join an American team.

472
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:07,690
I stayed here.

473
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,190
We had nothing.

474
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:10,510
Nada.

475
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,680
I founded VNG with her.

476
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,330
In VNG,

477
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,360
she makes all the decisions.

478
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,460
To tell you the truth, honestly,

479
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:20,670
I, Li Gan,

480
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,660
the boss of VNG,

481
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,860
have no place in our team.

482
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,910
No.

483
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:32,310
Shu Wen wanted
Ji Xiang Kong to be the captain.

484
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:35,010
Do you know everyone...

485
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,320
The sponsors...

486
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:37,940
They gave me... No.

487
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,900
They gave us

488
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,410
so much pressure.

489
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,260
Who took the brunt?

490
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,960
Me.

491
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,320
All my feelings for Shu Wen

492
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,830
and everything I've done for her,

493
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,560
and everything I've done for VNG

494
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,280
can't be compared to Brother Yi.

495
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,790
Here, I'll drink with you.

496
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,520
Brother Sun.

497
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
It surprised me that

498
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,980
Sister Wen would refuse him.

499
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,560
Brother Sun.

500
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,560
Actually, I've never believed

501
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,040
that you would go
missing in action back then.

502
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,930
Why did you leave the Pioneers?

503
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,540
Why did you leave Sister Wen?

504
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:49,210
I say, are you hiding a painful secret?

505
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:53,460
It's all in the past.

506
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,740
Why mention it?

507
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:07,010
But I think Sister Wen
still cares about you.

508
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:08,910
Impossible.

509
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:11,610
Why is it impossible?

510
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,960
Anyway, I think
Sister Wen doesn't like Li Gan.

511
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:17,690
Besides,

512
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,770
don't you want to be with her again?

513
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,610
Remember I told you this?

514
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,240
Time itself

515
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,340
can change everything.

516
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,640
Shu Wen and I are not who we were.

517
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,840
Stop talking about me.

518
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,460
How's you and Mia?

519
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,540
You just said it.

520
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,710
Time changes everything.

521
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,220
Mia has left for so many years.

522
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,550
You're still pining over her.

523
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,860
Now that she's back in China, and you...

524
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:54,190
Have you really fallen in love
with that girl called Qiu Ying?

525
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,080
Looks like you admit it.

526
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,290
Then, gather your courage and woo her.

527
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:05,410
Don't run away.

528
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:08,590
Don't let Summer take her away.

529
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,570
Wait.

530
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,670
How did you know about this?

531
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,360
Did Summer tell you something?

532
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:17,190
Is Pei Xi really serious?

533
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,180
Yi Xuan told me briefly.

534
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,890
I have no idea whether Pei Xi is serious.

535
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,230
However, it's obvious that you're serious.

536
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,730
Lin Yi Xuan, that fellow.

537
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:45,960
What's up?

538
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,970
We've been playing in the regular
season for more than three months.

539
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,510
Now we have ten days off, and?

540
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,340
More training.

541
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,740
I was supposed to meet my friends,

542
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,680
and I got called here
early in the morning.

543
00:33:59,050 --> 00:33:59,930
Where are they?

544
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,180
It's just you and me today.

545
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,860
Just us?

546
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,810
Why?

547
00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:10,270
Did they do this on purpose?

548
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,239
I'm leaving.

549
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,590
It's me who asked Sister Wen...

550
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,870
to give you extra training.

551
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,230
Even Lu Sheng and Tong Wu
aren't training today.

552
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,560
Brother Qi

553
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,949
doesn't need to train either, right?

554
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,679
He made the most mistakes.

555
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,530
I'm the MVP every round.

556
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:29,600
What mistakes?

557
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,389
During the 8th minute last round
while fighting the dragon,

558
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,850
if Shen Yue didn't protect you in time,

559
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,120
you would have been killed.

560
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,280
During the 12th minute,

561
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,300
why didn't you follow my
instructions and acted alone?

562
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,090
And during the 15th minute group fight,

563
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,460
had you gotten there in time,

564
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,540
we could have finished
the match at that time.

565
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:45,710
It's just some minor mistakes.

566
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,960
Besides, Brother Qi's mother came
from Taipei to visit him yesterday.

567
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,139
Even if he made a few mistakes,

568
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,440
it's understandable.

569
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,620
Were you with your mom or dating?

570
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,310
You know yourself.

571
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,630
What, dating?

572
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:03,370
Ji Xiang Kong.

573
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,510
I'm warning you.

574
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,810
Don't ask for trouble.

575
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,260
You will regret it.

576
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,630
If you really want to report me, go.

577
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,530
I don't care.

578
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,780
Double Yue is our key tactic.

579
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,460
Your condition and Shen Yue's
are of utmost importance.

580
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,430
Qi Yue.

581
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,900
You came all the way to the
mainland to join the championships.

582
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,230
I believe in your persistence
to achieve your dream.

583
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,780
You're at the peak
of your professional career.

584
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,010
Your success depends
on the next two years.

585
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,460
Think about it.

586
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,010
Xia Ling.

587
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,180
You're discharged.

588
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,580
-What are you doing here?
-Mom.

589
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,510
Mom, get in the car.

590
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,190
I have something to tell my sister.

591
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,600
You have nothing to tell her.

592
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,620
-Dad.
-Shoo!

593
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,850
Let them be. What are you doing?

594
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,880
-There's nothing to talk about.
-Get in.

595
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,680
Sister.

596
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,380
Xia Ling, why didn't you
tell me that you're discharged?

597
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,820
You'll be back for rehabilitation, right?

598
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,790
I'll join you.

599
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:17,970
No need.

600
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,210
Sister, as you can see,

601
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:23,150
my mother is nasty towards you.

602
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,480
If we keep in touch,

603
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,340
conflicts are bound to arise.

604
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,860
In the future, we should meet less.

605
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,680
Xia Ling, are you really...

606
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,460
Yes, I mean it.

607
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,470
I don't want to get stuck
between you and my mom.

608
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,290
Besides, you're busy with work.

609
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:43,320
Don't get distracted because of me.

610
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,980
That's all, I'm going.

611
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,560
Ying, don't be sad.

612
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,440
You can go back.

613
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,950
We'll take care of your brother.

614
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:17,190

00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,790
-I've booked the room.
-Yeah.

669
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,760
So fast?

670
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,920
Before that, we can have dinner together.

671
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,170
-Let's go.
-How about this?

672
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,620
Let's change to another day.

673
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,490
No, it has to be today!

674
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,320
-Today, let's go!
-We've booked the room.

675
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,710
-I'm here for Lu Yi Yi.
-Go!

676
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,650
Go!

677
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,460
You're a guy, and you
like milk tea so much?

678
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:38,070
Didn't you say you were going home?

679
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,280
Why are you here?

680
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,450
Trying to stage a coincidental meeting?

681
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,680
I...

682
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,660
I was walking halfway.

683
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,830
Then, it suddenly occurred to me
that I've left Dream Traveler for so long,

684
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,410
and I haven't seen everyone there.

685
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,040
I miss them a lot.

686
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,440
So, I dropped by
to buy some drinks for them.

687
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,460
I didn't know Qiu Ying
cares about friendship so much.

688
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,510
Right, Pei Xi should be
at Dream Traveler now.

689
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,150
Are you planning to meet him?

690
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,570
So, how are things between you two?

691
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,060
What do you mean?

692
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,360
Do you really think

693
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,150
he was confessing to me last time?

694
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,490
It's obvious.

695
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,510
No.

696
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,180
Well, I think it might be because

697
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,330
he got dumped, so he's in a bad mood.

698
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,480
He got dumped?

699
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,240
Do you know Qiao Xin and...

700
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,720
Forget it, let's just leave it.

701
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,260
Anyway, he wasn't confessing.

702
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:47,530
Are you saying

703
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,700
that Pei Xi knew about the relationship

704
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,830
between Qiao Xin and Qi Yue, so...

705
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:56,780
You also know their
underground relationship too?

706
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:01,250
I also know that during
the duo queue match,

707
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,540
the player who hounded
after you was not Pei Xi.

708
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,810
It was Qi Yue.

709
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:07,190
Qi Yue?

710
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,740
Qi Yue stole Pei Xi's account.

711
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,830
Also, Pei Xi's
relationship with Qiao Xin

712
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,360
was all Qiao Xin's ploy.

713
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,960
So, Pei Xi wasn't dumped at all.

714
00:42:17,050 --> 00:42:18,900
He really was confessing his love for you.

715
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,480
That's a load of rubbish!

716
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,050
I told you,
he wasn't confessing, he wasn't!

717
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,490
How... How is that a confession?

718
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:26,700
Nothing happened.

719
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,210
Why are you getting worked up?

720
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,830
Are you feeling guilty?

721
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,160
Why should I feel guilty?

722
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,760
Even if he really was confessing,

723
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,760
I wouldn't like a cold guy like him.

724
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,560
You big fool.

725
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,190
Right.

726
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:50,210
Is Mr. Luo treating you better now?

727
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,630
Same as usual.

728
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,160
But, it's okay.

729
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,790
I'm new in this industry.

730
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,240
There are so many things I need to learn.

731
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,090
In fact, I wish I can work
my way up step by step.

732
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,850
Then, would you mind showing
me your commentary video?

733
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:10,510
Sure, I still have a lot that don't know.

734
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:13,330
How about we go to Dream Traveler?

735
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:15,420
Dream Traveler again?

736
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,920
Why you like that place so much?

737
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:19,120
Or, is it because someone is there?

738
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:22,740
Why, you.

739
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:23,730
Take me there.

740
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:40,990
Speak your mind.

741
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,730
Why did you call us here?

742
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,030
I want to have a meeting
to discuss about tactics today.

743
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,590
The theme for this meeting is

744
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,290
Ji Xiang Kong.

745
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,520
Brother Kong?

746
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,620
This is an eye-opener.

747
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:57,030
For the first time,
in a meeting about tactics,

748
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,480
we're talking about a person.

749
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,340
Yeah, what do you mean?

750
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:01,530
You're confusing me.

751
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,080
Well, let's listen to the captain.

752
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,170
Judging from how VNG is leading now,

753
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,030
it's likely that we will fight
against them in the playoffs.

754
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,860
Before this, Ji Xiang Kong
defeated us once

755
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:15,190
because of what he knew about us.

756
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,160
This time,

757
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,510
why don't we use what we know about him

758
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:20,930
to defeat him once?

759
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:25,040
You have a point.

760
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,880
Make sense.

761
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:30,150
I'll contribute something, okay?

762
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,320
I'll go first.

763
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:35,270
Brother Kong.

764
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,940
His full name, Ji Xiang Kong.

765
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:38,660
His constellation, Leo.

766
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:40,020
His favorite food, strawberries.

767
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,710
His best friend, me.

768
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:47,920
-Is this a tactics meeting or a tea party?
-Exactly.

769
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:50,040
You're eating the food he bought.
Can you be serious?

770
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:52,080
Captain.

771
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:01,160
Excuse me, but I must say this.

772
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,260
According to what
I know about Handsome Ji,

773
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:06,310
if he gains an upper hand
at an early stage,

774
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:07,980
then, later on,

775
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,710
he'd make full use of his advantage!

776
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:15,210
Your turn, Brother Yao.

777
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:20,060
Ji Xiang Kong's greatest merit

778
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,510
is his imagination.

779
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,380
Don't take it lightly just
because we have an early edge.

780
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,180
It might be his ploy.

781
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:29,190
We must remain cautious.

782
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,660
Handsome Ji...

783
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,360
Handsome Ji is especially...

784
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:40,740
Especially strong.

785
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:44,010
Stop joking.

786
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,850
I thought of something important
that none of you have said.

787
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:51,210
He likes motorcycles best.

788
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,400
Have you realized that
Pei Xi is not as cold as before?

789
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:06,010
Lu Feng.

790
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:07,730
Tell me more.

791
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,660
You're asking me again?
