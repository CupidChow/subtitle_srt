00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,370
Ji Xiang Kong.

5
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,570
Qiu Ying?

6
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,810
How are you doing?

7
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,180
Why did you faint?

8
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,990
Do you feel better now?

9
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,610
Faint? I didn't faint.

10
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,810
Look, I'm fine.

11
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,090
Who told you that?

12
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,050
Qiao Xin.

13
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,640
Fool, you believed her?

14
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,700
I am glad you are fine.

15
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,850
I got to go.

16
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,860
Sorry, it was me who made you upset.

17
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,360
But, don't leave me
and ignore me, will you?

18
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:41,690
Don't say sorry to me.

19
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,400
We...

20
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,700
Let's not disturb each other.

21
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,090
I don't believe it.
I don't believe you can do it.

22
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,440
Why were you so nervous, then?

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,270
Ji Xiang Kong, let go of me.

24
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,690
Let go of me!

25
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,190
Qiu Ying.

26
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,170
Qiu Ying, please listen to me.

27
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:06,510
I like you.

28
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,120
I don't see you as
a substitute for anyone.

29
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,160
I don't know when it happened.

30
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,510
Maybe it was during Rising Star.

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,579
Maybe it was at the night I drank
with you in the convenience store.

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,750
Didn't we make a deal that we'd
reach the top of the world together?

33
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,380
Don't leave me.

34
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,120
You know it. I like you.

35
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,420
I liked you a long time ago.

36
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,620
But I don't know who I am to you now.

37
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,130
-You and Mia...
-It's over between me and Mia.

38
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:49,960
Please trust me.

39
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,730
Give me some time, I will handle it.

40
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,870
But now, everyone
knows you are a couple.

41
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,780
How can you just end it?

42
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,030
What do you want me to do?

43
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,480
Ji Xiang Kong.

44
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,730
I can't compare to Mia.

45
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,190
We have never started.

46
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,060
Let's end it like this.

47
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,070
[I've never seen you
so concerned about someone.]

48
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,440
[Mind you, she's just a new commentator.]

49
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,850
Mr. Luo!

50
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,480
Here's a copy of my commentary.

51
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,200
Please give me some feedback.

52
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,560
Go back.

53
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,810
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

54
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,040
Qiu Ying!

55
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,390
You've completely given up on him.

56
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,940
You've rejected him!

57
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,120
He's together with Mia Fu.

58
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,350
Don't be silly anymore!

59
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,940
Cry if you want.

60
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,970
It'd be fine after that.

61
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,230
Mr. Luo.

62
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,090
Don't worry.

63
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,560
I will pull myself together.

64
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,760
I won't let it affect my work.

65
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,890
I hope this will be
the last time I see you cry.

66
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,440
Are you okay?

67
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,540
I'm fine.

68
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,450
Let's start.

69
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,220
-Let's wait for Sister Wen.
-No need.

70
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,290
Okay, let's start.

71
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,200
Tomorrow, we will be
fighting against Dragons.

72
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,810
Compared to other teams...

73
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,540
Sister Wen.

74
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,920
Sorry for coming late.

75
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,610
Xiang Kong, you may start.

76
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,320
Okay.

77
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,070
Tomorrow, we will be
fighting against Dragons.

78
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,890
Compared to other teams,

79
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,320
their top laners are solid.

80
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:17,690
Their top laners can generate
explosive output from early to mid-game.

81
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,600
So, for our top laners,

82
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,320
we need to choose tank type heroes

83
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,510
to be on the safe side

84
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,120
so we won't get killed,
which can snowball us into trouble.

85
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,550
Lu Sheng, in the early game,
make sure you're properly farmed

86
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,140
before you focus at the top lane.

87
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,240
Okay.

88
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,559
Later, try to avoid team fights.

89
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:39,190
Focus on solo fights at the top lane.

90
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,220
Come on.

91
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,090
Brother Yao.

92
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,390
Hurry up.

93
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,900
Wait for Pei Xi.

94
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,070
Forget about him. Three, two, one.

95
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,130
Hey, Ji Xiang Kong.

96
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,930
I do admire you.

97
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,770
Dating with a celebrity

98
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,150
while flirting with our commentator.

99
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,640
-Not bad.
-What do you want?

100
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,670
You'd better speak with some respect.

101
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,330
Don't create trouble.

102
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,080
If you have time for a spat,

103
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,780
you should research your tactics,

104
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,670
or else our sub might just beat you.

105
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,000
How conceited.

106
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,750
And I was wondering

107
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,520
why Qiu Ying kept praising
you in her commentaries.

108
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,880
So, you are involved with her all along.

109
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,000
You know what Qiu Ying is like?

110
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,050
To think he'd want a girl like that.

111
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,630
Mind your tongue.

112
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,970
Captain!

113
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,670
-Ji Xiang Kong!
-Captain!

114
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,410
-Are you okay, Pei Xi?
-Ji Xiang Kong punched him!

115
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,700
Pei Xi, you can report him...

116
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,750
Do you have a problem?

117
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,810
Captain, he's provoking you!

118
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,170
Just get out of here!

119
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,460
Looking for trouble?

120
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:15,180
Bring it on!

121
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,200
Let's go.

122
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,580
You like showing off
your tactics, don't you?

123
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,700
Get your tissues ready.

124
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
Don't snivel like a dolt later.

125
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,370
Let's go.

126
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,650
What happened?

127
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,200
They were looking for trouble.

128
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,970
Pei Xi was speaking up for Ji Xiang Kong.

129
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,410
You, helping Brother Kong?

130
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,530
In the finals,

131
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,400
I only want to play against VNG.

132
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,970
Thanks, Pei Xi.

133
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,860
Are you okay?

134
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
I'm fine.

135
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,920
Okay, don't let this affect you.

136
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,140
Keep it up.

137
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,390
See you in the finals.

138
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,240
Come on!

139
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,770
Good morning.

140
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,370
Mr. Luo.

141
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,870
Thanks.

142
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,920
Did you rest well last night?

143
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,070
I slept as soon as
I reached home last night.

144
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,450
This cup of coffee
is going to waste, then.

145
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Of course not.
A coffee in hand keeps the spirits high!

146
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,220
Okay, let's check the scripts.

147
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,070
You're here.

148
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
What happened.

149
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,370
Sister Wen, the Dragons
provoked us outside just now.

150
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,970
Provoked us?

151
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,390
Provoke? That wasn't just provoking.

152
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,430
They were literally brazen.

153
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,230
They even told us
to get our tissues ready

154
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,670
so we won't snivel
like a fool when we lose.

155
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,150
They haven't even won once
in the entire season.

156
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,590
I wonder where they got their confidence.

157
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,640
What happened, Xiang Kong?

158
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,300
Bad news.

159
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,390
What's wrong?

160
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,970
[Compared to other teams,]

161
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,450
[their top laners are solid.]

162
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:27,950
[Their top laners can generate
explosive output from early to mid-game.]

163
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,980
[So, for our top laners, we need
to choose tank type heroes]

164
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,570
[to be on the safe side.]

165
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,480
The recording was
released three hours ago.

166
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,250
It's all over the Internet now.

167
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,650
No wonder the Dragons'
captain was so brazen.

168
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,930
Then...

169
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,050
I'll report this to the committee.

170
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,170
I have reported it.

171
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,520
The most important thing now

172
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,780
is to deal with the upcoming game.

173
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,890
Don't worry.

174
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,580
We have plan B.

175
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,220
Xiang Kong.

176
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,120
No need.

177
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,640
Ji Xiang Kong.

178
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,170
You broke our rules

179
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,850
by leaking tactical secrets.

180
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,120
From now on, you're on the bench.

181
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,200
Qi Yue, you're up in the next game.

182
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,700
Okay, Master.

183
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,460
What do you mean, Li Gan?

184
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,260
Do you know what are you talking about?

185
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,320
What do I mean?

186
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,270
You should ask him how
the recording was leaked.

187
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,440
Qi Yue saw with his own eyes

188
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,200
that before our tactics meeting,

189
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,620
Qiu Ying entered our meeting room.

190
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,790
Sister Wen, it must be
Qiu Ying who recorded it

191
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,700
to take revenge on Ji Xiang Kong.

192
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,600
Qi Yue, what are you talking?

193
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,740
Xiang Kong.

194
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,350
Yes.

195
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:59,750
Okay.

196
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,520
Excuse me, Mr. Luo.

197
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,490
Lucy, what brings you here?

198
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,010
-You are Qiu Ying?
-Yes.

199
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,420
Hello, I am Lucy from
the iConquer committee.

200
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,290
You won't be commentating today's game.

201
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,890
We need your cooperation
in one of our investigations.

202
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,940
Please follow me.

203
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,620
Lucy.

204
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,870
The game is beginning soon.

205
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,950
Can we talk after the game?

206
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,050
A few hours ago,

207
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:30,630
a recording of VNG's tactics
meeting was uploaded online.

208
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,290
This...

209
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,320
-VNG's tactics meeting?
-Correct.

210
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,450
We have reviewed
the hotel's CCTV footage.

211
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,040
Other than VNG members themselves,

212
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,350
only you have been to their meeting room.

213
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,980
No, yesterday, I just...

214
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,280
You don't need to explain to me now.

215
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,860
You can explain later.

216
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,940
Please cooperate with us.

217
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,300
Mr. Luo.

218
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,820
Don't worry. Leave everything here to me.

219
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,120
Just explain everything to them.

220
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,640
Okay.

221
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,490
Mr. Luo.

222
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,720
Go.

223
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,800
Mr. Luo.

224
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,500
Hello, Mr. Guo.

225
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,920
[I have been notified by
iConquer's committee.]

226
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,190
[Qiao Xin is coming.]

227
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,840
[She is your partner
in today's commentary.]

228
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:53,670
She is here.

229
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,420
Hello, Mr. Luo.

230
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,700
I am glad to be your partner again.

231
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,820
I will treasure this opportunity.

232
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,320
If you mess up your lines,

233
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,740
then keep quiet and just sit there.

234
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,770
Don't worry, Mr. Luo.

235
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,540
I'm all prepared for today's game.

236
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,540
You always say this, after all.

237
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,500
Opportunities are only reserved
for those who are prepared.

238
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,080
You were with Qiu Ying in our
meeting room for 15 minutes.

239
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,280
Ji Xiang Kong, as the captain,

240
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,170
don't you know the rules of our team?

241
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:37,450
No one other than our own members
are allowed in the meeting room!

242
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,050
I know.

243
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,630
It is my responsibility.

244
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,870
I will take it.

245
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,250
Xiang Kong.

246
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,390
Wait!

247
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,410
Qiu Ying did enter the meeting room,

248
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,869
but it's impossible for her
to record our meeting.

249
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,800
-Evidence?
-I can testify for her.

250
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:10,099
She finally got a chance
to be a commentator.

251
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,460
She wouldn't ruin her future.

252
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,380
You don't need to prove anything for me.

253
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,589
Since I didn't do it,

254
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,690
the truth would come to light.

255
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,390
You should focus on your competition.

256
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,250
Li Gan.

257
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,480
It is not the time for blaming.

258
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,100
Our strategy been leaked.

259
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,820
We need to make a new one.

260
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,890
Qi Yue and I have come up with
a new strategy on our way here.

261
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,200
As the coach,

262
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,920
I have the right to keep
Ji Xiang Kong in the game.

263
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:50,970
As the manager,

264
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:53,120
I also have the right to fire you.

265
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,170
Okay, everyone, sit down.

266
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,520
Listen while I explain our strategy.

267
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:03,170
Qi Yue will play in the mid lane.

268
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:06,280
Lu Sheng will play in
the top lane as usual.

269
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,600
Tong Wu, Lu Sheng.

270
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,660
Do you hear me?

271
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:16,170
Do your best.

272
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,550
You must win.

273
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,550
No wonder they were so provocative.

274
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
They cheated, and they have no shame.

275
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,330
How would confidential
meetings like this be leaked?

276
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:52,390
If VNG loses this game,
they'd be eliminated.

277
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,950
No way, Brother Kong always has Plan B.

278
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:55,990
He won't lose.

279
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,450
Welcome to the playoffs of
iConquer's 2018 Fall Championships!

280
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,230
I am today's commentator, Luo Tian.

281
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,940
I am today's commentator, Qiao Xin.

282
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,010
Where is Qiu Ying?

283
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,800
[Today's game is VNG versus Dragons.]

284
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,860
For them, this is a do or die clash.

285
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,890
The winning team will
advance to the semi-finals

286
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,120
while the losing team will be eliminated.

287
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,150
Today, there is a change in VNG's lineup.

288
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,290
The captain, Ji Xiang Kong,
has been replaced at the last minute.

289
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,680
Meanwhile, Qi Yue is back,

290
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:25,690
playing in mid lane as usual.

291
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,800
They replaced Brother Kong?

292
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,320
Coach Shu Wen isn't there, too.

293
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,670
Li Gan is the coach now?

294
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,620
It's over for VNG.

295
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,520
This is you, right?

296
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,270
That day,

297
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,450
I heard that Ji Xiang Kong fainted.

298
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,270
So, I called him,

299
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:51,950
but no one answered.

300
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,220
I got anxious and ran to
the meeting room to find him.

301
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,000
But, he never fainted.

302
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,750
They made it up.

303
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,750
They?

304
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,190
Qiao Xin and two of my colleagues.

305
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,150
Okay, I will verify this with Qiao Xin.

306
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,700
Before we finish investigating,

307
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:14,850
your commentating work will be suspended.

308
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,540
I understand.

309
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,590
Then, I'll wait for the
committee's notification.

310
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,390
Mr. Zhu.

311
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,160
Yes.

312
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,250
Yes, she was ill a few days ago.

313
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,800
We'll follow the contract.

314
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,260
Okay, let's work together next time.

315
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,040
Why isn't Xiang Kong on stage?

316
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,310
Maybe it's because of
their strategy leak scandal.

317
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,490
What do you mean, strategy leak?

318
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,200
Hurry up.

319
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:28,370
Why isn't Xiang Kong picking up?

320
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,520
Karen!

321
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,570
-Prepare the car.
-What are you doing?

322
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,050
I am going to look for Xiang Kong.

323
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,150
You have a recording session.

324
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,810
I need to stay by his side now.

325
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,040
You don't understand your priorities.

326
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,610
-We can do this.
-Okay.

327
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,450
Help Liu Miao! Shen Yue, go!

328
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,850
VNG is forced to initiate a team fight!

329
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,210
[Their strategy is a mess.]

330
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,320
[You cannot see the
partnership of Double Yue.]

331
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,640
[If this goes on, VNG is in peril!]

332
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,150
It's Ji Xiang Kong.

333
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,620
I heard he was benched

334
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,220
because of his rumours
with Mia and Qiu Ying.

335
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,330
Qiu Ying isn't commentating today too.

336
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,270
It must be because of this.

337
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,670
Come on.

338
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,690
Brother Qi, he's right behind you.

339
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,750
Protect the base.

340
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,800
Come on!

341
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,100
Darn, forget it!

342
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,540
Congratulations to the Dragons
for advancing to the semi-finals.

343
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,830
[Also hoping that VNG
can do better in the next season.]

344
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,520
Can you drive faster?

345
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,070
We're almost there.

346
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,830
I think you really shouldn't go there now.

347
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,170
You can't help him now.

348
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,570
What's more, your
popularity is just recovering.

349
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,380
If someone makes a story out of it,

350
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,170
your popularity will dive again.

351
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,230
All these years, I've never been
with him when he was in trouble.

352
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,720
This time, I must let him know

353
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,240
that I will support him
no matter what happens.

354
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,570
So many reporters.

355
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,470
We can't go now. Zhang, turn back.

356
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,270
Don't turn back!

357
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,790
I must meet him today.

358
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,820
Turn around.

359
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,640
Well?

360
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,770
Don't worry.

361
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,950
I have known Lucy for a long time.

362
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,830
She's always been impartial
when dealing with such cases.

363
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,450
For the time being, just wait.

364
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,220
They will find out the truth.

365
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,470
Thanks, Mr. Luo.

366
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:48,590
Oh, right.

367
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,250
How was the game?

368
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,950
VNG lost.

369
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,970
How... How is this possible?

370
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,340
Ji Xiang Kong always prepares
two sets of tactics as a precaution.

371
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,120
How could VNG get defeated by Dragons?

372
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,040
Ji Xiang Kong was replaced at the last minute.

373
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:18,070
It's because of me.

374
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,670
It's because of the strategy leak.

375
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,940
Don't make a wild guess.

376
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,650
This has nothing to do with you.

377
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,870
[Hello, the number you have called...]

378
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,150
Why did he turn his phone off?

379
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,540
Qiu Ying, don't worry.

380
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,450
Ji Xiang Kong is coming!

381
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,870
Ji Xiang Kong!

382
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,540
Ji Xiang Kong, were you benched
today because of the strategy leak?

383
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,910
Why did Qiu Ying appear
in VNG's meeting room?

384
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,300
Did she really record it?

385
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,160
Rumour has it that Qiu Ying
is bitter from what had transpired,

386
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,480
so she's taking her revenge.

387
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,080
Ji Xiang Kong, all the rumours
online are against Qiu Ying now.

388
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,790
Do you have anything to say about it?

389
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,170
Ji Xiang Kong, I think you
shouldn't run away anymore.

390
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:13,610
Everyone.

391
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:16,640
Please separate my team
from my personal affairs first.

392
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:20,090
The committee of iConquer
is still investigating the leak.

393
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,490
I will cooperate with them.

394
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,560
I guarantee with my professional career

395
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,880
that this incident is
unrelated to Qiu Ying.

396
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,190
Also, there is no revenge,
as speculated online.

397
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,640
Thank you.

398
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,070
Wait!

399
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,590
These online speculations arose...

400
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,380
Qiu Ying, where are you going?

401
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,420
[because of your complicated
relationship with Mia and Qiu Ying.]

402
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:45,490
Do you have anything to say about this?

403
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,670
Mia was my first love.

404
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,910
But now, we are just friends.

405
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,690
We didn't get back together.

406
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:56,800
So, in that case,

407
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,870
Qiu Ying didn't sabotage
your relationship, did she?

408
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,020
[Qiu Ying and I are just friends, too.]

409
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,850
But, I want to be her boyfriend.

410
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,140
[I also urge Mia's fans
to stop attacking Qiu Ying.]

411
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,640
It's all my fault.

412
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,740
Thanks.

413
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
Ji Xiang Kong!

414
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,340
Mia!

415
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,640
Mia, what brought you here?

416
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:24,650
Mia, is there anything
you want to tell Ji Xiang Kong?

417
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,370
Excuse me, everyone.

418
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,670
I'd like to talk to Ji Xiang Kong.

419
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,270
Xiang Kong.

420
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,990
Can you give me a precise answer?

421
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,450
Sorry.

422
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,770
Is he in the hotel?

423
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,130
Not yet.

424
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,560
Qiu Ying, you should be
more concerned about yourself,

425
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,840
not Ji Xiang Kong!

426
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,580
Qiu Ying!

427
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,280
-Where are you going?
-You can't leave.

428
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,630
You'd better stop seducing
someone else's boyfriend!

429
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,920
Ji Xiang Kong is a Casanova.

430
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,480
Wait for it, you'll get dumped!

431
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,280
You are the other woman, you know?

432
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,650
Go to hell!

433
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,120
Good job!

434
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,110
What are you doing?

435
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,190
Try again if you dare!

436
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,290
What are you doing?

437
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,010
You're Mia's fans, right?

438
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,720
If you still have some rationale,

439
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,100
if you really love her,

440
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,990
you should think about why
she can't date like any other lady.

441
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,680
Why was she forced to separate
with the person she loves?

442
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,600
Feeling all high and mighty
after destroying a relationship?

443
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,770
Exactly!

444
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,740
Of course I am.

445
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:21,520
That's because I respect the
relationship she had with Ji Xiang Kong.

446
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,020
I also believe that Mia respects
my relationship with him too.

447
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,340
Ji Xiang Kong and I truly love each other.

448
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,540
We didn't do anything immoral.

449
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:34,410
You have no right or power to judge me.

450
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,420
Go away.

451
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,350
No way!

452
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,570
Don't create trouble here!

453
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,900
You are the other woman!

454
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,570
Move! What are you doing?

455
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:47,370
Are you crazy?

456
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,720
Try cursing her if you dare!

457
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,720
Stay there!

458
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,000
Shut up!

459
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,840
Thanks.

460
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,740
It's my fault.

461
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,270
It was me who brought VNG to this state.

462
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,200
It's a virtue to
recognize your own faults.

463
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,680
But, you are too hard on yourself.

464
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,980
But, I couldn't deliver
my promise to Ji Xiang Kong.

465
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,870
You've already done a good job.

466
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,950
Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

467
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,570
This strategy leak scandal...

468
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,160
And the way he was benched...

469
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:12,970
This will be the biggest blotch
in Ji Xiang Kong's professional career.

470
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,240
From Legends to VNG,

471
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,770
he has experienced so much.

472
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,960
I believe he can face any trouble.

473
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,070
Don't worry.

474
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,820
What happened?

475
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,030
Brother Sun, Coach Shu.

476
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,580
Did Ji Xiang Kong come here?

477
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:40,640
He's not here.

478
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,910
His phone is turned off.
Where could he go?

479
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,610
It's okay...

480
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,020
I've been after you the whole day.

481
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,200
Didn't you hear me call you?

482
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,670
Who'd care about you now?

483
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,610
Brother Sun, Sister Shu Wen.

484
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:53,970
Is Brother Kong here?

485
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:54,990
He didn't come.

486
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,720
I thought he'd be with you.

487
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,620
So, if he's not here, where would he go?

488
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,180
Don't worry, don't panic.

489
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,420
Maybe he just wants some time alone.

490
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:12,850
I think I know where he is.

491
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,270
I will find him.

492
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,200
-Qiu Ying!
-Hey, where are you going?

493
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:18,280
How can I let her go alone?

494
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:19,320
Wait for me!

495
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,510
I'm off too, then.

496
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,900
Bye, Brother Sun and Sister Wen.

497
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,120
Wait for me!

498
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,170
Then, I'll check his quarters.

499
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,440
Shu Wen.

500
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,040
Everything will be fine.

Everyone knows how
much you've done for VNG.

541
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,740
But, this scandal has
blown out of proportion.

-The sponsors...
-I know, Mr. Li.

543
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,270
As the captain, I should bear

Sister Wen, looks like
I got something out of it.

557
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,890
I got this when I competed
in Vancouver for the first time.

558
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:51,420
No wonder it feels heavy in my hands.

I'm sorry.

00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,290
I couldn't protect you.

00:38:58,510 --> 00:38:59,770
I couldn't keep you.

562
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,000
Sister Wen, I should be
the one apologizing.

563
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,190
I promised you a perfect team,

564

but I failed.

565
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:11,780
But, I'm sure I will find
a perfect team one day.

00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,390
I believe in you.

567
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,420
I heard you're leaving,
so I'm here to send you off.

568
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,540
Well, want to play a round with me again?

569
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,220
In VNG,

570
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,250
he's the one who admires you the most.

571
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,030
Go.

572
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,560
Go!

575
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,070
Brother Shen.

576
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,920
What, you miss him?

577
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,650
You can leave with him.

578
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,100
No, Brother Qi, I'm just looking around.

579
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,490
Really? Get some drinks for us!

580
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,470
Well?

581
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,510
Quitting e-sports and
switching to basketball?

582
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:33,020
Right, you can dance too.

583
00:40:35,990 --> 00:40:36,990
Smell you later.

584
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,770
Bye, see you!

585
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,400
Don't mind them.

586
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,240
Actually, in VNG,

587
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,520
Tong Wu hates the most to see you leave.

588
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,100
Before you came, no one
has uncovered his potential.

589
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,690
That's why he has a buddy like you.

590
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,170
Xiang Kong.

591
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:14,620
Not many have impressed me.

592
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,360
You are one of them.

593
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:20,070
You think I'm stubborn?

594
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,020
It's the gusto in you that impresses me.

595
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,180
No one can defeat your competitive spirit.

596
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,670
It's kind of great.

597
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,670
Perhaps you'd do better after leaving VNG.

598
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,970
But, I don't know when I can
play basketball with you again.

00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:42,340
anytime will do.

601
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:44,660

I told him that we'd go next time.

Shu Wen, you can't let some
mere trifles affect you, you know.

635
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,670
Do you still think that our
problems are just mere trifles?

636
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,980
The biggest problem we face
is that we have different ideals.

637
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,770
If it can be solved,

638
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,310
things wouldn't be in this state.

639

We've been running
VNG together for so long.

643
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,220
Everything you've done,

644
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:09,840
I will remember them in my heart.

645
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,140
It's just that right now,

646
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,870
I don't know what I really want.

647
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,020
Shu Wen, it's been so many years.

648
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:26,180
I've stuck with you all this time.

649
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,370
Everything.

650
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:31,320
If you wanted it this way,

651
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,250
I never did it another way.

652
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,370
Every single thing was done

653
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,900
according to your plans and methods.

654
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,820
But, in the end, I realized

655
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,470
that you have never loved me!

656
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:50,000
Li Gan, can you calm down?

657
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,590
How can I calm down?

658
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:53,770
How?

659
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,940
Is it because of Sun Ze Yi?

660
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,890
