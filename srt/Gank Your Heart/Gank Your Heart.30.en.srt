[Episode 30]

4
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:48,470
Sister Yi Yi, have some coffee.

5
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,750
Don't try your tricks on me.

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,590
So, why do you call me here?

7
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:56,670
This is important.

8
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,840
Is there anything
incriminating in your bag?

9
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,580
My trophies.

10
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,930
And I thought it was a family heirloom.

11
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,240
You asked me here to show off your trophy?

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
No.

13
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,220
Yi Yi.

14
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,820
You know a lot of people.
Can you help me ask around?

15
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,850
Is there anyone who'd
buy trophies as a collection?

16
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,820
What?

17
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,510
Your salary and bonus
should be a considerable sum.

18
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,730
Are you crazy, selling your trophies?

19
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,340
Spill.

20
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,310
Who did you spend all your money on?

21
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,410
Who else can I spend it on?

22
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,910
My brother got married early this year.

23
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:40,680
I gave him all my money
for him to buy a house.

24
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,100
Other than my trophies,

25
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,040
the only valuable thing
I own is me myself.

26
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,560
But, nobody will buy me.

27
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,320
Why don't you buy me?

28
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,340
I can give you a 20% discount.

29
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,650
Buzz off.

30
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,110
Why do you need the money?

31
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,190
Are you in debt?

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,840
I'm not in debt.

33
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,460
It's for my penalty fees.

34
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,910
I will leave this team
to join Team Phenix.

35
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:18,570
Are you sure selling your trophies
is enough for the penalty fees?

36
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,100
I still have some money
for my future wife.

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,990
No. I cannot understand.

38
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,510
What's so attractive
about Ji Xiang Kong, anyway?

39
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:29,680
You'd rather join him than get married.

40
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,110
I cannot understand.

41
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,010
No, I still want to get married.

42
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,190
But now...

43
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,530
Yi Yi, I am begging you, please.

44
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,210
Could you help me, please?

45
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,240
I'll treat you to coffee.

46
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:57,290
Xiang Kong

47
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,470
You're back.

48
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,910
Don't worry too much about Xia Ling.

49
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,910
I just didn't expect it to be so bad.

50
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,890
He is like walking in a swamp now.

51
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,060
The more he struggles,
the deeper he sinks.

52
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,010
Give him some time.

53
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,510
Come on, smile.

54
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:35,990
Big Baby is leaving soon.

55
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,070
Where is your Big Baby going?

56
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,820
It's going somewhere far away

57
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,650
and meet its new master.

58
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,659
You want to sell it?

59
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,190
Yeah.

60
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,780
This is your favourite bike.

61
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,300
Can you really bear to sell it?

62
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,840
You could sell something else.

63
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,090
I've sold the others.

64
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,860
Lu Yi Yi told me that Xuan
is selling his trophies for money.

65
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,610
So, I have to sacrifice them for Xuan.

66
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,940
When we have enough money,

67
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,280
we will redeem them back.

68
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,390
Silly girl.

69
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,330
Even if I have nothing,

70
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,740
having you is enough.

71
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,990
I have enough money now.

72
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,490
Tomorrow, I will go to Team Legends.

73
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,450
Come on, I'm going to shower
Big Baby for the last time.

74
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,640
Brother Sun, let me train with you.

75
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,610
You, training with me?

76
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,650
Isn't that what a training
mate is supposed to do?

77
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,030
-Come on.
-Okay.

78
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,560
I'll start a new game.

79
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,850
Top lane, right?

80
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:27,480
Sure, I'll cooperate.

81
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,390
Okay, the room is ready.

82
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,460
Hell Lord at the top lane.

83
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,390
I didn't know you had a strategy.

84
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,060
It's to train your resilience.

85
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,110
What is it? Why are you grinning?

86
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:51,340
Nothing, you will find out later.

87
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,980
Let's go.

88
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,900
-Tough fight.
-Not bad, Brother Sun.

89
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,000
I caught you, didn't I?

90
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,340
Go back to the spring.

91
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,170
Coach Luo.

92
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,590
Sit down.

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,410
When Pei Xi left, he told me
he was going to your team.

94
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,460
I didn't believe him back then.

95
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,910
To think you built your
team in a few weeks.

96
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,530
I just took this opportunity to do it.

97
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,370
Congratulations.

98
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,030
But, you stole two of
my star players in one go.

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,040
Coach, no matter where we go,

100
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,240
we will never forget
being part of Team Legends.

101
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,700
Xiang Kong.

102
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:46,120
Seeing your passion
for professional e-sports,

103
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,320
unrestricted by business engagements,
free to chase after your dreams,

104
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,890
I am really happy for you.

105
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,990
-Thanks, Coach.
-No need to thank me.

106
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,060
As a coach, that is all I can do.

107
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,040
You have to continue by yourself.

108
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,190
Brother Kong?

109
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,690
Coach Luo.

110
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,990
What are you doing here?

111
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,600
What do you think?

112
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,630
Sign here.

113
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,300
Why are you in a daze?

114
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,650
Sign.

115
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,960
You've always wanted
to follow your buddy, right?

116
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,909
I haven't collected enough money yet.

117
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:41,360
By the time you save enough,
two seasons would be over.

118
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,660
I've prepared your transfer fee.

119
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:45,950
Sign here.

120
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,030
How did you get so much money?

121
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,090
You're not that valuable.

122
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,840
Just a few bikes.

123
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,690
You sold all your bikes?

124
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,830
Are you signing?

125
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,540
If not, I will get them back now.

126
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,340
I'll sign.

127
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,420
Brother Kong.

128
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,610
I will be your loyal servant.

129
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,860
I will even lay my life for you.

130
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,880
All right.

131
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,800
Go back and pack up.

132
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,790
Coach Luo and I are going to wrap up.

133
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,460
Coach Luo.

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,010
I'm not a good talker,

135
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,810
but when I was here,

136
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,840
I've caused you lots of troubles.

137
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,440
You have never blamed me.

138
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,580
I'm leaving with Brother Kong now,

139
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,590
but I will always remember your kindness.

140
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,730
I'm off.

141
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,140
Xiang Kong.

142
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,940
Do not forget.

143
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,210
You're carrying my
passion for e-sports too.

144
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,150
Team Phenix.

145
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,510
Do not let me down.

146
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,220
Don't worry.

147
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,300
Brother Sun, Qiu Ying, I'm here!

148
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:36,410
Xuan!

149
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,430
You rascal.

150
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,930
Have you sold your trophies yet?

151
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,480
You all know about it?

152
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,480
I'll deal with Lu Yi Yi later.

153
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,050
What are you doing here?

154
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,760
Enemies are bound to meet.

155
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,460
I think so, too.

156
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,310
We are different this time.

157
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,110
I. Lin Yi Xuan, am an official
member of Team Phenix.

158
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,670
You are no more than a training mate.

159
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,710
Even if I am a training mate,
I am better than you.

160
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,140
Young man, work hard.

161
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,300
Do your best so you'll
become an official member.

162
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,360
Do not lose hope.

163
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,330
Enough, Xuan.

164
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,420
We've tidied up two rooms here.

165
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,490
You can choose one.

166
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,510
Which room does Brother Kong live?

167
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,860
He lives on the second floor.

168
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,540
Okay, I'll stay in his room.

169
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,230
That room is mine.

170
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,140
After all, I came first.

171
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,520
I am already here.

172
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,030
Wise up and move out, then.

173
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,540
You know what Brother Kong and I are?

174
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,210
We're brothers who've been
through thick and thin, got it?

175
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,460
You made him sell his bikes.

176
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,410
I...

177
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:06,980
Ji Xiang Kong.

178
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:10,940
So, who stays in that room, me or him?

179
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,710
Brother Kong, I want to live
in the same room with you.

180
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:19,300
Look, he has been here
for a couple of days, so...

181
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,810
Stop messing around.

182
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,720
Fine.

183
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,540
From today on, I, Lin Yi Xuan,

184
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:30,170
will never set foot on the second floor.

185
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,430
I will sleep on the sofa.

186
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,490
Go.

187
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,330
Xuan.

188
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,980
These two guys will be a handful.

189
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:44,080
Isn't it?

190
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,660
By the way, I have been looking for 409.

191
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,500
Pei Xi has asked
everyone in Dream Traveler,

192
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,680
but nobody knows his identity.

193
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,210
Brother Sun, do you
have other recommendations?

194
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,710
For now, no.

195
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,060
Xuan sometimes speaks without thinking.

196
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,640
Don't mind him.

197
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,540
I don't mind.

198
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,330
He's telling the truth.

199
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:20,460
Actually, I've been practicing
with Brother Sun lately.

200
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,530
I think I'm pretty good
as a top laner too.

201
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,310
I can help my teammates
in different positions.

202
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,620
I have never experienced
anything like this in other teams.

203
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:43,190
Can you accept not playing as
midlaner and changing your tactics?

204
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,530
I want to enter Team Phenix.

205
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,930
I just want to change myself.

206
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,160
Before, I thought that only
Ji Xiang Kong's tactics were awesome.

207
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,440
But, when he was in VNG,

208
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,330
I saw a miracle.

209
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,310
Tong Wu, Lu Sheng.

210
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,410
They seemed to have
become a different person.

211
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,350
Xiang Kong just tapped
into their potential.

212
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,950
Yes.

213
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,290
That's why I believe that

214
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,230
he will lead Phenix and all of us

215
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,950
to the winner's podium at
the world championships.

216
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,730
Look how cute you were
when you were a kid.

217
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,620
Only when I was a kid.

218
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,040
You still have this photo?

219
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,740
This photo...

220
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,130
Dad kept it.

221
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,110
We took this at the amusement park, right?

222
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,980
Yeah, it was at the air bicycle.

223
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:22,080
It suddenly stopped halfway.

224
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,330
It was so scary that I cried.

225
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,510
You were really timid when you were a kid.

226
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,840
Why are you back so early today?

227
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,700
I'm bringing our son to rehab tomorrow.

228
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,530
There's still so much to prepare.

229
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,990
Who's here?

230
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,030
He seems happy.

231
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,960
It's Ying.

232
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,380
What is she doing here?

233
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,550
Shu Min!

234
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,370
Ying.

235
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,660
Auntie Xia is back

236
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,030
I'll visit you some other day.

237
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,569
Sister.

238
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,079
Didn't you say

239
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,359
that you'd bring me to your team?

240
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,560
You can come any time you want.

241
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,880
Let's go now.

242
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,510
Go, go.

243
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,040
Go out and play.

244
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,160
Staying at home all-day
is so boring, right?

245
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,940
I will take care of him.

246
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,430
Stay safe, you two.

247
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,290
What's wrong? Calm down, okay?

248
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,680
What were you thinking?

249
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,700
What's wrong?

250
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,610
I just wanted Ying to come

251
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,790
and open Xia Ling up.

252
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,130
You don't want to see your
son depressed all day, right?

253
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,670
See, after Ying came,

254
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,460
Xia Ling is laughing now.

255
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,110
Let bygones be bygones.

256
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:05,620
What could be more important
than seeing your child get better?

257
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,720
You...

258
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,630
Right?

259
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,090
Tell me when she comes next time.

260
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,410
I will.

261
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,410
I think you can check these two guys.

262
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,040
Let's look at Zhou Wen Jie.

263
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,570
His performance in the high
school league is pretty good.

264
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,460
Here is a video of his game.

265
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,450
Take a look.

266
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,810
Careful.

267
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,290
Not bad, right?

268
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,820
I'm back.

269
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,480
I brought a new friend.

270
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,940
My brother, Xia Ling.

271
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,010
Hi, Xia Ling.

272
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,350
Hi, Brother.

273
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,350
You are Ji Xiang Kong?

274
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,180
Many people call you
the Battlefield Trickster.

275
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,800
But, more people call you

276
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:15,940
the klutz.

277
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,040
Xia Ling.

278
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:24,110
Yeah, I am the klutz, as they say.

279
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,860
Right, Xia Ling plays iConquer too.

280
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,140
We have so many experts here today.

281
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,300
Why don't you play with them?

282
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,660
Come on, Brother.

283
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,210
Brother Xuan will meet you in game.

284
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,220
-Sit down.
-Why would I want to play with you?

285
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,560
You're just a support.

286
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,130
It seems that Xia Ling knows
everyone here to some extent.

287
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,360
By the way, this is Brother Sun.

288
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,240
The former captain of Pioneer,

289
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,180
one of the five ancient experts.

290
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,640
I want to play with him.

291
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,180
Can I?

292
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,330
You want to play with Pei Xi?

293
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,980
Xia Ling said Pei Xi is his idol.

294
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,110
Pei Xi, will you?

295
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,450
Why play with him?

296
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,060
He's just an intern here.

297
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,190
Play with me.

298
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,960
I just want to challenge
the strongest one.

299
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,250
Okay.

300
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,880
I accept your challenge.

301
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,630
The best top laner, indeed.

302
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:17,990
I learned something from you.

303
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,260
Actually, you're pretty good too.

304
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,130
Losing to the best
top laner is not a shame.

305
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,480
Let's work hard together.

306
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,710
It's you who should work hard.

307
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,960
I will, I will.

308
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:37,680
Don't you think that
the way Xia Ling plays

309
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,840
resembles someone's?

310
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,110
Yes, indeed.

311
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,010
Wait, what do you guys mean?

312
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,950
Mango attack one to one.

313
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,260
Always using consumables
to maintain skill energy.

314
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:55,060
Using intensive, high-mana skills
in early game to suppress the opponent.

315
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:00,520
This is exactly the
same as 409's strategy.

316
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,390
Yeah, when he started
setting up his equipment,

317
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,130
I knew there's something.

318
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,360
Wait a minute.

319
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:15,460
You mean he's the guy
you've been looking for,

320
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,320
the genius player, ID 409?

321
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,910
Brother, how did you...

322
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,390
I do not know what you are talking about.

323
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,340
I don't think Xia Ling is him.

324
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,650
He's just capable enough
for random matches.

325
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,510
This is already well done.

326
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,660
It just looks like 409.

327
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,260
But, when I played with him,

328
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,470
I only used a fraction of my skills,

329
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,960
and I still won easily.

330
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,490
Bragger.

331
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,340
I think he's just a bad imitator of 409.

332
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,160
Xiang Kong, don't go overboard.

333
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,120
You think I'm a jerk?

334
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,100
He was a jerk to me just now too.

335
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:54,080
I am telling you the truth.

336
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,380
He also needs to know his capabilities.

337
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,540
You think you know 409?

338
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,810
You lost to him anyway.

339
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,070
How do you know they
have played against each other?

340
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,860
Looks like you wouldn't
admit until I irritate you.

341
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,990
It was a good game, 409.

342
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,330
He really is 409?

343
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,610
Xia Ling.

344
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,340
Sister, I'm going back.

345
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,120
Xia Ling.

346
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,550
Would you like to join Team Phoenix?

347
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,990
Not interested.

348
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,490
I'll send him back.

349
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,350
Slowly.

350
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,350
What an unexpected surprise.

351
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:49,060
He came himself.

352
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:03,360
Xia Ling.

353
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,090
When you were unhappy as a kid,

354
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,760
you would ask for ice cream.

355
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,720
Be happy.

356
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,050
I cannot believe

357
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,810
my brother is 409.

358
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,390
You're a great player!

359
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,810
I understand what you mean.

360
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,350
You want me to join the team

361
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,110
just want to give me something to do.

362
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,090
I brought you out just to get you out

363
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,890
so you wouldn't stay at home all day.

364
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,210
I didn't realize you are 409.

365
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,380
When Ji Xiang Kong
invited you to join the team,

366
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,810
he meant it.

367
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,210
You don't know how hard
we tried to look for you.

368
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,210
Tell Ji Xiang Kong to give up.

369
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,570
Sister.

370
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,480
You people are after the championships.

371
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,910
What's the use of inviting an
unprofessional cripple like me?

372
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,780
Xia Ling, don't call yourself like that.

373
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,700
Sister, you're busy too.

374
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,470
Go back home first.

375
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,930
Let me do it myself.

376
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,520
Xia Ling.

377
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,620
I told you not to force yourself.

378
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:29,660
Take your time.

379
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,640
You see?

380
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,580
That's how I am now.

381
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,200
Hey, how did it go?

382
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,620
I saw him.

383
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,130
But given his condition,
even with me around,

384
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,100
I might not be able to persuade him.

385
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,240
[Are you sure he is
the one Phenix needs now?]

386
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,760
Right now, no one else is more suitable.

387
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,440
I don't want to miss him.

388
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,310
Now that he's in the abyss,

389
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,470
let's show him some light.

390
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:19,640
I want him to know his meaning and value.

391
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,540
What do you mean?

392
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,390
I'll stimulate him for real.

393
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,720
Hello?

394
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,680
[Xia Ling, you're awesome!]

395
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,760
[Brother, respect.]

396
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:18,550
[You're the legendary sweeper,
aren't you?]

397
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,830
[You kept yourself hidden.]

398
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,060
[Yeah, Master, help me out next time!]

399
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,600
[Dude, you're famous
all over the school now.]

400
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,500
[Someone just asked me for your contact.]

401
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,880
[Check out the school forum,
everyone's talking about you!]

402
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,590
[Yeah, Xia Ling, go and have a look!]

403
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,670
[Xia Ling from Basketball is
a top player in the national server!]

404
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,200
[Amazing. Who'd have known?]

405
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,430
[Xia Ling is really 409?]

406
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,700
[It's a shame that he's not going pro.]

407
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,920
[I heard that he was injured.]

408
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,220
[He can't play basketball anymore.]

409
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,870
[He used to be a basketball pro.]

410
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,830
[Why would this happen to him?]

411
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:25,230
By the way, Hei, ranked sixth in
the national server, has contacted me.

412
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,210
He would like to join us.

413
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,260
Let's meet him sometime, then.

414
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,380
We're taking him in?

415
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,500
Who else?

416
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,840
Let's wait a little longer.

417
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,890
I'm sure Xia Ling will come to us.

418
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,110
Let's eat.

419
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,350
Xia Ling?

420
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,580
What brought you here?

421
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,300
Come, we're having lunch.

422
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,890
Slow down.

423
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,760
Pei Xi, you're awesome.

424
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:02,330
Did you guys post the video online?

425
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,750
What's going on?

426
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:09,990
It's none of their business.

427
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,740
I posted the video.

428
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,190
Why would you do that?

429
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,940
Sorry for exposing that you are 409.

430
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,290
But I did it to let you know

431
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:31,600
that you're not useless.

432
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,310
I'm not useless?

433
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:36,300
Now the whole school
knows my leg is crippled.

434
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,530
-Xia Ling.
-No.

435
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,800
Now, the whole school knows that

436
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,080
you are 409, who rose to number four
in the national server in just two weeks.

437
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,000
You are the brave player,

438
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,380
ID 409, who challenged
me and Ji Xiang Kong solo.

439
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,210
Xia Ling, except you,

440
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,090
no one thinks you're useless.

441
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,230
Yeah.

442
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,650
Besides playing basketball,

443
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,940
there are many things we can do, right?

444
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,190
As long as you want it,
you can be the best in any field.

445
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,910
In iConquer,

446
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,560
you rose to number four
in such a short time.

447
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,140
You can also turn pro

448
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,490
and represent the country.

449
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,580
Who do you think you are?

450
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,800
Why do I need you to care for me?

451
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,180
Xia Ling.

452
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,080
Yes, I'm an outsider.

453
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,180
If you weren't Qiu Ying's brother,
I wouldn't care.

454
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,610
Ji Xiang Kong.

455
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,410
About what happened to you,

456
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,460
if I say I understand,

457
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,810
you'd think I'm a hypocrite.

458
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:40,060
But, every day, I see how Qiu Ying
feels guilty and worried about you.

459
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,850
Ever since she knew you
can't play basketball anymore,

460
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,890
she couldn't eat or sleep well.

461
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,180
She's been trying to cheer you up.

462
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,090
Even your parents

463
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,700
cajole you every day.

464
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,750
They're so scared that you'd get triggered

465
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,480
until they don't dare mention
the word "run" in front of you.

466
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:01,010
People are not doing this
to make you look useless,

467
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
but to make you feel positive about life.

468
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,830
Xia Ling.

469
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,540
You are 20 years old now.

470
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,190
Are you going to spend
your life as a loser at home?

471
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,410
Pei Xi.

472
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,340
Do you want to torture everyone
around you with your pessimism

473
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,940
or get back up

474
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,210
and use your own hands to
get back what was yours?

475
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,480
Think it over.

476
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,500
That's enough.

477
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,710
I don't need your help.

478
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,820
Xia Ling!

479
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:42,310
Recruitment is about to close soon.

480
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,930
We are willing to wait
for you until the last minute.

481
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,070
I'll take care of the problem I created.

482
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,540
Xia Ling!

483
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,340
Would you stop following me?

484
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,410
I apologize for the video.

485
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,130
Who wants you to apologize?

486
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,710
I did it myself.

487
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,060
If you feel hurt, you can hate me.

488
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,010
But, it has nothing to do with them.

489
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:37,690
Then, please stay out of my business.

490
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,180
No.

491
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,580
I won't leave you alone.

492
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:42,820
Your sister won't, too.

493
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,090
Team Phenix will not leave you alone.

494
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,940
Even so, I will not join Phenix.

495
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,000
As much as I want you to join Phenix,

496
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,990
it's still your choice.

497
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,210
What I want more now is
for you to pull yourself together.

498
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,910
Your sister told us

499
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,200
that you used to be a cheerful boy.

500
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,760
But now?

501
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:05,380
What does my former self
has to do with you?

502
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:06,990
Stop.

503
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,390
I don't want you to be what I used to be.

504
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
I just don't want anyone to pity me.

505
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:21,610
So, I'd rather be alone.

506
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:25,680
I was afraid that others
would see me as a weirdo.

507
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,910
So, in the past,

508
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,330
I would rather stay alone too.

509
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:32,310
You?

510
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,110
Who would see you as a weirdo?

511
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,960
Almost everyone who
has worked with me, I guess.

512
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,270
I didn't care what anyone else was doing.

513
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,850
Even in a tournament,

514
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,560
I'd rather turn my mic off

515
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,240
and listen to music.

516
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,030
I had zero communication with my team.

517
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,230
Even when everyone said
Pei Xi was dealing with nine at once,

518
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,880
Pei Xi is selfish

519
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,650
and has no team spirit,

520
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,090
I did not care.

521
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,590
But you still won.

522
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,220
You're the best top solo.

523
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,190
No.

524
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,010
I've never made it to the global finals.

525
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:10,090
How can I be number one?

526
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,530
iConquer has never been a one-man sport.

527
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:24,090
I've only learned this recently myself.

528
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,330
So, I regret it so much.

529
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,610
Regret what?

530
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,780
I regret that I clammed myself up.

531
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,850
Even when I wanted
to become part of the team.

532
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,489
But, I was always afraid of
people looking at me strangely.

533
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,730
I didn't dare to take the first step.

534
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:48,510
That's why in my free time,

535
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,690
I wouldn't stay in the team.

536
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,909
I'd rather go to Dream Traveler

537
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,460
and brew coffee for strangers.

538
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,860
This is my first time
saying all these too.

539
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,410
That's because

540
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,460
I don't want you to be who I used to be,

541
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,780
clamming yourself up.

542
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,200
I really envy you, actually.

543
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,340
When you're confused,

544
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,680
so many people are willing to help you.

545
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,060
So, Xia Ling.

546
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,190
Promise me.

547
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,410
Don't turn away people who care about you.

548
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,560
You have talent.

549
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:37,650
iConquer and basketball are
both competitive sports.

550
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,090
Sportspeople like us

551
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,230
won't settle for being ordinary.

552
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,840
Then, why would you become
just a training mate in Phenix?

553
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,010
What I can get in Phenix

554
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:54,090
can't be found in other places.

555
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,660
What did you get?

556
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:00,350
Want to know?

557
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,460
Then, join Phenix and find the answer.

558
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:14,160
Feel anything?

559
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,510
It tingles.

560
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,320
-Gentle.
-Got it.

561
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,220
The acupoint we talked about last time...

562
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,910
-What's it called again?
-Yong Quan.

563
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,430
You can't remember
how many times I've said it.

564
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,380
Why don't you lie down and let me do it?

565
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,310
How many days
have you been practicing?

566
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,370
How many acupoints
have you memorized?

567
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,390
Mind your manners.

568
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,290
It might affect our son.

569
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,160
Son, you're back.

570
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,980
-Have you eaten?
-I have.

571
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:56,790
Our son finally smiled.

572
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,410
What's wrong?
Still worried about Xia Ling?

573
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:22,340
Yeah.

574
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,310
I wanted to call him, but I didn't dare.

575
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:27,590
I don't want to affect his mood.

576
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,010
I hope Pei Xi's methods
can pull him together.

577
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,460
In fact, Pei Xi has a passionate heart.

578
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,430
It's just that he keeps it well hidden.

579
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:45,540
Yeah, but now he doesn't have to hide it.

580
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,680
Through Xia Ling,
I got to know a different Pei Xi.

581
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:52,690
I believe he will shine in Phenix.

582
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,310
You mean...

583
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,500
[Xia Ling, we miss you.]

584
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,180
[When your leg is better,
let's go for a game!]

585
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:23,150
-[Right?]
-[Yeah!]

586
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,810
[Xia Ling, I knew it was you.]

587
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,310
[Only you would have
that kind of ferocity.]

588
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,400
-[So cool.]
-[Xia Ling.]

589
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:30,980
[I knew you wouldn't fall.]

590
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,140
[There's a race everywhere in life.]

591
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,290
[Run forward!]

592
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,640
[Xia Ling, everyone in the class
has high hopes on you.]

593
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,180
[No obstacle cannot be overcome.]

594
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,360
[Xia Ling, look!]

595
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,660
[Look who this is!]

596
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:44,020
[Xia Ling, I saw your solo match.]

597
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:46,430
[You're still the same as ever.]

598
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,930
[Wherever you go, you are a king!]

599
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:07,340
[I don't want you to be who I used to be,]

600
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,610
[clamming yourself up.]

601
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,410
[I really envy you, actually.]

602
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,500
[When you're confused,]

603
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,590
[so many people are willing to help you.]

604
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,210
[So, Xia Ling.]

605
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,410
[Promise me.]

606
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,620
[Don't turn away people
who care about you.]

607
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,960
I wonder if our son is awake.

608
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,560
Son, time for breakfast.

609
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,330
Mom, Dad.

610
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,980
I'm going back to school.

611
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,290
You're going back to school?

612
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,410
To study?

613
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,640
Yeah, and you don't have
to research acupuncture anymore.

614
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,790
I'll go to the hospital
for rehabilitation.

615
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,070
You thought it through?

616
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,220
Eat your breakfast.

617
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,580
After breakfast, your mother
and I will take you to school.

618
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,990
Son, I'll take you to your dorm.

619
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,710
I'll ask your friends to take care of you.

620
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,820
It's okay, you can all go back.

621
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,240
I told them to wait for me downstairs.

622
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,940
You keep worrying about your son.

623
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,020
You didn't have to.

624
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,160
Tell us if you need something at school.

625
00:40:57,290 --> 00:40:58,370
Here.

626
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,100
Tell me if you need anything,
I'll bring it over.

627
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,710
I'm leaving. You should go home.

628
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,960
I'll help you, this is too heavy.

629
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:12,430
Let him do it himself.

630
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:15,310
Xia Ling can do it himself.

631
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,640
Are we really inviting Hei to join?

632
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,660
Why don't we wait
a little longer for Xia Ling?

633
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,740
We really don't have
time to wait any longer.

634
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,550
Listen to this.

635
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,850
[Ying, your brother has gone to school.]

636
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:28,090
[Auntie Xia and I
would like to thank you.]

637
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:30,570
[You've been helping him to open up.]

638
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,140
[It must have been hard on you.]

639
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:36,560
Xia Ling really can't come anymore.

640
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:43,530
All right.

641
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,690
Let's call Hei.

642
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,220
Xia Ling!

643
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,300
Xia Ling?

644
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:21,630
Xia Ling, didn't you go back to school?

645
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,910
I've arranged everything at school.

646
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,890
I just have a question.

647
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:29,510
If I come here, will we win?

648
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,110
If we work on it, it's possible.

649
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,780
It's very possible.

650
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,180
Congratulations on joining Phenix.

651
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:41,240
Come on, Brother.

652
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:44,260
Brother Xuan will look over you.

653
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:47,060
Don't look down on supports, got it?

654
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,170
Enough.

655
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,310
I hereby declare that Pei Xi

656
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,870
is now the last official
team member of Phenix.

657
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,090
Me?

658
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,180
No way.

659
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,350
I'm not ready.

660
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,260
No, you're ready.

661
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,820
What do you think?

662
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,490
I think not really.

663
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:18,480
Everyone has been speaking highly of you.

664
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:21,510
You have learned
to cooperate and dedicate.

665
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,270
Now you have proved that

666
00:44:23,350 --> 00:44:27,380
you are no longer a top solo
who replaces the whole team.

667
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,380
Also, all this time,

668
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,590
I'm impressed by
how you handled Xia Ling.

669
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:44,110
Today, Pei Xi and Xia Ling are
official members of Team Phenix.

670
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,640
Team Phenix is officially established.

671
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,050
Let's remember this day, go!

672
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:50,020
Come on.

673
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,980
Bathed in flames,
a phoenix rises from the ashes!

674
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,500
Top lane, watch it.

675
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:03,130
Okay, take note.

676
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,970
I'm caught! Three people are after me!

677
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,380
Xuan, hold on. I'm coming.

678
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,400
Great job!

679
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,340
Wonderful, Pei Xi, buddy!

680
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:16,210
Yes, we can do this.

681
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,900
♫ If the light fell into a black hole ♫

682
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,520
♫ I shall make a crack with my dream ♫

683
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,350
♫ As long as my heart is scorched ♫

684
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:00,890
♫ Then it will start a new spark ♫

685
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:07,690
♫ Waking up from a dream,
traces of injuries ♫

686
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,900
♫ All these are honours of youth-hood ♫

687
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,910
♫ Without the courage to bathe in flames ♫

688
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:15,150
♫ How will you see a miracle? ♫

689
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,250
♫ Traversing to wake up from a dream ♫

690
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:18,640
♫ Don't stop, to the summit, here we go ♫

691
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:22,710
♫ Yes, here we go ♫

692
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,590
♫ Deciding to go to the top of the world ♫

693
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:26,910
♫ It's the most exciting adventure ♫

694
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:29,540
♫ Be fearless today ♫

695
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,000
♫ Make a promise ♫

696
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,910
♫ And realise the dream ♫

697
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,320
♫ Just this moment ♫

698
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,110
♫ Let's work together hand in hand ♫

699
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,550
Not bad.

700
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,810
It's in place.

701
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,480
♫ You know the real life ♫

702
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,090
♫ You know we can fly ♫

703
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,030
Team Phenix finally has its own logo.
