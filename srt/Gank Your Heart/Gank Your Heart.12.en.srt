00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:49,580
Your current ranking
in the Regional Server

5
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,770
735th.

6
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,460
You don't have to remind me.

7
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,570
With my current standard,

8
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,240
I'm not even qualified to be
a waitress at Dream Traveler,

9
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,410
let alone the champion of Rising Star.

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,280
Here's my advice.

11
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:11,440
You may have a great dream.
Yet, the reality is cruel.

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,930
Do you want to reconsider
joining the competition?

13
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,850
No, I don't. I can do it.

14
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,250
Are you serious?

15
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,430
I've always been serious.

16
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,190
To improve
my professional knowledge quickly,

17
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,600
I must put it into practice.

18
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,840
Start.

19
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,510
Start what?

20
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,260
Practice to be a hero.

21
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,990
Sister, it's already half past twelve.

22
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,270
You've gone crazy indeed.

23
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,820
All right, get on with your practice.

24
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,770
I'll use some face masks and go to bed.

25
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,190
Go ahead.

26
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,680
Here's your natural pistachio.

27
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,390
Okay, thank you.

28
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,700
You suck.

29
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,530
Are you talking about me?

30
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,060
Try the mage.

31
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,590
The mage?

32
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,570
Why?

33
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,980
Actually, I too don't think
I'm good at using an archer.

34
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,820
But if I were to use the mage,
which one should I go with?

35
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,900
I know that you're the top mage.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,730
Why don't you recommend me
some handy ones?

37
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:13,930
The main problem is that,

38
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,440
if I were to use the mage,
I have to start from scratch.

39
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,920
Then how do I match
the earlier inscriptions?

40
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,930
And you know what?
During the early and the late stages,

41
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,959
the equipment...

42
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,860
Is this for me?

43
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,060
Thank you.

44
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,680
It's a puppy. How adorable.

45
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,130
Why did you give me a lollipop?

46
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,300
You talk too much. Eat up.

47
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,580
Sort out your questions
and send them to me.

48
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,590
The mage?

49
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:57,560
I remember Pei Xi used the Creator.

50
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,320
Whatever. I'll give it a try first.

51
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,550
Sister, it's getting late.
Why haven't you gone to bed?

52
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,000
Do you want to have panda eyes?

53
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,440
I don't have much time left
before the game.

54
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,510
I must speed it up.

55
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,690
Fine.

56
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,540
I'll go to bed first.
Don't stay up too late.

57
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,630
Go ahead. Goodnight.

58
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,060
You're amazing!

59
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:07,150
Mr. Pei Xi. These are all the
questions I have about the Creator.

60
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
Watch it.

61
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,100
I mean the computer.

62
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,670
That's the difference
between a pro and a rookie!

63
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,220
Do you understand now?

64
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,850
Wait, Mr. Pei Xi.

65
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,900
You were moving your hands too fast,
just like playing a piano.

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,170
And I was dazzled.

67
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,160
Could you please show me one more time?

68
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,360
Watch the replay.

69
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,180
Pei Xi.

70
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,950
Wait up.

71
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,130
To show my appreciation for your guidance,

72
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,230
I would like to work at Dream Traveler

73
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,540
and help you with
making coffee and chores.

74
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,480
And you don't need to pay me.

75
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,010
I'm very capable.

76
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,900
You're the top player
in the Regional Server.

77
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,590
Thus, you're not qualified to be
a waitress at Dream Traveler.

78
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,860
Pei Xi. I really can do anything.

79
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,890
I can move the tables, clean them,
sweep the floor, and so on.

80
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,450
I really...

81
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,990
Thank you.

82
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,350
-We're here.
-Brother Kong.

83
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,490
-Coach.
-Xiang Kong.

84
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,410
Is everything ready?

85
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,450
Then let's get started.

86
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,270
Where's Huo Yao?

87
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,549
I just had dinner with him

88
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,240
He said he's going out
to attend to some stuff.

89
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,549
Where did he go?

90
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,490
He didn't tell me.

91
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,480
We'll start without him.

92
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:48,100
All of us are aware that
VNG is the best at "4-Cover-1" tactic.

93
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,300
As long as we can stop
Pei Xi's farming at the early stage,

94
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,070
we may win the game.

95
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,160
I've had all Pei Xi's videos here.

96
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,690
Let's check them out.

97
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,660
Brother Yao, you're here.

98
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,560
Sorry for being late, guys.

99
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,380
Let's watch the videos.

100
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,340
You've been in good form lately.

101
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:37,200
Your contract with Legends
is due in two months.

102
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,230
This is the contract for next year.

103
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,340
Thank you, Manager Zhao.

104
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,540
Who cares for the team?

105
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,050
Who is the capable one?

106
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,370
Who really performs well?

107
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,600
The board and I know that well.

108
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,520
Huo Yao.

109
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,830
Who do you think

110
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,380
is the best candidate for captain?

111
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,700
Isn't Handsome Ji going to
become the captain

112
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,560
after we win the closed beta test?

113
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
You, Ji Xiang Kong,

114
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,900
Lin Yi Xuan, and Lu Feng.

115
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,430
Of all four of you,

116
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,160
I admire you the most.

117
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,880
If Gu Fang hadn't insisted on

118
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,640
recommending Ji Xiang Kong
for the post of captain,

119
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,770
I would definitely have
recommended you to the board.

120
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
Manager Zhao.

121
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,380
My capability is of average.

122
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,260
It's not about capability.

123
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,940
Huo Yao, let me tell you the truth.

124
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,070
Time and tide wait for no man.

125
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,430
You're aware

126
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,220
that the golden age of
a professional player

127
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,870
only lasts a few years.

128
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,520
Chairman Jin

129
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,270
has been very thoughtful
about your future development.

130
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,230
If you continue following Ji Xiang Kong,

131
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,730
I can't help you.

132
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,540
A straightforward person
doesn't resort to insinuations.

133
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,280
You are a wise man after all.

134
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,980
If you can understand what I mean.

135
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,980
Do you want to be the captain,

136
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:32,300
or put yourself in an awkward position
and wait for the elimination?

137
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,890
That depends on your performance

138
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,840
during the closed beta test.

139
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,950
Don't let me down.

140
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,900
I have errands to run. I'll get going.

141
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,890
Pei Xi likes to play solo.

142
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,230
He has a low participation rate,
and seldom plays with his teammates.

143
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,320
We will make good use of that.

144
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,760
We need to stand in
Pei Xi's way at an early stage.

145
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,470
Very good.

146
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,970
Huo Yao, say something.

147
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,190
Huo Yao.

148
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,460
-Say something.
-Sorry, Coach.

149
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:18,050
My head doesn't feel right today.

150
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,650
-Brother Yao, are you having a fever?
-I'm all right.

151
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,450
If you don't feel well,
head back and get some rest.

152
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,170
Okay, I'll head back and take a rest.

153
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,170
Go ahead and decide on the strategy.

154
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,680
I'll practice it tonight.

155
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,680
-I'm sorry.
-Go ahead.

156
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,200
It's too difficult.

157
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,080
What? Are you dazzled by my handsome face?

158
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,780
What are you doing here?

159
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,760
Lin Yi Xuan told me
that you come here a lot.

160
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,830
I was just passing by.
So I came up to have a look.

161
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,470
I didn't expect to see you here.

162
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,120
Have you been skipping
sleep and meals for this?

163
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,360
I only skip sleep, not meals.

164
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,600
What are you watching?

165
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,120
Pei Xi's moves are pretty good.

166
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,050
How did you know it's Pei Xi?

167
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,330
His moves can be identified at a glance.

168
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,210
Why are you watching this?

169
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,730
He's teaching me how to mid.

170
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,250
That's too harsh of him.

171
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,970
He's obviously showing off his moves.

172
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,120
How can a rookie like you master it?

173
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,060
I am slow so I have to start early.

174
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,170
And you told me that,

175
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:16,000
I can do it, if I believe I can.

176
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,590
So you came to Dream Traveler to learn?

177
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,160
I want to be a commentator.

178
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,680
And I want to join Rising Star.

179
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,250
With so many pros here,

180
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,580
I can improve myself quickly.

181
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,190
Don't rub your eyes like that.

182
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:40,830
Have you been staring at
the screen for too long?

183
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,170
Quit it, he's just messing around.
And you won't understand it.

184
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,140
Come on, I'll take you out for a walk.

185
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,570
Let's go.

186
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,720
Is someone speaking ill of me?

187
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,820
Thank you.

188
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,310
It feels good to receive flowers.

189
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,650
Do you think you've had a perfect day?

190
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,200
Why?

191
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,140
Because you got to spend your night
shopping with a handsome guy like me.

192
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,570
Why are you so narcissistic?

193
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,810
I have thousands of fangirls, okay?

194
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:41,030
But joking aside,
the finals are coming up. Are you nervous?

195
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,880
Nervous? How can I be nervous?

196
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,230
At first, I could get 90 points.

197
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,860
And with the support of
thousands of fangirls,

198
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,300
I can get 99 points.

199
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,570
And where is the last point?

200
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:56,520
It is you. If you come,
I'll get full mark.

201
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,300
Perfect.

202
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,500
Am I only worth one point?

203
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,580
That's pretty high, okay?

204
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,740
That makes you my No. 1 fangirl.

205
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,200
Well, Mr. Ji,

206
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,130
could you please tutor your No. 1 fangirl?

207
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,540
No problem.
I'll give you top secret tutoring.

208
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,490
I guarantee you'll become a master.

209
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,850
Come with me.

210
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,130
What did you bring me here for?

211
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,130
You'll find out in a bit.

212
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,130
Welcome to Bestore,
your high-end snacks retailer.

213
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,220
We have hundreds of high-end snacks.
for you to choose from.

214
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,490
Thank you.

215
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,810
Didn't you say you're going to teach me?

216
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,310
Master?

217
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,700
I think you're just tricking me
into buying you snacks.

218
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,930
You watched Pei Xi's moves just now.

219
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,240
What's the core?

220
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,620
It's fast, accurate, and ruthless.

221
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,560
That's right.

222
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,790
In addition to tactically
surpassing ordinary players,

223
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,680
pros excel at operation,
which is the basic skill.

224
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,250
But I'm a late starter. Can I succeed?

225
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,490
Why not?

226
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,160
You're playing iConquer to
improve your professional skills,

227
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,369
not for some competition.

228
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,910
So you need to figure out how it works,

229
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,810
instead being all mouth and no trousers.

230
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,130
Well, Mr. Ji, please train me

231
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,730
like how you train professional players.

232
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,690
Sure. Our first lesson for today

233
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,680
is APM and reaction training.

234
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,270
Okay.

235
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:25,880
Five packets of dried mango slice.

236
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,450
Four boxes of pistachios.

237
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,860
-Pistachios.
-Strawberry jelly.

238
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,560
Hey, catch it.

239
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,810
Yesso scallops.

240
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,840
Five boxes of dried mango slices.
Hurry up.

241
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,550
-Coming.
-Quick.

242
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,920
One, two, three, four.

243
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,120
Every hero has
their strengths and weaknesses.

244
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,100
When you encounter a situation
beyond your capability,

245
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,630
you need teamwork.

246
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,430
Why do I feel like you're
messing with me, not teaching me?

247
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,290
Doesn't what I just said make sense?

248
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:13,310
Okay, you're Handsome Ji,
the Battlefield Trickster.

249
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,020
You're right about everything.

250
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,920
Two bottles of orange juice.

251
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,450
Your APM and reaction
were pretty good today.

252
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:32,030
Practice more. Next time, I'll take you
to a game of whack-a-mole.

253
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,460
Is it useful?

254
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,550
It should work for you.

255
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,680
Well, I'm home.

256
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:42,720
We'll say goodbye here.

257
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,730
Here, for you.

258
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,620
For me?

259
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,040
Don't you girls like having these snacks?

260
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,510
Just don't eat too much.
Otherwise, you will get fat easily.

261
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,110
Thank you. What do you like to eat?

262
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,630
I'll treat you to it next time.

263
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,300
I...

264
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,030
I like milk tea. Strawberry flavor.

265
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,890
Seriously? You're a grown man,
and into strawberry milk tea.

266
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,110
Your taste is so unique.

267
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,640
Believe it or not.

268
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,520
Anyway, thank you for today.

269
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,300
You are welcome.
Feel free to ask me any questions.

270
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,880
I'm a walking encyclopedia.

271
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,750
It's no use asking Pei Xi
who can only play solo.

272
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,140
Are you sure?

273
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,360
I remember,

274
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:29,060
during the Q&A section,

275
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,360
our Mr. Ji answered
all six questions wrongly.

276
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,670
-While Pei Xi...
-That was a misunderstanding, okay?

277
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,520
Well, to make it up to you,

278
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,970
I've had two invitations
for the closed beta test.

279
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,890
I hope you can attend it.

280
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,450
I will go cheer you on.

281
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,480
Like I said,

282
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,020
the cheer of my thousands of fangirls
is worth only 99 points.

283
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,930
The last point is with you.

284
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,090
Well, it's getting late.
Hurry and go upstairs.

285
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,180
Get home safe.

286
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,600
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

287
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,040
[My God.]

288
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,570
[Why is my heart beating so fast?]

289
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,560
[And my face is burning.]

290
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,300
[Don't imagine things.
Stop imagining things!]

291
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,550
[Qiu Ying, you need to calm down.]

292
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,960
[You have to calm down.]

293
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,840
Yi Yi.

294
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,160
Where did she go?

295
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,670
My goodness!

296
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,990
You gave me a scare!

297
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,230
Why are you sitting here?

298
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,010
I saw it all!

299
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,050
What did you see?

300
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,760
What do you think I saw?

301
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,740
Did he give you the flowers?

302
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,250
He's passing by.

303
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,630
Only you buy into it!

304
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,310
He meant well.

305
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,190
Well, I'm a pretty girl after all.

306
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,260
What if I ran into some pervert?

307
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,560
Right?

308
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,800
He looks like the most dangerous pervert!

309
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,990
Ji Xiang Kong gave me
two tickets for the closed beta test.

310
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,680
Would you like to come with me?

311
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,090
Are you trying to impress me
with such a little sugar-coated trick?

312
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,350
I'm telling you,

313
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,140
as long as I'm standing here
as the firewall, he can't take you down.

314
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,200
Miss Firewall.

315
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,360
This is a grand event in the industry.

316
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,950
Are you sure you're not coming?

317
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,400
No!

318
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,950
To deal with a playboy like him,

319
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,050
we must adhere to the Three Don'ts.

320
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,920
Don't respond to him. Don't take the bait.

321
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,320
Don't accept him.

322
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,730
Indeed. We have no use for these tickets.

323
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,380
You're in that "nursing home" after all.

324
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,070
For big news like this one,
you just need to copy and paste.

325
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,970
Where's the trash can?

326
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,140
I'll just throw them away.

327
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,760
Hey, wait a minute.

328
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,930
I just figured.

329
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,140
If I don't attend it,

330
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,150
it's likely that
Ji Xiang Kong will bother you.

331
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,240
No way. I have to go there for you.

332
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,920
Okay, don't be mad.

333
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,080
I am telling you,
I have yet to forgive you.

334
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,980
-Little angel.
-I'm not your little angel.

335
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,410
I bought you your favorite
dried mango slices.

336
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,620
You are a man of conscience after all.

337
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,720
You said you didn't want to come.

338
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,300
You've been trying to hold yourself back
since you entered here.

339
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,630
Now that I'm here,

340
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,100
I'll just take some pictures
to pass the time.

341
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,280
I'll go check out that section.

342
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:08,890
Lu Yi Yi.

343
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,910
Lin Yi Xuan?

344
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,410
What are you wearing?

345
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:18,130
You came to see my game.

346
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,340
Why didn't you dress up?

347
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,900
and put on a gown or the like?

348
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,970
I can wear whatever I want!
It's none of your business!

349
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:25,010
Besides, I came to watch the game,
not to see you!

350
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,410
Why are you so narcissistic?

351
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Mind your words. Show some respect.

352
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,680
I'm going to beat you up!

353
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,960
Don't! Stop!

354
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,500
I'm telling you, my fans are everywhere.

355
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,490
I have more people on my side.
Do you hear me?

356
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,710
I will not watch it!

357
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,720
No, you have to watch it.
I have a seat reserved for you.

358
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,970
Lu Yi Yi!

359
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,290
-Lu Yi Yi.
-Go away!

360
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,840
It's so happening.

361
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,830
They are quarrelsome lovers.

362
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,410
They'll be back in a minute.

363
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:51,070
By the way, don't forget
what you're here for today.

364
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,610
The board director of Li Mao,

365
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,900
the executives of GDV,

366
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,340
and Mr. Luo Tian.

367
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,670
The big names
in the industry are all here.

368
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,540
Aren't you going to
get acquainted with them?

369
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,500
I know nothing.

370
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,380
How can I talk to them?

371
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,950
First time strangers, second time friends.

372
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,570
Meet them often,
and you'll get to know them.

373
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,390
If I resort to this method,

374
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:17,500
others will label me as a nobody again.

375
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,330
I don't want that.

376
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,050
If so, are you worthy of
the invitation I gave you?

377
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,140
Thank you for the invitation.

378
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,370
But...

379
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,780
All right, I get it.

380
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,390
Do it at your own pace.

381
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,750
I'm going to get ready for the game.
Remember to cheer me on.

382
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,350
Of course. Go for it.

383
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:36,640
Go for it.

384
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,220
Where did Yi Yi go?

385
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,300
What's your relationship
with Ji Xiang Kong?

386
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,500
What?

387
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:55,150
I'm asking you,

388
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,080
what exactly is your relationship

389
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,880
with Ji Xiang Kong?

390
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,690
We...

391
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,520
We're just friends.

392
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,700
Why are you asking that?

393
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,010
Because I'm curious.

394
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,860
I'm a little nervous.

395
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,100
It's just a closed beta test.
What are you nervous about?

396
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,990
Can I not be nervous, huh?

397
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,540
This game will determine
whether you remain the captain or not.

398
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:41,400
Darn it. You're not worried, but I am.

399
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,800
Enough. Just take it easy.

400
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,200
-Don't be nervous.
-That's easy for you to say.

401
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,780
Brother Yao, what's on your mind?

402
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,010
You're not as nervous as
Lin Yi Xuan, are you?

403
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,560
No, I'm just not feeling well.

404
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,050
Have some water.

405
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,610
Why are you waiting for?
Do you want me to open it for you?

406
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
I'll help myself.

407
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,800
You're quite thirsty.

408
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,120
It's probably because
I didn't sleep well last night.

409
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,630
Well, I...

410
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,790
I'm going to the bathroom to wash my face.

411
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,170
I'll be fine after that.

412
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,160
Row 1, Seat 11.

413
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,470
Such a nice spot!

414
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,630
Did he...

415
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,520
arrange it specially for me?

416
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,080
The game will begin soon.

417
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,130
Perform well

418
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,830
and I won't do you wrong.

419
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,560
Good evening, everyone.
Welcome to the finals

420
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,070
of closed beta test for
the new version of iConquer.

421
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,930
I'm your host for tonight, Luo Tian.

422
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,070
Hello, everyone.
I'm your hostess for tonight, Qiu Ying.

423
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,620
Qiu Ying!

424
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,930
[Someday]

425
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,460
[I'll definitely be
standing on this stage.]

426
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,360
[Go for it!]

427
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,460
First of all,
I'd like to introduce to you all

428
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,830
the series of heroes by iConquer,

429
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,330
Xuan Tian Warriors!

430
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,390
Check them out.

431
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,780
Here are the five new heroes
designed by iConquer,

432
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,250
specifically for Chinese summoners.

433
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:57,840
Well, they are Yu Bang,

434
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,790
Xin, Zhi Heng, Jin Can,

435
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,460
and Gongxi Chang Qing.

436
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,240
Their attributes are made up of
the five elements of China.

437
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,290
They're shaped by the interaction between

438
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,150
metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

439
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:13,070
Indeed. The design is of Chinese style.

440
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:16,650
Also, their story is adapted from
the myth of Xuan Tian Warriors.

441
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,180
It's a unique creation
for our Chinese fans.

442
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,210
Yes, the Xuantian Warriors

443
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,370
will remain a great innovation
in the history of iConquer.

444
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,410
Today, both Legends and VNG

445
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,580
will bring us the first show
of Xuantian Warriors.

446
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,740
Everybody, are you looking forward to it?

447
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,890
Yes!

448
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,620
Well, without further ado,

449
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:47,300
let's bring out the two teams.

450
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,030
Please welcome Legends

451
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,240
and VNG.

452
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:28,010
All right, the finals of the
closed beta test for the new version

453
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,420
begins!

454
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,630
Please take your seats.

455
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,960
Go for it.

456
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,070
I just figured.

457
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,910
About 70% of them bet on Pei Xi's winning.

458
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,470
Of course.

459
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,240
Why?

460
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:10,630
Isn't Legends the runner-up
in the finals in Vancouver?

461
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,650
Legends isn't doing well without Gu Fang.

462
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,290
-Their cooperation is way too tacit!
-Awesome!

463
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,910
It's really a snap judgment.

464
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,860
Without mutual understanding
and absolute trust,

465
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,410
it's impossible to kill
such a strong Mid like Pei Xi.

466
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,210
Hey. Didn't you just say that

467
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,340
Legends wasn't doing well without Gu Fang?

468
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,330
Did I?

469
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,090
All right, Pei Xi was killed just now.

470
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,400
Now, VNG chose to

471
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,200
[dispel the fog to secretly
take down the Dragon.]

472
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,610
[But Legends' false eye
has seen them dispeling the fog.]

473
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,730
[They're ready for an ambush here.]

474
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,230
Let's see if they manage to
sneak down the Dragon.

475
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,190
The enemies are coming.

476
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,630
Here they are! They're fighting!

477
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,870
Wait. What's the matter with Huo Yao?

478
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,350
-[He didn't use the ultimate skill well!]
-[What a pity!]

479
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,860
What's wrong with Huo Yao?

480
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:15,300
Brother Kong. You guys should
retreat and defend for a bit.

481
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,630
Let's retreat first.
Stop fighting for now.

482
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,830
Step back.

483
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,000
Brother Yao, step back.

484
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,550
-What's wrong with you, Brother Yao?
-Okay, I'll step back.

485
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,590
Why is Legends playing so poorly today?

486
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,470
We are winning!

487
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:34,080
Yes!

488
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,250
Can we trade one?

489
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,740
We can't manage this team fight.

490
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,230
VNG has stormed

491
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,800
the final defensive tower of Legends!

492
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,650
It looks unstoppable.
They're going to take down the crystal!

493
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,040
Wait, Brother Yao.
What's wrong with you today?

494
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,480
Wake up.

495
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:05,130
It's the closed beta test. The final.

496
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,990
[Something's wrong with Huo Yao.]

497
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,950
Yi Xuan,
the second round is about to begin.

498
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,330
Cheer up.

499
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,710
Brother Yao, what got into you just now?

500
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,310
Why didn't you go up there, Brother Yao?

501
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,290
Brother Yao.

502
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,320
With our economic advantage,

503
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,690
we should've won the last round.

504
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,420
I'm sorry, guys.

505
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:53,200
I didn't sleep well last night.
Maybe I was too nervous

506
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,390
-[Something's wrong with Huo Yao.]
-during the last round.

507
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,480
I wasn't myself.

508
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,250
Well, please pull yourself up
for the next round.

509
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,550
If we lose again...

510
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,550
This is just
a closed beta test, Brother Yao.

511
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,330
Our opponent is VNG.

512
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:10,199
How many times have we won against them?

513
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,889
We've been teammates for long.
I've never seen you being nervous.

514
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
If we lose one more round,
Brother Kong will have to leave.

515
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,580
-Can you pull yourself together?
-Enough.

516
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,360
Now isn't the time to fight about it.

517
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,679
Brother Yao.

518
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,400
Quickly pick yourself up.

519
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:33,469
Fellow masters.

520
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,590
What are you guys doing here?

521
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,929
Can you play the game well?
Don't you want to win it?

522
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,670
Is there anything wrong?

523
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,060
Manager Zhao, don't worry.

524
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,000
What could possibly go wrong?

525
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,139
Huo Yao.

526
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,000
What are you nervous about?

527
00:34:58,250 --> 00:34:59,430
Is there anything wrong?

528
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,430
Nothing's wrong.

529
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,200
Take it easy. Play the game well.

530
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,060
We're counting on you for the next round.

531
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,670
Go for it, fellow masters!

532
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,440
Alright, the next round is about to begin.

533
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:18,690
Let's go.

534
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,330
Brother Yao.

535
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,260
Everything is alright.
We only lost one round.

536
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,250
We still have a chance
to win the next one.

537
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,270
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

538
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,920
It doesn't matter to me
if I remain the captain or not.

539
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,150
What's important is,

540
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:59,300
we get to fight alongside
with our brothers.

541
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,530
Don't worry, Captain.

542
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,770
I won't make any mistake

543
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,340
in the next round.

544
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,890
[We've been brothers
for more than two years.]

545
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,140
[I trust him.]

546
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,020
All right, the two teams
are now in the second round.

547
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,510
And now, the pick-ban session.

548
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,770
I wonder what heroes each team will choose

549
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,020
for this round.

550
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:34,780
-Yi Xuan, I'll get you Gongxi Chang Qing.
-Okay.

551
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:36,320
Let's take a look.

552
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:38,170
Legends chose

553
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,630
Gongxi Chang Qing.

554
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,770
They chose Gongxi Chang Qing. Darn it.

555
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:44,360
-I bet they got it for Lin Yi Xuan.
-Our Support was robbed.

556
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,180
That's a much powerful Support Champion.

557
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,890
We choose Jin Can.
