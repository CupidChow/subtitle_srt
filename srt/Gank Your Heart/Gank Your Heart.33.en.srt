Xiang Kong.

5
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,950
I'm here.

6
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,770
Xiang Kong.

7
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,700
You're back.

8
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,589
I'm okay.

9
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,770
Go to bed first.

10
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,550
Sister Ying.

11
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,620
You better go to bed first.

12
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:30,990
Or you'll get cold.

13
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,080
I'm okay. Go to bed first.

14
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,520
Sister Ying.

15
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,770
Ji Xiang Kong is unfair to you.

16
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,690
You're his girlfriend.

17
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,550
Why does he take care of others

18
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,470
and let you alone?

19
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,800
Mi Ya was once injured

20
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,470
because of him.

21
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,150
If that hadn't happened,

22
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,390
Mi Ya wouldn't go blind.

23
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,830
Xiang Kong feels guilty.

24
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,630
So he takes care of her.

25
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,290
And Mi Ya has no family member.

26
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,850
They grew up together.

27
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,280
Xiang Kong is the closest person to her.

28
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,390
How about the future?

29
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,740
If she can't get recovered,

30
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,480
will he take care of her

31
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,810
all his life?

32
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,820
It won't happen.

33
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,770
She'll get recovered.

34
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,050
You'd better go to bed.

35
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,590
There's training tomorrow.

36
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,130
We've been training for a few days.

37
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:32,970
Without him,

38
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,360
we can't even play a game.

39
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,030
Don't worry.

40
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,560
Pei Xi told me that

41
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,909
Sister Wen will come over tomorrow

42
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,360
and train with you.

43
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,500
Sister Ying, I don't want you to suffer.

44
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,390
Fool.

45
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,650
I won't get suffered.

46
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,590
You go to bed first.

47
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,810
I'll go to bed as well.

48
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:04,970
Go upstairs first.

49
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,820
Take a rest earlier.

50
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,310
[Mi Ya is emotionally unstable.]

51
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,320

[Go to bed early.]

54
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,780
Are you tired?

55
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,640
Thank you for visiting me.

56
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,560
How's your preparation for the game?

57
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,409
This year, the teams from
the North American division

58
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,260
are particularly strong.

59
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,090
Especially Tatan.

60
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,310
So I made two episodes

61
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:38,280
of their review videos.

62
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,480
Do you have a good rest recently?

63
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:42,730
Why do you look terrible?

64
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,680
I'm busy these days.

65
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,680
So I'm a bit tired.

66
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,970
By the way,

67
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,170
The leak of tactics

68
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,470
has been found out.

69
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,960
Really?

70
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,240
What's going on exactly?

71
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,510
It has nothing to do with you.

72
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,040
It's the scheme of Qiao Xin and Qi Yue.

73
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,710
After this,

74
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,790
the organizing committee will
release an official statement.

75
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,050
Qiao Xin

76
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,340
has been fired by GDV.

77
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,890
Qi Yue was banned

78
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,640
for a year.

79
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,040
Thank you so much, Mr. Luo.

80
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,250
If it

81
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,310
wasn't for you,

82
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,770
it can't be found out.

83
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,410
I don't know

84
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,470
how much longer

85
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,550
I'd get the blame.

86
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,690
It's what I should do.

87
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:29,380
Oh, right.

88
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,430
I have

89
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,570
a better news.

90
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,010
I reached an agreement with Chairman Guo.

91
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:34,740
If you want,

92
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,679
you can be the Chinese commentator

93
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,049
to attend

94
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:40,370
International iConquer Championship
with me.

95
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,150
I know

96
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,170
Phoenix needs you too.

97
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,880
You don't have to answer me right now.

98
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,470
The commentary group will set out
next week.

99
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:54,290
You can talk it over

100
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,050
with Ji Xiang Kong.

101
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,830
Of course, as your partner,

102
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,550
I'd like you to

103
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,290
attend International iConquer Championship

104
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,610
as a commentator

105
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,950
with me.

106
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:05,950
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

107
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,930
I will think about it seriously.

108
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,040
Mr. Luo.

109
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,490
Why are you here?

110
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,870
I'm here to apologize to you.

111
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:42,350
Mr. Luo.

112
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,690
I know I made a lot of mistakes.

113
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,420
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,340
You shouldn't say sorry to me.

115
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,990
You should say it to Qiu Ying, VNG

116
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,230
and all

117
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,940
the diligent colleagues of GDV.

118
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,590
I'll apologize to them

119
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,400
and beg for their forgiveness.

120
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,470
Mr. Luo.

121
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,530
I beg you to give me another chance.

122
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,720
Please help me, okay?

123
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,730
I can be the intern.

124
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,780
Mr. Luo.

125
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,800
I promise I'll work hard.

126
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,390
I'll do well

127
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,750
at work.

128
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,850
It's the decision of
the organizing committee.

129
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,150
I can't help you.

130
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,030
Mr. Luo, I know it's my fault.

131
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,190
I was too stupid before.

132
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,890
I envy Qiu Ying.

133
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,140
I'm jealous that she's
outstanding than me.

134
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm jealous that everyone likes her.

135
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,790
I'm jealous that she owns

136
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,420
many things I don't have.

137
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,440
Qiao Xin.

138
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,360
You're the runner-up of Rising Star.

139
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,190
You have great talent

140
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,890
and abilities than others.

141
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,440
You could be a good commentator.

142
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,690
If you want to compare,

143
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,810
Qiu Ying works harder than you.

144
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,110
She knows how to appreciate

145
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,590
and has both feet on the ground.

146
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,690
Qiao Xin.

147
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
Don't compare with others.

148
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,240
It's most important

149
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,410
to focus on your own way.

150
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,090
Reflect yourself.

151
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,270
How is it?

152
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,060
Did Luo Tian agree to let you back?

153
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,040
Since he disagreed,

154
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,850
tonight I'll have dinner

155
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,210
with Chairman Guo.

156
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:12,800
You go back and dress up.

157
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,330
Say some words

158
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,260
to amuse him.

159
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,610
It's useless.

160
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,820
It's the decision of
the organizing committee.

161
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,280
GDV will not hire me again.

162
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:27,820
But

163
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,890
I made a lot of efforts

164
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:29,960
to let you work in GDV.

165
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,580
We can't just let it be.

166
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,230
How about this?

167
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,340
Let's put the blame

168
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,560
on Qi Yue.

169
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,140
Qi Yue?

170
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,910
He has already been

171
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,690
hated by everyone.

172
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,980
You can say it's his idea.

173
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,770
It can help you to regain your popularity.

174
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,090
Mr. Liu.

175
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,560
How can you let me

176
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,710
to deal with him

177
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,590
by this dirty trick?

178
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,670
Qi Yue is my boyfriend.

179
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,300
Qi Yue is your boyfriend?

180
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,780
I advise you

181
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,120
to break up with him right away.

182
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,940
I won't break up with him.

183
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,370
Are you silly?

184
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,710
Yes, I'm silly.

185
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm the top host of You Xing Video.

186
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm the runner-up of Rising Star.

187
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:21,480
I could have

188
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,890
stepped on the stage

189
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,260
by my strength.

190
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,940
Are you blaming me?

191
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,220
I have no right to blame anyone.

192
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,950
I deserve it.

193
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,730
From now on,

194
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,250
I won't compare myself with anyone.

195
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,630
And I won't use

196
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,670
such dirty tricks

197
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,940
to set others up.

198
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,690
Qiao Xin.

199
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,470
Qiao Xin!

200
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,270
You're

201
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,700
cultivated by me.

202
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,510
If there's no help from You Xing Video,

203
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,000
you can't work at GDV.

204
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,280
You're still bound to You Xing Video.

205
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,150
If you don't follow me,

206
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:08,680
you'll have no future.

207
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,230
I hope she would cry

208
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,370
to get all the emotion out.

209
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,900
Her silence

210
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,390
makes me worry.

211
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,570
Sometimes, I'd think

212
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,370
it's so unfair to her.

213
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,260
She has no love,

214
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,240
no career

215
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,990
and is injured now.

216
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,140
I can't imagine

217
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,040
the future life of Mi Ya.

218
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,270
Xiang Kong.

219
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:01,860
The only thing

220
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,320
we can do

221
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,560
is help Mi Ya to recover soon.

222
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,670
And what she needs most

223
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,840
is you keep her company.

224
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:14,420
I know.

225
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,010
I'll accompany her more.

226
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:28,800
Karen.

227
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:32,450
Karen, my phone is ringing.

228
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,790
Karen.

229
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,880
♫ There're so many regrets in the world ♫

230
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,280
♫ Are there you and I? ♫

231
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,840
♫ Still waiting for you ♫

232
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:17,380
Karen, where are you?

233
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,920
♫ Even the new me ♫

234
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
♫ Miss your glance ♫

235
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,240
♫ The passing time is just ♫

236
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:35,880
♫ An abandoned corner ♫

237
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,800
♫ In the end, I lost you ♫

238
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,280
♫ In the meaningless whirlpools ♫

239
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:48,200
♫ The story that's gone forever ♫

240
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,480
♫ Was mocking me at the moment ♫

241
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,680
♫ How about you keep quiet
and listen to me ♫

242
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,840
♫ I won't be sad anymore ♫

243
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,800
♫ I won't pretend ♫

244
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,980
Karen!

245
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,339
Mi Ya, why do you sit on the floor?

246
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,410
Don't go around as you can't see.

247
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,250
Stand up.

248
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,819
Let go of me! Leave me alone!

249
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,220
I don't need your sympathy.

250
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,599
Ji Xiang Kong, get lost!

251
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,400
-Calm down.
-Go away!

252
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,300
I can't leave you like this.

253
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:20,490
I don't need your sympathy.

254
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,550
Mi Ya.

255
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,119
Leave me alone.

256
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,240
Xiang Kong.

257
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,680
What should I do?

258
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,750
You were with me when I couldn't see

259
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,150
last time.

260
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,920
I was not afraid at all.

261
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,120
But now,

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,610
I have nothing.

263
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,930
Mi Ya.

264
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,030
I'm here.

265
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,050
Before you recover,

266
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,760
I'll take care of you.

267
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,490
If I were blind for life,

268
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,860
would you still accompany me

269
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,540
all your life?

270
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,760
Would you

271
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,610
accompany me for life?

272
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,110
-You're back, Qiu Ying.
-Sister Wen.

273
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,000
Qiu Ying, please come in.

274
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,130
There's good news for you.

275
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,270
I'll buy groceries with Sister Wen

276
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,140
and make your favorite dishes

277
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,740
to celebrate for you.

278
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,000
Thank you, Brother Sun.
Thank you, Sister Wen.

279
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,300
Why are you being so polite?

280
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,280
Let's come in.

281
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,030
Hurry up.

282
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,850
We'll be back soon.

283
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,230
Kung Fu dog.

284
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,320
Don't you think you look like him?

285
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,600
It's not as good-looking as me.

286
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,720
Why are you so narcissistic?

287
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:13,750
-Qiu Ying.
-Sister Ying.

288
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,240
You're back.

289
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,460
I've got good news.

290
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,250
Today,

291
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,060
The organizing committee of iConquer

292
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,200
released a statement.

293
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,080
The leak of tactics

294
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,240
has been found out.

295
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,550
It's the scheme of Qiao Xin and Qi Yue.

296
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,790
Are you happy?

297
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,130
Oh, right.

298
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,760
GDV also apologized to you.

299
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,210
Journalist Lu said

300
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,760
it'll be the headline tomorrow

301
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,410
to tell everyone.

302
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,450
What's wrong with you?

303
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,310
That's good news.

304
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,000
Why do you have

305
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,710
no response?

306
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,240
No.

307
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,390
Luo Tian has told me before.

308
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,440
Well.

309
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,010
Brother Sun and Sister Wen
went to buy groceries.

310
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,730
Brother Sun is the chef today.

311
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,540
We can have a big meal.

312
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,570
Brother Sun cooks the braised ribs.

313
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,690
I'll call Brother Kong to come back.

314
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,290
I'm going to get changed.

315
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,420
Lin Yi Xuan.

316
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,180
-You...
-I didn't do it on purpose.

317
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,500
Pei Xi, what are you doing?

318
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,300
Get up!

319
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,250
Ouch, it hurts.

320
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,470
What's with your information work?

321
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,880
What happened to

322
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:37,810
Qiu Ying and Ji Xiang Kong?

323
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,650
Since Mi Ya was admitted to the hospital,

324
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,050
Brother Kong never came back
in the morning.

325
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,530
He always comes back at midnight.

326
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,720
Let alone us.

327
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:47,490
Qiu Ying

328
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,810
can't even talk with him.

329
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,580
Ji Xiang Kong.

330
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,940
I'll check on her.

331
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,670
Would you

332
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,330
accompany me for life?

333
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,910
Qiu Ying, it's me.

334
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,520
I'm coming in.

335
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,830
Qiu Ying, are you okay?

336
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,120
You have something in your mind.

337
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,080
Why don't you talk to me?

338
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,220
You're so busy.

339
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,750
I don't want to trouble you.

340
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,930
I'm not busy.

341
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,350
No one would notice

342
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,300
even if

343
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,820
I don't go to work for a few days.

344
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,300
Yi Yi.

345
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,880
I want to tell you something.

346
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,550
What is it?

347
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,420
Luo Tian

348
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,850
wants me to go back to GDV

349
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,700
and comment on the world finals with him.

350
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:44,880
Really?

351
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,460
You can be the Chinese commentator?

352
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,150
With Luo Tian.

353
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,800
That's great! Qiu Ying.

354
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,350
You luck has turned.

355
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:01,460
Wait.

356
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,530
But

357
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:04,990
If you leave,

358
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,550
what about Phoenix?

359
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,960
Who would be the team lead?

360
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,610
Actually, Phoenix can run

361
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,780
without me.

362
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,510
If Xiang Kong can't solve the troubles,

363
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,910
Pei Xi and Brother Sun can help as well.

364
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,850
Pei Xi? Did I hear it wrongly?

365
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,650
Pei Xi

366
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:31,470
is not the one

367
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,080
he used to be.

368
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,370
If Xiang Kong left,

369
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,280
Pei Xi could be the captain.

370
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,320
Actually,

371
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:48,080
Phoenix doesn't need me now.

372
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:55,700
Qiu Ying, tell me the truth.

373
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,230
What happened

374
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,560
between you and Ji Xiang Kong?

375
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,390
Did Ji Xiang Kong and Mi Ya

376
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,710
rekindle their love?

377
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,500
Yi Yi, don't think too much.

378
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,420
Phoenix has reached to this phase.

379
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,690
I think I've finished my task.

380
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,080
It's time for me

381
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,380
to return to my dream stage.

382
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,760
I've never dated with anyone.

383
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,720
But now

384
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,160
I can understand

385
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:39,370
your feeling.

386
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:42,780
It's not good

387
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,920
for three of you.

388
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,130
But

389
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,230
whatever you decide to do,

390
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,710
I'll support you.

391
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,680
Thank you, Yi Yi.

392
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,470
Come here.

393
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,410
My Ying is the best.

394
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,740
Be happy.

395
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,300
I'll always accompany you.

396
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,000
Brother Kong.

397
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,010
Did you just come back?

398
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,090
Where are the others?

399
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,080
How did I sleep here?

400
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,250
We celebrated

401
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,250
for Qiu Ying last night.

402
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,090
And we all slept late.

403
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:42,830
Celebrate for what?

404
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,300
Don't you know?

405
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,340
The leak of the tactics

406
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,200
has been found out.

407
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,750
GDV

408
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,410
and iConquer organizing committee

409
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,670
both apologized to Qiu Ying.

410
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,490
Why didn't you

411
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,160
tell me?

412
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,950
I thought you knew it.

413
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,100
I must criticize you.

414
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:14,920
You're really too much these days.

415
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,550
You don't even care about Qiu Ying.

416
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,230
Look. How good she is.

417
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,230
It's early in the morning.

418
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,330
And yet she already prepared
the breakfast.

419
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:29,900
This...

420
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,290
Why does everyone have one?

421
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:37,960
What is it?

422
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:46,070
What's happened?

423
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,020
Where is she?

424
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,560
Where is she?

425
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,410
I don't know.

426
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,060
She was here

427
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,370
last night.

428
00:26:58,930 --> 00:26:59,850
What's wrong, Xuan?

429
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,880
Have you met Qiu Ying?

430
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,730
No. Xiang Kong is back?

431
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,700
It's impossible.

432
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,400
You stayed up later than me.

433
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,050
Right, she was here last night.

434
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,270
Well.

435
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:20,640
Brother Kong.

436
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,750
Where's my sister?

437
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,850
When did Xiang Kong come back?

438
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,930
What is it?

439
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Xia Ling. Pei Xi.

440
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,450
Come over here.

441
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,000
Qiu Ying has left.

442
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,110
And she left a letter for each of us.

443
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,950
It's Pei Xi's.

444

[Brother Sun.]

[If you don't hurry up,]

[I'd like to confess on behalf of you.]

456

[Pei Xi, please look around.]

Without any notice.

say goodbye face to face.

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,420
♫ But the world is too crowded ♫

519
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:49,220
♫ Perhaps the only choice is to leave ♫

520
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,890
♫ I just want to feel secure ♫

521
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,820
♫ I just want us ♫

522
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,020
♫ To stare into each other's eyes ♫

523
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,610
♫ Because it's you ♫

524

♫ I'll hug tightly no matter

525
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:11,920
[I believe you'll]

[reach the top of the world.]

527

528
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,940
[to the whole world that]

529
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,380
[our Chinese team]

00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,650
[I promise you.]

532
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,240

♫ I just want to feel secure ♫

534
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,540

♫ So that it worths this love ♫

537
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,200
Hello, here's your coffee.

538
00:32:58,910 --> 00:32:59,690
Why do you come alone today?

539
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,360
Where's your girlfriend?

540
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,750
Well.

541
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,820
You're going to leave.

542
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,710
Ji Xiang Kong hasn't contacted you

543
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:32,780
till now.

544
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,310
Such a jerk.

545
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,420
Does he really

546
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,630
want to take care of Mi Ya all his life?

547
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,300
All right.

548
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,350
He's just doing the thing

549
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,000
he should be doing.

550
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,080
I'm going to leave later.

551
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:54,500
Take care of yourself.

552
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,030
Go to bed early every day.

553
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,260
Don't worry about me.

554
00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:02,280
Okay.

555
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,730
As the car is arriving soon,

556
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,530
I'll see you off.

557
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,480
I'm going upstairs to get changed.

558
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:07,900
Go ahead.

559
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,350
[Take good care of yourself.]

560
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,860
[You too.]

561
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,880
Good morning.

562
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:13,580
Good morning.

563
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,240
Good morning, Brother Sun.

564
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,190
Let's have breakfast.

565
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
Good morning, Xuan.

566
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,010
I'll wake him up. You eat first.

567
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,290
Get up and have breakfast.

568
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:39,270
Hurry up and eat.

569
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,870
Who snored last night?

570
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,670
I couldn't sleep till midnight.

571
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:44,070
Was it you, Brother Sun?

572
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,530
It's not me for sure.

573
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,650
Don't lie.

574
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,630
The aged always snore.

575
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:48,290
I know it.

576
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,090
The breakfast is great.

577
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,990
You're here, Sister Wen.

578
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,720
How nice.

579
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,030
It seems that you can have a good life

580
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,090
by yourselves.

581
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:00,820
Did Pei Xi make it?

582
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,310
Brother Sun made it with me.

583
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,010
From now on,

584
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,340
you can focus on the training.

585
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,140
I'll take care of

586
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,390
things like preparing breakfast.

587
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,390
Great.

588
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,160
Sister Wen, are you going to

589
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,790
be our team lead?

590
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,820
Why? You don't welcome me?

591
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,250
No.

592
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,320
We welcome you.

593
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,060
By the way, Qiu Ying

594
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,080
told me all the bad habits

595
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:37,990
of you and Xia Ling.

596
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,790
No. How could it be?

597
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,810
-We're obedient.
-Right.

598
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:42,780
We're doomed.

599
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,560
She's way stricter.

600
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,310
Sister Wen, Xuan said that you...

601
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,740
We welcome you very much.

602
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,620
Cut the crap.

603
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,250
There're three more minutes

604
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:51,810
to have breakfast.

605
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,710
We'll begin our training at 8 o'clock.

606
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,970
Copy that.

607
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,040
It's the stadium of the finals.

608
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:11,720
Good job.

609
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,710
It's our commentary stage.

610
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,010
It's cool.

611
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:20,620
It's nice, right?

612
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,940
Imagine it.

613
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:27,770
From this angle,

614
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,340
we can see all the audience

615
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,140
cheering.

616
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,540
It changed a lot

617
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,130
in just one year.

618
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:37,460
A year ago,

619
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,170
I was

620
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,970
only a new commentator of You Xing.

621
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,820
I only commented on
a few rounds of iConquer.

622
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,630
Then I went live in the finals.

623
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:46,950
Who would expect that

624
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,050
the girl

625
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,800
who was once mocked by everyone

626
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
is the commentator

627
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,050
of the world finals?

628
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,030
To be honest,

629
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:57,270
you were my idol back then.

630
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,330
Then

631
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:00,800
why did you become my partner now?

632
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,490
Because I work hard.

633
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,220
Tomorrow

634
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,230
we'll be in the preparation phase
officially.

635
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,720
Why?

636
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,160
You're afraid I'll drag you down?

637
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,220
You're no longer the one

638
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,740
who sent me the review video

639
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,870
in a rainy day.

640
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:18,650
Now you

641
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,380
have an excellent understanding

642
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,270
of iConquer.

643
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,920
Especially

644
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,870
the review video that you sent
when you were the team lead.

645
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,990
It was amazing.

646
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,080
I've heard about the matter

647
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,070
between you and Xiang Kong.

648
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,950
If you want to talk to someone,

649
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,120
I can be your loyal listener.

650
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,130
It's strange.

651
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,170
I'm not sad as I should be.

652
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,470
Knowing him

653
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,740
is the most wonderful thing

654
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,670
in my life.

655
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,170
He started the journey to my dream

656
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,250
and let me see more beautiful views.

657
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,220
He gave me the courage

658
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,500
to climb the higher mountain.

659
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,690
Let's go. I'll show you around.

660
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,580
Why are you listening to this again?

661
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,740
I want to know more about Xiang Kong.

662
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:57,990
As if

663
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,620
he's by my side.

664
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,870
Alright, have a rest. Stop listening.

665
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:06,410
You're able to see?

666
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,030
Hold on.

667
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,050
I'll call the doctor.

668
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:12,830
Tony.

669
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,730
Can you

670
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,720
keep it a secret for now?

671
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,380
What are you thinking? Have a drink.

672
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,530
Luo Tian called me this afternoon.

673
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:51,140
He said that he and Qiu Ying
have checked in

674
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,000
the hotel arranged by the organizer.

675
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,910
It's good then.

676
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,120
Mi Ya and Qiu Ying.

677
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:05,400
One is responsibility.

678
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,500
One is love.

679
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:08,830
It's hard to choose one.

680
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,380
Qiu Ying decided to leave.

681
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,550
She wants to give you enough space.

682
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,530
So that you won't be stressed

683
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,280
when joining the game.

684
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,520
I know.

685
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,020
But I'm not

686
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,100
as puzzled as she thought.

687
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,330
So I wanted to stop her

688
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:36,530
yesterday

689
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,820
and tell her that

690
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,770
I keep my promise.

691
00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:42,050
I just want to hold her hand

692
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,680
to reach the top of the world together.

693
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:46,110
Before I handled

694
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,000
the things of Mi Ya,

695
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:49,540
I don't want my promise

696
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,650
to burden her.

697
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,350
I don't want her to give up her dream

698
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,620
because of me.

699
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,150
Both of you

700
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,400
think too much

701
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,050
and consider each other too much.

702
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,030
I remind you

703
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,510
not to be like the old me.

704
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:10,080
Keep everything to yourself.

705
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,720
And be separated with the beloved

706
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,850
for a long time.

707
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:16,130
I won't.

708
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:17,940
I'll handle everything

709
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,650
well.

710
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,020
And I'll not give up on her.

711
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,100
I trust you. Cheers.

712
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:32,230
Doctor.

713
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:33,670
How's Mi Ya now?

714
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,200
I checked on her this morning.

715
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,280
The blood clot on her head

716
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,250
dissolved a lot.

717
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,480
What about her eyes?

718
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,250
Although the blood clot dissolved,

719
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,770
her clinical symptoms haven't disappeared.

720
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:46,730
There are two reasons.

721
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:48,230
What are they?

722
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,850
One is the psychological factor.

723
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:52,800
This condition will disappear

724
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,080
after some time.

725
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,710
Another is

726
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,930
she suffered

727
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:58,280
permanent damage to the optic nerve.

728
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,350
Do you mean that

729
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:02,300
she can't recover again?

730
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:41,930
Why don't you call the nurse?

731
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,930
Xiang Kong.

732
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:57,610
Thank you.

733
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:01,850
I'm busy training lately.

734
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,020
So I have no time to see you.

735
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,400
It's okay. Your game is more important.

736
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:08,910
When

737
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,310
will the game begin?

738
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,640
Tomorrow afternoon.

739
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:14,660
I want to

740
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:16,600
watch you play the game on the spot.

741
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:20,700
Sure, after you get recovered.

742
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,010
Actually,

743
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,150
I can go right now.

744
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,800
Even if I only listen to it off the stage.

745
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,200
I want to see

746
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,280
the moment you win the champion.

747
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,330
I'll invite you

748
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:34,700
after I proceeded to the finals.

749
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:36,900
Really?

750
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,420
All right.

751
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,270
I heard from Tony that

752
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:56,970
the leak of tactics

753
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,180
has been found out.

754
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,850
Qiu Ying is back to GDV.

755
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:09,860
She is the Chinese commentator

756
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,750
of the world finals.

757
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:17,730
Did Qiu Ying leave Phoenix

758
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:20,770
because of me?

759
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,560
Commentary

760
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,290
has always been her dream.

761
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,760
Don't think too much.

762
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:38,410
Xiang Kong, you're so busy.

763
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:39,730
You don't

764
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:41,030
need to visit me actually.

765
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:44,610
It's not your fault that I went blind.

766
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:47,910
You don't have to blame yourself.

767
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:57,910
Mi Ya.

768
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,380
I'll take care of you

769
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:01,590
before you recover.

770
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:16,500
Thank you, Xiang Kong.

771
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,380
If it wasn't for you,

772
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,530
I don't know what to do.
