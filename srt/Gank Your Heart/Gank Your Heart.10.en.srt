4
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,759
Where are you going? Slow down.

5
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,600
-Slow down, okay?
-I can't hold it well.

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,990
Come, on your feet.
I'll get you home, okay?

7
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,620
Don't touch me! I'm hurt!

8
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,630
Are you aware that it hurts so bad?

9
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:56,390
It's not me...

10
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,920
-It's you.
-I'm sorry. Come, on your feet.

11
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,820
-No! I'm not doing that!
-Come, let's go home.

12
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,300
No, I don't have a home!
How can I go home?

13
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,720
I can go home by myself.

14
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,930
Can you manage that? Up we go!

15
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,290
Don't touch me! I'm a poor girl!

Let me down!

17
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,120
You're so drunk. How can I let you down?

18
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,890
You rascal! Why are you carrying me?

19
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,660
Get down!

20
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,280
You want me to get down?

21
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,490
Well, it's you who should get down.

22
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,390
I'll bite you if you don't let me down.

23
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,350
Don't do that. It hurts!

Did I get drunk?

52

Thank God you remember it.

53
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,190
How did you get home?

54
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,850
I carried her back here.

55
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,200
-Where's your motorcycle?
-I parked it on the street.

56
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,810
I'll go reclaim it later.

57
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,040
You abandoned your motorcycle
and carried her home.

58
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,520
Cool.

59
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,970
Get back to your room and sleep.

60
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,330

Don't worry.

64

I'm not interested in a drunkard.

65

Your phone was dead yesterday.

Thank you.

68

I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

Sure.

75
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,730
See you later.

76

-Brother Kong.
-Why are you in here? Get out!

77
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,100
-I heard it last night. Did you...
-What did you hear?

78
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,600
-Get out!
-Wait!

79
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:38,100
-Long time no see.
-Long time no see.

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,620
Take a seat.

81
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,310
Have you made up your mind?

82
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,270
Indeed.

83
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
I shall negotiate about

84
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,720
the issue of Ms Qiu Ying invasion of
Mr. Ji Xiang Kong's privacy

85
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,200
and personal reputation

86
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,650
on behalf of my client.

87
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,140
My client is willing to accept
reasonable compensation.

88
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,670
What do you it's the appropriate amount?

89
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,050
Just say it.

90
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,450
One million. It's not too much, isn't it?

91
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,780
-One million?
-One million?

92
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,310
What?

93
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,720
Isn't my reputation worth a million yuan?

94
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,510
One million?

95
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,770
You are blackmailing us!

96
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,190
Watch your words.
The two lawyers are sitting here.

97
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,180
Calm down. It's okay.

98
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,789
Well,

99
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,429
is there room for negotiation?

100
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,210
Considering Ms Qiu Ying's
financial situation,

101
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,090
my client has had the utmost concession.

102
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,460
[The compensation fee
is reduced to 0 yuan.]

103
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,910
Ji Xiang Kong.

104
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,210
Thank you.

105
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,660
How do you thank me?

106
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:24,930
Hey, don't ever say
you want to be my girlfriend.

107
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:26,590
Otherwise, I'd say yes.

108
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,140
Hey.

109
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,860
Mr. Chen is still nearby.

110
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,090
You're harassing her. Got it?

111
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,740
No matter why,

112
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,470
I still want to thank you.

113
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,460
Don't mention it.

114
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,880
I'm just making life easier for myself.

115
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:43,840
Oh, right.

116
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,510
Here's a piece of advice for you.

117
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,290
Cut back on drinking.

118
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,250
It's really scary when you're drunk.

119
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,960
You become a chatterbox.

120
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,740
What did I say?

121
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,680
You said all the things that should've
and shouldn't have said.

122
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,700
Take your time to recall them.
I'm taking off.

123
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,720
Things that should've
and shouldn't have said?

124
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,790
What on earth did I say?

125
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,720
I don't care what you said.

126
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,990
But have you forgotten what you told me?

127
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,980
Don't play dumb with me!

128
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,680
You were drinking with him last night!

129
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,130
And you lied about
drinking with your friends!

130
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,310
Isn't he my friend?

131
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,510
You...

132
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,000
Right?

133
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
You tricked me!
Qiu Ying, stop right there!

134
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,780
This isn't over!

135
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,370
Yi Yi, this shop sells tasty snacks.

136
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,230
Come, I'll buy you some.

137
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,630
Don't be mad.

138
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,430
Welcome to Bestore.

139
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,910
Wow! We can buy snacks
from here in the future.

140
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,190
Hey, tell me the truth.

141
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,310
What on earth did you do yesterday?

142
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,680
Come clean to me
or I'll teach you a lesson.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,540
Don't worry. We didn't do anything.

144
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,760
You didn't do anything?

145
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,120
Then why did he bury
the hatchet so easily today?

146
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,370
You can't fool me.

147
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,840
I find it strange, too.

148
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,810
Why did he help me all of a sudden?

149
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,760
Yet, we really didn't do anything.

150
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,520
I was just drunk.

151
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,180
How dare you drink so much!

152
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,580
You...

153
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,000
Yi Yi, this scallop looks delicious.

154
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,430
Don't change the subject.

155
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,410
Tell me. Did he force you to drink?

156
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,210
No, that's not the case.

157
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,620
Then why do you drink so much?

158
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,150
Aren't you aware of
your alcohol tolerance?

159
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,650
What if you've had too much to drink

160
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,850
and something happened?

161
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,060
I was in a foul mood.

162
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:38,790
That's why I drank.

163
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,100
I didn't expect to drink that much.

164
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,700
Even if you're in a bad mood,

165
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,760
you shouldn't have asked him
to drink with you.

166
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,160
You could've asked me to drink with you.

167
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,220
You really pissed me off.

168
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,250
Okay, I'll buy you more delicious snacks.

169
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,840
Don't be mad.

170
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,050
I begged Jeffrey
to set the record straight!

171
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,500
But he

172
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,230
immediately made up with the hostess!

173
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,020
The sponsors are asking me
for an explanation.

174
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,890
How do I explain that?
How can I explain that?

175
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,230
I don't want to be a manager anymore.

176
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,330
I quit!

177
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,790
What's the matter, Mr. Jin?

178
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,300
Are you aware that Ji Xiang Kong
and Qiu Ying reconciled?

179
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,530
They reconciled? When did that happen?

180
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,560
What are you saying?
It happened yesterday!

181
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,600
If you don't believe me,
you can ask Mr. Zhou!

182
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,220
Where is Ji Xiang Kong?
Ask him to come over.

183
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,120
-We're terminating the contract!
-Mr. Jin.

184
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,230
Mr. Jin, calm down first.

185
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,240
I'm sure he has his reasons for doing so.

186
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,600
Listen here, stop defending him!

187
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,630
President Bai is furious about it!

188
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,230
There's no way out of this
if we don't terminate his contract!

189
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,750
If we don't solve this problem,

190
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,910
our team's image will be
irreparably damaged.

191
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,990
Pushing a team member out
when something goes wrong?

192
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,240
That's not how we do things!

193
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,210
It's obviously a cover-up.

194
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,840
Someone's trying to sully
Ji Xiang Kong and Legends's good name.

195
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,230
If you were to terminate
his contract without evidence,

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,660
other players would be very disappointed!

197
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,390
Mr. Jin.

198
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,860
If we don't terminate his contract,

199
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,720
how do we explain to the sponsors?

200
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,750
Which party is more important, huh?

201
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,420
Zhao Yang,
have you contacted Jeffery or not?

202
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,240
Of course I have!

203
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,840
But Jeffery ignored me!

204
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,030
What can I do?

205
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,100
What we need to do now
is to contact Jeffery.

206
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,820
If he's willing to clear things up,

207
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,750
the problem will be solved!

208
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,320
Zhao Yang.
If you really care about the team,

209
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,280
you should contact him right away,

210
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,180
instead of sitting in the office

211
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,670
and sowing discord!

212
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,210
-What are you saying?
-I'm talking about you!

213
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,580
Who is sowing discord here?

214
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,380
Enough!

215
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,020
We will hold a press conference on Monday.

216
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,600
If the problem is not solved,

217
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,490
we will announce his contract termination
during the press conference!

218
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,770
-Have you got through to him?
-No.

219
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,440
-Hello.
-Brother Kong.

220
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,650
Have you met Jeffery?

221
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,270
Not yet. That could be
some wrong information.

222
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,160
Perhaps he's not staying in this hotel.

223
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,430
Zhao Yang complained about you
in front of Mr. Jin.

224
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,640
Give it to me.

225
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,170
Coach Luo wants to have a word with you.

226
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,460
It's such a serious matter.
Why did you make up with her

227
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,580
without asking me?

228
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,780
Coach. Qiu Ying didn't upload that video.

229
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,590
Do you have any proof?

230
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,360
I don't have any yet. But...

231
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,570
[Since there's no evidence,]

232
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:37,340
why did you take it upon yourself
and make peace with her?

233
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,820
[You're acquiescing in
your rumoured relationship with her.]

234
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:42,170
Zhao Yang can
get you off the team for that.

235
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,380
Do you know that?

236
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:46,260
[Coach, Qiu Ying is innocent.]

237
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,340
[She lost her job and sold her house.]

238
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,940
Zhao Yang would ruin her life.

239
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,050
I can't just sacrifice the innocent

240
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,710
[for my own interests.]

241
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,080
Looks like you'd made up your mind
before the reconciliation.

242
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,560
There's nothing else I can say.

243
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,780
No.

244
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,180
Brother Kong.

245
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,120
Mr. Jin was going to fire you today.

246
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,220
Coach Luo has had
a big fight with Mr. Jin.

247
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,590
And Mr. Jin promised
to give you two more days.

248
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,520
Don't you talk like that.

249
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,170
Sorry, Coach.
I've caused you so much trouble.

250
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,620
If Jeffrey can clear things up
at the press conference on Monday,

251
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,300
things may turn around.

252
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,500
Coach, I'm hanging up.

253
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,250
Jeffery!

254
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,600
Can I have a word with you?

255
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,090
I know why you're here.

256
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,130
I saw the video on the Internet.

257
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,420
It's fake.

258
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,710
I hope you could clear things up.

259
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,460
I heard that,
if they believe that it's true,

260
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,660
you're likely to
get expelled from the club.

261
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,010
Your attitude the other day

262
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,550
really pissed me off.

263
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,650
So you should pay for it.

264
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:17,010
Well, I don't want to help a loser.

265
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,880
If you don't clear things up,

266
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,580
do you want people to assume that
you're defeated by me?

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,710
Qiu Ying, stop working already.

268
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,090
Keep your laptop.
We're going to have dinner soon.

269
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,470
Right away.

270
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:46,670
There we go!
Here comes the spicy and aromatic hot pot.

271
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,500
-Put your computer away.
-Here.

272
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,960
You sit in front of the laptop
every single day.

273
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,150
When will you be ready for dinner?

274
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,860
Thank God. Your little angel is here.

275
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,569
-Here.
-Thank you, little angel.

276
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,750
The man who's going to marry you

277
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:10,010
is the luckiest person in the world.

278
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,290
You're so sweet.

279
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,310
Don't have it all to yourself.

280
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,280
I want to have some, too.

281
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,240
You're selfish.

282
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,339
Take a look at this, Yi Yi.

283
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,849
What is it?

284
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,530
A poll that agrees to
Ji Xiang Kong quitting Legends.

285
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,650
Seventy percent of them agree to it!

286
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,960
We just reconciled yesterday.

287
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,690
And this was posted online today.

288
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,310
And you know what?

289
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,800
The thing is

290
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,860
everyone has been gossiping about us.

291
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,350
Both of you are being gossiped about.

292
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,200
And you're still smiling.

293
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,730
No, I'm not smiling.

294
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,930
-You're smiling.
-I'm not.

295
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,710
I don't think Ji Xiang Kong
can turn things around this time.

296
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,110
I heard that the sponsors of Legends

297
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,570
got so mad when they found out about this.

298
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,850
They even asked to
terminate the sponsorships.

299
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,740
Legends is likely

300
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,340
to break off with Ji Xiang Kong

301
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,550
at tomorrow's press conference.

302
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,660
Then what do we do?

303
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,970
Should we help him?

304
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,590
Help him?

305
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,240
That's easy for you to say.

306
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,810
We are nobody. No one will listen to us.

307
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,710
Tell me. How do we help him?

308
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,040
I don't know either.

309
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,320
Well, Ji Xiang Kong helped me before.

310
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,140
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

311
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,360
And the thing is I started it all.

312
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,200
Sister, both of you are
being gossiped about.

313
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,910
If you tell them that
Ji Xiang Kong is innocent,

314
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,300
do you think they will believe it?

315
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,550
It will only deepen the misunderstanding.

316
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,750
If so, I can just upload
the full video that I took.

317
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,730
Don't you even bring that up.

318
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,540
Look at the video you took.

319
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:03,100
You only managed to get the part
where both of them were fighting.

320
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,750
Did you get the one where

321
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,150
the coach tried to break up their fight?

322
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,090
If you were to upload this video now,

323
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,980
people wouldn't buy into it.

324
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,750
Then tell me. What do we do?

325
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:22,140
Forget it. You eat first.

326
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,440
We'll figure out what to do.

327
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,540
Wait a minute, Qiu Ying.

328
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,590
Look at this person.

329
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:42,200
-What's wrong with her?
-She was there taking a video, too.

330
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:45,210
Maybe she managed to film the whole thing.

331
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,310
If we can find her

332
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,460
and get the full video of the incident,

333
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,380
we can prove Ji Xiang Kong's innocence.

334
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,380
But she's abroad.
Where are you going to find her?

335
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,860
Canada?

336
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,160
You're so silly.

337
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,680
Look.

338
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,670
Is that a tour group?

339
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,350
Surely they will return to China.

340
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:12,730
To find this person, all we have to do
is to find the tour group.

341
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,900
Once we've found her and got the video,

342
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,760
we will be able to prove it.

343
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,850
Even if she returns,

344
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,710
where are you going to find her?
There are so many tour groups in China.

345
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,870
Don't forget that I'm a journalist.

346
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,380
Such a minor thing won't
daunt a great reporter like me.

347
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:36,840
Rest assured. I'll take care of it.

348
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,360
You just eat up.

349
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,600
Seek truth and justice.

350
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,840
That's my mission.

351
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,390
Silly girl.

352
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,330
Hello, Yi Yi.

353
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:04,630
I found the travel agency.

354
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,110
[But their guide is on a tour.]

355
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,870
He'll be back on the afternoon flight.

356
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,380
[I'm glad that you found it.]

357
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,530
Just pray that the flight

358
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,760
[arrives on time.]

359
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,580
You're right.

360
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,760
[Many flights have been delayed.]

361
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,550
Ji Xiang Kong is so unfortunate.

362
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,280
If God isn't on his side,
there's nothing we can do about it.

363
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,420
Legends has sent a notice to the media.

364
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:34,380
There will be a press conference
tomorrow morning

365
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,680
to announce the termination
of Ji Xiang Kong's contract.

366
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,390
I'll wait.

367
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,790
Bye-bye.

368
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,780
[The King]

369
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,270
Brother Kong!

370
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,900
Didn't you see the messages
I sent you on WeChat?

371
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,970
Coach Luo just told me

372
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,280
Jeffery is flying off, and won't be
attending the press conference.

373
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,010
Got it. You may leave now.

374
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,960
Wait. Jeffery is flying off.
He's getting on the plane.

375
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,350
Got it. Don't worry about me.

376
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,160
Get back to your training first.

377
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,720
Whether I quit or not,

378
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,490
we're going to win the game.

379
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,670
Are you all right?

380
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,180
I'm leaving.

381
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,110
Jeffery is leaving, too.

382
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,250
Why hasn't the plane arrived yet?

383
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,560
It has yet to take off.

384
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,900
It's okay.

385
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,510
As long as the plane is not cancelled,

386
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,550
there's a glimmer of hope.

387
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,750
Fine, I'll wait for it with you.

388
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,950
You're the best, Yi Yi.

389
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,780
Here.

390
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:16,030
Have a drink to refresh yourself.

391
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,310
This could be a long wait.

392
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,760
Thanks.

393
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,290
I'm sleepy.

394
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,830
On your feet.

395
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,880
Slowly.

396
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,170
What time is it already?

397
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,730
Look at your face.

398
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:21,980
If you keep on with the waiting,
you'll soon become a ginger.

399
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,070
Yi Yi, you should head back first.

400
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,550
I'll wait a little longer.

401
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,420
Stop the waiting.
It's three o'clock in the morning.

402
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,360
And the press conference
will begin in a few hours.

403
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,550
Moreover,

404
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,440
even if you find the tour guide,

405
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,030
they might have deleted the video

406
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,890
since it's been a while.

407
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,470
As long as there's a glimmer of hope,

408
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,840
I'll wait.

409
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,450
Wait. Are you having a fever?

410
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,260
Or have you fallen in love
with Ji Xiang Kong?

411
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,840
Is it worth it to do this for him?

412
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,150
Neither of them.

413
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,080
I just think that I should
do something for him.

414
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,790
Otherwise, I'll feel sorry for him.

415
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,320
Yi Yi, you should head back first.

416
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,400
You will have to attend
the press conference tomorrow.

417
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,240
Fine, I'll head back and prepare for it.

418
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,520
Let's keep in touch.

419
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,680
Stay safe.

420
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,000
Bye-bye.

421
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,240
-Get home safe. Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

422
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,260
Hello, everyone who's watching this.

423
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,050
I am Lu Yi Yi, a reporter from
Dynamic Esports Magazine.

424
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,860
We're here at
the press conference of Legends.

425
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,570
Manager Zhao said
he'd give us a result today.

426
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:58,560
Now, let's go in there

427
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,960
and find out more about
the latest situation.

428
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,060
Thank you.

429
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,240
You're here. This way please.

430
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:10,790
-Manager Zhao.
-This way please.

431
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,150
-Manager Zhao.
-Manager Zhao.

432
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,980
How's everything going on here?

433
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,310
-How are you finding all this?

434
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,790
Not bad.

435
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,150
You're something else.

436
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,680
You're capable than me.

437
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,830
Thanks to your leadership.

438
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:25,490
I've spread the word today.

439
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,360
That Legends and Ji Xiang Kong
will officially terminate the contract.

440
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,690
That's right.

441
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,600
We need to make a big deal out of it.

442
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,930
Do you know what Mr. Jin likes?

443
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,950
His own face.

444
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,240
Once the contract has been
successfully terminated,

445
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,850
even if Ji Xiang Kong is innocent,

446
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,850
he can't return here. Right?

447
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,350
To tell you the truth,

448
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,830
I've got
the termination letter ready today.

449
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,900
Then what are you waiting for?

450
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,640
Get him sign it.

451
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,420
All right, I'll see to that now.

452
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,450
This way please.

453
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,100
-Brother Kong.
-Handsome Ji.

454
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,400
The press conference
is about to begin. Right?

455
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,750
There are a lot of reporters out there.
What do we do?

456
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,460
I have no idea why they're
having this press conference.

457
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:39,200
Well, well. Here comes another nuisance.

458
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,440
Everyone of you is here.

459
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,070
Here's the termination contract.

460
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,660
If there's no problem,
you could sign it now.

461
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,550
Sign what?

462
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,670
The press conference is yet to start.
What's the rush?

463
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,890
Well, if we're done here,
I'm going to take my leave.

464
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,330
I'll leave you to it.

465
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,520
Hey.

466
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,850
Tell Zhao Yang.

467
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,510
That I'll sign it.

468
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,320
But no matter what,

469
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,200
I'll wait until he drops the act.

470
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,550
Then I'll sign it in front of him.

471
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:41,090
Hello, Yi Yi.

472
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,870
Qiu Ying, how are things
going on your side?

473
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,730
Look, almost everyone is here.

474
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,410
[The press conference is about to begin.]

475
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,330
The flight has landed.

476
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,640
But he hasn't come out yet.

477
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,740
Could it be that it's too late?

478
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,330
Then what do we do?

479
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,410
Fine, I'll wait to hear from you.

480
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,480
The bus is at the gate. Come on.

481
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,810
Everybody, get on the bus.

482
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,280
Follow me.

483
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,930
Hey!

484
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,090
Wait!

485
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,350
Manager Zhao is here!

486
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,180
Welcome, and thank you for taking the time

487
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:09,210
to attend this press conference.

488
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:12,020
For today's press conference,
I'll be talking about...

489
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,540
Manager Zhao, it's said that

490
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,020
Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying reached
a settlement yesterday. Is that true?

491
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,560
Yes, Manager Zhao. Could we interpret
this incident in this way?

492
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,900
That the video that Qiu Ying
uploaded is authentic.

493
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,710
That Ji Xiang Kong
did beat Jeffery up in Vancouver.

494
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,560
Here. Manager Zhao.

495
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,890
I mean, if Ji Xiang Kong
were to be terminated,

496
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,540
would the Legends recruit a new member?

497
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,910
That's what we're concerned about.
Am I right?

498
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,930
-Yes!
-Manager Zhao.

499
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,600
Please answer the question, Manager Zhao.

500
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,230
Quiet, everyone.

501
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,070
Please take your seats.

502
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,960
First of all,

503
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,670
on behalf of the company
and Ji Xiang Kong,

504
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,350
I would like to apologize to you all.

505
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,090
Wait!

506
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,920
Where is your tour guide?

507
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,900
She's in that car.

508
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,290
Thank you.

509
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:26,130
Excuse me! Wait!

510
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,510
Watch out!

511
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,550
Are you all right?

512
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,790
Finally, I found you!

513
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,970
We deeply regret the misunderstanding.

514
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,420
-Hurry up.
-Thus, the company solemnly announces

515
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,170
the contract termination with...

516
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,570
Manager Zhao!

517
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:04,020
I have a video here.

518
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,660
It can prove Ji Xiang Kong's innocence.

519
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,290
Do you want to see it?

520
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,180
-Is that so?
-Do you guys want to see it?

521
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,670
-What video?
-What video?

522
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,730
-Let me have a look.
-Let me take a look.

523
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,610
Come and take a look.

524
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,460
Who is that?

525
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,890
Who's that?

526
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,690
That's what happened?

527
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,590
-Yes.
-Check it out.

528
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,040
Ji Xiang Kong didn't hit anyone.

529
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,960
That's right. As shown in the video,
he didn't hit anyone.

530
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,340
-Yes.
-What's going on?

531
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,080
Manager Zhao, please explain.

532
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,850
Though this video is a bit unclear,

533
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,080
it's obvious that
Ji Xiang Kong didn't hit anyone.

534
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,020
Manager Zhao.
Have you seen this video before?

535
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,070
-Did you see it?
-Have you seen this video before?

536
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,480
-Please answer our question, Manager Zhao.
-How's that, Manager Zhao?

537
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,910
Take a look.

538
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,780
Ji Xiang Kong didn't hit anyone.

539
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,700
That's right.
Have you seen this video before?

540
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,990
-Please answer the question, Manager Zhao.
-How's it, Manager Zhao?

541
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,540
Go ahead and explain yourself.

542
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,290
The company and I
have never seen this video.

543
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:04,270
But this kind of unofficial content

544
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,320
comes with poor clarity.

545
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,300
And we haven't confirmed it.

546
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,090
So the authenticity of this video
remains uncertain.

547
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:16,430
Also, we're not going to make
this bizarre video as an excuse

548
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,460
to deny our company's decisions

549
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,720
and to defend our player.

550
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,160
Manager Zhao.

551
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,690
Are you speaking on behalf of your team?

552
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:30,020
Here's the evidence that can prove
Ji Xiang Kong's innocence.

553
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:33,150
But you refuse to verify
and acknowledge it.

554
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,910
Is it you or your team

555
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,210
who doesn't care about
the player's innocence?

556
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,000
-Yes!
-Right?

557
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,030
I speak and act on behalf of the company.

558
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,730
We cherish our players.

559
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,000
But we will not condone
such a violent incident.

560
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,930
Our company bases its decisions

561
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,920
on hard facts.

562
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:02,750
Cute little journalist.

563
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,720
If you really have some other evidence

564
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,500
than this blurry video.

565
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,560
we will give it a thought. I mean this.

566
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,580
-You...
-Besides,

567
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,739
Jeffery is no longer in the country.

568
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,070
Manager Zhao is right.

569
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,310
-Ji Xiang Kong.
-Ji Xiang Kong.

570
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,670
-Ji Xiang Kong.
-Ji Xiang Kong.

571
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,650
Ji Xiang Kong,
the video is said to be synthetic.

572
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,219
Did you hit Jeffery or not?

573
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,219
-Ji Xiang Kong.
-Please answer it, Ji Xiang Kong.

574
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,960
Did you hit Jeffery or not, Ji Xiang Kong?

575
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,580
Please be quiet.

576
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,780
This video came out of nowhere.

577
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,130
Of course we can't be
so quick to believe it.

578
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,060
Who sent you here?

579
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,739
Your presence will only
make things more difficult.

580
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,550
You will cause more trouble for the team.

581
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:48,860
Are you aware of that?

582
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:53,300
How it all started and what happened.

583
00:34:53,449 --> 00:34:55,750
Who knows it better than I do?

584
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,420
I'm sure you all

585
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,680
would like to obtain
first-hand information from me.

586
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,870
Ji Xiang Kong, what happened on that day?

587
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,490
-Yes.
-What happened on that day?

588
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,310
Everyone, please be quiet.

589
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,070
What I wanted to say.

590
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,360
It's all in the video you just saw.

591
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:17,760
If you don't believe me,
you can go and ask Jeffery.

592
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,810
Jeffery has returned to his country.

593
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:23,200
How can he confront you? Right?

594
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,680
What era is it now, Manager Zhao?

595
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,510
With advanced communication technologies,

596
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:31,870
must he be here to clear things up?

597
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,240
-What is that?
-What is that?

598
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,550
I have a video here.

599
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:46,430
You all may check it out.

600
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:55,180
[The video on the Internet is fake.]

601
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,260
[There's no way I was
beaten up by Ji Xiang Kong.]

602
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,550
[That's ridiculous.]

603
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,770
[Ji Xiang Kong.]

604
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,210
[I admit your tactics are strong.]

605
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:12,170
[Next season's global finals.
I wait for you.]

606
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,310
That means the previous video was made up.

607
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,780
Ji Xiang Kong was wronged.

608
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,510
That's right. Ji Xiang Kong was wronged.

609
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,560
Ji Xiang Kong. What is the relationship
between you and Qiu Ying?

610
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,280
Why did she do that?

611
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,970
What on earth is going on?

612
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,200
I'm sure you're
well aware of the incident.

613
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,520
As for my relationship
with the female host,

614
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:42,150
there's nothing going on between us.

615
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:44,430
She didn't post the made-up video.

616
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,770
Both Qiu Ying and I are victims.

617
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,720
As for the one who made
the fake video to defame me,

618
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,720
Legends and I will definitely
find and turn him over to the law.

619
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,410
Manager Zhao. Legends was due to announce
Ji Xiang Kong's termination today.

620
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,930
But now he's proved innocent.

621
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,770
Well...

622
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,420
Like I said before.

623
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,480
That if Ji Xiang Kong is innocent,

624
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,130
our company will not
terminate his contract.

625
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,880
Thank you for your understanding,
Manager Zhao.

626
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,730
Meanwhile, I hope all
the media present here

627
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,370
could help Legends

628
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:27,980
find out the mastermind behind all this.

629
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:31,220
We will be having media interviews next.

630
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,390
If you have any question,
you may ask Manager Zhao directly.

631
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll go first. I can't explain anything.

632
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,200
Manager Zhao. Please answer it.

633
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,650
♫ If the light fell into a black hole ♫

634
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,250
♫ I shall make a crack with my dream ♫

635
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,780
Please explain it.

636
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,300
Who's the mastermind behind it?

637
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,010
Nothing. Let's continue.

638
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,770
Listen, Qiu Ying.

639
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,010
It's over at last.

640
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,140
It's over.

641
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,060
Ji Xiang Kong is
a man of conscience after all.

642
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,510
You didn't overnight
at the airport for nothing.

643
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,420
I'm tired.

644
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,380
I have to get some sleep here.

645
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,290
You can't sleep at the airport
even if you want to.

646
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,510
Don't hang up. Wait for me, I'm coming.

647
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,320
♫ Don't stop, to the summit, here we go ♫

648
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,980
♫ Yes, here we go ♫
