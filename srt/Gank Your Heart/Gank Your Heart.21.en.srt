00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,320
I'm sorry. We're closing now.

5
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,570
He hasn't replied to your message?

6
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,310
So sorry.

7
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,710
I'll be leaving right away.

8
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,730
Hello, Qiu Ying.

9
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,020
[I'm sorry.]

10
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,600
Is everything alright?

11
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,570
[I was held up by something urgent.]

12
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,960
I didn't think it would take so long.
I didn't reply to you immediately.

13
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm really sorry.

14
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,410
I'm just glad you're alright.

15
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,040
[Are you still at the shop?]

16
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,960
Sorry, you waited so long for nothing.
I'll come to get you.

17
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,420
No, it's fine.

18
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,050
You have curfew.

19
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,220
You won't get back in time
if you make another trip.

20
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,800
I...

21
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,440
I've gone home.

22
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,590
Then I'll buy you a meal next time
to make it up to you.

23
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,300
Okay.

24
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,700
I'll make you treat me to a feast.

25
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,670
[Quickly get some rest.]

26
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,060
Alright. You too.

27
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,250
Good night.

28
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,240
Good night.

29
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,079
Ji Xiang Kong is the reason you came back.

30
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,760
Did I hear it right?

31
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,140
Yes.

32
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,410
No wonder you insisted on
promoting "Beyond The Sky"

33
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,350
as your title song when you're back.

34
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,820
Mi Ya.

35
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,510
He has dumped you.

36
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:22,470
He only did it for my own good.

37
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,440
Plus, my feelings for him has never
changed. I'm sure it's the same for him.

38
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,120
I'm getting back with him this time
whether you approve it or not.

39
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,530
Have you lost your mind?

40
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,970
You're willing to put everything you have
on the line for that one guy?

41
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,960
Do you know how much I've done
to get you where you are now?

42
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,770
Have you forgotten all about it?

43
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,290
No, I haven't.

44
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,840
I was the one who trained every day
till half past two in the morning,

45
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,780
got up at six to attend events,

46
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,240
worked for 365 days, even during new year.

47
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,530
Do you know how hard it was for me?

48
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,140
Has anyone thought of that?

49
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,730
That's because you chose this path.

50
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,850
So you have to accept it.

51
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,780
You need to be responsible for your fans.

52
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,700
Whatever you say or do
must meet their expectations.

53
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:19,320
If they don't want you to date someone,
then you have no right to date.

54
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,740
-But I'm human too.
-You're not just anyone.

55
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,630
In order to enjoy the fame of a superstar,

56
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,450
you must put in all those efforts
and make those sacrifices.

57
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,870
If Ji Xiang Kong really loves you,

58
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,090
he shouldn't be your stumbling block.

59
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,150
Mi Ya.

60
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,170
Don't ruin yourself.

61
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,440
Since you're already back,
you should focus on work.

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,290
Get a foothold in the industry here.

63
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:01,330
I got a job offer for you today
to appear as a special guest for a show.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,540
Don't worry.

65
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,990
I will do my job well.

66
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,750
But this time,
I'm not letting go of Xiang Kong.

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,290
I'm going to rest.

-They did.
-What are you guys doing here?

96
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,130
-Did you hit likes for my sister?
-I did, every single day.

97
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,090
Then why are the numbers still so low?

98
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,020
How come Qiao Xin has so many likes?

99
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,910
What are you looking at?

100
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,310
Gu Jia Yi is truly a goddess.

101
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,250
A perfect goddess.

102
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,270
Xia Ling.

103
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,870
I think Gu Jia Yi is looking at you.

104
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,860
Stop looking.
There's nothing to see. Quick.

105

I'll buy the three of you milk tea.
What flavour do you want?

110
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:10,230
[They are on a roll.]

111
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,230
Pei Xi. What are you doing here
instead of training with your team?

112
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,700
[They make their enemies
tremble with fear.]

113
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,220
My gosh. Am I seeing things?

114
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,000
What is it?

115
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,200
You...

116
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,240
You were smiling at Ji Xiang Kong.

117
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,270
I wasn't.

118
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:35,520
Don't deny it. I clearly saw you smiling.

119
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,840
Why are you so delighted that VNG won?

120
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,290
It'll be more fun
to face Ji Xiang Kong at the playoffs.

121
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:51,180
Why do I sense a hint of admiration
from those words?

122
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,170
[Congratulations
on five consecutive wins.]

for Rising Star online voting.]

00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,810
Second place?

127
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,930
Since when did I have
such high popularity?

128
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,680
Brother Summer!

129
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,510
Can I take two hours off?

130
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,150
Where are you going?

131
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,010
Bringing your review video to Luo Tian?

132
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,800
Not bad.

133
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,960
You really managed to be his apprentice.

134
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,400
He's always so busy.

135
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,570
He also has to watch
my commentary videos on top of that.

136
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,120
I've been thinking of
how I should thank him.

137
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:25,520
That guy?
He is interested in nothing but work.

138
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,580
To put it nicely, he's a workaholic.
To put it bluntly, he's an idiot in life.

139
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,080
Really?

140
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,860
Back then in our team,
he even had to use our cups.

141
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,540
I got it.

142
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,100
What is it? Why do you look so startled?

143
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,030
Thank you, Brother Summer.

144
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,800
I'll get going. Bye bye!

145
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,230
Wait, I haven't approved your leave.

146
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,940
Thank you, Brother Summer!

147
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,020
Chairman Guo, GDV is indeed different.

148
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,210
It's far stronger than You Xing Video.

149
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,020
Our company lacks female commentators
like you who have good image and skills.

150
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,530
I would still need
more opportunities from you.

151
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,710
Of course.

152
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,560
Mr. Luo.

153
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,780
You two know each other?

154
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,900
Of course we do.

155
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:28,230
I used to frequent Dream Traveler to see
Mr. Luo's reviews and learn from him.

156
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,800
Good, then.

157
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:34,350
Luo Tian, Qiao Xin is now
a potential winner of Rising Star.

158
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:37,060
Give her some guidance if you have time.

159
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,140
Rising Star is a professional competition.

160
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,340
Your professional skill matters most.

161
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,420
I hope to see an exciting performance
from you at the competition.

162
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,010
I will work hard.

163
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,510
After all, I got where I am today
with my own efforts.

164
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,800
Unlike some people
who likes taking shortcuts,

165
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,560
sharing posts asking for support.

166
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:00,740
Using gossips of other candidates
to suddenly gain lots of good reviews.

167
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,010
My apologies. I think I got too worked up.

168
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,780
Anyway, all I hope
is to have a fair competition.

169
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,780
Don't worry.
I'll definitely look into this.

170
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,020
Thank you, Chairman Guo.

171
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,130
Chairman Guo, I need to get back to work.

172
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,540
Of course. Go ahead.

173
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,090
Bye, Mr. Luo.

174
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,300
Qiao Xin, I'll walk you out.

175
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,560
Sure.

176
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,520
Doing all these useless things.

177
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,460
Hello.

178
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:51,530
[Mr. Luo, Miss Qiu is here to see you.]

179
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,070
[Mr. Luo?]

180
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,280
Tell her to wait at the commentary room.

181
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,380
[Alright, sir.]

182
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:35,900
Think carefully if you are qualified
to stand in that position.

183
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,780
Sorry, Mr. Luo.
I just wanted to wait for you here.

184
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,130
What brings you here?

185
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,200
I got you a small gift
to thank you for your guidance.

186
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,920
I hope you like it.

187
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,010
What is this really about?

188
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,380
Here's my commentary video.

189
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,460
I've seen a lot of your commentary videos.

190
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,920
Today,

191
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,470
I'd like to see you
commentating on the spot.

192
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,520
You may begin.

193
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:36,680
But, Mr. Luo, I haven't prepared anything.

194
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,810
I said on the spot.
Do you think that needs preparation?

195
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,020
-If you're not doing it, I'm leaving.
-Mr. Luo, wait.

196
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,050
Today, I'll be reviewing

197
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,210
the first match of the closed beta test
for the new edition of iConquer.

198
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,280
VNG versus Dragon.

199
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,970
Don't rush. Take your time.

200
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:18,130
Both teams started a team fight
at the 21 minutes 36 seconds mark.

201
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:22,180
This is probably
the most crucial team fight of the match.

202
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,550
Pay attention to the speed
and tone of your voice.

203
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,010
Both teams started a team fight
at the 21 minutes 36 seconds mark.

204
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,090
This is probably
the most crucial team fight of the match.

205
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,820
Five players from Dragon
against four players from VNG.

206
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:40,090
If it weren't for Pei Xi, VNG would have
likely been defeated in this round.

207
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,400
I can't feel your passion towards iConquer
based on your commentary.

208
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,870
I...

209
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,730
I...

210
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,110
I'm sorry, Mr. Luo.

211
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,100
-I didn't control my tone of voice.
-Don't call me Mr. Luo.

212
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
If you're not passionate about this sport,

213
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,030
then you're not qualified
to stand in front of me.

214
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:07,500
If I had no passion for iConquer,
I wouldn't be standing in front of you.

215
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,190
Is that so?

216
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,880
A good commentator wouldn't spam posts
asking for support to climb ranks.

217
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:20,430
Spamming posts?

218
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,590
Mr. Luo, I...

219
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,190
I've never posted anything like that.

220
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,560
There must be some misunderstanding.

221
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,050
Please give me some time.
I'll find out what's going on.

222
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,430
I have to get back to work.

223
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,180
Bye, Mr. Luo.

224
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,000
[Mr. Luo, the weather has gotten colder.]

225
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,170
[Make sure you drink more hot water
since you have a weak stomach.]

226
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,260
He's so good at basketball.

227
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,630
-Yes
-He's from Class 5?

228
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,600
That's right.

229
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,580
I always thought he's from Class 3.

230
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,730
No. Is James that good?

231
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,360
Isn't that my sister?

232
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,980
-That's your sister? Introduce us.
-Go, go.

233
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,000
-Don't be so petty.
-Don't think about it.

234
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:51,200
Go see Gu Jia Yi's
cheerleading competition.

235
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,300
Okay.

236
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,840
We'll wait for you. Come quick.

237
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,820
Qiu Ying.

238
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,580
What brings you to my school?

239
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,960
-I came to see you.
-See me?

240
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,330
It's your first time coming here, right?

241
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:04,620
Are you hungry? We could go eat something.

242
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,880
It's okay. I only came here for one thing.

243
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,430
Stop doing unnecessary things.

244
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,540
You found out?

245
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,750
-I just wanted to help.
-You think you're helping me?

246
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,170
Xia Ling.

247
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,570
No matter what you do,
I'll never forgive you all.

248
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,800
I just want to live a quiet life
on my own. Don't you get it?

249
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,170
Qiu Ying.

250
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,550
-What did I do wrong?
-Stop calling me.

251
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:35,000
I can handle my own problems.

252
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,090
Xia Ling.

253
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,890
Save your pity.

254
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,450
I don't need it.

255
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,660
Take a look at the statistics.

256
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:56,060
In Dragon's recent winning matches,
they used both Chariot Man and Cyborg.

257
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,590
They reach a certain level of outburst in
early game and work in sync in late game.

258
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,460
Hence, our Champion selections
must be aimed towards that.

259
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,750
Qi Yue.

260
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,440
Practice more using Zhi Heng
these few days.

261
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,880
What?

262
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,120
Qi Yue.

263
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,430
We're discussing our battle tactics.
Please put down your phone.

264
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,790
I'm listening.

265
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:24,700
Captain wants you
to practice more using Zhi Heng.

266
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,860
Got it. Anything else?

267
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,770
If that's all, I'll get going.

268
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,130
Bye!

269
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:46,660
Captain, if there's anything else,
just tell me.

270
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,390
I'll relay it to Brother Qi.

271
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,530
We'll be using Double Yue next round.

272
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,340
-You two should practice more.
-Yes, Captain.

273
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,910
Alright. That's all for today. Dismissed.

274
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,130
-Sister Wen.
-Sister Wen.

275
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,720
Sister Wen.

276
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,590
I've taken a look at Qi Yue's
last three matches.

277
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,160
His statistics aren't that stable.

278
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,910
He's been too full of himself lately.

279
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:27,160
For seven consecutive wins,
he won MVP for each round.

280
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,940
Perhaps that's why.

281
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,360
I'll ask Li Gan to talk to him.

282
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,840
And you. Don't be so tensed.

283
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,090
Have a good rest. Relax.

284
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,040
[Hello, everyone. I'm Qiu Ying.]

285
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,910
[I'll be reviewing the third match of
iConquer 2017 World Finals,]

286
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,540
[which was won by 3-2.]

287
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,440
[It's Legends against Team Inception.]

288
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,980
[Invisible Spirit slipped into the crowd
at the start]

289
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,240
[and used three skills
in attempt to kill Chariot Man.]

290
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:08,890
[However, Megaera
who was next to Chariot Man]

291
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:11,310
[trapped Invisible Spirit and attacked.]

292
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,740
This translating software
probably sounds more natural than I do.

293
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:18,090
[Blade Master decided
to crash into the crowd and attack.]

294
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:22,530
[But before he could get there,
Minister sent him back to his position.]

295
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,890
What are you doing here?

296
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,010
I came out for a walk after training.

297
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,590
-I see.
-What's wrong?

298
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:29,970
Why do you look dispirited?

299
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,320
It's the finals for Rising Star tomorrow.

300
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,180
I listened back to my reviews
and it still sounds awful.

301
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:41,100
Every time I listen to Mr. Luo,
he's so full of emotion.

302
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,720
But when it comes to me,
I sound like I'm completing a mission.

303
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,610
I've tried many different ways,
but it's useless.

304
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,190
I don't feel like going anymore.

305
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:52,270
You know what's most important
before exams back then?

306
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,960
It's not cramming for the test,
but to relax.

307
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,070
Don't listen to these now.

308
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,580
Give me your earphones.

309
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,550
This is my personal playlist.

310
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,030
I always listen to these songs
before the competition to relieve stress.

311
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,630
It's very effective.

312
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,200
By the way, close your eyes.

313
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,800
♫ If, just if ♫

314
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,950
♫ We must waste time away ♫

315
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,320
♫ Then wasting it is worthwhile ♫

316
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,200
♫ As long as it's with you ♫

317
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,040
♫ If, just if ♫

318
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:58,440
♫ I just can't be alone ♫

319
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,670
♫ Then it was you who started it ♫

320
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:06,800
♫ I accept you disturbing me ♫

321
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,550
♫ Why are the skies clear, not raining? ♫

322
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,550
I told you to close your eyes.

323
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,840
♫ Because of you ♫

324
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,680
♫ I was lucky enough ♫

325
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,960
♫ To meet you ♫

326
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,260
How do you feel now?

327
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,320
This song sounds lovely.

328
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,340
Just let go of your worries,
stay confident and focused,

329
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:50,590
and give it all you've got,
then you can do it.

330
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,460
Don't forget our promise.
We'll reach the top of the world together.

331
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,450
By the way,

332
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,200
Ji Xiang Kong.

333
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,410
There's something

334
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:13,030
I've been meaning to ask you
a long time ago.

335
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,460
Actually...

336
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,770
Actually...

337
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:24,950
Look! Mi Ya got caught meeting
a handsome guy alone at night.

338
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,510
Apparently, she chose "Beyond The Sky"
as her EP track upon her return

339
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,490
to get back with her first boyfriend.

340
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,430
What's wrong?

341
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:46,810
Right. I forgot
that you're Mi Ya's hardcore fan.

342
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,850
Why?

343
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,290
Are you upset
that she's in a relationship?

344
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,200
As you said, I'm a hardcore fan.
Why would I be upset?

345
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:00,810
As long as it's her choice,
as long as she'll be happy,

346
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,660
I'll give her my blessing.

347
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,350
Right. What did you want to ask me?

348
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,630
Tomorrow is the finals for Rising Star.

349
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,990
You will come and cheer on me, right?

350
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:21,950
Obviously.

351
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,200
Tony. Were you behind the rumours
about me and Ren Xu?

352
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:35,130
He's popular now and you just returned.
It'll help boost your popularity.

353
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,810
Didn't you say I have no right
to be in a relationship?

354
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,810
You were caught
meeting Ji Xiang Kong privately.

355
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,870
That's the most I can do to cover it up.

356
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,380
-If we were caught, then just reveal it.
-Reveal who?

357
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:48,200
Ji Xiang Kong?
Do you know what kind of guy he is?

358
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,780
He has a bad reputation.

359
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,170
If you should be with someone like him,
it'd cheapen your image. You know that?

360
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,720
That's because people don't know him.

361
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,220
Ji Xiang Kong is someone who is competent.

362
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,510
He is the most passionate person I've met.

363
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,840
I've never felt ashamed to be with him.

364
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:10,280
Mi Ya, have you gone crazy
because of love?

365
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,480
It's been so many years.

366
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,120
Even if you haven't changed,
it doesn't mean he hasn't.

367
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,800
Xiang Kong would never change!

368
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:21,020
Fine. There's a girl who's been
pretty close with him lately.

369
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,750
Her name is Qiu Ying.
Look her up if you don't believe me.

370
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:56,800
[The King]

371
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,020
The guy in this picture is you, isn't it?

372
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:13,070
You've waited for so many years,
now she's finally back.

373
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,920
Those rumours about Ren Xu
are just cover-ups.

374
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,510
Don't take it to heart.

375
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,860
I know there's nothing going on
between them.

376
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,540
But her and I

377
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,700
aren't what you think either.

378
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,130
Then what's your relationship
with her now?

379
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,370
When we met that day, she told me

380
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:41,050
that she came back this time
all because of me.

381
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,530
She even said she'll be staying.

382
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,180
Even if she has to give up her career.

383
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,780
But...

384
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:54,740
You're afraid of ruining her career?

385
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,870
Then what is it that you're worried about?

386
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:01,210
Xiang Kong,
you've stayed single for so long.

387
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:03,850
Besides focusing on competitions,

388
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:08,250
isn't it because of the trauma
that Mi Ya had caused you?

389
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:12,050
Now she's back
and she wants to get back together.

390
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,890
Why can't you start afresh with her?

391
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Hello.

392
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:43,230
Xiang Kong. Don't take it wrongly.
There's nothing between me and Ren Xu.

393
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,870
My company was behind it. I had no idea.

394
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,580
I know.

395
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,700
They're trying to protect your image.

396
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,830
Thank you for understanding.

397
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,900
Don't worry. This won't happen again.

398
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:03,550
I'll tell Tony to clarify it
as soon as possible, and tell everyone

399
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,880
-that the one I like...
-[Don't do anything rash.]

400
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,730
You're a public figure.

401
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,280
You must be careful
with every decision you make.

402
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,640
Xiang Kong.

403
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,300
Back then, you let me go
so that I could build my career.

404
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,440
But as I became more successful,
it became clearer to me

405
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,680
that you were the most important thing
to me. Not the fame of an idol.

406
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,900
Can we meet now?

407
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,800
It's late.

408
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,440
Besides, the photo
has been shared on the internet.

409
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,820
It's too dangerous for you
to come outside.

410
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,930
What about tomorrow?
I'll be attending Rising Star as a guest.

411
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,940
Can we meet up

412
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,780
[before the competition?]

413
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,560
Please don't say no.

414
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,200
You must come.

415
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,220
I'll be waiting for you.

416
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,000
-Hurry up.
-Which room is it?

417
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,240
It's written there. The dressing room.

418
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,870
-Qiu Ying.
-Qiu Ying!

419
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,510
Sorry.

420
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,890
-How come you're here?
-Qiu Ying.

421
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,690
There's a huge crowd out there.

422
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,580
-Really?
-It's filled with people.

423
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,560
Those from Dream Traveler
are here too.

424
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,980
Is Ji Xiang Kong here yet?

425
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,060
Why do you only care about him?

426
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,700
He said he would come to support me.

427
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,000
Brother Kong is a man of his word.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

428
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,320
I can't stand it.

429
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:37,450
Are you two fans of Ji Xiang Kong?

430
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,290
Right. Earlier, I heard that

431
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,060
they have decided
to make Qiao Xin the winner.

432
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:48,710
That can't be. Don't spew nonsense.

433
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:51,610
You Xing Video is the main sponsor.

434
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,190
I'll head back to the waiting room.
See you later.

435
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,170
What we said earlier, I'm counting on you.

436
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,500
Mr. Luo.

437
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,440
Hi, Mr. Liu.

438
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,130
Thank you, everyone.
I'm going back inside.

439
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,570
Qiao Xin, Luo Tian and I
are looking forward to your performance.

440
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:12,650
-I won't let you down.
-Good.

441
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,430
Let's go.

442
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,800
Go get ready.

443
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,210
Qiu Ying, come here.

444
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,830
Come this way.

445
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,440
Mr. Liu, Chairman Guo from GDV,

446
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,430
and judge Luo Tian walked Qiao Xin back
to the dressing room.

447
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,340
Looks like the rumours are true.

448
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,130
Anyhow, I don't buy it.

449
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,730
That's right. Don't think about it.

450
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,050
All the best later.

451
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,590
-Go, Qiu Ying!
-Go, Qiu Ying!

452
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,710
I can do it!

453
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,320
What are you looking at?

454
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,570
[Sorry, Qiu Ying. Something came up.]

455
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,500
[I might be late.]

456
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:04,870
It's fine. Deal with your matters first.

457
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,139
What happened?

458
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:13,580
Ji Xiang Kong said he would be here later
because something came up.

459
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,880
Didn't you say
Brother Kong is a man of his word?

460
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,000
How dare he be late to such an
important competition for Qiu Ying?

461
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:26,870
He said he would be late.
He didn't say he won't be coming.

462
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,320
Let go first.

463
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,199
I'm going inside to prepare.

464
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,310
Okay, go get ready.

465
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,260
We'll be cheering you on in the audience.

466
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,060
-Keep it up!
-Keep it up!

467
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,530
-Keep it up, Qiu Ying!
-Keep it up!

468
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,410
Welcome to the finals of GDV
Rising Star Commentary Competition.

469
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,150
I am Can, your host for today.
Welcome, everyone!

470
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,480
According to the rules,

471
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:23,010
we will gather votes
from live audiences and the judges.

472
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,190
The one with the highest total votes
will be today's winner.

473
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,830
There will be two rounds
for the competition.

474
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,770
The first round is question and answer.

475
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,870
Two contestants will move on to the
second round, which is live commentary,

476
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,770
and compete to be the winner.

477
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,110
Everyone, don't be stingy with
your applause and cheers.

478
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,230
Cheer for your favourite contestant!

479
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,920
Qiao Xin! Qiao Xin!

480
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:53,550
Qiu Ying! Qiu Ying!

481
00:35:53,990 --> 00:36:00,020
Besides the four important guests
that we already have here,

482
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:05,560
we have one more secret guest
who will make an appearance.

483
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,950
She is the most popular
female singer right now.

484
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,510
Let's scream out her name. Who is it?

485
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:18,500
Mi Ya! Mi Ya!

486
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,830
Mi Ya! Mi Ya!

487
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,550
Mi Ya is here. Where is Brother Kong?

488
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,420
He's a fan of Mi Ya?
Then how could he be late?

489
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,300
Welcome, Mi Ya!

490
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,150
Welcome, Mi Ya, to the competition.

491
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,230
Qiu Ying.

492
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,120
Miss Mi Ya. You won't believe it.

493
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,710
Qiu Ying is especially good at
imitating your dance.

494
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,230
She had the top viewing video
while hosting a show once.

495
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,050
And she danced to your song "Answer Me".

496
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,100
Rising Star Commentary Competition
officially begins!

497
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:16,310
Next, we'll dive into the first round,
which is question and answer.

498
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,110
-Hi, please scan this for me.
-Sorry.

499
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,660
Hi, do you have a minute?
Please scan this QR code for me.

500
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,520
She's my sister.
No. She's taking part in this competition.

501
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,250
-She's so pretty. Let's scan it.
-Please. Thank you.

502
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,500
-Alright then.
-You can scan here or there.

503
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,680
-Thank you.
-Let's go.

504
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,960
Have a nice day.

505
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,410
Hi, sir. Do you have a minute
to scan this QR code?

506
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,110
No, my sister is taking part in
this competition. Please, just a minute.

507
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,260
What is the farthest distance for
Jin Can's Edgeless Sword?

508
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,400
A, 800. B, 1,000. C, 1,200. D, 1,400.

509
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,520
You may answer now!

510
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,830
Qiao Xin is so quick in this round.

511
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,690
Qiao Xin is so quick at
hitting the buzzer.

512
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,420
She is indeed You Xing Video's
best female host.

513
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,220
Qiao Xin, please give us your answer.

514
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,970
Though Jin Can's Edgeless Sword
can go to 1,000 at full skill,

515
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,050
it can reach 1,150
if paired with some items.

516
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,370
With clever positioning,
it can reach a maximum of 1,200.

517
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,830
Therefore, I choose C.

518
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,170
Congratulations!
Qiao Xin got it right again!

519
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,370
I didn't know Qiao Xin was this good.

520
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,720
Every time she hit the buzzer,
she answered it without thinking.

521
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,950
-I'm telling you.
-Yes.

522
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,240
Even I, as a professional gamer,
can't do that.

523
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,440
-Something doesn't smell right.
-That means...

524
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,420
Don't tell me she knew
the answers beforehand.

525
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,090
-I choose D.
-That's correct!

526
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,420
-I choose C.
-Correct again!

527
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,700
I choose A.

528
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:11,500
-That's correct!
-I choose B. C.

529
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,570
-I choose D.
-Correct again!

530
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,640
I choose A.

531
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,370
[I choose D.]

532
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:22,090
[Congratulations!
Qiao Xin got the right answer!]

533
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,610
Qiu Ying must hit the buzzer.

534
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:30,330
Alright. Next question. Get ready.

535
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,650
The question is,

536
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,900
Xin's Initial Attack...

537
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,880
[I must hit the buzzer no matter what.]

538
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:39,530
A, 26 to 31. B, 28 to 31.

539
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,150
C, 30 to 32. D, 33 to 38.

540
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,000
You may answer now.

541
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:52,910
Qiu Ying got it this time.
Please give us your answer.

542
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,070
Do take note
that there's a time limit to answer.

543
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,640
Why isn't she answering?

544
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,720
-You can do it, Qiu Ying.
-Yes. Say it. It's an easy one, Qiu Ying.

545
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:12,670
Maybe she's thinking of the answer.

546
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:20,010
Pan originally has the lowest initial
damage out of the iConquer Champions.

547
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:25,020
But after the addition of
the five Champions of Xuan Tian,

548
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,850
Xin took over the last position.

549
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,110
When a Champion's damage is lower than 28,

550
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,980
they won't be able to kill the soldiers.

551
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:39,100
So it must be higher than 28.

552
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:43,020
I choose B.

553
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:47,140
Alright. Congratulations!
Qiu Ying got the right answer!

554
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,160
-Qiu Ying!
-Qiu Ying! You're the best!

555
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,740
Qiu Ying!

556
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,130
Hi, may I have a minute?
Please scan this QR code for me.

557
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,550
-No, sorry.
-My sister is in this competition.

558
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,090
Please help me. Thank you.

559
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,150
Alright, then.

560
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,080
You can scan here or there.

561
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,660
[To give a passionate commentary
for every match. Qiu Ying.]

562
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,930
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

563
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,160
Hello!

564
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,560
It's a neck and neck competition.

565
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:16,150
There is still one last question.

566
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,140
Qiu Ying is now in second place,
while Qiao Xin is in first.

567
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,210
They are only ten points apart.

568
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,420
So we still don't know
who will be the final winner.

569
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:27,060
Please listen to the last question.

570
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:32,940
What should the commentator do if
there's a sudden blackout on the screen?

571
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,830
You see, Qiu Ying.
The scope for this answer is very wide.

572
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,440
Are you sure you want to answer
without hearing the rest of the question?

573
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,700
Or did you hit the buzzer by accident
because you were nervous?

574
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,560
What's so funny? Stop laughing!

575
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:54,210
She just hit the buzzer without thought.
She's still figuring out the answer.

576
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,260
The answer to questions like that
isn't just some numbers.

577
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,970
Is there a model answer?

578
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,570
She could easily go out of topic
if she's not careful.

579
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:05,030
Qiu Ying, please answer the question.

580
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:07,670
As we have a time limit for this question.

581
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:13,000
You must answer it within the time limit
or it will be considered wrong.

582
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,250
If there's a blackout on the screen
while commentating,

583
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,550
I will stay put at the commentary desk

584
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,490
and do my best to maintain the audiences'
anticipation towards the game.

585
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,850
Instead of amplifying the effects
on the audiences due to the emergency.

586
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,470
I think such an answer
is very Qiu Ying-like.

587
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,680
I think you were doing a show
in Vancouver once.

588
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,250
And you dealt with an emergency situation
by singing and dancing.

589
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,910
Are you going to do the same if you face
a similar situation in the future?

590
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,220
Gosh. Can is obviously
making fun of Qiu Ying.

591
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:06,590
She just got lucky.

592
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:12,220
The easiest solution is to tell
the audiences the reason for the blackout.

593
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,920
However, that will interrupt the
audiences' anticipation towards the game.

594
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,940
If I were in that situation,

595
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,770
I would do my best to hype the crowd
and console the audiences.

596
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:24,800
The professionalism of a commentator

597
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:28,760
is not only reflected in
accurate comments and quick analysis,

598
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,280
but also in how good they can bridge

599
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,900
the audiences and the game
if unexpected situations occur.

600
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:39,370
Treating the audiences with respect

601
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,890
to maintain their enthusiasm
throughout the competition.

602
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:45,130
Is that your final answer?

603
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,450
Yes.

604
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,340
The correct answer is

605
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,140
to shift the audiences' focus back to
the game and carry on with the commentary.

606
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,960
Congratulations, Qiu Ying.
Your answer is correct.

607
00:43:57,630 --> 00:43:58,820
Awesome!

608
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,670
She's not bad, right?
I think she has potential.

609
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,460
Now that Qiu Ying has answered correctly,

610
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,990
she has successfully tied the score
with Qiao Xin.

611
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,200
Congratulations once again
to Qiao Xin and Qiu Ying

612
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:24,600
for entering the final
live commentary round.

613
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:32,740
Qiu Ying! Qiu Ying!

614
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,580
Hello, I am your commentator, Qiu Ying.

615
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:45,190
This is my first time
standing on such a huge stage

616
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,520
to do a live commentary.

617
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:53,020
No. I'm too nervous.

618
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,470
Let's do it again.

619
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:58,650
[Hello, I am Fu Mi Ya.]

620
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,670
[It's my first public performance today.
I hope...]

621
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,590
[I hope that...]

622
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:18,940
[What are you writing?]

623
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:21,360
[Don't be nosy.]

624
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,440
[Sit over there.]

625
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:27,030
[Quick. Go sit there.]

626
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,990
[Do you know when you look the prettiest?]

627
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:42,390
[When?]

628
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,990
[When you are serious.]

629
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,850
[Cut it out.]

630
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:49,250
[I'm really nervous.]

631
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,450
["Hello, my name is Fu Mi Ya.
It's my first..."]

632
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,070
-["First..."]
-[Don't read it.]

633
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:08,830
-[Stop reading it.]
-["First..."]

634
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:11,330
-[First what?]
-[Give it back.]

635
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:22,080
[Do you think I will make it?]

636
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:25,160
[You've worked so hard.
I'm sure you will make it.]

637
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,900
[Don't be nervous about tomorrow.]

638
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:37,170
This is my first time standing on
such a huge stage to do a live commentary.

639
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,680
Sorry I'm late.

640
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,600
Congratulations!
You won first place in the first round.

641
00:47:00,140 --> 00:47:03,130
So tell me. Was it nerve-racking
during the competition?

642
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,570
But thanks to your advice,

643
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:10,340
I managed to answer the questions
with confidence.

644
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,240
You are confident and hard working.

645
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,960
I'll be anticipating your performance
in the next round.

646
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:18,620
The second round is doing live commentary.

647
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,460
If you have time,
could you stay and cheer me on?

648
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,380
I came to see you compete.
Of course I have time.

649
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,540
Alright, I'll let you get ready.
I'll go look for Lin Yi Xuan and the rest.

650
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,170
-See you later.
-Keep it up.

651
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,270
I will.

652
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:42,150
Let go of me.

653
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:47,350
Mi Ya, you are here as a guest.

654
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,900
We're in the middle of the show.
Be more professional.

655
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,890
Tony.

656
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,750
Qiu Ying's smile and the way she
works hard is just like me five years ago.

657
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:02,000
If Xiang Kong really likes her,
that means he saw my resemblance in her.

658
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,980
I knew it.
Xiang Kong never stopped loving me.

659
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:09,520
I'm going to talk to him.

660
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,800
Mi Ya.

661
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,080
Accept the truth.

662
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:18,810
Ji Xiang Kong came to see me just now.

663
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:22,240
He wanted me to tell you

664
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,470
to forget him

665
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,740
and be yourself again. Okay?
