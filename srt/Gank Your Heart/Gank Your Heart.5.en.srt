It seems to me that
if we successfully sign Pei Xi over,

102
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,740
Chairman Jin will surely make him captain.

Pei Xi's skills are remarkable.

that if I were to retire,

he wants me to leave
the esports industry forever.

to make a deal with Chairman Jin, is it?

Besides, what will you do if you want to
come out of retirement in the future?

Pro players should be mysterious.

164
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,820
He won't be as mysterious
if I tell you the name.

165
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,140
Fair enough, keep it a mystery then.

166
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,460
This is such a great event.

167
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,680
You should hold more events
like this in the future, okay?

168
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,230
Mr. Liu, can we ask
the publicity department

169
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:33,860
to advertise this event on
the homepage of the website,

170
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,660
so that we can get more attention?

171
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,550
This is a good idea.

172
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,370
I should give you good publicity.

173
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:39,860
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

174
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:41,030
We'll go get ready now.

175
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,740
Okay.

176
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,230
I'll be waiting to see what happens then.

177
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,340
Mr. Liu, leave it to us.

178
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,000
Brother Yao, did you notice any mistakes
Dragons made during the last few matches?

179
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,140
Tell us about it.

180
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,600
The view was bad.

181
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:06,800
Jungle kept getting caught.

182
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,480
He did not catch anyone in the early game.

183
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,600
Captain, the sly fox, Zhao is here.

184
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,910
Attention, everyone.

185
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,060
I have an announcement to make.

186
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,480
GDV has a reality show today.

187
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,430
Decide among yourselves
and send someone over.

188
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,610
Manager Zhao, didn't we have an agreement?

189
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,540
The closed beta test
is only a few days away.

190
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,300
We need to practice and 
we can't do any commercial events.

191
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,940
Xiang Kong, if you don't
participate in commercial events,

192
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:40,950
you won't have enough operating
costs for the team, isn't it?

193
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,640
Manager Zhao, Chairman Jin and you

194
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,100
are responsible for
the company's operation.

195
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,420
Coach Luo and I are only responsible

196
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,860
for playing games
and getting good results.

197
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,490
Besides, the result of
the closed beta test

198
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,450
will determine whether
I can become the captain or not.

199
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,900
Yet, you're asking us to participate
in the reality show at a time like this.

200
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,210
Those who know you will say that

201
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,140
you're doing this for the company.

202
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,830
But those who know nothing will think

203
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,660
you're just trying to obstruct me

204
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,780
as you don't want me to be the captain.

205
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,410
You won't go? Fine.

206
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,080
Go on with the meeting.

207
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,070
[This duo is very important to me.]

208
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,700
[Please be sure to show up.]

209
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,760
[It's almost time, are you ready?]

210
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,570
Coming.

211
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,970
Come in.

212
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,170
How is it going?

213
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,710
Did you find out who
will be Qiao Xin's partner?

214
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,780
No one in the company knows who he is.

215
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,730
It seems that Qiao Xin
came well prepared this time.

216
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,070
What's the matter? You're afraid of her?

217
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,700
I'm not afraid of Qiao Xin.

218
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,820
It's just that Ji Xiang Kong
still hasn't shown up yet.

219
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,560
He's not going to
mess with you again, is he?

220
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,760
I don't know.

221
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,050
Ji Xiang Kong...

222
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,090
Hello.

223
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,110
The match is starting soon.

224
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,420
You must protect me.

225
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:35,000
I'll reward you first.

226
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,170
I have a surprise for you
after we win the game.

227
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:42,130
Lu Feng, please practice more
using Chariot Man.

228
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,370
-But Chariot Man...
-No buts about it.

229
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,930
Just do as Xiang Kong said.
He must have plans for you.

230
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:58,780
That's all for today.

231
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,990
You may leave now.

232
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,320
Let's go.

233
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,190
He's logged into the game!

234
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,710
Hello, everyone. I'm Qiao Xin.

235
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,580
My battle with Qiu Ying is about to begin.

236
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:33,860
Please give me your support
and root for me.

237
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,090
I'll try my best!

238
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,990
Thanks, everyone.

239
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,860
I invited her.

240
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,160
Look, Qiao Xin's partner is Pei Xi.

241
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,360
Who is he?

242
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,730
Pei Xi?

243
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,000
VNG's carry.

244
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,140
The best young mid laner.

245
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,360
The best mid laner.

246
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,340
This should be fun.

247
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,960
Why are you still here?

248
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:58,980
I want to watch the show.

249
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,760
Take my laptop back with you.

250
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,609
I know you want to
play with the girl yourself.

251
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:15,180
He must be really good.

252
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,230
He's the dark horse of the year.

253
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,369
But that's okay.

254
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,290
VNG was defeated by Legends.

255
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,290
Don't worry.

256
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,640
That's good.

257
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,560
So this live stream is the battle

258
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,920
between the champion and runner-up
of the iConquer game in China.

259
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:32,430
It's also the battle between
the hosts of You Xing Video.

260
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,570
Relax, don't be nervous.

261
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,000
All the best!

262
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,850
You must beat her!

263
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,870
Good luck!

264
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,980
The game is on.

265
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,020
There are so many people.

266
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,020
You have to run! He's after you!

267
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,060
I'm running away.

268
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,910
He attacked me! What kind of man is he?

269
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,630
[They're trying to
kill me over the tower.]

270
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,890
Ji Xiang Kong, come save me!

271
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,400
Where are you, Ji Xiang Kong?

272
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:06,390
[Ji Xiang Kong, are you in a daze?]

273
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,930
What is Ji Xiang Kong thinking?

274
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,020
He was so close and yet
he didn't even save you.

275
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,340
Isn't Pei Xi a mid laner?

276
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,870
Why did he become Jungle today?

277
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,620
Qiu Ying isn't very good at it.

278
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,190
It's not that hard.

279
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,100
[You scored too fast.]

280
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,240
[Leave it to me.]

281
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:26,420
[I want to get points.]

282
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,410
We don't play games by mouth.

283
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,490
[Let me remind you of one thing,
Ji Xiang Kong's nickname is Klutz.]

284
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,520
This...

285
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,350
What's going on?

286
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,720
It seems like

287
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,410
I've picked the wrong teammate again.

288
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,030
It's okay.

289
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:48,980
Stay calm.

290
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:50,700
You'll respawn soon. Keep playing.

291
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,540
Let me check for you.

292
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,840
Brother Kong!

293
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,680
Why did you come back?

294
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,270
Wang Bin told me that

295
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,230
because of you,

296
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,160
the captain is going to sign an agreement
to quit esports with our company.

297
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,310
What should we do?

298
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,590
You should hurry over there.

299
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,700
They're attacking you again! Run!

300
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,670
Oh no.

301
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,470
Take it easy.

302
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,230
I lost again.

303
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,490
It's killing me. What did it say here?

304
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,370
I'll run you through.

305
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:24,960
Hurry up!

306
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,850
Ji Xiang Kong.

307
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,620
An esports player with a pretty face.

308
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,160
The weak link of Legends.

309
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,370
The shame of iConquer in China.

310
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,030
This guy is known for being a klutz.

311
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,630
Even the mid-tier team wouldn't take him.

312
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,730
-He's that bad?
-Tell me about it.

313
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:38,660
How did he even get into Legends?

314
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,620
Away from keyboard?

315
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,350
He's away from the keyboard?

316
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,480
Ji Xiang Kong is a scum.

317
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,400
Even if he's away from the keyboard,
I can't give up.

318
00:19:57,690 --> 00:19:58,690
Quick, Qiu Ying!

319
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,890
Qiao Xin is alone now!

320
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,720
Now's our chance!

321
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,150
Attack her!

322
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:02,730
I'll be there now.

323
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,410
Go!

324
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,720
Hit her!

325
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,340
You want to beat me?

326
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,280
I'll win this thing for sure!

327
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,110
Oh no, Pei Xi is on your tail again.

328
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,730
What kind of dark horse player is he?

329
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,110
He's a professional player
and yet he's picking on a girl.

330
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,560
I bet he's an ugly, creepy caveman
who doesn't know any better.

331
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,890
Right, he must be a middle-aged man
who's afraid to face the world.

332
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,050
Gu Fang, you've joined
Legends for so many years.

333
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,410
I really hate to see you leave.

334
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:34,880
Thank you for your care
throughout the years.

335
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,800
There's nothing much
I can do for the team.

336
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,240
The future of the team
is dependent on Chairman Jin,

337
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,760
Coach Luo and Manager Zhao.

338
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,700
Okay.

339
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,550
I hope you remember that

340
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,110
Legends will always be your home.

341
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,660
Don't sign!

342
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,190
Xiang Kong, what are you doing?

343
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,150
This unfair contract agreement
will make you leave esports forever!

344
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,150
I don't care what you're doing this for!

345
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,340
You're Gu Fang! You must stay
in esports even after you retire!

346
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,950
Stay out of this.

347
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,250
Ji Xiang Kong,

348
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,070
Gu Fang's put so much thought and effort

349
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,640
to make you the captain.

350
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,150
You shouldn't throw a tantrum
like a kid here.

351
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,050
If this is how I'll get the position,
I'd rather not be captain.

352
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,270
Xiang Kong, this is
not a time for rash actions.

353
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,760
Do you not believe me?

354
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,110
Of course I believe you!

355
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,910
If so, you should listen to me.

356
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,030
If I can make Legends
win the closed beta test,

357
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,600
you'll let me be the captain.

358
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,860
If I lose,

359
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,820
I'll quit.

360
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,300
Ji Xiang Kong.

361
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,350
Don't let your ego do the thinking.

362
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,560
You'll be held accountable
for what you said.

363
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,000
Sure, I believe you.

364
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,210
Prove your abilities.

365
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,530
That's what it takes to be a captain.

366
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,470
That's all for today.

367
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,670
Thanks for watching.

368
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,160
See you next time.

369
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,040
Goodbye.

370
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,770
[Defeat.]

371
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,410
I'm so mad at him!

372
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,640
What kind of person is he?

373
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,390
What the hell is that?

374
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,410
It's all because of Ji Xiang Kong.

375
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,540
If he wasn't away from the keyboard,
we wouldn't have lost so badly.

376
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,290
But he didn't offer me any help either

377
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,350
when he was in the game.

378
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,490
This won't do.

379
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,130
If we don't teach him a lesson,
he'd see us as pushovers!

380
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,170
Yi Yi, where are you going?

381
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,080
I'm going to beat him up!

382
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,590
I'll go with you.

383
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,210
It makes no difference
whether I stay in esports or not.

384
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,380
You were acting too rashly.

385
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,920
Captain,

386
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:42,310
I can't stay behind you forever
and have you take the storm for me.

387
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,510
Right, I heard Zhao Yang
is trying to sign over Pei Xi from VNG.

388
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,610
What?

389
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,770
Coach Shu is not an ordinary person.

390
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,230
He won't be able to steal him easily.

391
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:01,300
The rest is up to you now.

392
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,920
Don't worry, Captain.

393
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,230
Goodbye, then.

394
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,960
Good luck.

395
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,350
All right, I've got work to do.

396
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,350
Bye.

397
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:20,820
Brother Kong.

398
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,900
Are you really going to
leave the team if we lose?

399
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,080
Why?

400
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:29,550
Do you not believe me?

401
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:31,940
Of course I believe you.

402
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,520
Ji Xiang Kong!

403
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,900
What's going on?

404
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,470
I guess they are coming after me
because I went away from the keyboard.

405
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,820
You go ahead. I'll take care of things.

406
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,150
-Can you handle the two of them?
-No problem.

407
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,510
-Bye, then.
-Don't worry.

408
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,340
You're running away? Stop there!

409
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,600
Over there!

410
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,580
Stop.

411
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:58,830
Get out of the way!

412
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,420
No, wait a minute!

413
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,690
Stop!

414
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,090
-Who are you?
-My name is Lin Yi Xuan.

415
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,890
-You don't need to know who I am.
-I don't care who you are!

416
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,230
-Yi Yi.
-Let's go!

417
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:08,750
-Get back here!
-Yi Yi!

418
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,530
Qiu Ying, go get Ji Xiang Kong!
I'll take care of this guy!

419
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,110
-Hang in there!
-Don't you dare go!

420
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,430
What's wrong with you?

421
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,470
Why are you yelling?

422
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,320
Take this!

423
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,250
Listen, I don't hit girls.

424
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,110
You don't hit girls?

425
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,140
Perfect! But I don't mind hitting guys!

426
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,900
Don't hurt me!

427
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,390
I'll fight back!

428
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,200
Tell me your name.

429
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,500
Stop hitting me!

430
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,550
I'll fight back!

431
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,970
What are you doing?

432
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,940
Tell me why you did that.

433
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,190
Did what?

434
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,300
The duo queue.

435
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,800
Everyone was watching the game,
yet you didn't help me at all.

436
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,160
Do you know how humiliating it was?

437
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,780
You're talking about the duo queue.

438
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,690
You asked me to play duo queue with you
but I never said I would protect you.

439
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,200
I thought you were good

440
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:58,670
and wanted to make it harder
by playing with me.

441
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:02,020
Fine, even if you're
not obligated to protect me,

442
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,740
you should at least finish the game.

443
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,030
Why did you leave?

444
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,810
Something came up. I'm being honest.

445
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,790
Something came up?

446
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,280
Fine, Ji Xiang Kong.

447
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:19,990
You think it's fun messing with me, is it?

448
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,880
What are you doing?

449
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,010
Now we're even.

450
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,890
Are you crazy?

451
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,230
You shouldn't have messed with me.

452
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,870
Yes, I was messing with you. So what?

453
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,580
I just wanted to see
how far you'd go with it.

454
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,370
Are you going to cry again?

455
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,400
Your tears are so worthless!

456
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,460
Didn't you say you want to transform?

457
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,920
What have you done for that?

458
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:00,830
All you did was try to suck up to us.

459
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,330
That's all you did, isn't it?

460
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,100
You don't know anything, Ji Xiang Kong!

461
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,540
Yes, I don't know anything!

462
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,900
I've seen many of your kind
who suck up to others to gain popularity!

463
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,900
But you, you're the best of all of them!

464
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,310
Ji Xiang Kong, you jerk!

465
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,890
Yes, I'm a jerk!

466
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,840
You're sucking up to the wrong person!

467
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,390
Here's a piece of advice.

468
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,860
We don't need people
like you in the esports industry.

469
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,860
Get out of the way!

470
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,230
Don't be upset about it.

471
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,250
Lucky for him.

472
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:02,410
Next time I'll grab him and
let you give him a good beating.

473
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,070
Cheer up.

474
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,080
It's all my fault.

475
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:11,590
I've embarrassed myself.

476
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,670
I deserved that.

477
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,570
I said I'm going to
succeed on my own merit.

478
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,550
But from the time when
I was in Vancouver until today,

479
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,000
I still know nothing about esports.

480
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,990
What makes me think
I can get ahead by taking shortcuts?

481
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:32,550
You're going around in circles.

482
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,900
I've spent all night in vain
trying to persuade you.

483
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,590
Alright, we have to work tomorrow.

484
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,410
Go home and get some rest.

485
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,690
I'll go back on my own.

486
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,390
Fine.

487
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,820
Figure it out yourself then.

488
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,160
I'll go home first.

489
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,430
Don't worry.

490
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,270
Bye.

491
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:14,350
She's a girl after all.

492
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,540
It's so heartless of you to trick her.

493
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:20,620
Who are you talking about?

494
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,340
Nothing.

495
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:24,740
Just a keyboard warrior.

496
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,200
What happened to your arm?

497
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:27,980
I don't want to talk about it.

498
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,500
I was nearly killed by
the madwoman next to Qiu Ying.

499
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,410
Wait.

500
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,470
I need to give you a piece of my mind.

501
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,280
You can't trick her like that.

502
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,830
She has ambition,

503
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,690
that's why she tried so hard
to work at the iConquer section.

504
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,220
Qiu Ying is a girl after all.

505
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:49,740
It wasn't easy for her.

506
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,910
Fine, offer your help to her then.

507
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,740
I'd love to do that,
but she's not interested in me.

508
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:02,230
I'm warning you,
don't go out with girls like her.

509
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,570
You won't even know
when she's sold you out.

510
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,390
[Forty-four.]

511
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,530
Forty-five.

512
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,900
Forty-six.

513
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,740
Come on.

514
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,040
Forty-seven.

515
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,560
Mom, I can't do it anymore.

516
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,620
Really?

517
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,330
Come, have some water first.

518
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,300
Xiao Ying, all the children
who take part in

519
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,730
the New Year's performance
have to be the best,

520
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:50,470
right?

521
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:55,520
That's why you must strive
to be the best of them.

522
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,180
Don't be afraid of hardships.

523
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,880
And don't be lazy.

524
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:03,040
Well, we have three more to go.

525
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,650
Hang in there and finish it, will you?

526
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:09,260
Come on, I believe you. You can do it.

527
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,440
Forty-eight.

528
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,190
Forty-nine.

529
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,730
Come on, Xiao Ying. Last one.

530
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,680
Fifty.

531
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,350
You're amazing!

532
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,800
Xiao Ying, are you hungry?

533
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,690
Yes, I am.

534
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,160
What would you like to eat?

535
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,490
I'm sorry I let you down.

536
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,180
Thirty seconds left.

537
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,050
Be careful, Carry.

538
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,890
Someone's hiding in the grass.

539
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,370
They're coming after you.

540
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,830
-There's someone hiding in the grass.
-Okay.

541
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,170
Take a look at the view of the river.

542
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,050
-Be careful, Mid.
-Okay.

543
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,380
Okay, top laner.

544
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,150
Top went to mid lane.

545
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,820
Be careful, Mid.

546
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,840
The opponent Mid has
30 seconds for cool down.

547
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,120
Manager Zhao, the organizer of
closed beta test has made some changes.

548
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,410
Don't let them know that they will
be fighting against Newland tomorrow.

549
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,060
I'll see what they can do.

550
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,740
You didn't even look at it,
how did you know the opponent is Newland?

551
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,430
Did you...

552
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:37,170
How else could they possibly
have changed their opponent?

553
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,660
That's awesome, Manager Zhao.

554
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,240
Coach.

555
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,110
The first game is VNG versus Dragons.

556
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,410
The second game is Legends versus Newland?

557
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:03,480
Coach, didn't we always fight with Dragon?

558
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,130
Why has it changed to Newland?

559
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:08,889
The organizer couldn't have
done this without informing us.

560
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:17,050
It must be Zhao Yang.

561
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,100
It's quite a big trap.

562
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,440
Manager Zhao, look.

563
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,610
The organizer's changed
the schedule without informing us.

564
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:28,719
What should we do?

565
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,830
Yes, we can't play
without adjusting tactics.

566
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,820
We'll lose for sure.

567
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,370
My god, when did they adjust the schedule?

568
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,770
Wang Bin, did you
get any messages from them?

569
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,760
No.

570
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:42,290
Coach Luo, you didn't
receive any message either?

571
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:43,219
What message?

572
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,510
They never informed us.

573
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:45,900
This...

574
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,389
We'd been practicing
to fight against Dragons.

575
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,580
What should we do now?

576
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,949
I know.

577
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:54,320
What are you doing here?
Go and ask about it!

578
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,010
I'll talk to them now.

579
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,210
No way, we can't win at this point.

580
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,110
We'd practiced our strategies,
but they suddenly changed our opponent.

581
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,240
We can't fight. We won't win.

582
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,040
It'll all be in vain.

583
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,030
Why are we even here?

584
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,240
Manager Zhao, do something.

585
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,010
I understand.

586
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,760
Don't worry.

587
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,100
Look, I gave Wang Bin something
to do and it turned out like this.

588
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,380
Don't worry.

589
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,990
I'll talk to them myself.

590
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,860
Wait for my call, okay?

591
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,980
Manager Zhao, you must speak for us.

592
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,650
Okay.

593
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,160
We're counting on you.

594
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,010
We trust you!

595
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,960
Thanks, Manager Zhao.

596
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,340
Good luck!
