Actually, I still don't understand.

6
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,770
Why did you refuse Pei Xi?

7
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,750
Do you really not understand?

8
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,090
Is it because that you don't like
Pei Xi's solo play style?

9
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,840
I don't dislike it,
but it doesn't suit us.

10
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,850
But right now, he is the
strongest player in the league.

11
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,010
So many teams want to recruit him.

12
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,150
Besides, he insists on
teaming up with you.

13
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,370
It's an opportunity.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,420
Pei Xi is too individualistic.

15
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:21,020
When he was in Legends,
Coach Luo told him about this.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,880
But, he is still unwilling to change.

17
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,329
You can help him.

18
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,320
You've helped Tong Wu and Lu Sheng too.

19
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
You said everyone has shortcomings.

20
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,280
That's why I want him
to see his shortcomings for real...

21
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,610
so that he will change
from the bottom of his heart.

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,070
There's no perfect strategy.

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,160
There are only teams
that practice trust...

to complement each other.

25
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,540
But, what if your refusal
makes him give up?

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,000
He won't.

27
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,900
Judging from his personality, no one
can stop him when he's decided.

28

that you arranged this.

169
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,950
You invited all the fans.

170
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,290
He can't keep a secret.

171
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,650
Anyway, I must thank both of you.

172
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,680
Thank you for helping me
find Phenix's first member.

173
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,790
I know you refused me.

174
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,070
But, I still want to join Phenix.

175
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,290
In this season, except for Phenix,

176
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,710
I'm not going anywhere.

177
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:09,340
What if Phenix really can't accept you?

178
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,850
No matter what position you give me,

179
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,120
I will try my best.

180
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,070
-No matter what position?
-Yes.

181
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,310
Even if it's just a training mate?

182
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,200
Will you do it?

183
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,080
Okay, deal.

184
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,670
A training mate in Phenix.

185
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,670
[The King]

186
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,210
Five of us have finally reunited.

187
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,370
Yeah, it's either you or you who's absent.

188
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,450
Shouldn't you thank me today?

189
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:51,770
Yes, thank you.

190
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,020
Should I introduce you a girlfriend?

191
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:56,690
I don't believe in your judgment.

192
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,490
Summer, you never say anything nice.

193
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
Brother Summer.

194
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,000
Here's to you.

195
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,890
You're done a reliable job this time.

196
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,740
Hey, you sound like
I've never been reliable.

197
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,570
No, you're always reliable.

198
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,480
You've got a silver tongue.

199
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,470
Brother.

200
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,890
Brother.

201
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,780
Wait.

202
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,390
What did you call me?

203
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,200
I called you Brother.

204
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,810
No, no, no.

205
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:27,430
Whenever you get so friendly,

206
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,750
I always have a bad feeling.

207
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,220
I want to use Dream Traveler
as Phenix's training base.

208
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,360
You're not even in the team.

209
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,290
Why are you helping them?

210
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,920
I am a member of Phenix now.

211
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,670
Allow me to announce...

212
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,870
that I am a member of Phenix.

213
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,300
A training mate.

214
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,150
Ji Xiang Kong.

215
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,170
You made my cousin your training mate?

216
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,569
No, Brother Summer. Listen to me.

217
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,680
About this, he...

218
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,270
I agreed out of my own will.

219
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,020
As long as I can join Phenix.

220
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:19,359
Is there something wrong
with your brain, kid?

221
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:21,069
Did he drug you?

222
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,069
I'm not capable of that.

223
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,839
Okay.

224
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,369
Enough of that.

225
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,560
Pei Xi said he did it voluntarily.

226
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,690
Just let him be.

227
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,300
Yes.

228
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Phenix is lacking a training base now.

229
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,480
Why don't we give them
our training base as a gift?

230
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,870
So, Dream Traveler...

231
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,550
God.

232
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,610
My cousin has degraded
into a training mate,

233
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,540
and now I have to give
Dream Traveler away.

234
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:52,450
He's a leech.

235
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,880
Forget about Dream Traveler.

236
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,180
Xiang Kong.

237
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,010
I want to represent the Pioneers...

238
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,600
to give you our training base.

239
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,880
What about it? Any objections?

240
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,970
No, as long as it's not Dream Traveler.

241
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,710
Of course not.

242
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,010
I'm so happy.

243
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,130
Here.

244
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,770
Is this mine now?

245
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:18,670
Here's hoping Phenix
will win as soon as possible!

246
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,170
-A toast to all!
-Yeah!

247
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,840
Come on, Captain!

248
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,370
-Xuan?
-Xiang Kong.

249
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,580
Yi Xuan, you're here. Come.

250
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,040
Sit down.

251
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,870
Hi, Captain. Hi, Brother Sun.

252
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,230
Hi, Mr. Luo.
Hi, Brother Summer. Hi, Sister Wen.

253
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,930
I bought some fruits,
but I don't know if it's enough.

254
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,540
So thoughtful of you.

255
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,000
Put it here.

256
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,300
Brother Kong.

257
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,370
You built a new team?

258
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,550
Why didn't you tell me?

259
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,590
Why is Pei Xi here?

260
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,790
I'm a member of Phenix now.

261
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,560
You recruited him, but not me.

262
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,370
Do you think I'm not as good as him?

263
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,070
Xuan, you got it wrong.

264
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,800
We didn't tell you because I know...

265
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,070
you would support us, right?

266
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:43,270
Besides, we can't
afford your transfer fee.

267
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,500
I paid the penalty myself.

268
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,490
Xuan.

269
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,180
If you stay in Legends,

270
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,840
you can enter the world finals.

271
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,530
If you go with me,

272
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,940
you will have to start anew.

273
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,440
I don't want you to take such a big risk.

274
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,640
Well, Brother Kong.

275
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:24,700
My biggest dream in this life...

276
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,480
is to play on the same team with you...

277
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,670
and win together.

278
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,220
The penalty fees...

279
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,570
I will figure a way too.

280
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,020
No need to worry.

281
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,250
Xuan.

282
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:48,150
Xuan!

283
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,070
Leave him, you know his temper.

284
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,850
Let him calm down.

285
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,120
We'll talk to him later.

286
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,170
You really don't know how to speak.

287
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,820
I just told the truth.

288
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,570
You know if it's the truth or not.

289
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,860
[The King]

290
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,730
You're all sending me off?

291
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,270
I don't need the grand treatment.

292
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,820
Shu Wen, you can't go.

293
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,170
Go upstairs...

294
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,460
and help Brother Yi clean up.

295
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,430
It's been so long since you met.

296
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,760
You guys, wise up.

297
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,390
-Just go.
-Go.

298
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,030
Bye.

299
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,350
-Go home.
-Bye.

300
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,360
Stay safe on the road.

301
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,080
If there's nothing else, I'm going too.

302
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,210
-Let me send him off.
-Bye.

303
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:35,370
Master.

304
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,450
Drive slowly.

305
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,890
I've watched your review video this week.

306
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,270
Your overall perception has improved.

307
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,030
Really?

308
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,050
I was worried since
I was occupied with work,

309
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,010
and that the video would look haphazard.

310
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,530
It must be hard to be the team manager.

311
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,950
You have to learn many things
and lead the whole team.

312
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,740
If you come across any problems,

313
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,140
ask me anytime.

314
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,430
Don't worry.

315
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,850
if problems find apprentice,
the master won't be let off easily

316
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,750
Right.

317
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,020
I'm still investigating the strategy leak.

318
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,680
As soon as I receive any news,
I will inform you at once.

319
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,290
Actually, whether they find the truth
or not doesn't matter anymore.

320
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,030
At least,

321
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,550
I've made such good friends.

322
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,780
The things I learned in GDV...

323
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,440
will be useful when I help
Xiang Kong manage the team.

324
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,000
Okay.

325
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,690
Ji Xiang Kong is very lucky
to have a girlfriend like you.

326
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,350
I'm leaving.

327
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,770
Brother Sun, it's late.

328
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,030
I have to go as well.

329
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,040
Why are you smirking?

330
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,500
Sister Wen, bye.
Brother Sun, bye.

331
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,790
Sister Wen, bye.

332
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,990
-Stay safe.
-Okay.

333
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,480
Tell me when you reach home.

334
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,300
Bye.

335
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,990
Your buddies left right
after eating everything.

336
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:28,700
I'll help you tidy up.

337
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,700
Shu Wen.

338
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,400
Stop cleaning.

339
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,250
You've been busy the whole day.

340
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,660
It's late. I'll send you back.

341
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,070
What do you mean?

342
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,820
Driving me away?

343
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,050
No, I didn't mean that.

344
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,470
This afternoon, didn't you say
you had something to explain?

345
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,070
Tell me. I want to hear now.

346
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,810
I underestimated everything back then.

347
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,580
I thought that after
you win the championships...

348
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,740
You dare cheekily to
mention the championships?

349
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,800
Do you know this?

350
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,340
On the evening we won,

351
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,390
I cried the whole night.

352
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:38,370
I felt so sad.

353
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,820
I was alone.

354
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,990
Alone outside.

355
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,740
Without you.

356
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,450
What's the point of winning?

357
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:56,660
I know about every single day
you spent in Vancouver.

358
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,370
I asked someone to
take care of you for me.

359
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,970
But in the end...

360
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,520
You're gone.

361
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,270
The moment I lost you, I realized that...

362
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,620
I had no chance to find you again.

363
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,270
Shu Wen, sorry.

364
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,590
Do you still love me?

365
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,120
All these years,

366
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
other than you,

367
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,200
I've never loved anyone.

368
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:00,770
Sun Ze Yi.

369
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,540
You're a jerk.

370
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,820
Come on, let's start!

371
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,620
Wait.

372
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:51,150
What are these?

373
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,520
It's dirty inside.

374
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,680
Thank you.

375
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,120
I don't need it.

376
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:01,870
Pei Xi.

377
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,350
How about this?

378
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,820
If you really think it's too dirty here,

379
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,050
you can wait for us at the yard outside.

380
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,590
After we finish cleaning here,

381
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,120
we will call you in, okay?

382
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,050
No.

383
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,950
Okay.

384
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:21,890
Xiang Kong.

385
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,810
Did Pei Xi really agree
to be our training mate?

386
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,240
What else? I'm not capable of forcing him.

387
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:33,740
But, we all know Pei Xi's capabilities.

388
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,320
To join Phenix,

389
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,770
he's even willing to be
just a training mate.

390
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,640
You still don't plan to accept him?

391
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:45,070
But at this moment, he's not the
most suitable candidate I have in mind.

392
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,940
Finally, it's done!

393
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,890
I'm almost done here too.

394
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,220
Done cleaning?

395
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,470
Lunch is ready, come down and eat.

396
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,720
I smell something delicious. I'm starving.

397
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:13,970
Smells delicious.

398
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,610
I can't wait.

399
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,580
Dig in.

400
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:20,570
It's so delicious.

401
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:24,770
Nice.

402
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,090
Thank you, Xiang Kong,

403
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,990
for making me come back here.

404
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:40,400
Brother Sun, why are you thanking me?

405
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:41,720
You belong to this place.

406
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,080
Right, Brother Sun.

407
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,070
Did you live in that room?

408
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,390
Yes, I used to live there.

409
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,890
Okay, you'll continue staying there.

410
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,750
I'll stay in the room
beside the training room.

411
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,700
Pei Xi, choose one.

412
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,360
Which room are you staying?

413
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,680
Me?

414
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,200
Anywhere, I guess.
I'll stay next to Brother Sun's room.

415
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,280
Okay.

416
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:10,950
Help me get a bed.

417
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:12,450
I'll live with him.

418
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,220
No!

419
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,330
Why do you want to live with me?

420
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,640
Qiu Ying will be jealous.

421
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,220
Yes.

422
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,970
Okay. I'll move the bed myself, then.

423
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,750
I must stay with you.

424
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,120
Pei Xi. I'll get jealous.

425
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,740
Well...

426
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,320
-Why does he want to stay with me?
-Pei Xi!

427
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,030
You're practicing?

428
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:51,320
Don't look at me. I'm getting nervous.

429
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:55,990
Why did you choose this?

430
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,860
The Blazing Rod looks so pretty.

431
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,020
It is beautiful, but it's useless.

432
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,050
Only a multiplied effect would work,
at least three rods.

433
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,970
I don't care, it's beautiful.

434
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:14,870
Look, so beautiful.

435
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,140
It's like fireworks.

436
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,310
Do you like fireworks?

437
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,600
Which girl doesn't like them?

438
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,270
Whenever I see fireworks,

439
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:34,770
I feel like the whole
world is lit up for me.

440
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,910
Then, don't you feel lit up now?

441
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,710
[Xia Ling, when will you join
us for a game of iConquer?]

442
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,980
[Yeah, you're a master!]

443
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,170
[When will you carry us?]

444
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,000
Son.

445
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,250
Are you hungry? Here, eat something.

446
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,220
I'm not hungry.

447
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,850
Impossible.

448
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,760
You didn't eat much for lunch.

449
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,800
Eat up.

450
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,290
I want to be alone, okay?

451
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:16,750
What's wrong?

452
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,470
He still won't eat?

453
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,110
The transfer window will be
closed in less than a month.

454
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,830
We need to build a full team quickly.

455
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,730
Actually, I think these
few players are all great.

456
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,420
Why don't you consider them again?

457
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,940
Besides, they're all top national players.

458
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,520
This guy and this have agreed to join us.

459
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,350
Think again.

460
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,639
Actually, those players
don't have anything special.

461
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,139
It's just my opinion. Forget it.

462
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,770
But, our situation is that...

463
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:21,310
first, we can't pay them
a satisfactory salary.

464
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,320
Second, we're a new team.

465
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,210
The fact that we can attract top
national players is good enough.

466
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,800
Or, we can call them
and practice together.

467
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,420
But, I think Pei Xi is right.

468
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,760
There's nothing special about them.

469
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,389
They are not who we're looking for.

470
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,000
Right.

471
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,440
There's one person
you might be interested in.

472
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,020
Who?

473
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:09,320
Let's check.
ID number 409.

474
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,510
He climbed the ladder
since half a month ago.

475
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,230
He kept winning, and he's now
number four in the country.

476
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:18,260
However, this guy is mysterious.

477
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,760
Every time I send him a message,

478
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:20,850
he won't reply.

479
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:23,470
No one knows who he is.

480
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,110
He's online. Invite him to a solo game.

481
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,230
Let me try.

482
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,030
We'll use your account.

483
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:35,300
He always refuses me when I invite him.

484
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,500
Wait and see.

485
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,900
He's in!

486
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,590
You've got the charm, I guess.

487
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,020
I'll try sparring with him.

488
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,860
His equipment setup is quite thoughtful.

489
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,640
He uses consumables in the
early game to get experience.

490
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,420
Not bad.

491
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,670
Impressive.

492
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
He's strong in laning.

493
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,400
He's also got a flexible
setup and strategy.

494
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,350
He's also increasing
his net worth steadily.

495
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,340
Very effective.

496
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,640
[That's all you got?
You don't deserve Qiu Ying.]

497
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,400
Looks like he's your fan.

498
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,530
I'll talk to him.

499
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,620
Here.

500
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,770
Hello, 409.

501
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,100
I am Qiu Ying.

502
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,920
Wait and see.

503
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,190
409, I am Qiu Ying.

504
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,050
Do you want to meet?

505
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,020
[No.]

506
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,070
He's not my fan either.

507
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,940
If I get a chance to meet
him, I won't go easy.

508
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,550
I think he's great.

509
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,060
Is there any way to contact him?

510
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,800
I can ask about him in Dream Traveler.

511
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,800
Right, you can ask your cousin.

512
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,320
He's not answering.

513
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,180
Hello?

514
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,250
Ying.

515
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:19,650
Do you have time?

516
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,370
I want to talk to you about Xia Ling.

517
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,870
What's wrong with Xia Ling?

518
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,560
What's wrong with Xia Ling?

519
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,490
Did something happen to his leg again?

520
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,670
Sit down.

521
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,160
What's wrong with him?

522
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:43,120
When he video called me
yesterday, he said he's good.

523
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:44,740
He was lying.

524
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,120
In the future,

525
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,660
he can't play basketball any more.

526
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,510
His nervus peroneus communis
has been damaged.

527
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,250
He can't do intense sports.

528
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:00,500
He didn't want you to feel guilty,
so he wanted me to keep it from you.

529
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,170
Then...

530
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,390
What about normal walking?

531
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,770
Normal walking should be fine.

532
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,500
But now, he has to rely
on his walking stick.

533
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,620
Will he use a stick
for the rest of his life?

534
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,050
No.

535
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,110
The doctor said that...

536
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,890
since he's young, he will recover soon.

537
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,500
The problem now...

538
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,290
lies in his mentality.

539
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,750
Mentality?

540
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,150
He is like a different person now.

541
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,050
He coops himself in his room all day.

542
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,120
He speaks no more than
three sentences with us every day.

543
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,020
He wouldn't meet his
friends even when they visit.

544
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,970
Auntie Xia and I are so worried now.

545
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,500
We really don't know what to do.

546
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:05,260
He is so young,

547
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,800
yet he's already so disheartened.

548
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:07,970
What about his future?

549
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,740
After thinking about it,

550
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,670
I'm afraid that he
might only listen to you.

551
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:19,920
Why don't you advise him?

552
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,390
I'll go there right away.

553
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,540
Not now. Auntie Xia is at home.

554
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,070
What about tomorrow?

555
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,100
[Listen, Ying.]

556
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,430
[If you leave the house now,]

557
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,220
[never come back again!]

558
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:51,110
You're here.

559
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,130
Come in.

560
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,920
Has Xia Ling got up?

561
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,270
He's in his room.

562
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,600
Well, you talk to him first.

563
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,950
I'll go out.

564
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,370
I've told you many times
to leave me alone...

565
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,100
Sister?

566
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:42,470
Why are you here?

567
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,940
Can I come in and talk to you?

568
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,820
Sure.

569
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,800
My leg is recovering soon.

570
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,320
Can you stop pretending?

571
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,270
Do you plan to stay in this room
for your whole life?

572
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,670
Did Dad tell you something?

573
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,860
Xia Ling.

574
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,550
Aren't you going to tell me the truth?

575
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,760
Sister, don't think too much.

576
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:01,930
I'm fine.

577
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,250
I know.

578
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:08,130
Even if I blame myself and feel guilty,

579
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,020
I can't change reality.

580
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:13,850
But, I really hope you
can pull yourself together...

581
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,050
and become the cheerful
boy you used to be.

582
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:23,770
I will.

583
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:25,550
Take it easy.

584
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:29,070
How can I be relieved
when I see you like this?

585
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:39,290
Right, have they investigated
the truth behind the leak?

586
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:44,670
iConquer's committee
is still investigating.

587
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,470
But I've already resigned from GDV.

588
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,700
I built a new team with Ji Xiang Kong.

589
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,340
You're playing iConquer too?

590
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,540
Why don't I bring you to my
new team and look around?

591
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,330
Ji Xiang Kong and Pei Xi are all there.

592
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,390
You can ask them anything.

593
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,470
Okay?

594
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:25,620
No.

595
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,450
I'm crippled now.

596
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,970
I can't do anything
except causing trouble.

597
00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:38,270
Xia Ling.

598
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:48,390
Here, come.

599
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:50,370
I was worried that...

600
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,340
the food would get cold
if you come any later.

601
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:55,760
I'll pour some vinegar.

602
00:45:57,250 --> 00:45:59,090
I ordered your
favourite steamed dumplings.

603
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:00,920
Dig in.

604
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,420
Well? Did you talk to him?

605
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,370
He's still clammed up.

606
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,050
I wanted to take him for a walk,

607
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:13,590
but he refused.

608
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:18,720
It's already great that he talked to you.

609
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,270
But, don't worry.

610
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,720
I will visit him when I have time.

611
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,260
Did you resign from GDV?

612
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:40,990
How did you know?

613
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,270
Your news were all over the Internet.

614
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,540
You can't be a commentator
anymore after you quit?

615
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:57,390
I am building a team
with Ji Xiang Kong.

616
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,490
I will also find the truth...

617
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,590
about the strategy leak.

618
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,620
One day, I will return to the podium.

619
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:14,320
So, is Ji Xiang Kong your boyfriend?

620
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,500
Great, he looks reliable.

621
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:27,680
He's different from what they say online.

622
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,000
It's about time you get a boyfriend too.

623
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,540
Remember this.

624
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,350
Observe his character, it's important.

625
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,820
I know.

626
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,770
I need to buy some groceries.

627
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:53,410
Now, eat up.

628
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,800
I'm leaving.
