[Episode 20]

4
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,690
You'll still miss if you aim like that.

5
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,280
You still come to this archery place
like you used to whenever you're stressed.

6
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,610
It's a crucial battle for VNG tomorrow.

7
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,180
If we lose,
we won't get to enter the championship.

8
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,210
Though I support Xiang Kong's tactics,

9
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,720
I'm still not confident that we can win.

10
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,690
You're not superwoman.
Don't push yourself so hard.

11
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,540
Relax.

12
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,930
Hit the bull's eye in one shot.

13
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,260
You will win the competition tomorrow.

14
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Aim your target. Relax.

15
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,940
[I'm going to hit the bull's eye
with this shot.]

16
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,350
[Don't talk big.]

17
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,730
[That's why we will win the competition
tomorrow because I said so.]

18
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,940
[Look!]

19
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,950
[If we really win tomorrow, I'll treat you
to any food you want this month.]

20
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,030
[I don't want you to pay for food.]

21
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,570
[Then what do you want?]

22
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,160
[I want you to be my boyfriend.]

23
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,820
Thanks.

24
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,600
Just relax during the game.

25
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,630
Brother Kong, you look handsome today.

26
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,019
Handsome Ji,
I'm getting scared upon seeing you.

27
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,250
Pei Xi, heard what your teammate said?
Half the victory is already mine.

28
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,580
Bring it on then.

29
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,680
Make sure you keep an eye on them.
Don't go easy on me.

30
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:32,340
I know them like the back of my hand.
Don't blame me for showing no mercy.

31
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,580
Well, then that's all the more reason
for us not to go easy on you.

32
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,570
That's right.
See you at the bot lane, Brother Kong.

33
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,900
Gosh.

34
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,180
I've been looking forward to this day.

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,210
I hope you won't lose too quickly.

36
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,880
Let's see what you've got then.

37
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,490
-I'll get first blood later. You hear me?
-Alright, kids.

38
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,830
-Are you guys prepared?
-Yes.

39
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,590
We're well prepared.

40
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,150
Just relax. It's your show tonight.

41
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,150
-Got it.
-Good luck.

42
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,420
-Yes!
-Good luck.

43
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,310
Welcome, summoners,
to the Fall Championship Regular Season.

44
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,920
Today's game is highly anticipated.

45
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,040
It is a crucial game for VNG.

46
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,710
Now, let's look at the total points for
the 16 teams in the Regular Season so far.

47
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,500
Legends is the first in the standings,
while VNG is the last.

48
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,360
According to the rules,

49
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,550
if VNG loses another game,
they won't get to enter the playoffs.

50
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:40,159
Yes. Based on the points,
there is a huge gap between them.

51
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,260
Miracles can happen anytime in iConquer.

52
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,570
There is no eternal champion, but
everyone is headed for the championship.

53
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,909
But there's another major highlight today.

54
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,500
It's the first battle between Pei Xi
and Ji Xiang Kong after changing teams.

55
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,140
Moving on, let's welcome both teams!

56
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,370
Welcome!

57
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,340
So much enthusiasm from the crowd!

58
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,800
If that's the case,
let's hear it from the fans of VNG!

59
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,970
Fans of Legends, let me hear your screams!

60
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:39,270
To be honest, based on the current data,
I'm really worried for VNG.

61
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:45,630
But I saw their coaches,
Shu Wen and Li Gan, today.

62
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,850
They look calm.

63
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,270
I noticed that too. I wonder why.
Do they have a trump card?

64
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:59,330
Let us look forward to the exciting
performance from VNG and Legends.

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,200
The game officially starts now.

66
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,710
Team players, please take your seats.

67
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:27,450
Don't make a mistake
announcing the points later.

68
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,770
Don't worry. I've got it.

69
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,409
How come VNG changed positions?

70
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,159
Why is Lu Sheng playing Mid?

71
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,710
Is Ji Xiang Kong toying with VNG?

72
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,480
One more loss
and his reputation will be ruined.

73
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,700
It doesn't matter.
He doesn't have a good reputation anyway.

74
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:52,740
I just pity VNG.
They are going down because of him.

75
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,170
I'm sure Ji Xiang Kong has his reasons
for making adjustments.

76
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,660
Besides, no one knows Legends better
than him. I think VNG will win this game.

77
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:09,110
If that's the case,
that means Pei Xi knows VNG even better.

78
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,060
Qiu Ying,
Pei Xi has been pretty good to you.

79
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,280
-Why are you hoping that he'll lose?
-Exactly.

80
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,030
-Don't stir up nonsense.
-I didn't.

81
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,570
Brother Summer.

82
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,860
Let me ask you.

83
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,030
Who do you wish will win more?
Pei Xi or Ji Xiang Kong?

84
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,890
Pei Xi looks cold on the outside,
but he's actually a really warm guy.

85
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,659
Ji Xiang Kong is a nice guy too.

86
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,320
But he's popular with the ladies.
It's a little risky. What do you think?

87
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:40,130
Brother Summer.

88
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Actually, it doesn't matter to me
whether they lose or win.

89
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:47,480
It's not like they're giving me
the prize money. Right?

90
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,100
Holy moley! That's...

91
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,780
Brother Yi is here. Look after the bar.

92
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,640
Let's see.

93
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,180
VNG made some bold changes
in their composition.

94
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:16,260
But I think Lu Sheng
isn't comfortable playing Mid Laner yet.

95
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,140
So I think chances of VNG
turning the tables is low.

96
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,500
Not necessarily.

97
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,460
Don't forget. Ji Xiang Kong
is nicknamed Battlefield Trickster.

98
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:30,100
Since he changed tactics,
I believe he came prepared.

99
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,090
Besides, Lu Sheng played Mid Laner
in Newland three years ago.

100
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,850
I believe he can create miracles if his
teammates lay out a good attacking ground.

101
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,170
We look forward to Lu Sheng
showing us great skills and top condition.

102
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,550
And present us
with an exciting first match.

103
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,620
Alright.
Let's take a look at the bot lane.

104
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,920
Lin Yi Xuan attacked his former captain
right at the start.

105
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,850
He is mischievous.

106
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,080
Lin Yi Xuan that punk is fooling with me.

107
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,060
I just greeted Brother Kong.
Let's go together.

108
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,160
Sure, let's go. Let's gang up on him.

109
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,620
What...

110
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,450
Looks like Lu Sheng is playing Mid.
They've changed their team comp.

111
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,430
It could just be a strategy adjustment.

112
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,590
We must maintain capital in early game.

113
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,860
Shen Yue, follow me.

114
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,750
Relax, relax.

115
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,570
He used Shadow of Demons.

116
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,590
-It's a hit!
-Nice one!

117
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:36,550
He got it right. It seems
Lu Sheng has accurate predictions.

118
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,550
The captain got caught at the start.
What's going on?

119
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,050
I'm close to killing him.
Someone come gank him.

120
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,680
Qi Yue, go help him out.

121
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,090
He is badly injured now.

122
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,420
Relax. You're breaking
my momentum to save you.

123
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,750
Lu Sheng can't hold on any longer. Go now.

124
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,760
Looks like he's trying to counter-kill.

125
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,690
Pei Xi used Flying Double Waves.
He broke the ice.

126
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,160
-He earned first blood. Nice one!
-Brilliant!

127
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,970
-Nice!
-Well done.

128
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,570
-Qi Yue finally got there.
-It's way off.

129
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,470
-But he's too late.
-What's going on with Qi Yue?

130
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,290
If Qi Yue got there a little earlier,

131
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,830
What is he doing?

132
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,470
-they could have killed Pei Xi.
-Yes, what a shame.

133
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,980
But Pei Xi's move was brilliant.

134
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,470
Yes, that was amazing.

135
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,640
Sorry, captain. It was my fault.

136
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,030
It's fine. Clear soldiers first.
Don't attack.

137
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,230
Lu Sheng, stay put if you can't do it.

138
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm badly injured thanks to you.

139
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,630
Everyone farm for now. Don't attack.
Work on your FOV.

140
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,440
Tong Wu, give Mid-lane a hand.

141
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,940
-Okay.
-Look.

142
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,670
Support, Tong Wu,
has secretly reached Lu Sheng's side.

143
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,210
They have released the fog.

144
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,410
Looks like they're aiming at Pei Xi.

145
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,270
Do you have a good view on the jungle?
If not, stay put.

146
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,080
By the time you're done checking,
Pei Xi will be gone.

147
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,140
Shen Yue, let's go.

148
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,570
Captain, Qi Yue and Shen Yue
are coming through the fog in the jungle.

149
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,170
Lu Feng, Li Nan, cover me.

150
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,590
Don't gank them yet.
Get a clear view first.

151
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,690
Is this Ji Xiang Kong's strategy?
Always hiding under the tower.

152
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,340
Come on, Shen Yue.

153
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,290
Alright. I'll go first.

154
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,470
So sorry, rising Mid Laner.

155
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,340
Go!

156
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,270
It's a trap. What should we do, Qi Yue?
We're caught.

157
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,300
Tong Wu, help. There's three of them.

158
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,010
Don't go, Tong Wu. You'll be killed.

159
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,680
Are you leaving us to die now?

160
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,320
You two are badly injured.
It's no use even if he goes.

161
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,830
You don't trust us? Hurry up, Tong Wu!

162
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,740
Triple Kill! Nice one!

163
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,980
What a brilliant strategy
from Pei Xi's team.

164
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,310
As expected from
the new generation's Mid Laner.

165
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,050
As we can see, the fans are going crazy.

166
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,940
I can even hear them from here.

167
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,740
It feels as if they have already won.

168
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,920
Lu Sheng can't compete with
a world-class Mid Laner like Pei Xi.

169
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,300
Moreover, he chose Hell Emissary.

170
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,880
He can't master it at all.

171
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:04,610
He's lacking behind in capital.
There's no way he can win.

172
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,960
[Lu Sheng playing Mid isn't the problem.]

173
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,400
[I know. The problem is with Qi Yue,]

174
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,130
Sorry about that.

175
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,980
VNG is losing.
Come back to your senses already.

176
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,990
[It's alright. It's just the first round.
Don't worry.]

177
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,290
[I think it's better
that I don't bother him now.]

178
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,370
-Nice!
-Well done.

179
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,530
Stall for time.

180
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,150
It's okay. I'm clearing soldiers.

181
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,790
Lu Sheng, quickly clear soldiers.

182
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,040
-Okay.
-Return to base. Protect the tower.

183
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,330
Gather at Mid-lane.
Let's destroy the crystal.

184
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:03,100
-On my way.
-On my way.

185
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,740
I defeated Brother Kong just now.

186
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,160
Destroy the tower first.

187
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,140
What a bull strategy.

188
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,110
It's alright. Let's win the next round.

189
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,690
Go take a break.

190
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,390
Qi Yue, calm down.

191
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,290
Have confidence in yourself.

192
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,610
Everyone back to their former positions
for the next round.

193
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,600
But Lu Sheng is doing fine as Mid Laner.

194
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,930
This is an order, not a discussion.

195
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,100
Mr. Li. If you and Sister Wen
made me captain,

196
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,640
-then trust me.
-Ji Xiang Kong.

197
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,060
Next round is the deciding match.
It's crucial.

198
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,170
VNG has never lost in Regular Season.

199
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,720
I thought you didn't know it was crucial.

200
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,230
Answer me. Who told you to gank Pei Xi?

201
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:23,250
He's strong in early game. If we...

202
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,190
So you acted on your own?

203
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,750
Doing that equals to a suicide.

204
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,590
And you, Tong Wu.

205
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,360
Why did you go when you know it's useless?

206
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,840
No one is allowed to act
on their own in the next rounds.

207
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:53,260
Anyone who defies orders will be benched.

208
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,050
I know everyone got impatient
because you're eager to win.

209
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,890
Let's keep our heads up
and play steadily in the next round.

210
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,910
Then we'll have a chance to win.

211
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,140
The first game was only an appetizer.

212
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,280
The second round
will be the deciding match.

213
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,270
Will Legends get to keep at
their Mid Laner legend,

214
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,560
or will VNG turn the tables?

215
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,460
Let's begin the pick-ban session
for the second round.

216
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,890
Okay, let's have a look.

217
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,640
VNG snatched Xin right away.

218
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,060
We saw Pei Xin's strategy earlier.

219
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,190
This Champion usually appears
in the four-protect-one comp.

220
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,630
Are you saying that VNG could likely
be playing four-protect-one?

221
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,260
It's hard to say.

222
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,340
Ji Xiang Kong is nicknamed
Battlefield Trickster.

223
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,970
So any tactic is possible.

224
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:44,170
You've got a point.

225
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,510
Let's continue to have a look at
the Champion selections.

226
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,390
See that? Pei Xi chose
his favourite Champion, Hell Emissary.

227
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,850
VNG is going to be destroyed
in this round.

228
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,240
Exactly. Look at that team comp.
They've obviously given up.

229
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,780
Not necessarily.

230
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,780
Ji Xiang Kong
is the Battlefield Trickster.

231
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,980
Qiu Ying.

232
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:08,589
Pei Xi always looked out for you.
Why are you supporting his enemy?

233
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,079
I...

234
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,550
You don't understand.

235
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,500
Qiu Ying is drawing the line
between personal and work affairs.

236
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,900
She picked the side she likes.

237
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
What do you know?

238
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,990
I'm just stating facts.

239
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,119
The best Legends can do
is play four-protect-one.

240
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,150
-Want to bet?
-Fine. Let's bet.

241
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:30,370
If VNG wins, you have
to buy milk tea for everyone here.

242
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,620
-Okay. Deal!
-That's right.

243
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,510
Let's wait and see.

244
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:48,140
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

245
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,350
Move over.

246
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,310
What are you doing here?

247
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,930
I have the same question for you.

248
00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:03,590
Seeing you here is harder
than winning the lottery.

249
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:15,730
Did you come to see the game or someone?

250
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:21,050
I came to see Xiang Kong's game.
Is that a problem?

251
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,690
Not at all. The view here isn't good.

252
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,130
I can take you to the coach's
seating area. Come on.

253
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,340
You seriously like creating chaos,
don't you?

254
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,650
Summer.

255
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,700
Brother Summer.

256
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,480
-It's really you.
-Hello.

257
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,410
I didn't expect to see you here.

258
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,190
-May I take a photo with you?
-Of course.

259
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,950
Could you move aside, please? Thanks.

260
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,020
Excuse me. Thanks.

261
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,430
Look here, Brother Summer.

262
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,690
Three, two, one.

263
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,200
-Thank you, Brother Summer.
-Let's watch the game.

264
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,050
Both teams have completed
their selections.

265
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,590
Let's begin the second round
without further ado.

266
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,900
The game begins.

267
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,820
This should be a relaxing round.

268
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,680
-No fret.
-You two mustn't let your guard down.

269
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,840
-Alright, alright.
-Don't worry.

270
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,040
Watch out. I'm going to steal a rune.

271
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:24,810
Lin Yi Xuan will ambush at the river
at the 2-minute mark.

272
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:27,710
Qi Yue, Shen Yue. Get a good view.
Wait for him at the river.

273
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,310
-Understood.
-Double Yue released fog at the start.

274
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,850
Waiting at the runes spot. They predicted
accurately. Here comes Lin Yi Xuan.

275
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,850
Lu Feng, save me!

276
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:38,230
He used a second skill
and controlled Lin Yi Xuan.

277
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,250
Qi Yue defeats his enemy with a move.

278
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,260
Nice one!

279
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:43,550
VNG's waiting strategy was a good one.

280
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,930
They caught Lin Yu Xuan, a huge rabbit.

281
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,880
Double Yue has impeccable timing.

282
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,670
-I told you not to throw.
-What's going on at the bot lane?

283
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,210
It must be Brother Kong.
Only he knows I'd be here.

284
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,040
They're playing four-protect-one.
Huo Yao and Lu Feng will gank at bot-lane.

285
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,680
Double Yue, get a good view
and countergank.

286
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,920
-Got it.
-Let's go, Shen Yue.

287
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,260
-Let's go to them.
-And back to the game.

288
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,950
-I'm being frozen.
-Watch out.

289
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,110
Lu Sheng, go with him.
Prepare to tower dive.

290
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,690
-Double Yue, go!
-I'll help you.

291
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,140
Brother Yao, hurry over!

292
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:16,990
I'm being frozen as well.

293
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,360
-Good one!
-Nice one!

294
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:20,950
Double kill!
Not even Huo Yao could escape.

295
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,030
Double Yue's momentum was perfect.

296
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,370
I can't get to the bot-lane. It's too far.

297
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,190
-Li Nan, help me at Mid.
-Okay. On my way.

298
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,870
Brother Yao, something smells fishy.

299
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,470
Bug Queen is rarely used for damage.

300
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,960
Why is Qi Yue so fierce today?

301
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,690
Oh, please.
The credit goes to Brother Kong.

302
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:50,120
You're right.
I think I've seen this tactic before.

303
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,610
It's Double Yue.

304
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,920
-What?
-Double Yue? No way.

305
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,680
No one can defeat Double Yue.

306
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,100
If Brother Kong used Double Yue,
that's bold.

307
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,980
Lu Sheng, retreat for a bit.

308
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,830
I can keep up.

309
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,160
They've arrived at Mid-lane. Watch out.

310
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,990
-Ready. Attack now! Qi Yue, now!
-Got it.

311
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,350
They're at the Mid-lane.

312
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,510
Behind the tower.
Watch out. Just don't die.

313
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,580
-To the back. Quick!
-Follow them. Attack!

314
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,510
-Keep pushing. Mid-lane.
-They're at it.

315
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,200
-There's too many of them.
-Don't fret. Give him a hand.

316
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,490
Hold on. Keep holding on, Li Nan.

317
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,510
He didn't develop. Freeze him.

318
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,970
-Attack now.
-They've hit one wave. Watch out.

319
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,040
-Qi Yue, prepare to initiate.
-I'm on it.

320
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,680
Did you see that?

321
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,400
I knew Ji Xiang...

322
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,910
I knew VNG would win.

323
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,090
It's just a tie for now.
You haven't won the bet yet.

324
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,580
That's right.

325
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:15,440
Okay. Let's find out
who's the MVP for this round.

326
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,870
It's Qi Yue. Congratulations!
Well deserved.

327
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,150
Congratulations, Qi Yue.

328
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,950
Double Yue performed strongly
for their attacks and ganking this round.

329
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,760
With the increased money,
they've built an advantage for VNG.

330
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:32,600
Let's take a break
and anticipate their next game.

331
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:33,960
See you later.

332
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,070
Everyone, well done!

333
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,650
It was nothing.

334
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:47,980
Qi Yue, the MVP record is what
you should be bringing to the game.

335
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,960
Legends probably
still have no idea what hit them.

336
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,370
Maintain this good spirit
and play steadily next round.

337
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:00,010
The next round is the tiebreaker.

338
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,210
We must win this. Be fearless!

339
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,840
Keep going forward!

340
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:06,340
-Keep it up!
-Keep it up!

341
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,620
Have some water.

342
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,640
Why are you suddenly being nice?

343
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,270
What do you think
Ji Xiang Kong will do in the next round?

344
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,390
Save your breath.

345
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:51,000
How would I know what he's planning to do?
Are you kidding me?

346
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:56,240
VNG has tasted the victory of Double Yue.

347
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,660
I'm sure they'll continue
using this tactic.

348
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,780
Then how should we counterattack?

349
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,940
How?

350
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,210
What other tactics do you know
other than four-protect-one?

351
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,800
Xiang Kong has studied your team.

352
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:19,470
He analyzed Double Yue's tactic
and came up with a strategy.

353
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,880
First, select a Support with
more controlling skills at the start.

354
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,250
Then pair it with a high damage-level
Champion in early and mid game.

355
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,720
These two will roam and kill
to break the opponent's momentum,

356
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,660
and increase our competitive edge.

357
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,420
Coach, are you suggesting we use
Ji Xiang Kong's tactics to defeat him?

358
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,670
-That's right.
-Will it work?

359
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,840
Do you have a better idea?

360
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,730
Let's do that.

361
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,480
Legends chose Demon Bull and Xin.

362
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,360
What kind of combination is this?
I don't get it.

363
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,260
What's our plan this round, Captain?

364
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,350
We're not using Double Yue this time.

365
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,140
Are you kidding me?
Didn't you see us crush them earlier?

366
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,100
They've chosen Demon Bull and Xin.

367
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,400
They're clearly targeting us.
We can't use Double Yue.

368
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,340
How do you know?

369
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,890
I taught them this method.

370
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,120
We'll play four-protect-one.
Lu Sheng, choose Creator.

371
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,800
-We'll protect you.
-Four-protect-one? How creative.

372
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,150
Creator is extremely difficult to control.
Not everyone can do it.

373
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,450
He can handle it.

374
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,960
Okay.

375
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:43,420
I've locked it in.

376
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,750
Look at Luo Tian.

377
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,550
He has girls surrounding him all day now.

378
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,280
He wasn't like this back then.

379
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,040
When Luo Tian first came,

380
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,030
he had poor skills and he was shy.

381
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,390
He practiced in the training room
every day back then.

382
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:09,250
Let's see. VNG chose Creator,
a Mid Laner Champion.

383
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,940
Lu Sheng just switched
to the Mid position.

384
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:14,440
He also played really safe
in the first two rounds.

385
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:17,610
Do you think he's able to handle
such a difficult Champion?

386
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:19,990
Brother Yi.

387
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,110
Creator is Pei Xi's favorite Champion.

388
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,110
If he loses, I'll buy you a drink.

389
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,210
Okay. Let's continue to look at
the rest of their selection.

390
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,590
Lu Sheng is using Creator
to fight against Pei Xi?

391
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:43,440
You've got to be kidding me.

392
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,840
As long as Pei Xi is steady
throughout this round,

393
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,600
Legends is definitely going to win.

394
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,490
I agree.

395
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,170
Someone's buying us milk tea.

396
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,760
Hang on. They're not using
the same tactic as the last round.

397
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,820
Ji Xiang Kong is using four protect one.

398
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,600
Who are they protecting?

399
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:14,980
-Lu Sheng. His Creator.
-Why him?

400
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,270
He played like a coward
in the first two rounds.

401
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,870
Gank Lu Sheng. He's our breakthrough.

402
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,160
Gank Lu Sheng?

403
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,870
That's impossible.

404
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,730
Brother Kong would never
let a coward play Mid Laner.

405
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,100
Xuan.

406
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,510
Captain Ji just joined VNG. He wouldn't
know Lu Sheng better than Pei Xi.

407
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:34,120
Li Nan, Lin Yi Xuan.
You two investigate and defend.

408
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,650
Kill wards in a minute's time.

409
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,420
Take Lu Sheng out after level three.

410
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,490
-Okay, got it.
-Okay.

411
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,410
Top Mid Laner Pei Xi,
who's controlling Xin, will fight against

412
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,430
-Creator, used by Lu Sheng.
-See?

413
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,290
-Luckily we're not using Double Yue.
-It's not surprising.

414
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,270
I think Lu Sheng will be crushed.

415
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,780
Lu Sheng is indeed at a disadvantage.

416
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,670
Pei Xi's main move is breaking the ice.

417
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:58,730
While reducing Lu Sheng's health points,
he's suppressing Lu Sheng's creep score.

418
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,740
-So Lu Sheng...
-Can he handle it or not?

419
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,040
Lu Sheng, clear soldiers. Attack.
Why are you hiding under the tower?

420
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,950
-Yes, but his fireball...
-Lu Sheng, can you do it or not?

421
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,030
-He's likely to...
-Kill them.

422
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,200
Qi Yue, help him at Mid-lane.

423
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,270
[I thought too highly of you.]

424
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,120
You really think I can't defeat you?

425
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:32,290
-Watch out, Captain.
-Watch out. Fall back.

426
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,920
Retreat!

427
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,420
Brother Sheng, don't dive!

428
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,380
-Dive! Tong Wu, go with him.
-Here goes nothing.

429
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,300
Protect him. Nice one! Good.

430
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,200
-Mid-lane. Group battle.
-Attack!

431
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,180
-I'll shield the damage.
-Fall back.

432
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,820
Double Yue, circle at the back.
Mid, prepare to engage.

433
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,840
I'll take them out.

434
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,520
-Attack.
-I'll go firsthand. Firsthand engage!

435
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,760
-Go! Attack!
-I'll go. I'll cover you guys.

436
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm behind you.
Li Nan, keep using the skill.

437
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:58,120
-I'm going.
-Hurry! Nice!

438
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:01,110
-They still have it. Keep chasing.
-Lu Feng, Li Nan. Fall back!

439
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,910
-I can't retreat.
-Good one!

440
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,080
-We're close!
-Double Yue, keep killing.

441
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,240
-Li Nan, retreat!
-Brother Yao, fall back. Protect the base.

442
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,670
-Penta kill! Penta kill! Keep going!
-Nice one!

443
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,300
Nice one!

444
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,170
Penta kill!

445
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:30,060
One more wave. Keep going, Mid-lane.

446
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:33,100
-Shen Yue, keep pushing.
-I'm right behind you.

447
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,510
-Shen Yue.
-I'm here!

448
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,280
-VNG is pushing the final crystal.
-It's over.

449
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,360
-Looks like they'll win. They did it!
-Lu Sheng isn't timid.

450
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,010
Congratulations, VNG! Winning the game
with one player holding off the enemies!

451
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,980
VNG! VNG!

452
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,850
VNG chased two with one player
and defeated Legends.

453
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,620
Through them, we saw
the pure and passionate spirit of youths.

454
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,330
Be fearless and keep going forward.
That is the spirit of E-sports.

455
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,360
Let me shake hands with the winner.

456
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,090
What were you doing?
You could have escaped.

457
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,090
Many things can happen during a game.
Yet you had time for him?

458
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,640
Congratulations.
You're no longer at the bottom.

459
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,850
Congratulations, Handsome Ji.

460
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,570
We finally got to show
how strong we are in this round.

461
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:19,120
The one who surprised me the most
was Lu Sheng.

462
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,790
I feel relieved from all the
pent up frustration in the past rounds.

463
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:29,110
Lu Sheng wouldn't have tower dived
in the past.

464
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,400
Ji Xiang Kong changed him.

465
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,260
Congratulations to VNG
on turning the tables.

466
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:38,990
Congratulations again to Qi Yue
for also winning the MVP this round.

467
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:42,350
-Qi Yue, well done!
-Qi Yue is finally smiling this time.

468
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,960
Not only did he get a penta kill
towards the end,

469
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,820
but Double Yue's ganking in the
second round was remarkable as well.

470
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,000
Besides, don't you think
Qi Yue finally rid himself of

471
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,460
-Pei Xi's suppression?
-[You were right about him.]

472
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,540
[So were you.]

473
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,930
I also think Double Yue
had impeccable timing.

474
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,060
They gave their opponent a fatal blow
at the crucial moment.

475
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,990
I've got to go.

476
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,490
Don't leave.

477
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,380
It's hard for everyone to gather.

478
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,590
Let's go eat and catch up later
once Luo Tian's work is done.

479
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,920
Not today. Maybe next time.

480
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,730
Exhausted already?

481
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,530
Someone's buying us milk tea.

482
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,380
It's not me.

483
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,480
-You said it.
-Can I buy the small sizes?

484
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,910
No.

485
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,610
Xiang Kong is amazing!

486
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,080
Hello, I am journalist Lu Yi Yi,
from Dynamic Esports Magazine.

487
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,380
As you can see,
there's a huge crowd at the venue.

488
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,460
-We are...
-Ji Xiang Kong is here. Ji Xiang Kong!

489
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:51,810
Handsome Ji!

490
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,690
VNG lost four matches
and finally bounced back today.

491
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,860
What do you think is the main factor?

492
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:01,420
Our capabilities and teamwork.
And also a little bit of luck.

493
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,120
You are very modest today.

494
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,830
Was I immodest before?

495
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,900
Our captain has always kept a low profile.

496
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:11,190
Qi Yue, what are your thoughts
on receiving MVP?

497
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,520
What was it that allowed
Double Yue to regroup?

498
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,480
Hello, Qi Yue. VNG lost four consecutive
matches and turned the tables today.

499
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,160
What do you think of
your team's performance today?

500
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,760
Our results speak for itself.
Double Yue is invincible.

501
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:26,810
If we were to grade our performance today,
I think it would be 99 points.

502
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,540
And how would you grade
your performance today?

503
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,470
I'm MVP for both rounds. You tell me.

504
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,940
The remaining one point
is for room for improvement.

505
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,530
-I see. Thank you.
-Any more questions?

506
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,000
-No more. Thanks.
-It's Pei Xi. Pei Xi!

507
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,890
-Pei Xi!
-But I'm not done yet.

508
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,440
Excuse me. Excuse me!

509
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:49,860
Pei Xi, any comments
on Legends losing to VNG?

510
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,030
Wait. Pei Xi!

511
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,190
Pei Xi. Pei Xi!

512
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,710
Hey, stop messing around.
I need to interview Pei Xi.

513
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:07,370
He'll barely say a thing.
Interview me instead. I'm ready.

514
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,910
Fine. Go on.

515
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,240
-Do I look at you or him?
-Look at me.

516
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:17,710
Ji Xiang Kong's performance in this game
was outstanding.

517
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:21,760
He knew where I'd go to get buff,
so he ambushed me there.

518
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,700
Then he earned first blood by killing me.

519
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,380
Plus, Double Yue
must have been Brother Kong's idea.

520
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,930
I mean, it was Ji Xiang Kong's idea.
So he's amazing.

521
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,710
Stop laughing. This is an interview.

522
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:35,490
Are you a member of VNG or Legends?

523
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,630
In a competition,

524
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,930
we should share honor and shame,
work hard together, and gain victory.

525
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,910
Are you stupid?

526
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:45,030
Excuse me. We still have a meeting,
so we have to go.

527
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,360
I still have things to say.

528
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,780
-Brother Kong...
-Is this not embarrassing enough?

529
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:51,240
-I'll talk to you on WeChat.
-Don't worry. Go on.

530
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,940
Bye-bye.

531
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,780
Pei Xi.

532
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,770
Pei Xi, what are your thoughts
on today's match?

533
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,110
Although we lost to VNG today,
we'll continue to work hard.

534
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:08,710
I believe Legends
will defeat VNG in the end.

535
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,170
Sister Wen, if we get a feast like that
after every win in the future,

536
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,409
we'd be eating VNG out of house and home.

537
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,100
Don't worry.

538
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,560
As long as you can win the competition,
I'm willing to sacrifice anything.

539
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,489
You think I would let you do that
when I'm here?

540
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,889
-Sorry, I'm late.
-Our MVP is here.

541
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,190
Master, Sister Wen.
I'd like to drink to you two.

542
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:43,159
Victory will be ours in the future
now that Double Yue is back.

543
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,739
-Good.
-Cheers.

544
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:56,110
Outsiders say that VNG has lost its pillar
since Pei Xi left.

545
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,130
But in today's match, we showed them

546
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:03,750
that we can still win and be the champion
without playing four-protect-one.

547
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,650
Xiang Kong, you told me
that you would give me a brand new VNG.

548
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,450
You did it today.

549
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,390
Double Yue was able to make a return.
The credit definitely goes to Xiang Kong.

550
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:25,590
But of course, the one who contributed
the most to our victory today is Qi Yue.

551
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,780
Followed by Lu Sheng.

552
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,440
Obviously,
without Sister Wen and Mr. Li's trust,

553
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,480
and also everyone's cooperation,
I would be nothing.

554
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,020
This is to everyone.

555
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,000
-To Captain!
-To Captain!

556
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,810
-Thank you.
-Xiang Kong is right.

557
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,660
Don't forget. We are a team.

558
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,050
-Our goal is...
-World Championship!

559
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,120
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

560
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:59,940
[Congratulations. I bet on your team today
and won free milk tea.]

561
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:10,410
[You won free milk tea because of me.
Shouldn't I get one too?]

562
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,760
[Aren't you at the
victory celebration party?]

563
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,350
[Yet you have the time
to rip off milk tea from me.]

564
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:28,630
[As my number one fan, shouldn't you
be holding up a sign to cheer for me?]

565
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:34,700
[Then let's meet at our usual place
in an hour.]

566
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,930
You're back.

567
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:15,710
Do I look good today?

568
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,050
You...

569
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,930
You have lipstick on your teeth.

570
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,810
Going on a date with Ji Xiang Kong?

571
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,310
Yes.

572
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,720
Pei Xi.

573
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:46,370
You also did a great job today.

574
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,770
Thank you.

575
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,930
I'm not lying.
I really think you did great.

576
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,250
I'll get going then. Bye bye.

577
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,530
Hello?

578
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,610
Hello? Who is this?

579
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,820
[Xiang Kong.]

580
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,440
[It's me.]

581
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,480
[I'm back.]

582
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,250
Mi Ya?

583
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,010
[I want to meet you.]

584
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:53,290
[Are you free?]

This is our signature item.
It's 13.60 yuan.

617
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,350
-Strawberry milk tea.
-Thank you.

618
00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:35,990
"I will stay loyal to you
and be by your side when you shine."

619
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,070
I'm sure your boyfriend will be moved
when he sees it.

620
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:43,930
I've told you. He isn't my boyfriend.

Still, you are more than friends.

Plus, he's so handsome.
You should keep a closer eye on him.

623

Don't touch it.

Get back to work.

625
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:58,010
Hi. How may I help you?

626
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,440
[I'm here. I'll be waiting.]

[Sorry, I was held up. Wait a while.]

Xiang Kong, I miss you so much.

What's wrong?

630
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,740
Did I frighten you?

631
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:02,070
No.

632
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,620
It's just...

633
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:07,000
It's been a long time.

634
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,790
It's been 1,820 days.

635
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,400
I remember every single day
we weren't together.

636
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:21,910
I really hope that this number
would stop increasing from now on.

637
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,970
You've been doing well overseas.

638
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,340
How come Tony let you come back?

639
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,520
Coming back was my decision.

641
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,490
I want to be with you again.

What are you doing?

643
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,020
Tony, I...

644
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,610
It's been a while, Tony.

645
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:01,120
Sorry. I'll talk to you later.

Go back.

to tell Xiang Kong.

What if you get photographed?

652
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:21,440
Go back.

653
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,940
He's right, Mi Ya.

654
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,720
Many fans are here. You should go back.

655
