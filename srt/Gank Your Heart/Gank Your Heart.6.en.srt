[Episode 6]

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,259
We'd been practicing
to fight against Dragons.

5
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,460
What should we do now?

6
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:43,380
I know.

7
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,979
What are you doing here?
Go and ask about it!

8
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,539
I'll talk to them now.

9
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,770
No way, we can't win at this point.

10
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,490
We'd practiced our strategies,
but they suddenly changed our opponent.

11
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,740
We can't fight. We won't win.

12
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,580
It'll all be in vain.

13
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,460
Why are we even here?

14
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,750
Manager Zhao, do something.

15
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,460
I understand.

16
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,300
Don't worry.

17
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,580
Look, I gave Wang Bin something
to do and it turned out like this.

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:04,980
Don't worry.

19
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,380
I'll talk to them myself.

20
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,330
Wait for my call.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,699
Manager Zhao, you must speak for us.

22
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,190
Okay.

23
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,759
We're counting on you.

24
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,520
We trust you!

25
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:12,600
Thanks, Manager Zhao.

26
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,980
Good luck!

27
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,480
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the closed
beta test of the new version of iConquer.

28
00:02:37,579 --> 00:02:39,329
We're at the preliminary round.

29
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,660
I'm your host, Luo Tian.

30
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,950
I'm Can. Welcome, everyone.

31
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,340
Without further ado, let's give
a round of applause to VNG and Dragons.

32
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,620
Welcome.

33
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:11,120
Alright, we now declare that
the competition has officially begun.

34
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,990
Please take your seats.

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,710
Lu Yi Yi, do you have time?

36
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,890
Yes. What's the matter, Director Shi?

37
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,220
Is there an urgent task?

38
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,960
If you're not busy,

39
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,180
I'll let you cover the news
about Gu Fang's retirement.

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,680
Really?

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,100
No problem, leave it to me.

42
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:42,020
Don't get so excited.

43
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,210
You don't have to go on the field.

44
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:49,750
Just give a call to the relevant staff
and sort out the news from our peers.

45
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:50,590
That ought to do it.

46
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,579
We don't have
the invitation letter after all.

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,160
We can't even get in.

48
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,180
That's all you need to do.

49
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,510
This tastes good.

50
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,530
I'm taking this, thanks.

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,330
You're kidding me.

52
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,660
Gu Fang's retirement party is held today.

53
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,610
And he didn't tell me until now?

54
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,620
Perhaps God is giving a perfect
opportunity for me and Qiu Ying.

55
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,670
How are they doing now?

56
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,080
They're talking about tactics.

57
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,300
They'd been studying
how to beat Dragons for days.

58
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,920
I bet they can't come up
with anything now.

59
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,390
Leave it to me.

60
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,730
Let's see if Pei Xi can get a pentakill.

61
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,490
Pentakill! Awesome!

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,350
This is a miracle!

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,340
First wave, push toward the nexus.

64
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,480
Awesome! Congratulations to VNG on
beating Dragons in two out of three games

65
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,890
and claiming the first win!

66
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,920
Congrats!

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,850
He's indeed the best mid laner.

68
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,200
His hand speed is as fast as
Gu Fang when he was in his prime.

69
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,690
Sooner or later, he'll be mine.

70
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,240
That's for sure.

71
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,930
Manager Zhao, we're up next.

72
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,860
Just wait and see.

73
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:46,510
Just relax and prepare for the next round.

74
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,130
Congrats, Coach Shu Wen.

75
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,480
You won again.

76
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,480
You're indeed a pearl among women.

77
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,409
Good luck.

78
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,090
See you guys at the retirement party.

79
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,640
I won.

80
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,910
I know, so what?

81
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,970
So, you'd better not lose.

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,080
That's none of your concern.

83
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,200
Fine.

84
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,480
See you at the final round.

85
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,800
I'll be with you till the end,
see you at the finals.

86
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,320
Was he trying to provoke us?

87
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,560
Who cares? Let's go.

88
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,590
-Let's go!
-All the best!

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,100
All the best!

90
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:48,920
-Next up, let's welcome both the teams...
-Legends and Newland!

91
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,250
Alright, we'll now declare that
the second preliminary round

92
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:11,520
of the closed beta test of iConquer
has officially begun.

93
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,700
Take your seats, please.

94
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:21,370
Let's move to the pick-ban session.

95
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,220
Let's do a quick push this round.

96
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,680
-Okay.
-Okay.

97
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,800
Sure.

98
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,370
Pick two champions to destroy the tower.

99
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,720
Legends picked two champions.

100
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,480
Why did they pick two champions
to destroy the tower?

101
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,720
It's too risky.

102
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Are they going to do a quick push or...

103
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,480
They need to get lots of coins fast
in early the game to do a quick push.

104
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,630
Newland specializes in farming.

105
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,840
I don't know how Ji Xiang Kong has
the guts to compete with them in farming.

106
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,460
So what if they can farm?

107
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,530
Once they fail to take the tower, they'll
lose the initiative to their opponent.

108
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,840
And Ji Xiang Kong's tactic won't work.

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,480
Li Nan, Lu Feng, invade their jungle
and wait in the bushes.

110
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,330
Okay.

111
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,020
I'm on my way.

112
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,520
Xuan, take all our buff.

113
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,090
Got it.

114
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,930
Brother Yao, freeze the lane
and attract the monsters.

115
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,960
Sure, no problem.

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,520
Farm quickly, guys.

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,800
-No problem.
-Okay.

118
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,080
Let's take a look at Ji Xiang Kong's team.

119
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,490
The three of them have come to mid lane.

120
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,370
They are ready to attack.

121
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,130
-[First blood.]
-Amazing!

122
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,250
Nice catch!

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,920
And I think the new talent,
Li Nan, and his teammates

124
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,490
are working in perfect harmony.

125
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,240
The first blood and coins
are given to Lu Feng.

126
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,680
Lu Feng is farming rapidly.

127
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,000
Indeed.

128
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,840
-Double kill!
-Awesome!

129
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,400
-It's just luck.
-Stop it!

130
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,570
They got off to a flying start.

131
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,360
Indeed.

132
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,559
Get ready to engage!

133
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,539
We must take the initiative this time!

134
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,419
On it!

135
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:38,480
-My skill...
-I've got him!

136
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,659
Damn it, Lu Feng managed to dodge my ulti.

137
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:41,480
Go!

138
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,130
Attack the tower!

139
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,240
Go!

140
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,410
Hang in there!

141
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,920
-Fall back!
-Hang in there!

142
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,490
Good!

143
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,260
Look at them.

144
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,380
Young people nowadays
perform better under pressure.

145
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,410
Tell me about it.

146
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,400
Here you go.

147
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,600
Ji Xiang Kong did
a great job in commanding.

148
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:08,410
Indeed.

149
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,240
They are off to a good start.

150
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,810
However, for all I know,

151
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,110
they had been expecting to fight
against Dragons in this competition.

152
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,400
Only Xiang Kong can pull off
a victory under such circumstances.

153
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,400
They weren't notified that
there would be changes to the schedule?

154
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,320
Perhaps Zhao Yang made a mistake
since he'd been busy?

155
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,440
I hope it's just a mistake.

156
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,810
Or else, Legends would have a big problem.

157
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,150
Alright, I'll ask him in person.

158
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,520
I’ll give everyone an explanation
if he did it on purpose.

159
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:52,480
Chairman Jin, I always think that

160
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,270
Xiang Kong is the perfect candidate
for the captain of Legends.

161
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,800
I know you care a lot about your protégé,

162
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,570
but it's all subject to
the result of the finals.

163
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,770
Let's not talk about these.

164
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,810
It's your retirement party tonight.

165
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
You're the star.

166
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,770
I've sent the reporters away,
just as you said.

167
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,490
Only the inner circle will be here.

168
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,270
After the fierce competition
between four teams,

169
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:26,320
let's congratulate Legends and VNG

170
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,610
on passing the qualifying round
of the closed beta test.

171
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,680
Bye, Sly Zhao.

172
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,150
And also, I think both the teams
did an amazing job today,

173
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,020
be it Pei Xi's pentakill
or Handsome Ji's tactic.

174
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,490
They really got the audience's
adrenaline pumping.

175
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,280
I'm going to share
some good news with you.

176
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:48,120
You'll be able to meet
the new champions of iConquer

177
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,400
during the final round
of the closed beta test.

178
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,220
Handsome Ji, are you excited to meet them?

179
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,290
I can't wait to meet them.

180
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,140
I'll ask Pei Xi the same question as well.

181
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,120
What about you?

182
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:09,360
I'm more excited to use the champions
to beat Ji Xiang Kong in the final round.

183
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,890
Like I said, I'll be
with you till the end.

184
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,130
Things got rather heated
even before the game.

185
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,470
I believe they'll present the most
spectacular show during the final round.

186
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,420
There are so many people.

187
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:40,690
VNG is here.

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,890
Security man, please let us in!

189
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,050
Let us in!

190
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,200
Legends!

191
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,370
Legends is here!

192
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,010
Handsome Ji!

193
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Handsome Ji!

194
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,450
Lin Yi Xuan!

195
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,230
Handsome Ji!

196
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,850
There are so many people.

197
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,910
Let's go have a look.

198
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,250
Go home!

199
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,480
No interviews today!

200
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,740
You have no right to
refuse to let us through!

201
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,700
This is Gu Fang's private event.

202
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:20,940
You can't go in.

203
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:24,360
You brought me here
for Gu Fang's retirement party?

204
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,520
My company told me to cover
the news of Gu Fang's retirement.

205
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,540
I need to do a good job.

206
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,240
Besides, all the famous people
in the industry will be here.

207
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,300
It'd be great if you can
get to know one or two of them.

208
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,410
Do you want to sneak in with me?

209
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,450
That's not a good idea.

210
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,990
What's so bad about that?

211
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,120
Are you afraid you'll
run into that liar, Ji Xiang Kong?

212
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,850
Why would I be afraid of him?

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
There's no way we can get in.

214
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,570
Don't worry, I know this hotel inside out.

215
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,820
I have my ways.

216
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,800
Come with me.

217
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,640
-Where to?
-Let us in!

218
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,630
Wait, have you ever acted before?

219
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,770
Once or twice.

220
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,930
Great.

221
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,490
Look up, straighten your back and relax.

222
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,010
Take a deep breath.

223
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,160
Let's go.

224
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,920
What's the matter with you?

225
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,000
What took you so long?

226
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,920
This is my first big job!

227
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,370
It's your first day at work and you're
already giving me so much trouble.

228
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,410
I'm sorry, boss.

229
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,710
Did you bring the video material?

230
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,060
I did. It's in my bag.

231
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,810
Let's go!

232
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,040
They need it for the big screen!

233
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,000
What are you doing?

234
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,330
Did you not see me getting yelled at?

235
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,860
Can you take responsibility
if the retirement party is delayed?

236
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,430
What's with the attitude?

237
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,870
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:31,690
We're running late!

239
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,800
I'll teach her a lesson later.

240
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:34,370
Can't you use the front door?

241
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,780
I'm telling you,
you won't get paid this month.

242
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,550
Over here!

243
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,360
Right, did you see the look on
that sly fox, Zhao Yang's face?

244
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,300
Brother Xuan, I didn't get a good look.

245
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,390
Show us how he looked.

246
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,200
You didn't see it?

247
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,250
-Lu Feng!
-This is outrageous.

248
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,250
Cut it out.

249
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,780
If Zhao Yang sees what you're doing,
he's going to give you a hard time.

250
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,170
-I'm afraid...
-I'm not afraid of him!

251
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,520
Brother Kong's got my back.

252
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't get me involved.

253
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,610
I don't want to be in your shoes.

254
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,690
We're different.

255
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,570
When did you lose your sense of justice?

256
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,990
You're not worth fighting for.

257
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,030
There are so many people.

258
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,850
It's not time yet.

259
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,130
Let's wait outside.

260
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
-Come, we'll have a look around.
-Let's go.

261
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,490
[Come here.]

262
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,050
Listen, there's a small kitchen here.

263
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:31,570
We'll sneak in and
steal two uniforms later.

264
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,890
Then, we'll blend in
and nobody will notice.

265
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,800
Will it work?

266
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,880
Trust me! I've never
gotten you into trouble!

267
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's go.

268
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,270
Listen, it's Gu Fang's retirement party.

269
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,320
Everything must be perfect.

270
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,270
I'll fire you if you dare
make another mistake.

271
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,030
Don't come back again.

272
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,570
You useless thing!

273
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,370
I know, Boss.

274
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,010
Let's go.

275
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,380
It hurts!

276
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
We were acting!

277
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,560
Let's go.

278
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,770
You're good.

279
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,790
When did you learn martial arts?

280
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,320
We'll talk about that later.

281
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,490
Did you see the clothes over there?

282
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,510
I think there's nobody here.

283
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,680
Go.

284
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:31,720
Go get the clothes.

285
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,680
Who are you?

286
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,040
-I'm having a stomach ache.
-What are you doing here?

287
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,140
It hurts so much!

288
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,060
We're looking for the washroom.

289
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,080
Ouch!

290
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,690
Girls, why are you here when
you're looking for a washroom?

291
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,350
We don't know the way.

292
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,010
It's over there.

293
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,780
Leave now!

294
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,480
Thank you.

295
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,130
Let's go.

296
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,010
I can't hold it any longer.

297
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:00,930
Go get the clothes.

298
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,770
Me?

299
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:03,890
Go.

300
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:06,170
Go.

301
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,570
Sir, I couldn't find my way
to the washroom.

302
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,090
Girl, why did you come back?

303
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,240
I told you to leave.

304
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,240
You know, nine out of ten girls
are bad with directions.

305
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:24,770
Fine, do you have a pen and paper?

306
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,830
I do.

307
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:30,240
Let's go somewhere with better lighting.

308
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,170
See?

309
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:34,810
What's happening?

310
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,360
I think there are rats here.

311
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,570
What did you say?

312
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,770
There are rats here?

313
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,930
-No, finish your drawing first.
-I need to look into it.

314
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,490
Finish it and I'll catch it for you.

315
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,640
Girl, you...

316
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,570
You're making it worse.

317
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,250
See?

318
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,240
Turn right, okay?

319
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,630
Then, you walk straight, turn right
and take another right.

320
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,360
-We're back in the same spot.
-This isn't right.

321
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,680
You've got me confused.

322
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,119
I'm a little confused now.

323
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,319
Look, it's coming back to me now.

324
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:09,490
-Turn right.
-Thank you.

325
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,010
I've got this.

326
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,599
Girl, don't go!

327
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,960
I haven't finished yet.

328
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,000
-Turn right and take another right.
-Got it!

329
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,180
Let's go.

330
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,270
This girl is so weird.

331
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:24,900
I was so frightened.

332
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,930
Well, you're no better than me in acting.

333
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,270
We made it anyway.

334
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,570
Come, let's go find the hall.

335
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,370
Let's go.

336
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,440
-It's so grand.
-Hurry up!

337
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,920
-Be careful.
-Why is it so heavy?

338
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,440
Try harder!

339
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,810
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

340
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,360
Look at the crowd.

341
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,000
This is so pretty.

342
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,130
Right, I need to take photos.

343
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,270
Be careful.

344
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,240
Don't worry.

345
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:11,620
This way.

346
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:13,890
Chairman Jin.

347
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,480
Chairman Jin.

348
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:16,450
Congrats.

349
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,770
Congrats.

350
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,920
-Alright.
-I'll let you guys talk.

351
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,480
-I need to get them seated.
-Okay.

352
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,680
Over here, please.

353
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,370
Ever since Pioneers won the championship,
I became a commentator.

354
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,710
Summer set up Dream Traveler.

355
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,670
Li Gan and Shu Wen became coaches
and established VNG.

356
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,500
You were the only one
left on the field, but now...

357
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:46,760
Actually, I've always wanted to see
the great power of that Holy Princess.

358
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,570
The game has been constantly updated.

359
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,890
This champion isn't that powerful now.

360
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,120
That means I'd never be able
to get back on top again.

361
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,930
Look over there. Gu Fang, Luo Tian.

362
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,560
I met them before.

363
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,640
Over here, then.

364
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,400
Shu Wen, Summer and Li Gan.

365
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,780
Five Ancient Masters from
Pioneers are here today.

366
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,240
You're good.

367
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,760
You've only worked for a few days
and you already know about Pioneers.

368
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:21,610
Of course.

369
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,640
However, you only got half of it correct.

370
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,010
The real Five Ancient Masters are

371
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,410
Gu Fang, Luo Tian, Summer,

372
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,930
Shu Wen and Sun Ze Yi.

373
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,050
Wait, who's Sun Ze Yi?

374
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,410
Not many people know about Sun Ze Yi now.

375
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
He used to be the conductor of Pioneers.

376
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,520
Four years ago, which is also the year
they won the championship,

377
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:50,290
he decided to retire before
the competition for some reason.

378
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,120
And Li Gan took over his place.

379
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,400
Hence, the world remembers Li Gan
and forgot about Sun Ze Yi.

380
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
So that's what happened.

381
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,120
Do you think Sun Ze Yi is here?

382
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:06,880
Where is he?

383
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,160
No, he won't come.

384
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,040
He disappeared from
the public eye a long time ago.

385
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,050
What are you doing? Go serve the wine.

386
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,270
Okay.

387
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,910
What a fright.

388
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,360
It's okay.

389
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,120
Yi Yi.

390
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,640
Everyone at that table knows me.

391
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,520
It's okay.

392
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,380
Keep your head down. I'll serve the wine.

393
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:34,240
They don't know me anyway.

394
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,410
Cover me up.

395
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,440
Don't look at them.

396
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,170
Don't look.

397
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,550
-Mr. Luo.
-Captain.

398
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,820
Still calling me Captain?

399
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,050
You'll always be our captain.

400
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,920
I've heard that you've become
the acting captain of Legends.

401
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,600
Keep it up, I know you'll make it.

402
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,490
Thanks, Mr. Luo.

403
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,730
Xiang Kong, you did a great job today.

404
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,450
Now that I've made up my mind,
I'll do my best.

405
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,720
Ji Xiang Kong!

406
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,210
Let's go.

407
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,810
Feel free to call me if you need
my help to organize an event.

408
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,230
You must've spent a fortune.

409
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,480
That's no big deal.

410
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,310
By the way, you guys never
visit my Dream Traveler.

411
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,200
I feel like celebrities are
much easier found than you guys.

412
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,960
We'll visit you when
the closed beta test is over.

413
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
Sure, I know you have your hands full.

414
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:35,530
Since the dismissal of Pioneers, you two
established VNG with your bare hands.

415
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,240
I'm very impressed with what
you've achieved, I mean it.

416
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:42,870
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

417
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,970
What are you guys talking about?

418
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,550
Tonight's a big night.

419
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:53,010
Why haven't I seen Pei Xi?

420
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,440
My cousin isn't very sociable.

421
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,840
Manager Zhao,
you're so interested in Pei Xi.

422
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,450
Are you trying to poach him from us?

423
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,440
What are you talking about?

424
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,970
I cherish all the talented people.

425
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,130
I'm a big fan of players like Pei Xi.

426
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,550
I just wanted to get to
know more about Pei Xi.

427
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,480
Besides, nobody dares to poach
employees from Coach Shu Wen.

428
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,870
I wouldn't dare to do so.

429
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,220
Right?

430
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,870
You guys continue.

431
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:30,090
Excuse me.

432
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,730
You guys continue.

433
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,140
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

434
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,870
Pei Xi was fully trained by us.

435
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:48,550
I can't believe Zhao is
thinking of stealing him away.

436
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,850
Zhao Yang is getting showier.

437
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,900
It's not up to me to decide
whether Pei Xi will go to Legends.

438
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,400
Kids today are not
as well behaved as we were.

439
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,360
Besides, I'm just his cousin.

440
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,900
I can't do anything.

441
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,400
Zhao Yang is known for his tricks.

442
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,200
You have to be vigilant.

443
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,730
What do you think will happen if Pei Xi
were to partner up with Ji Xiang Kong?

444
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,840
It would be incredible.

445
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,120
Sounds like you're trying to
poach an employee from Legends.

446
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,250
What? If you didn't
beat me to it two years ago,

447
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,750
Ji Xiang Kong would've
worked for us, okay?

448
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,970
He wouldn't have said yes.

449
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,890
-Enough.
-You're retiring anyway.

450
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,350
-Alright.
-Why do you care so much?

451
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,220
-Let's get seated.
-Let's go.

452
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,410
That was scary.

453
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:53,840
By the way, Summer is half your enemy.

454
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,690
I don't even know him.

455
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,840
Why would he be my enemy?

456
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,340
Pei Xi, the guy who helped Qiao Xin
hunt you down in the game,

457
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:02,490
is he your enemy?

458
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:06,330
He's Pei Xi's older cousin.

459
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,100
You know quite a lot.

460
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,270
Let me introduce to you...

461
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,600
My God, look at...

462
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,180
What's on your mind?

463
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,940
Brother Sun.

464
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,600
Fair enough.

465
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,870
Everyone's here except him.

466
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,860
Give him a call and ask him to come.

467
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,840
-Maybe I should try.
-Go.

468
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,130
Here are your drinks.

469
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,500
Brother Sun, my computer is running slow.

470
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,330
Let me check.

471
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,390
[Ji Xiang Kong]

472
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,490
You're using all the special effects.

473
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,100
My computer can't run
all the effects at the same time.

474
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,520
[Brother Sun, are you coming to
Captain's retirement party?]

475
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,590
[Everyone's here except you.]

476
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:04,210
Not bad, catch up on your points.

477
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,000
[Brother Yi, everyone's here except you.]

478
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,880
[I'll send you the location.
Come quickly.]

479
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,790
Brother Sun, come over here.

480
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,460
Okay.

481
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,730
Isn't this the runner-up, Legends?

482
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,200
Master of Fried Chicken, right?

483
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,360
Why would you throw
such a big dinner party?

484
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,440
You think you're the champion?

485
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:32,240
-Yi Xuan.
-What? Shall we talk outside?

486
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,090
Sit down.

487
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,820
You're quite arrogant for a support.

488
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,950
Look at them.

489
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,220
There are four supports here.
You think you can beat them?

490
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,630
Klutz.

491
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,610
My coach is here,
so I won't argue with you.

492
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,290
Who is this?

493
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,930
Your new assistant, is it?

494
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,160
I've watched VNG's competition.

495
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,730
Only Pei Xi is worth watching.

496
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,260
Say that again.

497
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,590
Don't mention him.
I'm in charge when he's not around.

498
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,640
Your beef is with me.

499
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,460
Don't mention Pei Xi?

500
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,560
-This is...
-You're being disrespectful!

501
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,950
Do you know why Legends lost the game?

502
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:08,040
You guys talked too much.

503
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:09,910
And this is...

504
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,650
Never heard of Double Yue?

505
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,770
Take note, Shen Yue Yue
and Qi Yue Yue.

506
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,670
Double Yue, who can't beat anyone.

507
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,060
Double Yue.

508
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,400
Enough, I hate people who are all talk.

509
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,660
Let's fight on the battlefield
if you have guts.

510
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,250
Here's to you, Lin Yi Xuan.

511
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,170
I'll remember you.

512
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,920
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

513
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,040
I'm your host, Luo Tian.

514
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:45,960
Welcome to my best friend
Gu Fang's retirement party.

515
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,670
Four years ago, Gu Fang's Holy Princess

516
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:54,540
helped turn the tide in
the final competition in Vancouver.

517
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:59,560
He's the reason the Chinese team
won the first championship.

518
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,760
Four years later, our last hero
has chosen to retire.

519
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,940
He's indeed the best
iConquer commentator in China.

520
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:15,010
Of course he is. He's so cool.

521
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,760
Trained together...

522
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,830
I want to take a few photos over there.
I'll leave you here.

523
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,490
Be careful.

524
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,550
Alright, you too.

525
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,360
Okay.

526
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,250
Now, our last fighter is retiring as well.

527
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,410
As your best friend,
I'm sincerely happy for you.

528
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:36,670
But as a professional commentator,
I feel sorry to hear that.

529
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,360
Because from now onward,
we'll lose another

530
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:43,040
top summoner on
the battlefield of iConquer.

531
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,020
Without further ado, let's welcome
the star of the night, Gu Fang!

532
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,650
Great!

533
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,330
-Hurry up!
-Go!

534
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,450
Go.

535
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,050
Hurry up!

536
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,290
I didn't prepare anything.

537
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,410
Good evening, everyone.

538
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,750
I wasn't expecting so many people.

539
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,930
I didn't expect Summer to throw
such a big retirement party for me either.

540
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,790
I thought only a few people would be here.

541
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,840
We'd eat, talk and that'd be all.

542
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:40,360
As you know, Pioneers
is the first team I joined.

543
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,880
We named it Pioneers
because we're the pioneers

544
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,840
who dreamed of becoming an esports gamer.

545
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,450
There's a fan who snuck in to get photos.

546
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,110
Go check on her.

547
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:55,440
People thought we were
a bunch of frivolous kids

548
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,420
who did nothing but play games.

549
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,400
But we never gave up.

550
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,080
We couldn't get
any sponsorship and support.

551
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,910
In order to save money,
we had to share a bowl of noodles

552
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,370
and sleep on the floor
of the stadium's entrance.

553
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,600
But we were enjoying it.

554
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,240
Because we were deeply aware
that was the path to our dream.

555
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,560
You found a great spot.

556
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,320
It's you!

557
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,470
We got together...

558
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,960
Since we know each other,
I'll get straight to the point.

559
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,610
Give it to me, or I'll call the security.

560
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:36,320
I remember you said
you don't hit girls, right?

561
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,350
Are you going to hit me again?
Give it to me quickly.

562
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,280
-Hurry up.
-No, why would I hit you?

563
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,400
Gu Fang is crying!

564
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,120
We didn't have anything in mind.

565
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,760
Wait!

566
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,450
We just didn't want to give up.

567
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:58,490
We wished that one day, we could
stand on the global stage

568
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,560
and say out loud with pride that

569
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,960
we are from China!

570
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,750
Nice!

571
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,930
I'm glad we were able to make it.

572
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,400
To all the competitive
youngsters who are here,

573
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,550
and those who aren't,

574
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:24,120
I believe you'll keep
yesterday's dream in mind.

575
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,880
Win the highest honor for our country.

576
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,300
Stay true to yourself. Dare to dream.

577
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,640
Break through your limits
and stand on top of the world.

578
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:39,110
This is your destiny!

579
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,850
Let's raise our glasses.

580
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,440
I wish you all the best
in your future endeavors.

581
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,970
I wish the Chinese teams
all the best in their future endeavors.

582
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,600
-Yes!
-Cheers!

583
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,640
-Yes!
-Cheers!

584
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,720
Bottoms up!

585
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,960
Come with me if you
don't want to embarrass yourself.

586
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,420
Stop right there!

587
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,440
Gosh, I'm tired.

588
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,550
And yet you're still running.

589
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:49,080
Stop!

590
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,160
Stop, or I'll call the police.

591
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,400
It won't help.

592
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,910
Man, seriously?

593
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,740
Even if I can't hide in the ladies' room,

594
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,710
do you dare conduct
a body search on a girl?

595
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,320
Of course I wouldn't dare to do so.

596
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,540
But I can do this all day
until you hand me the photos.

597
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,520
You!

598
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,480
You scoundrel!

599
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,550
I'm sorry.

600
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,360
You!

601
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,900
It's just some photos.
Is this really necessary?

602
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,960
Is this necessary?

603
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,140
My captain said he wanted to
keep his retirement at a low profile.

604
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
He didn't want anybody else to know.

605
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,760
Damn!

606
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:44,160
If you post the photos, I'd have to
take the blame for you.

607
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:44,950
Do you still think it's unnecessary?

608
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,580
Dude, how about this?

609
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,060
You can pretend you didn't see me today.

610
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,640
See, nobody will find out
if I keep this to myself, right?

611
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,750
I'll treat you to a meal
when the job is done.

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,840
How nice of you.

613
00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:01,920
No way.

614
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,110
Let go, I can walk on my own!

615
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,210
Let go of me!

616
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,750
You're not only overdramatic
but also shameless.

617
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,000
Ji Xiang Kong, don't go too far.

618
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,460
I'm going too far?

619
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:17,240
If I didn't see you today, I'm afraid
your live stream will go viral again!

620
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,830
Don't tell me you didn't know
this is a private event.

621
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,000
Give me your phone.

622
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,340
I didn't take any photos,
nor did I do a live broadcast.

623
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
See for yourself.

624
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,160
You think I'd believe you?

625
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,110
Have you seen enough?

626
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,180
Is there anything else?

627
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,300
Get out of my face.

628
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,640
Ji Xiang Kong,
I'll prove myself to you one day.

629
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:10,760
Tell me, how useless would I be
if I lost my job again?

630
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,699
No, listen to me.

631
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:20,840
If you post the photos, I'd have to
go home and become a delivery guy.

632
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,840
Let's be considerate to each other, okay?

633
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,920
I'm so upset now.

634
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:30,590
Just leave me alone.

635
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Can we talk after that?

636
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,449
I'll be fine, just leave me alone.

637
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,520
Will you be alright?

638
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:38,880
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

639
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:41,010
I'll be fine.

640
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,000
How tragic.

641
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,400
I almost cried.

642
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,510
Brother Kong...

643
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,429
I feel sorry for you,

644
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,159
but please hand over the photos.

645
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,840
You!

646
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,790
Shu Wen, I need to make some calls.

647
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,630
Hey, this is a serious matter.

648
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,360
Yet, you made it seem so light-hearted.

649
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,250
I'm retired anyway.

650
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:40,510
What's so serious about it?

651
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,840
Others don't understand Gu.

652
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,360
But we knew him better than anyone.

653
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,880
He's always had a lot on his mind.

654
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,850
You were able to
stick with it until today.

655
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,080
That's quite a perfect ending.

656
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,630
Right.

657
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,650
Let's have a drink.

658
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,200
Hand me my glass.

659
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,980
-Cheers.
-To the honorable retirement...

660
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,400
Of the last fighter of Pioneers.

661
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,920
-Cheers.
-Congrats.

662
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,330
Thanks, guys.

663
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,220
Everyone's here except Sun.

664
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,960
Did he reply to your message?

665
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:28,150
He did.

666
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,440
What did he say?

667
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,820
What else could he say?

668
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:34,440
That he's busy and
doesn't have time for this.

669
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,350
I understand.

670
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,870
Brother Yi couldn't hire anyone
to work at his internet cafe.

671
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,870
He has to take care of it himself.

672
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,150
Why don't we go to him instead?

673
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,550
Sounds good.

674
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,820
It's been so many years.

675
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:51,920
We should pay a visit to him.

676
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,960
Right.

677
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,680
I can't join you.

678
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,680
I've got some work. I'll be leaving soon.

679
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,490
Come on, there's always someone missing.

680
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,510
Stop it, I do have work to do.

681
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,140
It's no fun.

682
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,820
-Sister Wen.
-Sister Wen.

683
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,240
Xiang Kong, take care of your captain.

684
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,130
I'll leave first.

685
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:21,450
You guys, work harder.

686
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,760
See you at the final round.

687
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,490
Sister Wen, see you then.

688
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,400
-Bye, Sister Wen.
-Sister Wen, goodbye.

689
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,150
Bye.

690
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,950
Why are you looking at me?

691
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,020
Did I say something wrong?

692
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,440
Duh.

693
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,440
I...

694
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,720
Captain, shall we get out of here?

695
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,660
Sure.

696
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,690
Drop it.

697
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,780
It seems like Sun isn't the only one
who can't let go of the past.

698
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,340
Come, let's go to The King.

699
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,110
-Let's go.
-Let's go.
