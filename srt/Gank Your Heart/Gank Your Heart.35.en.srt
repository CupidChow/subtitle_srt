[I can feel

Brother Kong,
what should we choose this time round?

97

Go ahead and make your pick.

98
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,740
I'll pick last

99
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,200
and give them a surprise.

100
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,110
Isn't the global gank strategy too common

101
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,480
to be used in such
an important competition?

102
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,980
As it's too common,

103
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,210
our opponents won't be able to
predict our intentions.

104
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,980
They would be caught unprepared.

105
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,100
Holy Princess?

isn't this the hero you were famous for?

109
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,800
It seems that Team Phenix wants to

110
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:01,890
salute to their previous captain here.

111
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,490
Our former captain
must be moved to tears by now.

112

Holy Princess

113

115
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,660
it can bring luck

116
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,080
to Team Phenix.

117

back to this stage.

119
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,730
Jeffrey must be confused

120
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,300
to see Holy Princess.

121
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,570
Holy Princess?

122
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,280
Ji Xiang Kong is a solo top player.

123
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,050
Why is he picking a solo mid?

124
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,290
Isn't he trying to
use shadow tactics in his lineup?

125
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,050
What are they thinking?

126
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,110
So what are we going to do?

127
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,510
We can beat them with our secret weapon.

128
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:36,720
Let's see what's Ji Xiang Kong has first.

129

Brother Sun, can we go now?

139

Come.

140
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,890
I surrounded one of them.

141
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,090
Wait for my big move.

142
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,260
[Ji Xiang Kong and Pei Xi
wants to attack solely.]

143
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,970
[It's an effective way to gain advantages
at the beginning of the game.]

144

[Attacking solely?]

[When Pei Xi attacked,]

[they weren't frightened at all.]

[Ji Xiang Kong hasn't shown himself,
but his attacks are there.]

150
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:18,220
[Now Team Tatan is confused
about their strategy.]

151

[Cyborg and Megaera]

152
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,980
[attacked at the same time
to try to kill Ji Xiang Kong.]

153

[It's nothing serious.]

[to protect Ji Xiang Kong.]

[He avoided
the normal attack from Cyborg]

[and Punishing Shot from Megaera.]

[He's swift.]

00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,540
[to control and kill Cyborg
with Sun Ze Yi.]

168
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,580
Bravo!

169
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,870
Nice!

170
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,550
Bravo!

171
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,180
Guys, keep going.

172
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,010
Come on.

173
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,330
[Jeffrey is going to dive.]

174
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,000
[Ji Xiang Kong attacks. Awesome!]

175
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,500
[Jeffrey sees him and
wants to escape. It's too late now.]

176
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,820
[Xia Ling and his double attacks!]

177
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,540
[Stay here, Jeffrey!]

178
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,290
Bravo!

179
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,150
[There is a price to pay for
attempting to tower dive.]

180
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,650
[He doesn't even know
what strategy Team Phenix is using.]

181
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,300
[Team Phenix is using the most common
global gank strategy.]

182
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,590
[The player can't see most of the game.]

183
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,140
Boys, I don't think we can win this time.

184
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,000
So what do we do?

185
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,140
Listen. Alright.
Here is what we're going to do.

186
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,140
We're going to pretend to lose on purpose.

187
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,480
-What?
-Why?

188
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,110
Just do as I say!

189
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,700
Trust me.

190
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,690
Okay okay.

191
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,030
Trust me

192
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:39,950
Go back...

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:40,630
[Pei Xi and Xia Ling]

194
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:42,960
[killed Jeffrey effortlessly.]

195
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,200
[Phenix's vision has been set.]

196
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,300
[Ji Xiang Kong is trying
to lure the enemy.]

197
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,330
[But, it's so obvious.
Will Jeffrey fall for his trap?]

198
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:52,720
[Jeffrey is having a mental breakdown.]

199
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,430
[Jeffrey tried to
kill Ji Xiang Kong with one attack.]

200
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,410
[But Ji Xiang Kong
got away immediately.]

201
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,460
[Am I seeing things?]

202
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,680
Did Ji Xiang Kong
expect that move from Jeffrey?

203
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,800
What is Ji Xiang Kong doing?

204
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,170
I would've already won the game by now.

205
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,180
Stop it.

206
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,470
[Just as the Tatans gathered,]

207
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,900
[Ji Xiang Kong used his strongest attack
and suppressed five of them.]

208
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,580
[With another attack, he controlled Musk,]

209
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,580
[silenced Jeffrey and killed Megaera!]

210
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,350
[Four of Phenix's members]

211
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,890
[who had been lurking
for a long time appeared together.]

212
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,730
[Xia Ling leads the way,]

213
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,550
[using both his skills]

214
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,900
[to take Jeffrey away.]

215
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,160
[No more Tatans left.]

216
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,760
[Team Phenix advances ahead.]

217
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,430
Bravo!

218
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,100
[They took the nexus!]

219
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,650
-Good!
-Bravo! Nice.

220
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,370
Good game.

221
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,130
Xiang Kong won this game.

222
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,250
Pretend yeah?

223
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,960
[Congrats Team Phenix]

224
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,950
[for winning the first round of
the international finals.]

225
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:02,420
[Now it is one to zero.]

226
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Come on.

227
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:17,080
What are they doing?

228
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,080
What happened?

229
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,130
No matter what,

230
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,270
we won a round.

231
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,350
It's good for us.

232
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,850
Let's talk later.

233
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,010
Well done guys.

234
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,150
Awesome.

235
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,570
What's going on?

236
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,450
Team Phenix
is such a formidable team.

237
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:46,930
What's wrong, Chairman Jin?

238
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,360
Now, I

239
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,500
am a calculative businessman.

240
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,370
If Xiang Kong hadn't left,

241
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,000
our Legends

242
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,580
should be at that position right now.

243
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,210
It's okay, Chairman Jin.

244
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,210
Next season,

245
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,510
we'll do a better job.

246
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,220
Sister Wen.

247
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:24,330
What's wrong?

248
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,770
You've won a round.

249
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,370
Why are you so dejected?

250
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,540
Have a seat.

251
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,760
Although we won this round,

252
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,930
I've never seen their tactics before.

253
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:44,530
Our victory was partly based on luck.

254
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,070
Brother Kong.

255
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,310
Next round,

256
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,700
should we try the shadow tactics?

257
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,910
Yes.

258
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,890
You made it to the finals
thanks to the shadow tactics.

259
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,330
As long as you use this trump card,

260
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,570
you will win the game.

261
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,550
At this crucial moment,

262
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,210
we can never let our guard down.

263
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,280
We're against

264
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,830
the world champion from last year.

265
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,960
No mistakes allowed.

266
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,650
Trust us.

267
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,160
We won't make mistakes.

268
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,030
Relax.

269
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,160
Anyway, I'm going to avenge the Legends.

270
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,460
Looking good, guys.

271
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,600
Ji Xiang Kong, right now,

272
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,180
you only have
the shadow tactics left, right?

273
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,230
We are so looking forward to it.

274
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,990
Alright guys, let's go!

275
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,640
Look at Jeffrey's attitude.

276
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:49,080
What does he mean?

277
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,470
Did they find out how to crack
the shadow tactics?

278
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
Shadow tactics
is not that easy to crack.

279
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,430
This is the final game. Let's go!

280
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,550
Come on, we can do this!

281
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,980
[Welcome back to the game.]

282
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,340
[Now, the second round of the finals]

283
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,960
[is about to begin.]

284
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,000
[In the first round,]

285
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,880
[Team Phenix used
the global gank strategy]

286
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,950
[and won.]

287
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,190
[Phenix is leading.]

288
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,430
[Judging from the current lineup,
it seems like Phenix is going to use]

289
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,460
[the shadow tactics
which haven't been cracked yet.]

290
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,340
Oh man, losers!

291
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:22,730
I knew they have nothing else
but a stupid shadow.

292
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:26,060
Alright boys, stick to the original plan.

293
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,000
It's bulletproof.

294
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,510
Their lineup.
is exactly the same with the last round.

295
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,330
Maybe they are lazy to change.

296
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:33,700
No way.

297
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,410
I don't know what they are up to either.

298
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,330
Let's play safe this round.
Creating better horizon

299
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,870
Avoid attacking at the early stage.

300
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,300
Okay

301
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,860
[Team Tatan chose the same lineup
as the previous round.]

302
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,420
[They did nothing outstanding
with this lineup.]

303
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:50,060
[Is he confident with his lineup?]

304
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,480
[I feel like Team Tatan
is going to adjust their strategy.]

305
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,250
[This lineup]

306
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,490
[can defend against
the shadow tactics to a certain extent.]

307
00:15:58,610 --> 00:15:59,770
Top laner is missing.

308
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,130
Bot lane is missing. Be careful, mid-lane.

309
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,720
-I've been attacked.
-Can you retreat?

310
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,840
Xia Ling, I'm coming to you.

311
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:04,630
-I can change with you.
-Sure.

312
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,530
Retreat.

313
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,710
Don't attack now.

314
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,540
Tatan multiplied their substitutes.

315
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,010
Whenever Phenix tried to attack,

316
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,370
they'd avoid it successfully.

317
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,950
Yes, they are staying together.

318
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,370
They are limiting
Phenix's mid-laner from moving.

319
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:16,580
Their positions are switched frequently.

320
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,790
We should be careful.

321
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,760
They kept changing positions
and then disappear.

322
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,740
Seriously? Quad switch?

323
00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:24,430
[When did Tatan switch positions?]

324
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,930
[They cracked the shadow tactics,]

325
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,960
[Jeffrey has become the mid-laner.]

326
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,080
[Besides, Tatan's support]

327
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,880
[seems to have
switched positions with the carry.]

328
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:34,060
[Tatan isn't using the shadow tactics.]

329
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,480
[To be exact,
it's using double shadow tactics.]

330
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,800
[Quad switching positions.]

331
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,600
[Phenix is fully surrounded.]

332
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,810
This is bad.

333
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,460
Phenix can't attack.

334
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,480
I didn't expect they would use

335
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,560
the quad switching positions

336
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,760
to defend against the shadow tactics.

337
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,080
Three of them are coming after me.

338
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,450
I can't leave.

339
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,070
Oh, nice!

340
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,540
Alright let's go for the other one, guys.

341
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,650
This is going to be easy.

342
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,480
He's waiting for us.

343
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,640
[Double kill. Triple kill.]

344
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,050
Nice. One tower down.

345
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,460
Nice.

346
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,460
Pentakill!

347
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,920
Come on, Phenix!

348
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:11,119
Nice!

349
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,140
[Tatan slayed their opponents!]

350
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,030
[Jeffrey's stats are increasing rapidly.]

351
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,609
[Phenix couldn't fight back at all.]

352
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,900
What's wrong, Ji Xiang Kong?

353
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,940
You didn't expect this, right?

354
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:22,099
We've cracked your tactics long ago.

355
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,000
Right now,

356
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:26,910
shadow tactic isn't going to work anymore.

357
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,230
The first round.

358
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,640
We lost it on purpose.

359
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,320
What should we do now?

360
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,650
Drop the top lane.

361
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,780
Fight the Dragon.

362
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,750
Get the Dragon.

363
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,950
That's our only hope.

364
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,320
-Come on.
-Come with me.

365
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,300
Coming.

366
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,510
[Since the start of the game,]

367
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,190
[Phenix has been on the losing end.]

368
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,210
[They are still looking
for a breakthrough.]

369
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,190
[There they are. Five of them.]

370
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,020
[They are going for the Baron.]

371
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,040
[Tatan has planted vision all around.]

372
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,910
[Phenix must be careful!]

373
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,220
They are destroying our tower.

374
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,810
Ignore them. Abandon this tower.

375
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:55,960
Xiang Kong, what about the Highland?

376
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,900
Brother Sun, why don't you
guard the top lane?

377
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,240
-Pei Xi, you too.
-Okay.

378
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,090
Go!

379
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,760
[Baron only have one third HP left.]

380
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,120
[Lin Yi Xuan is
waiting outside the Dragon Pit.]

381
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,910
[He sees two Tatan players coming.]

382
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,690
[It seems that he's trying to
attract their attention]

383
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,180
[so his team can kill Baron swiftly.]

384
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,300
[But the two of them couldn't care less]

385
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,740
[and went straight to the Dragon Pit!]

386
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,430
Ignore them. Continue attacking Baron.

387
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,120
-He is losing HP.
-His HP is low. I can kill him.

388
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,720
Xia Ling, what are you doing?
Come back! Attack Baron!

389
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
His HP is low!

390
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,530
Baron's HP is critically low, Xia Ling!

391
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,970
End it! Kill it!

392
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,250
Lin Yi Xuan, who told you go there?

393
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,400
-We need to kill Baron!
-No, I can't.

394
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,090
Retreat...

395
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,730
Go! Blue, help me!

396
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,040
Five of Tatan's players
jumped into the Dragon Pit.

397
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,450
Ji Xiang Kong is critically injured.

398
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,020
Ji Xiang Kong has been killed!

399
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,270
Xia Ling has been killed!

400
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:36,900
Why didn't you obey my order?

401
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,360
[Congratulations, Tatan for
winning this round.]

402
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,570
[The score is one versus one. It's a tie.]

403
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,570
[After ten minutes break,]

404
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,870
[we'll welcome the final round.]

405
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,630
[Stay tuned!]

406
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,210
Don't go.

407
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,770
Let them calm down.

408
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,690
There's still a chance.

409
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,930
I need to find Xiang Kong.

410
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,360
For the next round,

411
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,370
what strategy are we using?

412
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,890
Judging from their strategy,

413
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,570
it's clear
they have studied us thoroughly.

414
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,880
If them can crack our shadow tactics,

415
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,600
they can also crack
all the tactics we are good at.

416
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,410
Then...

417
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,150
What should we do?

418
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,570
I'm sorry.

419
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,800
I don't know the answer either.

420
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,110
Captain, then...

421
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,530
Xiang Kong.

422
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,720
Don't stress yourself out.

423
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,270
I need some fresh air.

424
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,610
Brother Sun, I...

425
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,960
Xiang Kong.

426
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,380
Mi Ya.

427
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,190
Why are you here?

428
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,010
I wanted to see you.

429
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,800
When I was watching you earlier,

430
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,260
while listening to Qiu Ying's commentary,

431
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,710
I finally realised

432
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,030
she knows you better.

433
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:33,930
She understands you more than I do.

434
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,010
We...

435
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,350
We missed too much.

436
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,540
And my eyes.

437
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,080
You knew it already?

438
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,460
Your recovery

439
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:57,430
is the best news I've heard all day.

440
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,190
The score now

441
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,340
is one versus one, a tie.

442
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,920
But Phenix's morale
has been hurt seriously.

443
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,880
If they continue the next game
with a load on their mind,

444
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,880
it will be disadvantageous for
Ji Xiang Kong and his team.

445
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,190
Perhaps

446
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,210
someone should remind them about this.

447
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,810
Me?

448
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,350
-Sister Shu Wen and the rest should be...
-Qiu Ying.

449
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,260
It's not just Ji Xiang Kong and his team
who needs to adjust.

450
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,130
You need to adjust, too.

451
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,330
We have ten minutes.

452
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,790
Return before the game.

453
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,170
Go.

454
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:47,800
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

455
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm sorry, Xiang Kong.

456
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,720
I was too selfish.

457
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,820
In other to keep you by my side,

458
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,250
I made use of
your responsibility and promise.

459
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,950
I must've hurt Qiu Ying, too.

460
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:18,790
Please apologize to her on my behalf.

461
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,950
I hope it's not too late.

462
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,950
I've never given up on Qiu Ying.

463
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,050
When the game is over,

464
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,530
I will explain to her.

465
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,610
You have my blessing.

466
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,460
Qiu Ying!

467
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,200
-Brother Kong.
-Xiang Kong.

468
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:10,770
Qiu Ying!

469
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,730
Talk to her after this.

470
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,970
We're about to go on stage.

471
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:19,580
Xiang Kong.

472
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,650
Are you ready?

473
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,710
I'm sorry.

474
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,050
We might have to play the game
without any strategy.

475
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,620
Today's match

476
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,480
is not only about us.

477
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,620
It concerns

478
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,600
all the esports players in China.

479
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,910
We have to fulfill their dreams

480
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,360
and stand at the peak of the world.

481
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,420
Come on.

482
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,840
Friends.

483
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,530
Time for us to show our skills.

484
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,800
[Welcome back.]

485
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,580
[Let's give a big round of applause]

486
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,560
[for Team Phenix!]

487
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:09,580
[I am 30 years old.]

488
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,970
[I've passed the prime
of a professional esports player.]

489
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,080
[I thought I would never get to
do crazy things again.]

490
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:17,780
[I am able to return to the stage]

491
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,770
[to prove I am not a failure.]

492
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,820
[I am satisfied with this.]

493
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,810
[I once said]

494
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,860
[the biggest dream in my life]

495
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,950
[is to enter the competition with you.]

496
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,100
[I have already achieved my dream.]

497
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,780
[Captain.]

498
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,860
[I've only been
a professional player for six months.]

499
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,080
[Yet I've entered the finals
of the International Championship.]

500
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,400
[and compete with my idol.]

501
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,290
[I have no regrets.]

502
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,780
[My biggest dream]

503
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,910
[is to have a group of team members]

504
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,460
[who can fight alongside me.]

505
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,000
[My dream has come true today.]

506
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:57,420
[So,]

507
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,640
[let's enjoy the rest of the game.]

508
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,230
[I was doubted]

509
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,890
[for being an unqualified player.]

510
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,050
[Fortunately]

511
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,360
[everyone trusted me willingly.]

512
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,430
[After losing that match one year ago,]

513
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,410
[the captain retired with regret.]

514
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,100
[You didn't leave
when I was at my lowest point.]

515
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,440
[Our rival is very strong.]

516
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:21,920
[Right now,]

517
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:23,370
[countless longing gazes]

518
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,110
[Termination agreement]

519
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,840
[are focused on this stage.]

520
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,470
[I don't want it to end.]

521
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,280
[Our dream of becoming the champion.]

522
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,930
[Let's work hard to achieve it!]

523
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,670
[Now, Team Phenix is still on stage.]

524
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:46,970
Why are they on the stage? Phenix!

525
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:57,990
Wait a minute.

526
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,830
What are they doing?

527
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:01,510
What are they doing?

528
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,390
[Pioneers.]

529
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,610
[Legends.]

530
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,080
[VNG. They are pinning
other teams' badges on their jackets.]

531
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,190
[Today, I think]

532
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,830
[they are not competing for themselves.]

533
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,040
[Actually, Team Phenix]

534
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:45,350
[is a combination of
VNG, Legends and Pioneers.]

535
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,670
[They are carrying
the dream of two generations.]

536
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,390
The best moment of China gaming history.

537
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,040
We stand up.

538
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,160
No matter what,

539
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,460
we still have to beat them.

540
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,700
Stay focused.

541
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:20,950
In this round,

542
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,920
pick the champion you play best.

543
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,130
Alright, guys. Are we ready for this?

544
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,710
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

545
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,020
Phenix, all the best!

546
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:39,380
Phenix, all the best!

547
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,730
[We can see]

548
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,070
[the audience are cheering for Phenix.]

549
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,390
[In this season,]

550
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,750
[according to the official statistics,]

551
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,350
[Stone Beast, Dictator,]

552
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:50,300
[Xin, Chariot Man, and Jin Can]

553
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,250
[are the champions
that have highest winning rate.]

554
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,710
[But the lineup of Phenix this time]

555
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,110
[is relatively weaker in stats.]

556
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:02,180
[If Tatan plays like how they did earlier,]

557
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,860
[it's going to be
a tough fight for Phenix.]

558
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,170
[I believe]

559
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,910
[the third round will be an exciting one.]

560
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,940
Lin Yi Xuan, loiter outside.

561
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,130
-Okay.
-Be the spy.

562
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:17,830
I'll do that.

563
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,650
Gather.

564
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:22,050
[Things don't seem good for Phenix.]

565
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,330
[Tatan are surrounding them from behind.]

566
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,330
[Phenix blocks Jeffrey.]

567
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,300
[If they kill Jeffrey swiftly,
things will look up for them.]

568
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,280
[Oh no!]

569
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,210
[Knight and Jeffrey's triple attack!]

570
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:33,780
[Phenix's HP is running low.]

571
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,140
Should we retreat?

572
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,780
I will take charge.

573
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,000
You, jungler.

574
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,020
Sure.

575
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,560
I'll go to the top lane. Pei Xi, mid-lane.

576
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:42,400
Xia Ling, bot lane.

577
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,130
[But Phenix doesn't
have the vision of Tatan's side.]

578
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,040
[If they act recklessly,
they might get into trouble.]

579
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,060
[In this situation,]

580
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,520
[all they can do is to
avoid being attacked.]

581
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,280
[If Phenix can't come up with
an idea to get out of the situation,]

582
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,900
[it will be risky for them.]

583
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,810
[The economy stats of Tatan and Phenix
differs by 5,000 points.]

584
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,250
[Man count...]

585
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,770
[Five versus one.]

586
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,710
[One of Phenix's towers
has been taken down.]

587
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,750
[At this rate,]

588
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,500
[Tatan's economy will get stronger.]

589
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,670
Tatan is surrounding us again.

590
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,210
Brother Kong, I can't get to Baron.

591
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,610
[Tatan decides to attack Baron.]

592
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,530
[As long as they kill it,]

593
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,200
[they are likely to win this round.]

594
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,430
[But for Phenix,]

595
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,940
[it's one disaster after another.]

596
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,290
[Phenix is in a risky position now.]

597
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,560
[Why isn't Phenix taking any action?]

598
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,490
[Are they running out of tactics?]

599
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,650
[Pei Xi, Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan]

600
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:21,800
[have been killed.]

601
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,430
[They were too rash this time.]

602
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,360
[Tatan is moving together.]

603
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:26,920
[Phenix is lagging behind.]

604
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,000
[They should retreat
instead of attacking.]

605
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,370
[Otherwise, things may go out of hand.]

606
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,630
[Something is wrong with Phenix.]

607
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,200
[Is something wrong
in their communication?[

608
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,530
Don't give up!

609
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,310
Are you letting down
those who trusted you?

610
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,520
Can you think of a solution? Brother Kong!

611
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,560
I want to win, I don't want to lose!

612
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,600
Quiet, let me think!

613
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,210
Is Phenix giving up?

614
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,970
[If Tatan takes Baron
and advances to the Highland,]

615
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,330
[Phenix will definitely lose!]

616
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,820
[Tatan had just killed Baron.]

617
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,050
Brother Sun, what shall we do now?

618
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:56,190
Defend our territory.
Forget about the towers.

619
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,060
[Phenix's tower had been demolished.]

620
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,460
[Tatan is getting ready
for their last attack.]

621
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,810
[They will win the finals soon!]

622
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,450
Give me five!

623
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,050
I want to see their faces.

624
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:13,180
[Phenix is not a team
that will give up easily.]

625
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,580
[I believe Ji Xiang Kong
will come out with a new solution.]

626
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:17,950
[Ji Xiang Kong, you can do it.]

627
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,450
[Phenix, you can do it!]

628
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,260
[Phenix, you can do it!]

629
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,770
Why are you using this?

630
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:32,160
The Blaze Rod is so pretty.

631
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,110
It's only effective during multiple
attacks. At least three times.

632
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,880
Ji Xiang Kong!

633
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,680
You will definitely

634
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,960
win the international championship!

635
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:47,130
I have an idea.

636
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,830
Xia Ling, Pei Xi. Sell your equipment.

637
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,880
Use the Blaze Rod.

638
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:52,980
What for?

639
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,160
It has a self-damaging effect!

640
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,280
Brother Sun,

641
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:01,850
should we use the Blaze Rod?

642
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:02,830
We have to believe Xiang Kong.

643
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,030
It can cause stack damage.

644
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,420
That's our only way out.

645
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,380
Go.

646
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,050
These boys won't give up easily.

647
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,070
They must have a trump card.

648
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,470
Have trust in them.

649
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,650
[Hang on. Pei Xi?]

650
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,240
[What is he doing? He...]

651
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,270
[Why is he selling]

652
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:24,590
[all the equipment?]

653
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,630
[Xia Ling is doing the same.]

654
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,380
[Both supports in Phenix are selling]

655
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,710
[all their equipment.]

656
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,010
[Does it mean they are giving up?]

657
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,250
[Blaze Rod?]

658
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:31,930
[Pei Xi and Xia Ling]

659
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,230
[used Blaze Rod at the same time.]

660
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,430
[This is the lowest cost-performance
equipment in the game.]

661
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,640
[Do you like fireworks?]

662
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,710
All girls love it.

it feels like the whole world
is lighting up just for me.

-Retreat.
-What should I do?

681

[he lights
the first Blaze Rod for Phenix!]

[Lin Yi Xuan is helping Xia Ling.
 Are they going to attack?]

703

Xia Ling, the second one!

704
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,060
I'm on it!

705

♫ Beyond the limit ♫

827
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,950
♫ The journey might be tough ♫

828
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,160
♫ Stand against the storm ♫

829
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:39,260
[Oh gosh!]

830
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,040
[What a moment!
We're cheering together on the stage!]

831
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:47,810
[What a special moment.
What a way to end this day!]

832
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,350
[Absolutely amazing.]

833
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,470
[Everybody.]

834
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,220
[Your champions.]

835
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,660
Feels awkward

836
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,110
when everyone's on a holiday.

837
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:52,360
Yes.

838
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,940
It feels like a dream.

839
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,720
I remember giving you the key.

840
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,320
It felt like yesterday.

841
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,830
Captain, thank you.

842
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,230
Here.

843
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:10,640
Take it back.

844
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:19,570
This

845
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,270
is for your support to Phenix.

846
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,350
Captain,

847
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,910
I promised

848
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,680
to bring back
the second championship ring.

849
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,500
I did it.

850
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:40,230
You shouldn't be thanking me.

851
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:42,240
You should thank your past self.

852
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,080
Thank you

853
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,700
for not giving up.

854
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:00,880
Actually the two rings

855
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,260
don't belong to you

856
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,730
or me.

857
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,440
They signify China's glory in iConquer.

858
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,000
This isn't the end,

859
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,510
but a turning point.

860
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:11,510
We should hang them here

861
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:14,010
so the future teams
will continue our glory.

862
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:41,360
Watch out.

863
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,350
It's so high.

864
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,980
Is this our destination?

865
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,070
Well,

866
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,850
besides its height,

867
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:05,350
what else is different here?

868
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:07,380
Close your eyes and you'll know.

869
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,740
Why?

870
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,250
Just close your eyes.

871
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:18,870
Three, two, one.

872
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,430
Open your eyes.

873
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:22,260
♫ Deciding to go to the top of the world ♫

874
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:25,500
