00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,750
My leg.

8
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:04,910
It hurts.

9
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,550
-Sorry, are you okay?
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?

10
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,280
I am fine.

11
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,490
-I can stand up by myself.
-Let me help you.

She is fine. You can go back to the car.

It's okay.

Are you sure?

17
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,550
Do I need to send you to the hospital?

18
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,510
It's okay. I still have to find Gu Fang.

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:30,930
I came to Vancouver

20

just to see Gu Fang.

21

No, the temperature is fine.

You looked like
you were crippled just now.

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,180
I even thought about

53

having to take care of you my whole life.

54
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,990
It's not that serious.

55

Tell me then. Which year did he
win his first world championship?

63

When did he win his first MVP?

-Sorry. I mistook you for someone else.
-[He's playing me!]

during the competition just now.

Where is my phone?

91

I left it in the team's car.

92

Yes. The captain is inside. Go in.

103

Aren't you going to come with me?

104
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,870
Go in first.
I'll come as soon as I park my car.

105
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,860
I will wait for you inside then.

106
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,560
See you later.

107
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,920
Hi, can I help you?

108
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,150
I find Gu Fang.

109

Okay. Wait.

-Yeah.
-I love those guys.

Gu Fang, he comes here? Where?

123
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,310
Oh, you think he is here? No.

124
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,540
I definitely would've noticed
if he was here.

125
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,860
Not here?

126
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
-No.
-Sorry.

127
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,940
I hope you will find him though.

Thank you.

129
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,590
Hey, how is it going?

130
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,200
[Have you interviewed Gu Fang?]

131
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,160
Yi Yi, I was fooled by someone.

132
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,380
I don't even know where Gu Fang is now.

133
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:31,660
By the way, I asked you to follow
Legends' fans in Weibo before this.

134
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,400
Any updates from them?

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,770
Wait for a moment. Let me have a look.

136
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,430
They just uploaded
some photos of the team.

137
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,450
[It seems like]

138
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,060
they are in Vancouver's Top Bar.

139
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,200
I got it. I'll go there now.

140
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,130
Captain.

141
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,950
What happened?

142
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:07,770
We have been sitting here for a long time
and dare not approach him.

143
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,990
No matter what,
we are the silver medal winner, right?

144
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,360
Is being second embarrassing?

145
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,910
We are better than all
except one, right? Brother Yao.

146
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,160
Cheer up. Come on.

147
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,450
It's not embarrassing?

148
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,700
Why are we here?

149
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,240
We came here for the champion,
not for the second place.

150
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:57,190
Reflect on yourself. Okay?

151
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,980
Hello, Yi Yi. I've reached the bar.

152
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,350
I'm looking for them.

153
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,040
I see Gu Fang.
Let me shoot some background scenes first.

154
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,850
When I interview Gu Fang,
make sure that the signal is stable.

155
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,320
Don't worry.

156
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,920
It is your first interview in IConquer.

157
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,260
[You put in so much effort to get
this exclusive. I'll take it seriously.]

158
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:22,170
[Moreover, if I make any mistakes,
even if you don't blame me,]

159
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,430
[Mr. Liu will definitely fire me, right?]

160
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,650
I'll go there now.

161
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,510
-All the best!
-All the best.

162
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,170
Captain.

163
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,260
Don't think too much.

164
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,060
You always tell me this, right?

165
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,970
The most important thing
is to get up after you lose a game.

166
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,530
I was just consoling you.

167
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,240
If you say that,

168
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,310
you will lose your authority after this.

169
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,870
Xiang Kong, sorry.

170
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,890
Why are you apologising?

171
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,840
It is not your responsibility alone
for losing the game.

172
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,600
Actually, I've seen it.

173
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,600
I saw you giving them a suggestion

174
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:22,390
for me to exchange position with Huo Yao.

175
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,330
-Captain.
-You knew that my condition is bad.

176
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,600
If I had supported your suggestion
to change our strategy,

177
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,230
we might have won today.

178
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,040
It's just a possibility.

179
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:41,130
There is not foolproof strategy.

180
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,330
But I can't accept this.

181
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,920
Four years.

182
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,370
I've gotten the second place
for four times.

183
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,660
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,730
Stop apologising.

185
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,420
It is not your responsibility alone.
We are all...

186
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,070
I've been playing for 10 years.

187
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,920
I know my condition very well.

188
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,070
[My time has passed.]

189
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,000
[Sometimes, I clearly know
when, where and how they'll attack us.]

190
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,670
But I couldn't dodge the attacks.

191
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,650
[So, they lost because of Gu Fang.]

192
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,910
[This will become a hot topic.]

193
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,080
-Is it the signal problem?
-Mr. Liu.

194
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,490
-Come on, don't just sit here. Call her.
-I...

195
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,140
-Why is it disconnected all of the sudden?
-She must be...

196
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,570
Call her. Pick up your phone and call her.

197
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,520
Okay, I'll call her.

198
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,120
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

199
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,650
Hello, Yi Yi.

200
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,500
[What are you doing, Qiu Ying?]

201
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,620
Gu Fang is right there.
Why didn't you interview him?

202
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,720
What did Gu Fang say to Ji Xiang Kong?
What does he mean by he couldn't dodge it?

203
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,300
Hurry up and film them.

204
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:28,400
[Mr. Liu.]

205
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:30,460
I...

206
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,010
[I need to build a good relationship
with them first, right?]

207
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,910
[If he refuses me after I
request to interview him directly,]

208
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,650
we may lose them as future partners.

209
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,910
[Why did I send you there? You are a host.
You are there to interview him.]

210
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,340
I'll go and pay. Wait for me in the car.

211
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,990
Thank you, Brother Kong.

212
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,700
Sorry.

213
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,140
Don't worry, Mr. Liu.
I will figure it out.

214
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,600
I don't want to hear this.

215
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,630
Go to them right now.

216
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,540
Okay.

217
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,020
-Hey, beauty girl. I like you.
-What are you doing? No!

218
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,580
I don't like you! Don't touch me. No!

219
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,070
-What are you doing?
-This is my girl.

220
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,930
[He said, my girl?]

221
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:26,120
Okay.

222
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,120
Thank you.

223
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,430
Thank you.

224
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,780
You are so persistent.

225
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,700
Are you not mad
for not finding anything there just now?

226
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,850
Why will I be mad? You just saved me.

227
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,170
What about I treat you to a meal some day?

228
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,200
Just a meal?

229
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,280
What do you want then?

230
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:15,910
Very easy.

231
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,730
Go out and turn left. Bye.

232
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,730
-I really want to thank you.
-Don't bother.

233
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:24,500
You are the one who sneaked into
the backstage acting like a staff, right?

234
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,420
-[Take care of your dress.]
-[Sorry.]

235
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,840
[What? Take care of your dress.]

236
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,940
Now, you are pretending to be a fan
again and again.

237
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,550
Your goal is to dig out
information about Gu Fang, right?

238
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,840
Sorry. He doesn't accept
any interview now.

239
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,880
He needs his peace.

240
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,890
I don't care. I have to interview Gu Fang.

241
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,300
Ji Xiang Kong.

242
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,180
Wait.

243
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,760
I admit that I lied to you.

244
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,910
But I only did it for my job.

245
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,550
Let me introduce myself.

246
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:12,040
I am a host from You Xing Video.
My name is Qiu Ying.

247
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,839
I came to Vancouver this time

248
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,750
to interview about the championship

249
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,300
as well as Gu Fang.

250
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,359
No matter what you think,

251
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,819
I still hope that you can help me.

252
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,849
Because Gu Fang is the idol of
China's e-sports.

253
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,790
-This competition...
-Does beautiful girl

254
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,340
have bad memory?

255
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,540
I just told you very clearly
not to disturb him.

256
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,550
Or

257
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,630
are you willing to do anything

258
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:39,900
in order to interview him?

259
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,440
It's too late tonight.

260
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,050
I still have work to do.

261
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,980
Let me write down my phone number for you.

262
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,870
I really want to interview him.

263
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,220
But I know that
he is very upset right now.

264
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,640
You can call me anytime
when he's feeling better.

265
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,520
I'll leave right now. Bye.

266
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,130
Remember to call me.

267
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,390
Sit here.

268
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,160
-How is he?
-He is still sleeping.

269
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,430
Manager Zhao called to tell us that
if the captain is too drunk,

270
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,430
the fan meeting tonight will be cancelled.

271
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,780
That Sly Zhao.

272
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,430
Look at him just now.

273
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,150
If we had won today,

274
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,350
I don't believe that he would do this.

275
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,690
But it's good that it's cancelled.

276
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,090
I can't bear to see him
forcing a smile for everyone.

277
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,710
Playing a game with me?

278
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,630
Whose necklace is that?

279
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,150
None of your business.

280
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,630
Fine.

281
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,230
Driver, let's go, come on.

282
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:24,900
Let's go.

283
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,080
Hello, Yi Yi.

284
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,500
Qiu Ying. How did it go?

285
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,190
[Have you interviewed Gu Fang?]

286
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,490
Not yet.

287
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,510
He just lost the competition today.

288
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,620
He is sad now.

289
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,900
Isn't it inhumane

290
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:04,930
to interview him

291
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,480
at this time?

292
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,010
Is that important right now?

293
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,010
[If you pity him,]

294
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,790
[Mr. Liu will be inhumane to you.]

295
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,200
At first, I was going to

296
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,000
interview him directly.

297
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:23,560
But in the end,

298
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,820
I was caught and I was kicked out.

299
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,610
Forget it. The most important thing now
is to broadcast Gu Fang's fan meeting.

300
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,800
[Be there on time. Do not be late again.]

301
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,710
Maybe, you will find a chance
to interview Gu Fang.

302
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,770
Okay, I got it.

303
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,890
I am on my way there.

304
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,780
Hurry up then.

305
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,330
Don't worry.

306
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,020
The event has been cancelled.

307
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,940
Why are they only posting it now?

308
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,740
Connect with her now.

309
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,020
The live broadcast is going to start.
Make sure that nothing goes wrong.

310
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,310
Are you there yet, Qiu Ying?

311
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,120
Ask him to check their official website.

312
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,870
Five minutes ago, they posted that

313
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,000
due to Gu Fang's health problem,
the fan meeting has been cancelled.

314
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,310
Mr. Liu, the event has been cancelled.

315
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,300
[I don't care what's the reason
or whose problem it is.]

316
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,010
[Our company has invested so much
into this. We have to do it!]

317
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,730
[Let me tell you, Qiu Ying.
Start broadcasting within 30 seconds!]

318
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,320
[You have to be online!]

319
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:15,080
No, Mr. Liu. Hello?

320
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:17,740
Mr. Liu. She's all alone over there.

321
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,470
How can she handle this?

322
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,040
[Hello, everyone. I am the host
of You Xing Video, Qiu Ying.]

323
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,150
[Today, I will bring you the
latest information about IConquer.]

324
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,780
What should we do, Mr. Liu?
Our real-time data keeps on going down.

325
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,070
You know that
everyone is here for Gu Fang.

326
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,680
But the event has been cancelled.
I don't think

327
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,630
we need to do the live broadcast anymore.

328
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,740
No, we can't stop. Do we have
anything else about IConquer to post?

329
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,860
No. Ask her to find a way.
This live broadcast must not stop.

330
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,350
This is beyond her power.

331
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,430
If we stop this live streaming,
we'll all be fired.

332
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,080
Looks like everyone
is very enthusiastic today.

333
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,490
But unfortunately, today's event
has been cancelled in the last minute.

334
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,820
It's really a pity that the Legends
has missed the first place again.

335
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,140
How about this.

336
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,530
On behalf of You Xing Video,
let me give you a special show.

337
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,880
Let's cheer for the Legends. Stay tune.

338
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,690
Please wait for a moment.

339
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:52,520
The show will start soon. Stay tune.

340
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,060
Qiu Ying is really going to dance?

341
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,260
Not bad.

342
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,230
She created her own event.

343
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:20,040
♫ Just listen. Don't tell me yes or no ♫

344
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,950
♫ At your one o'clock,
my heart is beating for you ♫

345
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:31,120
♫ I'm in a trance. Come to me ♫

346
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,380
Is that the place where the fan meeting
was supposed to be held in?

347
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,680
Yes.

348
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,140
That Zhao Yang.

349
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,160
If it wasn't because of him,
I would be able to meet Qiu Ying today.

350
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:45,330
I remember now. She was chatting with
Handsome Ji in front of the bar.

351
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,550
I think I saw her too.

352
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,680
Why didn't you tell me?

353
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,430
Do you want to die?

354
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,720
Captain has fallen asleep.

355
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,650
Handsome Ji, you know Qiu Ying?

356
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,870
Looks like you know her well.

357
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,330
Introduce her to me?

358
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,800
I've been following her for a long time.

359
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:10,160
She acts badly, has low IQ

360
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:13,180
and uses e-sports to gain popularity.
Do you think I'll know her well?

361
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,320
He is indeed Handsome Ji.
Always so observant.

362
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,190
What did you say?

363
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,560
Okay. More people are watching.

364
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:29,020
Now, upload the video
of Gu Fang and Ji Xiang Kong.

365
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,840
Mr. Liu, I don't think it's appropriate
to upload that video.

366
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,400
Why not? Strike the iron while it's hot.
Post it now.

367
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,360
Post it in our official account too.

368
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,660
I think she is as good as
the superstar, Mia.

369
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,040
You are right.

370
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,020
If you compare her to Mia,
Brother Kong will hit you.

371
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,260
Why?

372
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,930
Handsome Ji is Mia's hardcore fan.

373
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:53,670
Hardcore fan?

374
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,370
Let me tell you, it's called loyalty.

375
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,760
He collects her albums,
because he's faithful, right?

376
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:03,640
He always buys three of the same album.

377
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,690
One for him to listen, one for him to keep
and one for him to bring around, right?

378
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,230
Yes. He even bows to her poster every day.

379
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:10,610
No.

380
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:15,590
Her dance is similar to Mia, right?

381
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,780
Brother Kong, do you know her well?

382
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,360
Brother Kong.
Mia is too far away from you.

383
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,620
How about you take her instead?

384
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,040
Go to sleep.

385
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,730
[Ji Xiang Kong]

386
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:44,440
Although your master is not nice,

387
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,590
it's not your fault.

388
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,080
I'll let you warm me up for one last time.

389
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,800
Hello, Qiu Ying.

390
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,250
That was close. Luckily, you're smart.

391
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:22,170
You danced to fill in the gap.

392
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:24,150
[More people are watching us now.]

393
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,640
Really?

394
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:27,780
[That's good.]

395
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,180
You've worked hard today.
Go back to your hotel to rest.

396
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:34,030
I'm already outside of the hotel.

397
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,500
Okay, bye.

398
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,380
Bye.

399
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,930
Are they that similar?

400
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,730
[Why are you apologising?]

401
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,060
[It is not your responsibility alone
for losing the game.]

402
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,340
[Actually, I've seen it.]

403
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,170
She secretly took a video
because she didn't get the interview?

404
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,700
She really does whatever it takes
to be famous.

405
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,130
You knew that my condition is bad.

406
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,960
In that case,

407
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,070
don't blame me for being inhumane.

408
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,040
I still feel cold.

409
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:37,200
I should get up and jump
to warm up my body.

410
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,320
[Your necklace is here. Come and get it
at Marco Polo Hotel at 7am tomorrow.]

411
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:01,970
Three.

412
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,400
Two.

413
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,880
Bye.

414
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,360
Is his phone out of battery?

415
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,000
Hello. Excuse me.

416
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,660
Hi, how can I help you?

417
00:30:49,370 --> 00:30:51,140
I want know him.

418
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,560
Legends.

419
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:53,990
Ji Xiang Kong.

420
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,100
His room number.

421
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,910
I am sorry but you can't take
client's information.

422
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,790
I am his best friend.

423
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,630
But now, his phone is powered off.

424
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,450
So, I think he maybe...

425
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,750
Sleep.

426
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,280
-Okay, let me check.
-Thank you.

427
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,920
Actually, he checked out 15 minutes ago.

428
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,800
-Checked out?
-Yes.

429
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,080
My name is Qiu Ying.
He leaves something for me?

430
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:32,820
No, he didn't leave anything.

431
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,530
Okay.

432
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,120
It's only seven now.

433
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,350
He plays me again.

434
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,630
Excuse me. Maybe you can check our
parking lot. Maybe he is still there.

435
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,840
What?

436
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,920
You can check the parking lot,
P, parking lot.

437
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,820
-P.
-Parking lot. Yes. Maybe he's still there.

438
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,180
It is great. Okay.

439
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,700
-Thank you. Bye.
-Good luck. Bye.

440
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,410
Why isn't our car here yet?

441
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:33,830
Why is their car bigger than ours?

442
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,960
[The necklace is very important to me.
I'll pick it up on time tomorrow.]

443
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,510
[I have arrived at the hotel.
What is your room number?]

444
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:42,160
[If it makes you feel better to play me,
go ahead.]

445
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,440
[But you have to give me back
my necklace.]

446
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,220
[Or else, I won't forgive you. I beg you.]

447
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:49,530
[Please take care of my necklace.]

448
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,470
What are you smiling?

449
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,710
Your fans.

450
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,360
Are they my fans?

451
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,300
They are here to support us.
They are fans from China. Right?

452
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,840
Hello, everyone.

453
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,970
-Hi!
-Hello!

454
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,210
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey, loser.

455
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,010
What's up?

456
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,630
You finally got the first place after
playing IConquer for so many years.

457
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,200
That's not easy. Congratulations.

458
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,520
Loser.

459
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,790
If we are losers just because
we lost once,

460
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,730
it means that you've been losers
for many years.

461
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,900
We will still be the champion next year.

462
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,000
Where is Gu Fang?

463
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:39,790
Is he crying in his bed?

464
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,490
-Watch your words.
-Calm down.

465
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,870
He used to be very powerful
when he used the Holy Princess, right?

466
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Why has he become

467
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,840
so useless now?

468
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:54,250
Who are you talking about?
