4
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,660
Why are you looking at me?

5
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,750
I'm not.

6
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,380
Is it okay?

7
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,490
Not bad.

8
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,810
Challenge the Top 100
of the regional server.

9
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,830
I will lose then.

10
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,260
It's okay. Don't worry.

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,430
I can help you.

12
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,640
We didn't order any drinks.

13
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,079
It's free.

14
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:23,400
Free?

15
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:27,630
When did Dream Traveler become generous?

16
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:30,560
We have always been generous.

17
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,480
Thanks.

18
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,940
Thanks.

19
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,870
Accept the invitation.

20
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,380
You are teaching her
how to move up the ranks?

21
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,950
Why are you still here?

22
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,940
You are wasting your time.

23
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,480
I have time now.

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,780
Choose your champion.

25
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,050
Give me.

26
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,100
Do we have more strawberries?

27
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,700
Yes, it's here.

28
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,880
It's for this customer.

29
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,740
I will send it to the VIP room first.

30
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,860
I will make a better one for you later.

31
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,980
Okay.

32
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,440
Sorry.

-Is someone in the VIP room?
-Ji Xiang Kong is here.

35
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,430
Ji Xiang Kong?

36
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:08,080
Qiu Ying, who is here every day to
become the no. 1 in regional servers too.

37
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,760
You can't memorise your build order.
You have to be flexible.

38
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,010
That's not how you play Creator.
You can kill him now.

39
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,490
Are you sure? I have so little health.

40
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,290
Listen to me. Kill him now. Go.

41
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,110
Control with your E skill.

42
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,890
W to hurt him.

43
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,540
Move.

44
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,860
Equal to A.

45

He blinked.

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,780
Chase with your blink
and kill with your ultimate.

Continue. Keep your hands on the keyboard.

Push. Hit the crystal.

You are great.

51
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,010
You should be more confident.

52

Pei Xi, do you know?

It's still free?

57
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,500
I will try it then. Thanks.

58
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,909
Thanks.

59
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,360
There are so many strawberries.

60
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,450
It is different from your menu.

61
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,760
Thank your cousin for me.

62
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,140
Did you find a new team?

63
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,340
Why won't you leave?

64
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,460
Besides,

65
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,770
that's none of your business.

66
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,660
Don't tell me that
you are not wanted by any teams.

67
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,140
Aren't you asking too much?

68
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,790
I am only worried about next season.

69
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,310
I don't have a good opponent.

70
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,970
Thank you for having high hopes for me

71
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:25,980
but shouldn't you train with my brothers
instead of walking around here?

72
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,390
Shouldn't you find another team

73
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,140
instead of having a date here then?

74
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,090
All right. Stop arguing.

75
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,650
Don't be angry.

76
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:47,680
Pei Xi. Let me give you a suggestion.

77
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,710
Please don't be serious
when you talk in front of girls.

78
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,870
You will scare them.

79
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,690
I don't have so much time like you.

80
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:11,370
Sorry for letting you wait.
I make it better than him.

81
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,080
Thanks.

82
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,400
Don't ask me.

83
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,210
I haven't asked yet.

84
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,000
What's the matter?

85
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,480
I got lucky today because of you.

86
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,230
I got to enter the VIP room
and got free food as well.

87
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,570
The free food is not because of me.

88
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:59,520
I think Pei Xi came in a lot
because he thought I was an eyesore.

89
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,560
-An eyesore? What do you mean?
-He is obviously interested in you.

90
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,150
Should I keep my distance from you?

91
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,550
I don't want to
get in the way of your happiness.

92
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,600
Coach Ji, I haven't had
any happiness since our gossip.

93
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,220
So I need to
be responsible to you forever?

94
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
Dream on.

95
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,470
Actually,

96
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,370
I really want to know
which team you will join.

97
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,880
Do you want to listen to the truth?

98
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,280
Actually, no teams have
contacted me up until now.

99
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,450
It's so strange.

100
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,550
Why did I hide it well usually

101
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,080
but I'm telling you the truth?

102
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,210
That is why we are best friends.

103
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,240
Hello, Leon.

104
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,780
Hello, Ji Xiang Kong.

105
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,640
This is En-ception's manager.
I heard you've left Legends.

106
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,860
Well, I'd like to ask you.

107
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,270
Would you like to join us and fight
for the next year's World Championship?

108
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,330
Thank you for inviting me

109
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:26,510
I know En-ception is
one of the best teams.

110
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,630
But my dream is
to win as a Chinese player.

111
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,400
Thank you.

112
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,870
Bye.

113
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:37,980
En-ception.

114
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,880
Who called you? What's going on?

115
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:46,220
En-ception invited me
to join their team but I refused.

116
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,730
Why? Aren't they
the third-ranked team in the world?

117
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,710
It's a long story.

118
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,090
Tell me. I'm your best listener.

119
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,390
During my third year of university,

120
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,790
I participated in an
iConquer exchange match.

121
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:13,240
I heard the foreign team
mocking the Chinese team.

122
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,280
I am so angry and requested
to have a solo match with them.

123
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,250
Do you want a go at my Invisible Spirit?

124
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,950
Hell Emissary bought Soul Tears
He's seen through Invisible Spirit's way.

125
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:31,620
He didn't get hurt by Invisible Spirit
and even used its ability to heal.

126
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,560
This is an awareness
that many professionals don't have.

127
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,920
Mind your back.

128
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,760
No. Please. In the front of the line.

129
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,330
-No!
-We've won!

130
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,800
Ji Xiang Kong. You are so great.

131
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,220
You've made China proud.

132
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,890
Hello, are you interested
to join a professional team?

133
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,240
Then, you joined a professional team?

134
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,700
I joined a professional team officially
after I graduate.

135
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,540
My favourite Chinese team, Pioneers,
had already disbanded at that time.

136
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,780
China has never won
a world championship again since then.

137
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:21,460
The foreign media mocked Chinese teams
saying we have no tactics.

138
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,620
After I graduated, I joined a club
and started my professional career.

139
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:31,530
That is why you've been rejecting
invitations from foreign teams.

140
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:35,860
If I have the chance
to lift the championship trophy,

141
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,700
it will definitely
belong to a Chinese team.

142
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,910
That is also my purpose of
becoming a professional player.

143
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,710
It's my promise to Gu Fang.

144
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:56,020
I admire someone who has a dream the most.

145
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,560
Ji Xiang Kong. I believe
you will stand on top of the world.

146
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,050
Then, I hope you will
be the one on that day

147
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,790
to stand on the commentary stage
to announce that a Chinese team

148
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:17,760
has won the World Championship.

149
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,700
It's a deal.

150
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,130
It's a deal.

151
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:33,100
[A huge congratulations to Team Legends
for winning the World Championship!]

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,690
What are you doing?

166
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,500
Are you serious? Tell me.
What kind of dream did you have?

167
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,210
You were laughing like a maniac.

168
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,400
I think you are the one
who had a nice dream.

169
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,320
Who uses a face mask in the morning?

170
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,630
I need to use it more as this is the
special formula UNIFON mask you gave me.

171
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,210
I will also be a pretty girl from now on.

172
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,630
How is it? Does my skin look
supple after using it? Jealous?

173
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:59,030
Fine, delicate pretty girl.
I'm so jealous of you.

174
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:05,350
Forget it. Tell me.
When did you come back last night?

175
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,910
11 p.m.?

176
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,370
Are you sure?

177
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,940
12 a.m..

178
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,220
You came back so late.

179
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:20,520
Tell me. What did you do?

180
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,770
I'm going to do a face mask.

181
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,350
No. Come back.

182
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,630
Face mask?

183
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,090
You need to give me an explanation.

184
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:32,820
Don't tell me you were at Dream Traveler
because I couldn't find you there.

185
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,470
Fine. I will tell you the truth.

186
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:41,200
I was with Ji Xiang Kong.

187
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,850
Him again.

188
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,830
I knew it.

189
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,830
He was only teaching me
how to move up the ranks.

190
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,590
Do you know? I'm ranked no.65
in the regional server. Amazing, right?

191
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:59,190
Most importantly, Ji Xiang Kong rejected
the world's 3rd ranked team, En-ception.

192
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,640
Qiu Ying.

193
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,840
Can you control yourself?

194
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:13,450
You are the famous Goddess Ying after all
but you look like his stupid fan now.

195
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,630
I can't stand it.

196
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,240
There's no use talking about it.

197
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,860
I am going to work now.

198
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,660
Just do your face mask.

199
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,120
Captain.

200
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,600
Thanks for your help during this period.

201
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,640
Even if you're gone in the future,

202
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:36,150
I will continue to work hard.

203
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:38,220
Hello, Captain.

204
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:42,160
Sorry, you are the captain
of Team Legends now.

205
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,790
There's a cake.

206
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:46,330
Who bought it?

207
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,950
A farewell party?

208
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:51,030
For our runaway captain?

209
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,000
I bought it.

210
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,580
Today.

211
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,780
Wow, our cool captain bought us a cake.

212
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,630
I am so surprised.

213
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,270
Oh, my hands were trembling.

214
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,150
We will be rivals
when we meet the next time.

215
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,330
Do you need to be so polite?

216
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,250
That's not necessary.

217
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,600
Qi Yue. What are you doing?

218
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,970
Let's be honest.

219
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,520
Pei Xi. Shu Wen and I
did our best to nurture you at VNG.

220
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,560
All the tactics we used
revolve around you as our core.

221
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,020
We nurtured you into the best Mid Laner.

222
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,190
The new season is starting
but you said you want to leave?

223
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,700
Have you considered your teammates?

224
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,620
A selfish guy like him
won't consider our feelings.

225
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,140
We discussed tactics to protect you
the night before so you could get the MVP

226
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,360
and perhaps improving the chance
for VNG to win the championship.

227
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:57,460
In the end,
you went to Team Legends the next day.

228
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,160
Amazing.

229
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,569
Both of us want to become World Champion
but we can't do it with our tactics now.

230
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:11,900
If we continue to play like this,
it will only hinder our career progress.

231
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,730
Do you understand what he's saying?

232
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,810
You were the one
who was talking about our tactics.

233
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,920
When you couldn't do it, you betrayed us
and went to be captain of another team.

234
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,119
Is that it?

235
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,450
Without our sacrifice,
can you be as famous as you are today?

236
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,430
-What happened?
-It's nothing.

237
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,980
Besides, Sister Shu Wen treated you nicely
yet that's how you repay her. Ungrateful.

238
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,260
Enough.

239
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,200
Pei Xi.

240
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,490
I respect your choice.

241
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,970
We also appreciate
everything you've done for VNG.

242
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,070
I hope you have a good future.

243
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,720
Thank you, Coach.

244
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,300
I will remember you forever.

245
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,930
You are my teacher.

246
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,050
Xuan. What are you doing?

247
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,230
Brother.

248
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,630
I understand your feelings right now.

249
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,510
I'm more upset than you.
I want to beat Zhao Yang as well.

250
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,040
But there's no use.

251
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,720
Handsome Ji left and Pei Xi signed on.
No one can change that.

252
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,590
If you keep causing trouble,
Zhao Yang will make things hard for you.

253
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,790
When Handsome Ji left, he said

254
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,790
he wants us to train well

255
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,010
and get a good result.

256
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,160
I can't stand it if you keep doing this.

257
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,610
Captain and Brother Kong left.
I don't want to do anything now.

258
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,280
We still have two years left
on our contract with Legends.

259
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,490
You are only ruining the career
of your brothers if you do this.

260
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,560
Fine. I understand.

261
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,220
-Xuan.
-What?

262
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,730
Zhao Yang brought Pei Xi here.

263
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,910
-Director Jin.
-Pei Xi.

264
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,910
Welcome, Pei Xi.

265
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,280
It's fine. We'll become a family
in the future. Let's keep it casual.

266
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,450
Yes.

267
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,060
Come and tell me if anyone is unwilling
to cooperate with you in the team.

268
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:35,430
Director Jin.

269
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:37,220
Do you know?

270
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,740
When the news of Pei Xi
signing for our team got out,

271
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,720
Two major sponsors from VNG
called me immediately.

272
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,460
They wanted to work together with us
and support us in the next season.

273
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:53,470
Look. When Pei Xi joins our team,
even the sponsors are coming to us.

274
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,620
I think we can look forward
to winning the championship soon.

275
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,860
Did Ji Xiang Kong leave because of me?

276
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,560
His departure has nothing to do with you.

277
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,090
You don't need to worry about this.

278
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:12,060
You haven't had a tour of the company.
Let me show you around...

279
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,810
Who is the cause then?

280
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
That's...

281
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,990
-Coach Luo, what is he doing?
-What are you doing?

282
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,610
Are you causing trouble for me again?

283
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,260
Lin Yi Xuan.

284
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,340
Are you crazy?

285
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,830
Why are you here
with the fitness equipment?

286
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:39,680
-I'm greeting our new captain.
-We are all brothers in the future.

287
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,230
We need to prepare for the next season.
All right?

288
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:53,010
Coach Luo. With Pei Xi's in the team,
let's work together and create glory

289
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,520
so we can go on top of the world, right?

290
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:01,240
Kid, just you wait.

291
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,940
He's young.

292
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,690
He is too young.

293
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,390
You're not close yet.
It would be fine once you are close.

294
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,620
Right, Coach Luo?

295
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,540
Pei Xi.

296
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,360
Pei Xi.

297
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,700
What's wrong?

298
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,440
He's a genius. That's what they do.
They have a unique approach.

299
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,100
That's too much!

300
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,000
Coach Luo. Shame on you.

301
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,120
Those were your students?
Get a leash on them!

302
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,020
I am going to find Pei Xi.

303
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,200
This is my tactical analysis
for Team Newland.

304
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,400
20 out of last season's 26 wins depended
on conventional time-wasting tactics.

305
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,990
If we could make
some breakthrough in our strategy

306
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,110
I believe Team Newland has a chance of
playing in Vancouver for the new season.

307
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,640
Xiang Kong.
We are not discussing tactics today.

308
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,430
Have a look at the contract first.

309
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,070
Let's get it done if there are no issues.

310
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,290
Gu Fang called me.

311
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,850
Team Newland has been
paying attention to your matches.

312
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,470
However, different teams
have different tactics.

313
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,420
You want the team to use your tactics
when you've just joined.

314
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,150
Do you think that's suitable?

315
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:54,180
If you perform well
after a couple of seasons,

316
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,280
the board of directors will consider
getting you to be in command.

317
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,400
Director Chen, I don't mind my role.

318
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,750
I just hope I can show my edge.

319
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,440
If my tactics are worthless to your team,

320
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,690
it would be meaningless
for me to join the team.

321
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,950
Xiang Kong.

322
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,330
As your friend and a senior,

323
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,780
I will give you a piece of advice.

324
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,790
Don't be too idealistic.

325
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,220
But I'm willing to gamble on my ideals.

326
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,890
Thanks for your coffee.
I'll be leaving.

327
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,840
-That's all the dishes.
-They look so delicious, Brother Sun.

328
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,050
Did you already guess that
I wouldn't sign for Team Newland?

329
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,370
That team is too small for you.

330
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,950
Brother Sun, stop praising me.
I will feel embarrassed.

331
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:05,630
Are you sure? I've never seen you
embarrassed for leeching at my place.

332
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,310
Starting tomorrow, I can work for you.

333
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,980
I can't afford a World Champion.

334
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:17,820
But I've thought about it seriously.

335
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:22,930
If Team Newland doesn't need your tactics,
there's a team that suits you a lot.

336
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,520
Which team?

337
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,640
VNG.

338
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,530
Sister Wen's team?

339
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,680
Brother Sun. This is the first time
you mentioned Sister Wen on your own.

340
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,030
You are still being
so carefree about this?

341
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,400
Keep talking.

342
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,600
What do you think about Shu Wen?

343
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,710
Sister Wen is definitely
the female role model.

344
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,350
Besides you and Captain, I respect her
the most in the e-sports industry.

345
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,560
In the current e-sports industry,

346
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:03,160
she is the only person that is
as adventurous as Gu Fang.

347
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,090
You are right.

348
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,610
The only top team that
I have yet to contact is Team VNG.

349
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,060
Their sponsors are
basically going after Pei Xi.

350
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,290
After Pei Xi left,
they are also having a hard time

351
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,470
I'm afraid I'll get her into trouble.

352
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,080
Is that what you should be worried about?

353
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,060
Let's talk about Pei Xi.

354
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,910
Maybe he is better than you as a player.
But you know people better than he does.

355
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,640
Isn't iConquer a game about
interpreting people's minds after all?

356
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:38,490
If you go to Team VNG,
they will be able to improve.

357
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,750
If Sister Wen needs me,
she would've already contacted me.

358
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,430
Forget it.

359
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,530
If you are afraid, you can always return
and become an internet cafe manager.

360
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,270
If you want to challenge yourself,

361
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,510
call Shu Wen.

362
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,870
Tell her that you can give her
a brand new Team VNG.

363
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,990
-Enjoy your food.
-Thanks.

364
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,780
Director Yuan called me yesterday.

365
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,970
I know.

366
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,930
He went to Team Legends with Pei Xi.

367
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,110
Sponsors are so materialistic nowadays.

368
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,310
They only follow
the people with commercial value.

369
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,630
Your stomach is hurting again?

370
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,640
You had a drink
with Director Yuan yesterday, right?

371
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,770
I am fine.

372
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,010
If our team performs well,

373
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,180
the sponsors who left will return.

374
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,300
Don't worry. I'm still working hard.

375
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,500
We are having a hard time in this period.

376
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,160
You've worked hard.

377
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,770
Oh.

378
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,870
There's a talented kid in the junior camp.

379
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,630
I think we can nurture him.

380
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,540
He might become the next Pei Xi.

381
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,780
But I don't want the next Pei Xi.

382
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,750
Ever since Pei Xi came to VNG,
we've never changed our tactics.

383
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,040
So I was thinking that

384
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,510
Pei Xi leaving the team
might be a blessing in disguise.

385
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:59,320
-But we do well with this tactic.
-That is why VNG crumbled after he left.

386
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:03,780
-This is not my ideal team.
-There's a gap between ideals and reality.

387
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,050
I have a simple plan.

388
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,290
Pick a kid from the junior camp
to replace Pei Xi's position.

389
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,160
Next, get Qi Yue to become the captain.

390
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,520
Li Gan. Qi Yue is good

391
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,420
but he doesn't have
the right personality to be captain.

392
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,410
But we don't have a better choice now.

393
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,030
Let me think about it.

394
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,260
Sister Wen, are you free tomorrow?
I want to have a chat with you.

395
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,800
Why are we practising this?
It's all the same.

396
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,100
I'm stopping.

397
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,210
Yi Xuan.

398
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,630
-Stop talking.
-Was I wrong?

399
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,340
Lin Yi Xuan.

400
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,670
Training matches will start soon.

401
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,370
Why don't you take a break?

402
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,420
Pei Xi.

403
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,210
Director Jin.

404
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:21,110
Pei Xi. You are my lucky player.

405
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:25,130
Director Yuan who used to
sponsor Team VNG previously

406
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,740
is coming to sponsor us because of you.

407
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,120
I didn't ask him to sponsor us.

408
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,040
It doesn't matter.
We got the sponsorship anyway.

409
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,450
Three days later,
we will improve all our equipment.

410
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,650
It's all thanks to your new captain.
All of you should thank him.

411
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,740
Thank you, Director Jin.
Thank you, Captain.

412
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,000
Okay. I will leave you all alone.

413
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,200
Training matches are starting soon.

414
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:54,940
You should cooperate well
with your new captain.

415
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,380
Do your best.

416
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,440
Got it. We will.

417
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,570
-Okay. I'm leaving.
-Bye, Director Jin.

418
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,040
Our Brother Kong

419
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,650
never cared about sponsors in the past.

420
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,040
We have to beg everywhere
in order to change our equipment.

421
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,850
But our new captain
doesn't care about tactics.

422
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,780
He is only thinking of ways
to get new sponsors.

423
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:26,150
Amazing.

424
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:32,700
I already said
I didn't ask Director Yuan to sponsor us.

425
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,180
Don't think that you can
win us over with little things like that.

426
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,450
No one wants to win you over.

427
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,640
You may leave if you wish.

428
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,300
There are

429
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:50,830
many support players out there.

430
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,300
Are you looking down on support players?

431
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,040
Lin Yi Xuan.

432
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,500
Calm down.
The match starts in five minutes.

433
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,860
Aren't you great?

434
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,830
I'm not playing.

435
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,230
I'll see how you play.

436
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,410
-Lin Yi Xuan.
-Lin Yi Xuan! Where are you going?

437
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,740
-Don't stop him.
-Captain.

438
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,220
How can we play without a Support
on a "four versus five" game?

439
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,240
We can win even if it's
a "four versus five" game.

440
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,800
Gather around.

441
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,630
Gather around.

442
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,920
Come here.

443
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,350
What is it, Director?

444
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,770
All of you are here?

445
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:38,180
Director Li from Team VNG
called me this morning.

446
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,950
He wanted us to interview
Qi Yue from their team.

447
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,550
I couldn't refuse him.

448
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,560
Who is willing to do this interview?

449
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,700
Me.

450
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,710
-Anyone else?
-Yi Yi is willing to do the interview.

451
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:59,090
Fine, Yi Yi. You can do it.

452
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,890
-I...
-Go.

453
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,460
Thank you.

454
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,910
Leave. I haven't finished my tea yet.

455
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,140
-Li Nan. Go.
-There's a ward across.

456
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,810
I'm impressed.

457
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,870
We can win with only four people.

458
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,880
How strong is his mental
for him to overcome so much abuse?

459
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,880
What can I do for him?

460
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,230
Actually, there are
people who support him too.

461
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,739
I will take screenshots of them.

462
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,330
I'm back.

463
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,260
I am so tired.

464
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,040
What are you doing?

465
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,790
-Nothing.
-What were you doing sneakily?

466
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,810
I am busy.

467
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,820
Why are you so tired?

468
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,330
Isn't it relaxing to work
at your zen magazine company?

469
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,429
They are zen but I'm in trouble.

470
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,870
Let me give you a massage.

471
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,400
Over here.

472
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,190
Not so hard.

473
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,490
Tell me what's bothering you
to entertain me.

474
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,110
Are you even my best friend?

475
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,310
I am going to VNG
to Interview Qi Yue tomorrow.

476
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:22,370
-Isn't that great?
-But I only know so little about him.

477
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,130
I did last minute research on him
for the whole day.

478
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,380
I am so angry about this.

479
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:36,320
They asked us to interview them
but they've rescheduled it three times.

480
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:42,220
I'm looking forward
to seeing how great is this Qi Yue.

481
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:47,310
-Not so hard, it hurts!
-Sorry.

482
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,520
Anyway, Qi Yue is the captain and
the most senior player in Team VNG.

483
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,940
He is also the boss's apprentice.

484
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,030
Isn't it normal to act like that?

485
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,520
-He is Shu Wen's apprentice?
-Li Gan's apprentice.

486
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,360
You know a lot about him.

487
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,730
Since you know so much,
why don't you come with me tomorrow?

488
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,400
I will let you be my camera assistant.

489
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,640
I will broaden your horizon tomorrow.

490
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,190
I will show you
what a professional team looks like.

491
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:26,830
It's also beneficial to you
for participating in Tomorrow's Star.

492
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,610
What do you think? I'm nice to you, right?

493
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,400
-You are very nice to me.
-I think so too.

494
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,480
I think you are just afraid to go alone.

495
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,030
-Why would I be afraid?
-That's exactly the case.

496
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,500
You haven't told me
what you were doing sneakily just now.

497
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:48,550
Fine. I'll go with you.
I will be your assistant.

498
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:51,470
Happy? I'm busy. Leave me alone.

499
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,130
You...

500
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,910
I'm sure you're hiding something.
