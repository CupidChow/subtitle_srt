00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,200
Brother Kong,

5
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
I'm really not used to the time
when you are not in the team.

6
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:56,890
Yes.

7
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,700
If I don't scold you for three days,
you'll feel sick all over, right?

8
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,280
Makes sense.

9
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,030
Right, Brother Kong.

10
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,169
I think it's a good choice
for you to join a team abroad.

11
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,430
Coach Luo said

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,300
that's the third-ranked team in the world.

13
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,030
They are willing to pay so much
money to invite you. They are so sincere.

14
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,880
Enough. I have my own plan.

15
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,900
Just focus on your game
and don't worry about me.

16
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,140
Oh.

17
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,050
You know what I want to say
by calling you out here, right?

18
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,700
You don't have to praise me.

19
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,720
I know working hard is what I ought to do.

20

You...

21
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,900
Don't listen to Coach Luo.
He was making a big deal out of it.

22
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,500
Brother Kong.

23
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,430
You've transferred to another team now.

24
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,050
Can you…

25
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,490
Stop!

26
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,930

Gosh!

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,370
What I meant is,

32
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,970
now that you've joined another team,

33
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,900
you better hide from me

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,880
if we meet each other in the competition.

35
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,780
Me hiding from you?

36
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,150
Look.

37
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,050
All my tricks were taught by you.

38

If I meet you,

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,470
I will lose badly.

40
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,530
-What a coward.
-No. Brother Kong.

41
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,850
About transferring,

42
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,650
I've already thought it through.
You don't need to persuade me.

Really?
Tell me.

Look. My contract with
Legends has not ended yet. Right?

45
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,320
If I leave now, I have to compensate them.

Where do I get so much money?

47

First, tell me your opinion about VNG.

119
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,120
Pei Xi is the cause
of both success and failure.

Continue.

121
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,650
I believe you've already noticed
that Pei Xi's departure

122
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,880
gave a huge impact on VNG
who uses four players to protect him.

123
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,280
A team that always relies
its success and failure on one person,

124
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,630
is that really the team you want?

Ji Xiang Kong.

126
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,470
You are the first person
who dares to say this to me.

127
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,810
That is why I am not a likable person.

You should know that

132
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,040
VNG don't lack great players.

133
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,520
They lack tactics.

134

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,620
I can give you a brand new VNG.

137
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,590
I have one more question.

138
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,720
You know our situation very well.

139
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,550
Why did you still come?

140
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,050
Because Brother Sun told me that

141
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,220
you still have
a desire for the championship.

Why is Sister Wen talking with
Ji Xiang Kong for such a long time?

149
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,600
Will she really let
Ji Xiang Kong join our team?

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,830
I don't know.

151
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,030
But I think the coach has her own idea.

152
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,330
It's useless to ask you.

153

-There is definitely something wrong.
-Let's go.

169
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:51,700
Why is Ji Xiang Kong here?

170
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,700
Don't tell me…

171
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,850
He is joining VNG?

172
00:11:58,990 --> 00:11:59,590
Qiu Ying.

173
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:02,700
My intuition as a reporter tells me
that there must be something behind this.

174
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,210
-Come on. Let's go have a look.
-Why are you such a busybody?

175
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:08,420
They might kick you out
if you go in rashly without evidence.

176
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,580
Are you stupid?

177
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,670
What is he doing here then?

178
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,200
Actually, VNG is not bad.

179
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,030
After all, they are
one of the top four teams.

180
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,270
Last year,
they even got second place in the league.

181
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,650
Just behind Legends.

182
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,520
But I'm sure you've seen
the attitude of Qi Yue just now.

183
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,200
Although VNG is nice,

184
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,850
it might not suit Ji Xiang Kong.

185
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,320
Why is that related to you?

186
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,650
Tell me. Why do you
care so much about him?

187
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:49,050
-I'm not. Nonsense.
-Are you going to tell me the truth?

188
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,380
-You...
-A UFO?

189
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,870
Where?

190
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,720
Where is it? Qiu…

191
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,640
Qiu Ying! Stop right there! Make it clear!

192
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,830
Master. Sister Wen.

193
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,850
Can you make a decision
about the captaincy today?

194
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,350
Qi Yue.

195
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,700
Give me some more time.
We need to go through some procedures.

196
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,770
Sorry for the inconvenience.

197
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,380
Master.

198
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,370
When I was in Taiwan, I've always
wanted to join a professional team.

199
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,800
It was you who discovered me

200
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,250
and invited me to
develop in China's mainland.

201
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,880
Rest assured.

202
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,220
Although Pei Xi left,

203
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,270
I'm still confident in leading my brothers
to become next season's champion with VNG.

204
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,250
Qi Yue.

205
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:34,950
Return to the training room first.
The training game is about to start.

206
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,900
Sister Wen.

207
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,500
Master.

208
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,080
You need to have confidence in me.

209
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,750
Besides me, there's no better choice.

210
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,820
I will go to training first.

211
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,820
I've decided to sign Ji Xiang Kong.

212
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,700
I've already guessed your decision.

213
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,340
You can sign whoever you want,

214
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,090
but I don't recommend
signing Ji Xiang Kong.

215
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,800
You know our team's
previous problem very well.

216
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,310
Even though we have
a capable player like Pei Xi,

217
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,270
we still can't go far without tactics.

218
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,220
Besides, you should know full well
the tactical ability of Ji Xiang Kong.

219
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,950
This is not about capability.

220
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,020
The problem lies with him.

221
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,680
He has too much negative news.
This is very hard for me.

222
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,230
If you sign him,
what will our sponsors think?

223
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,820
But according to our current situation,

224
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,830
a good captain is
more important than the sponsors.

225
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,000
-Do you admit that?
-Yes.

226
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
But…

227
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,230
Shu Wen.

228
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,330
If there's another sponsor
who withdraws their investment,

229
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,160
VNG's operation will have a problem.

230
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,970
Isn't dealing with sponsors
what you are good at?

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,120
Li Gan.

232
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,500
When we established VNG, we said that

233
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,350
we will develop a team that
can win the World Championships.

234
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,880
Even if I have to put
all my money at stake,

235
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:17,200
I am not afraid.

236
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,920
All right.

237
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll take a look at
their training game first.

238
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,800
-Cheers.
-Cheers. Come on.

239
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,940
Brother Sun.

240
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,650
I didn't expect the talk with Sister Wen
to go so smoothly.

241
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,350
She is a person with visionary ideas.

242
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,800
Also, she will push on without hesitating
about an idea she has decided.

243
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,070
You have great room
for development at VNG.

244
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,250
Thanks, Brother Sun. Another toast to you.

245
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,060
Come.

246
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,020
Thanks for your care during this time.

247
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,020
Also, if it wasn't for your encouragement,

248
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,170
I wouldn't have the courage
to find Sister Wen.

249
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,100
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

250
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,320
My roommate is leaving
after moving in for only a few days.

251
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,600
I would be left alone.

252
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,070
Brother Sun.

253
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:18,700
You've been single all this time.

254
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,430
Are you still waiting for Sister Wen?

255
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,700
You brat.
What nonsense are you talking about?

256
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,030
Li Gan?

257
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,720
President Li.

258
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,150
Brother Yi.

259
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,300
After so many years,

260
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,850
you still haven't changed a bit.

261
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,400
Neither have you. Sit down.

262
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,240
Xiang Kong.

263
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,350
I am here today

264
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:52,580
as a representative of VNG.

265
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,080
I'll go grab
another bowl and chopsticks for you.

266
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,800
Both of you, talk first.

267
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,150
First of all,

268
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,500
I apologize to you on behalf of the team.

269
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,250
We can't sign the contract with you.

270
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,490
Besides that, my personal thought

271
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:11,520
is for you to tell Shu Wen
that you can't sign.

272
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,599
Wait.

273
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,150
President Li.

274
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,470
I don't understand what you mean.

275
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,500
It has been three years
since the establishment of VNG.

276
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,780
Shu Wen went through
all sorts of difficulties to achieve this.

277
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:29,800
But right now, we are at
another life-and-death moment.

278
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,980
Pei Xi's departure
took away three of our largest sponsors.

279
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,770
Another two are still hesitating.

280
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,150
After your talk with Shu Wen today
they got the message and called me

281
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,430
saying that
if Shu Wen insists on signing you,

282
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,400
they will withdraw their investment.

283
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,080
Xiang Kong.

284
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,440
Shu Wen appreciates you from her heart.

285
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,900
She even made the decision
to put everything at risk to protect you.

286
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,380
You can't sit by and
see years of her effort go to waste.

287
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,400
If you still consider the loyalty
to your friends and seniors,

288
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,530
you should tell her

289
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,520
that you can't sign with her yourself.

290
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,550
President Li. That's enough.

291
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,700
I understand.

292
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,490
I am the one

293
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,770
who caused you trouble.

294
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:22,970
Thank you for your understanding.

295
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,600
I am leaving first.

296
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:30,870
You're leaving?

297
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,220
Brother Yi.

298
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:33,770
You owe me a drink.

299
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,450
We'll drink the next time we meet.

300
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,600
Right on time.

301
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:54,950
Ji Xiang Kong's contract.

302
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,270
Take a look.

303
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,170
Since you've made the decision,

304
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,000
I will respect it.

305
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,200
I want to hold a signing ceremony.

306
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,830
Schedule the time as soon as possible.

307
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,480
At that time, I want you to
help me contact a few media companies.

308
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,000
-Let me…
-[Sister Wen.]

309
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,890
[I am not the one suitable for VNG.
I can't sign with you.]

310
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,770
What happened?

311
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,870
[Sorry.]

312
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,800
Ji Xiang Kong changed his mind suddenly.

313
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,280
[Hello,]

314
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
[the phone you are dialling
is switched off.]

315
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,500
Switched off?
What does he mean by that?

316
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,800
Shu Wen. Calm down.

317
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:34,780
Ji Xiang Kong might've
learnt about our situation right now.

318
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,730
We can't compare to Legends in terms of
material or financial resources.

319
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:40,010
He is a smart guy.
If he has decided not to come,

320
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,350
shouldn't we understand him?

321
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,520
No.

322
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,550
He is not that kind of person.

323
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,120
No way.

324
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:50,520
I have to find him.

325
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,350
I will try everything to persuade him.

326
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:53,700
Shu Wen.

327
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,550
Don't go.

328
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:56,990
He is not coming.

329
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,530
How do you know?

330
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,520
You went to look for him.

331
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,300
Shu Wen!

332
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,770
Are you here to look for

333
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,180
Xiang Kong?

334
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,920
Where is Xiang Kong?

335
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,630
He is upstairs.

336
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,800
Let me bring you there.

337
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,630
Sister Wen?

338
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:14,390
This is the contract.

339
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,080
Will you sign or not?

340
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,680
Sister Wen.

341
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,450
If I am the person
who puts VNG in a worse situation,

342
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:38,550
I...

343
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,530
I won't be signing.

344
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,520
Are you making it worse
if sponsors withdraw their investment?

345
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:44,610
In my opinion,

346
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,250
if we can't win the World Championships,

347
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,150
VNG's existence is meaningless

348
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,280
no matter how many sponsors we have.

349
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,870
Sister Wen.

350
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,430
-I understand your feeling. But…
-You don't understand.

351
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,380
It has already been five years
since Pioneers became World Champion.

352
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,600
In the hearts of veterans like us,

353
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:14,750
we have waited too long

354
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,200
for this title.

355
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,500
-But, Sister Wen…
-Xiang Kong, don't worry.

356
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,530
Even if all the sponsors leave,

357
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,320
I will try everything I can
to make VNG survive next season.

358
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,050
Ji Xiang Kong.

359
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,520
I need you.

360
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,900
You promised me.

361
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,970
You said you'll give me a brand new VNG.

362
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,490
Sister Wen.

363
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,830
I am not satisfied
with this annual salary.

364
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,500
Write whatever amount you want.

365
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,770
I am more satisfied with this.

366
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,630
One Yuan?

367
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,970
From today onwards,

368
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,970
I will fight side by side with VNG.

369
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,480
Hide.

370
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,030
Nice!

371
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,950
Nice. Awesome.

372
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,340
Qiu Ying, that was an amazing play.

373
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,300
Nice. I can't believe that
Brother Monkey lost to you.

374
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,350
Amazing.

375
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,430
Skinny Monkey, I am sorry.

376
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,380
She intimidated all of you
with her petty tricks?

377
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,550
Do you dare compete with me
for one more round?

378
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,600
A solo match.

379
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:35,920
Okay. Let's do it.

380
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,180
If you are fighting for
the top spot in the regional server,

381
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,500
why don't we make it an open competition?

382
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:44,930
Yes.

383
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:45,930
That's great.

384
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,800
After all, this is a challenge
for the top spot in the regional server.

385
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
It's so hyped.

386
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,720
Yes!

387
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:55,520
What? Are you afraid?

388
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,920
Why should I be afraid?

389
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,200
If I lose, so be it. I am not embarrassed.

390
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,800
Great!

391
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,930
I'm betting on Qiu Ying.

392
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,970
No.

393
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,150
I still think Ya Tou will win.

394
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,900
That's impossible.

395
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,780
How about this? I'll bet with you.

396
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,100
If Ya Tou loses,

397
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,020
I'll buy you a month's worth of ZiHaiGuo.

398
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,380
Any flavour I want?

399
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,580
Any flavour. That's a deal.

400
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,450
Qiu Ying.

401
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,200
Do your best.
All my meals for this month are on you.

402
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:38,570
Don't worry.

403
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,350
Brother Summer.

404
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,350
Why is no one here
at Dream Traveler today?

405
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,540
I don't know.

406
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,470
Let's take a look.

407
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,750
An open game?

408
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,820
Brave.

409
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,750
[First blood.]

410
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,250
What's happening?

411
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,950
The top of the regional server challenged
Qiu Ying. They are fighting each other.

412
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,720
Your little girlfriend is awesome! She is
fighting the top player in a solo match.

413
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,220
No.

414
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,700
We are just normal friends.

415
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,800
Normal friends. Sure. I understand.

416
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,220
Teaching your normal friend in person.

417
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,220
She wants to be a commentator.

418
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,700
That's why she came here to learn.

419
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,230
This girl is pretty nice.

420
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:06,080
She could rely on her beauty
but she is depending on her talents.

421
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,200
If there's something like that,
just tell me in the future.

422
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,070
Spare the effort.

423
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:14,150
I am just afraid
to break the rules of Dream Traveler.

424
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,040
Relax.

425
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,350
Even if she loses,

426
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,930
I will give her an opportunity.

427
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,050
Don't worry.

428
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,820
She will definitely win.

429
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,870
You have little health!
Go back to base! Don't wander around!

430
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,120
Push for the nexus.

431
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,130
Qiu Ying. Don't go back.
Push for the nexus.

432
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,890
Why are you spacing out?
Push for the nexus!

433
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,000
[Victory.]

Xiang Kong.

435
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,800
I finally become
the regional server's top player.

436
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,370
-Congratulation.
-Thanks!

437
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,250
Pei Xi.

438
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,990
Am I qualified to work here now?

439
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,560
You are fighting to become
the regional server's top player

440
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,600
just to be a waitress here?

441
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,570
Right.

442
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,730
That's not the only reason.

443
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,730
What do you want then?

444
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,230
I want to become a commentator.

445
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,250
I have so many experts like you
to teach me in-depth knowledge

446
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,350
while working at Dream Traveler.

447
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,770
While I was playing
in the regional server,

448
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:43,280
I also have
a deeper understanding of iConquer.

449
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,050
It's not easy to become a commentator.

450
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,150
Everything starts from scratch.

451
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,710
I will take my steps up.

452
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:53,420
Exactly. She has a wonderful idea.

453
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:55,310
Why are you discouraging her?

454
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,390
That's right. Let me introduce you.

455
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,750
The owner of Dream Traveler,
Brother Summer.

456
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,380
I know. You are
one of the five Ancient Masters.

457
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,200
The best support of Pioneers.

458
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,270
Your ID name is Summer.

459
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:13,000
After you retire,
everyone calls you brother Summer.

460
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,630
Your compliments are making me shy.

461
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,680
-You are well-prepared.
-Definitely.

462
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,480
Hello, Boss!

463
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,980
Calling him boss so soon?

464
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:25,850
-He didn't say if he wants you yet.
-I didn't say I am not hiring her.

465
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:26,730
Exactly.

466
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,720
Congratulations on
joining Dream Traveler.

467
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,680
Thanks, Boss!

468
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,690
Can I apply for my entry now?

469

Sure. Follow me right now.
You two, stay here for a talk. Let's go!

00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,080
What?

472
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,280
Do you like Qiu Ying a lot?

473
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,720
What does that have to do with you?

474
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,970
You better stay away from her.

475
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,800
Do you like her?

476
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,480
I heard you've joined VNG?

477
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,690
What a coincidence.

478
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,970
After all the hassle,

479
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,700
my old team becomes your new team.

480
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,840
But your old team becomes my new team.

481
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,930
It seems like
we are destined to be rivals.

482
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,100
That's quite good.

483
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,700
I am not as kind as you.

485
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,530
I finally become
an official worker at Dream Traveler.

00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,350
Good for you.

487
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,400
You found a job.

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,070
You have to buy me dinner then.

489
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,410
Of course.

490
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,330
What about

491
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,800
Dream Traveler's strawberry cake?
How's that?

492
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,220
Wait. What?

493
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,670
Two pieces of strawberry cake.

than Lin Yi Xuan?

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:06,820
Forget it.

498
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,240
I found a job too. Dinner's on me.

499
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,100
Yes!

500
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,470
Thanks.

501
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,750
That was so unexpected.

502
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,680
You reached the top of the regional server
after such a short time at Dream Traveler.

503
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,820
Rising Star is coming soon.

504
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:31,020
I have to work hard.

505
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,670
Brother Summer often invites
many professionals in the area

506
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,050
including Teacher Luo Tian,
to do commentary on games.

507
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,200
If I stay at Dream Traveler

508
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,330
I can stay there and listen
with a valid reason.

509
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:42,180
Oh.

510
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,200
What's your new job?

511
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,870
I signed for VNG.

512
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,880
Really?

513
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,400
VNG. That's one of the top four teams.

514
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,130
We must have a drink to celebrate.

515
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,770
-Waiter!
-Are you sure?

516
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,520
Did you forget about
your drinking capacity last time? You...

517
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:02,660
Waiter. Two beers!

518
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,340
Cheers!

519
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,280
-Handsome Ji. Your hot towel.
-Thanks!

520
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,980
Why do you need a hot towel?

521
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,350
Aren't your hands hurting?

522
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:19,100
Here.

523
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,430
Your gaming intensity
is catching up to our training.

524
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,320
Don't train for more than three hours
in the future.

525
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:29,080
You need to take care of yourself.

526
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,420
Another hand.

527
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,850
How do you feel? Any better?

528
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,530
Much better.

529
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,380
I still have some ointment at my place.
I will bring them to you next time.

530
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:43,720
Thanks.

531
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,980
Why are you being polite? We are brothers.

532
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,530
After going to VNG,

533
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,380
I made a pledge to win the championship.

534
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,620
The same goes for you.

535
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,750
After going to Rising Star,

536
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:57,170
you have to win.

537
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,250
Don't forget the promise between us.

538
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,880
We have to go to
the final of iConquer together.

539
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,890
-Let's do our best.
-Do our best.

540
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:21,100
It's already 9 p.m..
Why isn't she back yet?

541
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,110
Yi Yi. I'm back.

542
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,449
Where are you?

543
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,020
Why are you here?

544
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,600
-Come here.
-Stand up. Look who's talking!

545
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,420
What's wrong?

546
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,170
You made so many dishes.

547
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,699
Impressive!

548
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:47,100
To celebrate you becoming
the regional server's top player,

549
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,449
I prepared this since 3 p.m..

550
00:34:49,770 --> 00:34:50,679
Look what time it is right now.

551
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,130
You just came back now?

552
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,199
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

553
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,180
I have to tell you in advance?

554
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,930
When did we not celebrate together
on such a huge occasion?

555
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,670
All right. Calm down.

556
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:06,800
-Don't touch me.
-I am sorry. Isn't that enough?

557
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,750
My little angel.

558
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,730
Did you go out
for a date with Ji Xiang Kong again?

559
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,680
Today is special.

560
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,450
I just joined Dream Traveler
and he just joined VNG.

561
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,080
It's a double blessing
so we celebrated for a little bit.

562
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,580
Ditching your friend for dates.

563
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm ignoring you
and giving you the silent treatment.

564
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,150
Master Lu.

565
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,500
Master Lu.

566
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,970
Just ignore me for ten minutes.

567
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,420
Come down after ten minutes, okay?

568
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,930
I am telling you. I'm serious this time!

569
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,980
Fine. You are serious. 15 minutes.

570
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,650
I will reheat the meal.
You haven't eaten anything yet, right?

571
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,320
I'll eat another meal with you.

572
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:47,720
It's decided.

573
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,900
Let's reheat the meal.

574
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,000
-Ending your silent treatment?
-Not yet!

575
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,100
Come here quickly.

576
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,130
What's wrong?

577
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:18,650
Take a look.

578
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,500
[Ji Xiang Kong became VNG's captain
thanks to riding on Shu Wen's coattails!!]

579
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,180
Do you remember
that time when we went to VNG?

580
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,360
They are being really intimate, right?

581
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,090
I felt something wrong and
wanted to go back and take a look

582
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,050
yet you stopped me
and didn't let me go back.

583
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,590
If they got together,

584
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,800
they can help each other at work.

585
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,620
It's quite nice too.

586
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,200
Stop pretending in front of me.

587
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,460
What about you then?

588
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,820
Are you telling me that you are still
thinking of him as a normal friend?

589
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,700
Why are you staring at me?

590
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,720
Do you also want to know

591
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,830
the relationship between him and Shu Wen?

592
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,350
No matter what relationship they have,

593
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,500
it is still none of your business.

594
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,250
Why couldn't you sleep?

595
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,780
But I just want to know.

596
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,600
Seeing him dating someone else

597
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,140
makes me feel uncomfortable.

598
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,070
What can you do
even if you know the truth?

599
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:22,830
Ji Xiang Kong
still sees you as his brother.

600
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:32,430
I'm punishing you.

601
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,350
Good night, Jiang Jiang.

602
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,180
Brother Qi, don't be angry.

603
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,270
Tong Wu.

604
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,650
I am sorry, Brother Qi.

605
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:02,770
Sorry about that.

606
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:05,880
-Are you stupid? Can you be more stupid?
-Sorry.

607
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,790
-I am sorry, Brother Qi.
-What are you doing?

608
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,070
Brother Qi.

609
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,950
Do you think something's really going on
between Sister Wen and Ji Xiang Kong?

610
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,700
She offended two big sponsors
for Ji Xiang Kong.

611
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,720
What are you talking about?

612
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,170
You are following them
with their nonsense talk out there.

613
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:31,450
My master will not be cuckolded.

614
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:33,620
I'm telling you.
As long as I'm still here,

615
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,700
I will make sure Ji Xiang Kong suffers.

616
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,800
From now on,

617
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,500
we have to stand side by side.

618
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,950
I'll see what he can do.

619
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,730
Lu Sheng, I am talking.
Are you listening?

620
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,300
I am.

621
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,050
If the four of us
won't cooperate with him,

622
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,000
I'll see how he does as captain.

623
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,630
Definitely.

624
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,670
We will do whatever Brother Qi says.

625
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,790
Tong Wu.

626
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:58,300
I will listen to brother Qi.

627
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:05,020
Whatever.

628
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,630
Up to you. I am good anyway.
