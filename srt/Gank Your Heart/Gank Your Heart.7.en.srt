But he received a call on the way here
and went back to work.

29

He's always been like this.

30
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,440

Don't be, we're brothers.

34
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,070
It's fine.

35
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,280
We know you don't like this kind of thing.

36

We won't force you.

37

You've come all this way

38
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,980
Kind of what?

39
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,050
I feel kind of embarrassed.

40
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,470
I said I'd treat you guys to
a decent meal but I failed to do so.

Boss, your computer can't work properly.

Why don't you just go home? Okay?

45
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,400
Today's not a great day for gaming.

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,420
Back when we were training together,
we treated each other as rivals.

47
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,900
We pushed ourselves and
practiced hard every day

48
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,470
as we were afraid that we couldn't
keep up the hand speed.

49
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,829
We never knew when to stop.

50
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,720
That's why you're the ace.

51
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,680
That's not the takeaway here.

52
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:49,850
Alright.

53
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:51,579
Do you know about this? Back then...

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,530
Do you remember this?

55
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,880
All he ate were steamed buns
and plain water.

56
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,200
I thought he was a monk.

57
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,130
He didn't do anything else.
He didn't even have a girlfriend.

58
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,010
I wasn't as sociable as you
or as handsome as him.

59
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,080
How was I supposed to get a girl?

60
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,960
Come on, you can't fool me.

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,260
One of the prettiest women in
our industry, Shu Wen, was his girlfriend.

62
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,250
You're drunk. Stop that nonsense.

63
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,070
It's okay. It's all in the past now.

64

Let's drink up. That's all behind us now.

65
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,250
If that's the case,
why did you cut her out?

66
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:21,870
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,550
We're all doing fine now, aren't we?

68
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,870
Alright, let's drink up.
We're here to catch up on lost time.

69
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,900
Cheers to the good old days.

70
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,700
You're here.

71
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,930
When is your flight tomorrow?
I'll send you off.

72
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,540
It's okay, I can go by myself.

73
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,990
Right, Manager Zhao told me
you refused to appear on the reality show.

74
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:03,480
I don't want to
waste my time on those things.

75
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,700
You know why Sun left the industry, right?

76
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,020
I know, he has his reasons.

77
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,560
Actually, back in those years, he was
the most enthusiastic one on our team.

78
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,550
He was also the most talented among us.

79
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,840
At that time, esports wasn't
looked upon favorably by the public.

80
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,110
So he had to bow to reality
when his parents fell sick.

81
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,120
I don't understand, Captain.

82
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,790
Are you telling me to
confront or accept reality?

83
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,620
Business is a double-edged sword.

84
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,040
We must learn to be flexible
in order to survive in this industry.

85
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:56,780
All right, I'll try my best to cooperate
as long as it doesn't affect the training.

86
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,080
Good.

87
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,270
I'll take this with me.

88
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,870
Nice photo.

89
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,960
These are the five latest
champions released by iConquer.

90
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,270
Zhi Heng, Jin Can, Yu Bang,

91
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,120
Gongxi Chang Qing and Xin.
The info's all here.

92
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,670
Our top priority is
to obtain these champions

93
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,440
so that we can catch
our opponents off guard.

94
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,250
You want to beat them
with the new champions?

95
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,730
Have you thought this through?

96
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,940
We just started training
with these champions.

97
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,080
It'd be quite difficult to
master them in a short period.

98
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,500
You're right. But our opponents
are facing the same problem as well.

99
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,450
They are still trying to
figure out the champions.

100
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:49,090
If we can keep one step ahead of them,
we'll be able to make a surprise attack.

101
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,080
On the contrary, if they get familiar
with the champions,

102
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:53,980
we'll lose the initiative as well.

103
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,409
Brother Kong has a point.

104
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,480
Handsome Ji, you're our captain.

105
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,450
I'll do exactly as you say.

106
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,970
Me too.

107
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,730
Thanks for your trust. Let's do our best.

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,340
But we've got a new problem now.

109
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,790
We don't have enough time
to practice with the new champions.

110
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,690
Manager Zhao wanted one of us
to join the reality show.

111
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,590
That'll take all day.

112
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,090
It's okay, I know about this.

113
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,470
Alright, let's start training.

114
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,330
Guys, let's do this!

115
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,050
Good luck!

116

I call Yu Bang. He's mine.

117
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,150
Yes, I finally finished it!

118
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:41,030
It's okay, at least I've got some viewers.

119
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,720
I'd better take the time to
master the new champions.

Chairman Jin.

121
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,740
Yesterday, the director of GDV called me
and said they'd never work with us again.

122
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,920
Why?

123
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,330
You have no idea.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,460
GDV specifically asked for
Ji Xiang Kong to join their show

125
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,250
but he turned down their requests.

126
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,450
He said he doesn't have time for that.

127
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,620
But...

128
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,780
But what?

129
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,140
Speak up.

130
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,190
But he'd got spare time

131
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,390
to play a duo queue with
the female streamer from You Xing Video.

132
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:39,820
Really?

133
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,820
Chairman Jin, we can't
afford to upset GDV.

134
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,740

I'm glad you came,
I wanted to speak with you.

137
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,070
I heard from Manager Zhao
that GDV and you...

138
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,440
Chairman Jin, I'm here to talk
about that with Manager Zhao.

139
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,500
I've confirmed my schedule with GDV
to appear on the reality show.

140
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,830
That's impossible. This...

141

How come I didn't know about it?

142
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,980
You didn't know about it?

143
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,960
You might want to ask your phone.

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,590
GDV kept calling you
but you never picked up their calls.

145
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,430
Are you sure?

146
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,350
There's nothing here.

147
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,270
Look.

There's really nothing here.

149
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,080
By the way, Manager Zhao,

Chairman Jin, if there's nothing else,
I'll get going now.

153

Focus on your training.

154

I'm telling the truth,
I really didn't receive any calls.

155
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,020
Please have some tea.

156

00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,380
[If the problem hasn't been
solved by then, you'd have to go.]

163
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,310
Hello.

164
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:19,530
[Hi, is this Qiu Ying
from You Xing Video?]

165
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,310
Yes, I am. You're...

166
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,750
[I'm Director An from GDV.]

167
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,250
[We have a reality show this Saturday.]

168
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,560
[We'd like to invite the esports players]

169
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,790
[and female streamers
of iConquer to our show.]

170
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,620
[May I know if you
have time for our show?]

171
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,190
Director An, I can make time for this.

172
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,530
But...

173
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,790
[Don't worry, you'll
receive remuneration.]

174
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,170
[I'll email you the details.]

175
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,670
Thanks, Director An.

176
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:53,690
There's always light
at the end of the tunnel.

177
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,960
Thank you, Lord.

178
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,400
Pei Xi, I just put on the hand cream
and so my hand is a little bit slippery.

179
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,450
Can you help me with this?

180
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:29,010
It's okay, thanks.

181
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,660
I've got my own water.

182
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:41,650
Qiu Ying.

183
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,450
Director An.

184
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,060
Handsome Ji,
this is your partner, Qiu Ying.

185
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,930
Director An, I'll be partnering up
with Ji Xiang Kong?

186
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,990
Yes.

187
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,480
Pei Xi will partner up with Qiao Xin.

188
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,000
And you two will be in the same group.

189
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,630
Stay here and relax.

190
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,500
I'll let you know when we start recording.

191
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,060
Qiu Ying, what's the matter with you?

192
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:37,950
Aren't you and Ji Xiang Kong
on good terms?

193
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,130
That's none of your business.

194
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,930
Your idol is leaving.

195
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,050
Pei Xi, wait for me!

196
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,310
What are you looking at?

197
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:03,700
Hey, you must've put in
a lot of work to get on the show.

198
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,910
What's that supposed to mean?

199
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:10,260
Don't tell me it's just a coincidence
that I'm partnering up with you.

200
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,020
Listen, Ji Xiang Kong.

201
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,760
I was properly invited to this show.

202
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,870
Besides, I had no idea my partner
would be an asshole until I got here.

203
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,170
Is that so?

204
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,010
Fine, I'll make sure you
steal the show later.

205
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,360
[The answer is wrong!]

206
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,660
-She's pretty good though.
-Did I get it wrong?

207
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,280
The answer is D, right?

208
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,470
Qiu Ying, are you alright?

209
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,450
Don't worry about it,
you'll get a second chance.

210
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,600
Alright.

211
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,830
Pei Xi, it's your turn to
answer the third question.

212
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,000
Why is Stone Beast able to
take different positions in a team?

213
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,650
A, because of its skills.
B, because of its nature.

214
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,870
C, because of its appearance.
D, because of its equipment.

215
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,400
The correct answer is...

216
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,630
D.

217
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:12,020
Congratulations, that is correct.

218
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,010
Love you, Pei Xi!

219
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,630
Qiao Xin is so lucky.
Pei Xi got it right again.

220
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,930
Back to you, Ji Xiang Kong.

221
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,570
Can he get it right this time?

222
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,790
Listen carefully to the question.

223
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,430
How many times can
Blaze Rod add damage to the stack?

224
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:35,060
A, once. B, twice.
C, thrice. D, indefinitely.

225
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,460
Please answer carefully.

226
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,260
D.

227
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,330
D, is it correct?

228
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,780
The answer is wrong!

229
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,790
Ji Xiang Kong!

230
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,160
Our punishment has
got some visual effects.

231
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,870
Are you okay, Qiu Ying?

232
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,120
Bring her up quickly!

233
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,760
Ji Xiang Kong,
you're doing this on purpose!

234
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,670
You're doing this on purpose!

235
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,190
We can see that Qiu Ying
is feeling a little upset and annoyed.

236
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,849
Why did you keep getting it wrong?

237
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm a little nervous as this is
my first time appearing on a variety show.

238
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,210
We can see that
Qiu Ying is getting emotional.

239
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,500
Does it hurt?

240
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,030
Okay. The last question
belongs to Ji Xiang Kong.

241
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
So far they haven't gotten
any correct answers. Good luck.

242
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,160
Listen carefully to the question.

243
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:38,530
Are Zeus' skills released
from his left hand or right hand?

244
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,350
Simply choose either one.

245
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,820
Please answer.

246
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,390
Ji Xiang Kong, get the answer
wrong again if you dare!

247
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,390
Let me tell you, I...

248
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,830
I've never been afraid of anything!

249
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,540
Left hand.

250
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,620
Left hand.

251
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,340
The answer is wrong!

252
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,640
Qiu Ying!

253
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,950
Are you alright?

254
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,600
Ji Xiang Kong, you did it on purpose!

255
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,500
You didn't get any questions right today.
Hang in there, Qiu Ying.

256
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Alright, after the previous round,
Pei Xi and Qiao Xin are ranked first.

257
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,520
Let's welcome Qiao Xin and
Qiu Ying to join us on the stage.

258
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,470
Congratulations to Pei Xi's team.

259
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,190
Would you like to share
your feelings with us?

260
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,270
Thanks so much...

261
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,690
Was that fun?

262
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,610
And my partner, Pei Xi...

263
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,340
It's up to me to decide.

264
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:03,260
Alright, congrats to Pei Xi and Qiao Xin
on entering the next round.

265
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,950
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're now watching GDV's reality show,

266
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,860
Heroes of the King, which is
exclusively sponsored by Bestore.

267
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,370
Now, let's move to the second round,

268
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:18,300
the duo battle!

269
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,420
I hope you can treat this game seriously.

270
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:27,710
Show me your real skills.

271
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:47,310
We can see that both the pro players
are focusing on farming.

272
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,220
They completely ignore their partner.

273
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,190
But in the other lane, Qiao Xin and
Qiu Ying are having a terrific fight!

274
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,970
Qiao Xin.

275
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,550
You shouldn't have messed with me.

276
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,220
Stop chasing, Qiu Ying.

277
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,710
We can't fight it. Stay back, Qiu Ying.

278
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,570
Dodge!

279
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,550
Qiu Ying was pushed into
the turret area by Qiao Xin.

280
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:15,110
Her HP is low now.
Pei Xi, come and help me.

281
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,230
Pei Xi has joined the fight and
taken Qiu Ying under control.

282
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,840
Ji Xiang Kong, I'm dying.
Come and help me quickly!

283
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,430
Oh no.

284
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,870
I don't want to die with you.

285
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:27,850
Qiao Xin reunited with Pei Xi's Creator
and killed Qiu Ying! Nice work for them!

286
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,160
[First blood.]

287
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,160
I died again.

288
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,770
Getting back to Ji Xiang Kong,
he's staying in the mid lane.

289
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,890
Are you trying to fight both of us alone?

290
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,550
Not only the both of you.

291
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:42,240
He's battling with three people.

292
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,610
Ji Xiang Kong is a spy
from your team, isn't he?

293
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,810
Follow me if you want to win this game.

294
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,920
I said follow behind me
if you want to win this game.

295
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,680
I'm not trying to help you.
I just don't want you to hold me back.

296
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,320
Is she asking Ji Xiang Kong for help?

297
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:01,520
Wait, what are they doing now?
Qiu Ying has stopped moving!

298
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,680
Ji Xiang Kong is at the mid lane.

299
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,350
Hurry up, Pei Xi!

300
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,320
His HP is low! Take him down!

301
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,020
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

302
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,540
Pei Xi is rushing toward Ji Xiang Kong.

303
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,280
You're leaving me to die?
That's your strategy?

304
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,260
Just do as I said if you want to win,
do you understand?

305
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,580
Wait in the bush.

306
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,870
Don't come over unless I ask for you.

307
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:19,740
What is she doing?

308
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,310
Pei Xi has followed
Ji Xiang Kong to the turret.

309
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,210
Lay low. Don't let them see you.

310
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,110
Are you sure you don't need my help?

311
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,710
It's getting dangerous for Ji Xiang Kong.

312
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,090
Don't move. I've led Pei Xi
to come over here.

313
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,600
Go, you can attack now. Go!

314
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,370
What should I do?

315
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,810
Go! Use your ulti!

316
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,760
Okay.

317
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:36,750
Don't let him escape.

318
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,740
It's an ambush!

319
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,210
Ji Xiang Kong has taken
Qiao Xin and Pei Xi under control.

320
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,420
Qiu Ying joined Ji Xiang Kong
and killed Qiao Xin! Nice teamwork!

321
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,790
-First wave.
-Keep chasing.

322
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,260
Your hands shouldn't leave your keyboard.

323
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,650
I know.

324
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,570
Nice tactic.

325
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,140
-Clear the mid lane with me.
-I'm coming.

326
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:53,020
They're destroying the tower very fast.

327
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,740
The tower's down. Now they're
pushing toward the nexus.

328
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,840
Come on!

329
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,180
Good job!

330
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,410
-Congrats to Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying!
-Ji Xiang Kong, we won!

331
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,500
Congratulations.

332
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,000
It was a fierce competition.

333
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,880
Let's welcome Qiao Xin
and Pei Xi to the stage too.

334
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,070
Pei Xi and Qiao Xin.

335
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,730
I'll announce the result
of the second match.

336
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,380
Ji Xiang Kong and Qiu Ying
won the duo battle.

337
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,880
Congrats to both of them.

338
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,830
Hello.

339
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,320
Share some good news with you.

340
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,160
[I won!]

341
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,740
You won?

342
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,020
The prizes are as follows,

343
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,980
[an iConquer's limited-edition doll,]

344
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,020
a Bestore's VIP membership card

345
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,600
and a laptop.

346
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,780
[Are you serious?]

347
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,210
But...

348
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:14,720
But...

349
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,380
But your skills...

350
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,800
It's Ji Xiang Kong.

351
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,320
He didn't give me
any help at the beginning.

352
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,330
[But you can never
imagine how good he was]

353
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,000
at the last minute
of the game.

354
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,790
He wiped out Pei Xi and Qiao Xin.
That was fantastic!

355
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,500
It doesn't make sense.

356
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,790
But that's what happened.

357
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,570
Perhaps he grew a conscience?

358
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,830
Director An.

359
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,190
Excuse me, Qiu Ying.

360
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,440
Ji Xiang Kong left his doll here.
Can you help me give it to him?

361
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,870
I've got my hands full now.

362
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,430
Thank you.

363
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,490
Can I take a photo with you?

364
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,330
-Sure.
-Thanks.

365
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,920
One, two, three.

366
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,420
Okay.

367
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,940
Thank you.

368
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,450
People call you Battlefield Trickster.

369
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,900
They do call me that.

370
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,860
You really got me just now.

371
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,650
It was just a small trap.

372
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,320
I didn't expect you to buy it.

373
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,360
Indeed.

374
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,620
I thought that rookie was your burden.

375
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:22,720
But surprisingly, you were
able to make use of her.

376
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,630
Make the best use of one's talent.

377
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,240
This is my principle.

378
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,140
Had it been a one-to-one battle,
you wouldn't have had a chance to win.

379
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,780
Maybe.

380
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,640
You have the fastest hand speed.

381
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,820
I'll probably lose if it's a solo battle.

382
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:41,710
But don't forget that iConquer
is never an individual competition.

383
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,020
You'd better do as good as you did
today at the closed beta test.

384
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,950
I'll only do better.

385
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,850
Because we're a team of five.

386
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,570
See you at finals.

387
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,280
Ji Xiang Kong!

388
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:08,370
Wait!

389
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,120
Wait.

390
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,000
You forgot your doll.

391
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,990
Director An told me to give it to you.

392
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,830
Thanks.

393
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,060
Don't mention it.

394
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,230
In fact, I should be thanking you instead.

395
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,150
Thank you for helping me
win the championship today.

396
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,990
Also, you did a great job today!

397
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,360
I'd have done it better without you.

398
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,350
I know.

399
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,390
But I still want to thank you.

400
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,170
Anything else?

401
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,510
Hands off.

402
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,220
I'd like to

403
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,970
treat you to a meal.

404
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,420
Treat me to a meal?

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,260
I've been messing with you all day,
yet you want to treat me to a meal?

406
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,910
Did you get hurt?

407
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,700
No, I'm fine.

408
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:14,110
It was quite exciting to
stand on the platform.

409
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,090
I have a dream actually.

410
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,280
I've always wanted to be an esports host.

411
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,650
I've been learning it lately.

412
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,230
But I've realized that iConquer
isn't as simple as I thought.

413
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:32,790
And I'm kind of scratching my head at it.

414
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:35,900
You're the only pro player I know.

415
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,770
So...

416
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,550
So you want me to teach you?

417
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,140
Sure.

418
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,330
How are we going to do that?

419
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,100
Here's the thing.

420
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:49,610
I made a video about
the skill analysis of Invisible Spirit.

421
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,070
But the reaction was really bad.

422
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
I've received so many
criticisms from netizens.

423
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,630
Can you give me some suggestions
if that's okay with you?

424
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,730
Sure. Should we watch it here
or at your place?

425
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,390
My place?

426
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,690
Aren't you doing this
to get closer with me

427
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,360
so that you can create
some rumors about us?

428
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,850
I...

429
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,910
That's not what I meant.

430
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,640
Get out of my way.

431
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,950
Keep the act up.

432
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,070
Playing hard to get, is it?

433
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,470
Since you're being so forward,
we should just get straight to it.

434
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:26,060
Come, let's go to your place.

435
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:31,020
Ji Xiang Kong, you've crossed the line!

436
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,270
Is it me?

437
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,960
Or are you being dramatic?

438
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,130
You're the one who pretended to be
Gu Fang's fan in Vancouver.

439
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,030
You're the one who danced
in the iConquer show to get more views.

440
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,750
You're also the one who uploaded the video

441
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,860
about our conflicts
without verifying the facts!

442
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,900
And the reality show today...

443
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,150
Ask yourself.

444
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,770
Other than playing petty tricks,

445
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,820
what makes you think you're
qualified for an esports host?

446
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,450
Let me tell you,

447
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,210
we have been brought to this day

448
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:04,050
by the good faith and the hard work
of many in this industry.

449
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,670
If you're looking for
the shortcut to success,

450
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,870
I'm sorry,

451
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,960
but there's no shortcut.

452
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:17,850
Ji Xiang Kong, you're in no place to
lecture me and tell me what to do!

453
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,220
Get out of my way!

454
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,580
Why are you in my room again?

455
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,810
I missed you.

456
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,450
Your place is more
comfortable than my place.

457
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,380
What's this?

458
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,560
You don't need to know.

459
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,020
What are you watching?

460
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,470
Qiu Ying's video.

461
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,500
She's been criticized strongly.

462
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,950
[Invisible Spirit can't stay
too long on the lane.]

463
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,570
[She's not good at poking
the enemy champion.]

464
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,960
[But she can cause...]

465
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,290
[But she'll use up her own skills, 
so you can't use them frequently.]

466
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,590
[I made a video about
the skill analysis of Invisible Spirit.]

467
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,130
[I've received so many
criticisms from netizens.]

468
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,480
Don't waste your time
on some meaningless stuff.

469
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,520
How is this meaningless?

470
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,600
Didn't she go to that reality show too?

471
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,380
And you two won the championship together.

472
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,210
Seems like fate brought you guys together.

473
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,890
You've got way too much free time.

474
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,730
Maybe I should add two more
hours to your training every day.

475
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,490
I...

476
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,290
No, I've got lots of
things to do actually.

477
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm so busy.

478
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,450
[It can cause huge damage to
the enemy champion on the same lane.]

479
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,380
[Invisible Spirit can't stay
too long on the lane.]

480
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,030
[She's not good at poking
the enemy champion.]

481
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,780
[She's a support.]

482
00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:47,240
[If she dies, the player's tempo...]

483
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,440
She was telling the truth.

484
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:50,500
[So you have to
be careful while farming.]

485
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:52,800
Did I go too far?

486
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:32,670
[How did it go?]

487
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,430
[When you thanked that liar,
was he impressed by your generosity?]

488
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,780
[Did he reflect upon the fact
that he's an asshole?]

489
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,800
I just said thank you to him.

490
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,130
[Listen, Ji Xiang Kong
has a bad reputation.]

491
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,940
[You should stay away from him.]

492
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:11,520
I know, thanks for your reminder.

493
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:24,810
Mom.

494
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,840
Am I really that bad?

495
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:44,400
I'll certainly work harder in the future.

496
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,790
I will prove myself.

497
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,730
[The blue team has the acceleration buff.]

498
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,790
[It can be used after
the first skill and second skill.]

499
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,340
Shoddy work.

500
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:51,620
[Even though you left me a bad comment,]

501
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:55,710
[I still want to thank you
for taking your time to watch my video.]

502
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:57,890
[I will keep improving myself.]

503
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:02,040
[Feel free to point out
the mistakes I made in the video.]

504
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,570
You're quite humble.

505
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,380
Let me point out your mistakes
and give you some suggestions then.

506
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:28,750
You're here.

507
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,630
Hello.

508
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,180
What would you like to drink?

509
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,670
Take a seat.

510
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:40,950
Well...

511
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,950
Did you get stuck in traffic?

512
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,960
We should've met somewhere near VNG.

513
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,320
I wouldn't have
interrupted your training then.

514
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,370
It's so difficult to meet you.

515
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,350
To be honest, I've been working
in this industry for years.

516
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,850
Yet, I've never seen such
a talented player like you.

517
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,440
That pentakill was awesome!

518
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:06,840
Double kill, quadra kill, rampage.

519
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,710
Did you know that I started
paying attention to you

520
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,070
even before you joined VNG?

521
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:20,389
But your cousin, Summer, and Shu Wen
have been good friends for so many years.

522
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,389
I couldn't compete with her.

523
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:28,120
But frankly speaking,
VNG isn't suitable for you.

524
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,250
You see, a solo can never
play better than a team.

525
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,570
This game is all about teamwork after all.

526
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,310
How can you possibly win
when your teammates are bad?

527
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,840
This is why VNG missed
the championship in all these years.

528
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:43,290
Don't you think so?

529
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:45,199
You want me to switch to Legends?

530
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:48,980
If you're willing to come,
I'll accept all your demands.

531
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,469
Who's the captain?

532
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,440
Is it Ji Xiang Kong?
