[iConquer 2019 Spring Championship]

5
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,530
Dear summoners.

6
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,900
Welcome to iConquer's
2019 Spring Championships!

7
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,270
I'm today's host, Can.

8
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
This team that I'm introducing

9
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,570
has faced much controversy.

10
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,170
Next, let's welcome the most popular
new team in 2019's professional league.

11
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:21,200
Team Phenix, welcome!

12
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,650
Phenix is the best!

13
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,670
First, the captain, Ji Xiang Kong.

14
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,900
Phenix is just a bunch
of old, feeble players.

15
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,380
Actually, I'm really looking
forward to fighting against them.

16
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,850
Yeah, me too.

17
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,329
Looking forward to
beating you, Ji Xiang Kong!

18
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,550
The veteran warrior,

19
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,920
the former captain of Team Pioneers,

20
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,320
Sun Ze Yi!

21
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:48,170
I think Sun Ze Yi is very brave
to return to professional gaming.

22
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:52,670
Brother Yi!

23
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,070
The top mid-solo of the
current generation, Pei Xi!

24
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,520
It wasn't easy for Ji Xiang Kong
to gather these people together.

25
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:00,930
I hope they'll perform well.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,670
But it's a pity for Pei Xi.

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,490
He can't adapt to Ji Xiang Kong's tactics.
He is ruining himself.

28
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,470
I think having both of
them on the same team

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,640
will give everyone
something to look forward to.

30
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,190
I have always respected Pei Xi's choices.

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,470
So, I think he knows better than me.

32
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,520
Team Phenix's secret weapon,

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,420
their youngest player,

34
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,170
Xia Ling!

35
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,270
Xia Ling, come on!

36
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,600
You are the best!

37
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,530
Phenix reminds me of Pioneers.

38
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,750
Their passion towards iConquer
and their pure grit...

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,770
I believe they will make a miracle again.

40
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,200
Lastly, the strongest support,

41
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,120
Lin Yi Xuan!

42
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,920
Every player in Phenix

43
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,670
have been doubted and criticized before.

44
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,020
They are here today because of their
confidence to overcome all odds

45
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:48,320
and their passion for iConquer.

46
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,820
Now, I officially announce

47
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:53,800
the start of today's game!

48
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,300
Phenix, come on!

49
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,120
Ji Xiang Kong is standing
again with Rebirth Shield!

50
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,050
He's going to fight back!

51
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,320
Sun Ze Yi is cutting in from the side.

52

59
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,700
We can do this now.

60
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,920
-Perfect!
-Go, we can do it!

61

62
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,080
Pei Xi, go!

63
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,280
One hit and they've
destroyed the crystal!

64
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,920
Perfect!

[Phenix's performance is excellent today!]

68
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,350
I believe that in future games,

69
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,270
Phenix will continue to surprise us.

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,980
[Let's wait and see.]

71
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,870
I watched Pei Xi grow up.

72
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,350
After he joined Phenix,
he's really made a breakthrough.

73
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,700
Yeah, Pei Xi wasn't like this,
he only cared about himself.

74
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,570
Now, he's keeping the chance

75
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,650
for Xia Ling to farm.

76
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,670
He's grown up.

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,370
-Are you happy?
-Yeah!

78
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,120
Your performance today is so great!

79
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,700
Yes, especially Little Ling!

80
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,100
He wrecked those guys from Team Dragon.

81
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,200
Good for you.

82
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,380
Xuan, you did great too.

83
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,600
Definitely.

84
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,680
Wait, call me Brother Xuan.

85
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,720
Actually, I think Xuan sounds good.

86
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,630
Yeah, I think so too.

87
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,380
If I remember correctly,
you are a week younger than me.

88
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,930
So, you need to call me Brother Xuan too.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,920
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

90
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,120
Look, it's Lu Yi Yi.

91
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,530

92

94

Come here.

95

101
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,800
Congratulations on your first victory.

102
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,100
Thanks, Luo Tian.

103
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,550
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

104
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,250
Brother Yi is still what he used to be.

105
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,720
Very brilliant.

106
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,170
My APM is not what it used to be.

107
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,630
APM is not the most important.

108
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,690
It's experience and intuition.

109
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,970
You're making me embarrassed.

110
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,300
Come on.

111
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,990
Xiang Kong.

112
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:39,850
I'm going to talk to Mr. Luo.

113
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,420
Wait for me in the lounge.

114
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,380
Okay. See you later.

115
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,020
Let's go.

116
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,620
Go.

117
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,940
It must be hard to be a team manager.

118
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,800
It's okay, actually.

119
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,400
They're working harder.

120
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,890
I'm just doing the chores.

121
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,390
Qiao Xin denied to the
organization committee

122
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,750
that she told you Ji Xiang Kong fainted.

123
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:08,300
That's why there hasn't been any
progress in VNG's strategy leak case.

124
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,370
I knew Qiao Xin would deny this.

125
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,830
Don't worry, I will make the
committee continue investigating

126
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,600
to prove your innocence
as soon as possible

127
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,060
so you can go back to
commentating as soon as possible.

128
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,470
I believe the truth will
come to light one day.

129
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,820
Don't worry, I am fine now.

130
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,350
I can also learn a lot
from managing the team.

131
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:37,770
Right, this is my video this week.

132
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,390
Let's go.

133
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,870
-So many gifts.
-Xia Ling, it's for you.

134
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,050
Mine?

135
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,920
-Have a look.
-So cool.

136
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,000
-Not bad.
-Qiu Ying.

137
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,480
-This is yours.
-I have one too?

138
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,230
We will support you forever.

139
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,200
-Facial masks?
-It's from Unifon.

140
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,770
What else do we have here?

141
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,020
Here's one for you.

142
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,820
Who gave me a rabbit?

143
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,070
Rabbit?

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,120
Someone is knocking.

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,800
I'll open the door.

146
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,380
Mom.

147
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,500
Ying.

148
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,720
Xia Ling.

149
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,230
Your mom and I went to school to find you,

150
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,850
and we heard you're here.

151
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,030
I was wondering why you
wouldn't let us visit you in school.

152
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,020
It turns out that you're
here, messing around.

153
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,980
Xia Ling.

154
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:49,030
Didn't you tell them
that you're in e-sports?

155
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,290
Xia Ling, let's go.

156
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,720
Let's go home first.

157
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,970
We'll continue this conversation at home.

158
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,470
I'm not going home.

159
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,800
I'm here to play for real,
not messing around.

160
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,290
I've transferred my major to e-sports.

161
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,900
I'm studying and doing
e-sports at the same time.

162
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,040
The school supports me.

163
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,730
What e-sports?

164
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,750
What major are you in now?

165
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,270
Auntie, calm down first.

166
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,670
You might not understand

167
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,250
that e-sports is included
in the Asian games now, too.

168
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,580
I don't want to talk to you.

169
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,350
Xia Ling.

170
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,370
Come home with me.

171
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,350
I am not going back.

172
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,500
Mom, if you insist on doing this,
I'll never go home.

173
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,900
Xia Ling, don't talk
to your mom like that.

174
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,250
She wants the best for you.

175
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,200
Don't pretend to be the good girl.

176
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,570
If not because of you,

177
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,500
he wouldn't get hit by a car
and become like this!

178
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,920
You don't have a decent job,

179
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,190
and you mess around
with these dubious people.

180
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,700
Don't ruin my son!

181
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,670
-That's way overboard.
-How am I overboard?

182
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,750
When Xia Ling was hit, my daughter...

183
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,750
His sister also rushed to
the hospital immediately.

184
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,500
Enough.

185
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,450
Xia Ling.

186
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,420
Why didn't you discuss
your major transfer with us?

187
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,070
Look how worried your mother is.

188
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:21,620
Your mother might not
understand what you're doing now.

189
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,900
Well, we'll go back first.

190
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,270
When you're done here,

191
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,140
let's go home and convince her.

192
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:29,120
Go. Enough.

193
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,370
Come home with me.

194
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,000
-Come back with me.
-I'm not going back!

195
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,370
Since I was a child,

196
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,670
as long as something
doesn't suit you, it's wrong.

197
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,870
Dad, Sister and me...

198
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,050
Have you ever thought that what
you've done are really all right?

199
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,750
Mom.

200
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,130
I don't care about how you
view what I'm doing now.

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,920
I just want to tell you that

202
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,300
here, I have my sister,
everyone and Team Phenix.

203
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,000
Only here can I find my value.

204
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:09,500
Hope you can respect my choice.

205
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,270
Why are you here?

206
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,750
I left you a bank card.

207
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,300
Repay your loans soon.

208
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:39,480
Send me the video of your game.

209
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,780
The one which they won.

210
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,270
Ji Xiang Kong is your boyfriend?

211
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,600
Good, he looks reliable.

212
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,250
He's different from what they say online.

213
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,800
How am I overboard?

214
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,980
When Xia Ling was hit, my daughter...

215
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,000
His sister also rushed to
the hospital immediately.

216
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,150
Qiu.

217
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,050
Do you and our son think that

218
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,670
it was me who pushed Qiu Ying away?

219
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,700
No.

220
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,920
Don't think it this way.

221
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:45,000
In the past, everyone has something wrong.

222
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,350
My daughter has been very
stubborn since she was a child.

223
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,750
She also made you upset.

224
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,200
But all in all, it's all my fault.

225
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,400
I didn't deal with it well.

226
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,850
Sorry.

227
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,950
I lost my temper today.

228
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,580
It goes wrong when you care about it.

229
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,830
I understand.

230
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,470
Do you really want those two kids

231
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,280
enter some gaming competition?

232
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,400
Ever since I heard from Xia Ling that

233
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,490
Qiu Ying became a commentator,

234
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:26,300
I began to pay attention
to this new industry.

235
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,650
Before this, we all thought that

236
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,320
it's something slackers do, right?

237
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,950
It's like video game addiction.

238
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,370
But after getting to know it,
I realized that

239
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,450
this is called electronic sports,

240
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,070
which is different from computer games.

241
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,220
Even in the Asian Games,

242
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,780
it's an official sport now.

243
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,450
Xia Ling's school
even set up a major for it.

244
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,950
But, what prospects do this major hold?

245
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,220
How do you know that it has no prospect?

246
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,070
The child is only 20 years old.

247
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,400
Being 20 years old mean
having infinite possibilities.

248
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,930
You see.

249
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,320
He's in love with electronic sports.

250
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,170
If he can recover from his injury trauma

251
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,350
and regain confidence,

252
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,020
isn't it a good thing?

253
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,580
I'll show you something.

254
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,300
Your son looks so confident in the video.

255
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,150
Sister, sorry.

256
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,950
My mom scolded you like that yesterday.

257
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,020
It's okay.

258
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,240
It's because your mom
doesn't know about our job.

259
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,770
That's why she's anxious.

260
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,200
She always thinks she's right.

261
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,170
Xia Ling, don't talk about
your mother like that.

262
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,020
It's because your mother
loves you and cares about you.

263
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
That's why she did this.

264
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,440
Well, after eating, I'll bring you home

265
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,150
so you can talk to her, okay?

266
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,740
There's nothing to talk.

267
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,130
She can't understand.

268
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,300
Do you plan to be at odds
with your mom forever?

269
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,190
Like me and my dad?

270
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,800
You always said he cared about me.

271
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,730
I didn't believe.

272
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,270
Dad really cares about you.

273
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,480
I didn't lie.

274
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,980
Since you became a commentator,

275
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,900
he began to follow you on Weibo.

276
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,800
I know.

277
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,480
Yesterday, I thought about it all night.

278
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,610
Since he married your mother,

279
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,250
I always thought
he didn't love me anymore.

280
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,250
And my mom too.

281
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,200
So, I really hated him.

282
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,140
I wouldn't answer his calls.

283
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,600
I wouldn't see him
even when he visited me.

284
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,280
I returned all the money he gave me.

285
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,190
Dad?

286
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,100
Having breakfast?

287
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,320
How's it going?

288
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,050
Still angry with your mom?

289
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,840
No.

290
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:37,850
No?

291
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:38,850
Yeah.

292
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,650
I have convinced your mom.

293
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,450
Really?

294
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,900
Of course.

295
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:47,570
Don't you know how your mom is like?

296
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,820
She is always like this.

297
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,400
She's not unreasonable.

298
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,620
The key is how you talk to her, right?

299
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:54,650
See?

300
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,650
She asked me to bring you
everything you might need.

301
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,300
If you need something, call us.

302
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,630
Any of us, we'll send them over.

303
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,119
Okay.

304
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,970
Your mom wants to remind you
that your leg is still injured.

305
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,720
When you are practicing,
don't sit for too long.

306
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,670
Don't skip your rehab sessions.

307
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,750
Don't skip school either.

308
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,440
My sister is watching over me.

309
00:17:17,530 --> 00:17:18,849
Don't worry.

310
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,349
Dad, don't worry.

311
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,950
Of course.

312
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,750
With a sister looking after him,

313
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,030
of course I won't be worried.

314
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,670
I used to...

315
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,000
I hope you can forgive me.

316
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,450
Your sister is a commentator.

317
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,050
You are an e-sports player.

318
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,980
As long as you are doing things you like,

319
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,670
we won't discourage you in the future.

320
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,750
Since you like it, then do your best.

321
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,400
As long as you work hard,
no matter what the results are,

322
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:22,200
you are both our pride.

323
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,250
My daughter.

324
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,330
My son.

325
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,680
You're the best.

326
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,210
Bye. I'm leaving.

327
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,480
♫ If the light falls into a black hole ♫

328
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,280
♫ I shall make a crack with my dream ♫

329
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,840
♫ As long as my heart is scorched ♫

330
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,170
♫ Then it will start a new spark ♫

Thanks.

360
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,950
Rest early.

361
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,650
What is this?

362
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,330
I want to try.

363
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,200
Come, I'll teach you.

364
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,200
It's so cool.

365
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,760
Yeah.

366
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,570
This is a new strategy
that I came up with.

367
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,100
But, it might be too ambitious.

368
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:25,650
I don't know if it'd be risky at play.

369
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,840
That's because after
they exchange positions,

370
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,530
with the cooldown time included...

371
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,200
It can cause huge damage.

372
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,850
You are the best.

373
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,420
Believe in yourself.

374
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,020
Thank you.

It's alright. Go to sleep.

406
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,390
In the first round of the playoffs,
we'll be fighting against Newland.

407
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,180
They're good at mid and late-game.

408
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,520
They will try to avoid fighting
with us in the early stage.

409
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,790
It's a stamina battle.

410
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:04,900
Xia Ling is strong in jungling.

411
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,820
It's an advantage for us
in the early stage.

412
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:08,220
But in the mid and late stages,

413
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,870
if we don't get our net worth high,

414
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,300
we will get passive.

415
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:14,380
Team Boulders is also good at long fights.

416
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,570
Right.

417
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,150
So, these two teams are
our strongest enemies.

418
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,600
We need to change our tactics.

419
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,900
What tactics?

420
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,780
-Changing positions.
-Changing positions?

421
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,970
I call this shadow tactics.

422
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,900
Xia Ling and Pei Xi
will exchange positions.

423
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,350
Which means I go to the jungle

424
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,950
while Xia Ling goes to mid lane.

425
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,970
I hope you can switch flexibly
in the game.

426
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,850
Switch flexibly? What do you mean?

427
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,900
Pei Xi and Xia Ling can
work together in mid lane.

428
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,070
Meanwhile, he can
jungle with you together

429
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,720
to attack single opponents.

430
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,780
You three can even start an ADC
when you go to the bottom lane.

431
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,390
Then...

432
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,080
That makes the pistachio versatile.

433
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,500
It can walk around.

434
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,050
It means they shadow each other.

435
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,020
They can exchange positions at will

436
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,650
and assist each other,

437
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:18,630
which makes the enemy confused.

438
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,200
Right.

439
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,950
Ying is so clever.

440
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,780
You taught me well.

441
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,300
The idea is good.

442
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,750
It can counter many formations.

443
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,380
However, it is not easy

444
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,130
to adapt to this.

445
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,980
Moreover, Xia Ling is
better at jungling than me.

446
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,450
There is a gap between my
overall output and Pei Xi's.

447
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,650
I believe you can make it.

448
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,500
Why don't we try first?

449
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,050
No matter what position I'm in,
I will try my best.

450
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,370
But I'm not sure about this.

451
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,850
No problem.

452
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,500
I'll work with you.

453
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,840
If there is any problem,

454
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:03,330
we face it together.

455
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,570
Yes, Xia Ling.

456
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:08,070
We all believe in you. Come on.

457
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:13,100
Here, let's work together

458
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,820
to win the playoffs.

459
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,950
Come on.

460
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,770
Xia Ling.

461
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,950
Come on!

462
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:38,320
Xiang Kong!

463
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,920
Qiu Ying?

464
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,930
Why are you here?

465
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:48,850
I wanted to talk to you about Xia Ling.

466
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,020
Is it about exchanging positions?

467
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:57,600
I don't know if Xia Ling
is capable of playing mid lane.

468
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,150
Don't worry.

469
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,180
He is the youngest among us.

470
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,220
His reaction and learning speed
are the quickest too.

471
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,300
His APM is almost the same as Pei Xi's.

472
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,050
What are you worried about?

473
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,390
I know him.

474
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:13,950
I'm worried that
he is not confident in himself.

475
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,780
I believe in him.

476
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,390
He is stronger than we imagined.

477
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,930
Okay, don't worry.

478
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,630
Do you know this?

479
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,900
I have never been more eager to win.

480
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,950
Before this, I didn't care about
how I was cursed at or criticized.

481
00:27:41,210 --> 00:27:44,390
But now, I want to protect
the people around me.

482
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,980
I have to be stronger.

483
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,340
I know.

484
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:53,430
You're facing more
pressure than anyone else.

485
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,380
Ever since Phenix was established,
I've wanted to tell you that

486
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,100
I will take you to the world finals.

487
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,780
We will reach the top
of the world together.

488
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,420
I believe in you.

489
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,700
Everyone, welcome to the first game

490
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,850
of iConquer's 2019 Spring
Championship playoffs!

491
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,980
Welcome, I am today's host, Can.

492
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,100
Take it easy.

493
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,920
This may be our first time
trying Shadow Tactics,

494
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,370
but don't worry, just relax.

495
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,600
Take it easy.

496
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,430
We will be fine.

497
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,670
Don't be afraid.

498
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,920
I'm with you.

499
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,200
Don't listen to him, I'll protect you.

500
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,450
You protect yourself first.

501
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,050
You don't believe in me?

502
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,380
Today's game will be between
the up-and-coming Team Phenix

503
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,230
and the veteran team, Newland.

504
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:15,470
I hereby announce
the start of today's game!

505
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,280
Both teams may take their positions now.

506
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:25,700
Did Xia Ling exchange
positions with Pei Xi?

507
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:28,280
This is Xiang Kong's new strategy.

508
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,640
What a big change.

509
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,050
Are they well prepared?

510
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,850
It worked great during training.

511
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,940
Xiang Kong will not fight
without preparation.

512
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,040
It should be okay.

513
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,970
Let's see.

514
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:42,700
Pei Xi is jungling?

515
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,190
Is Ji Xiang Kong mad?

516
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,500
He lets the new guy play in the mid lane.

517
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,840
Will it work?

518
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:50,000
Ji Xiang Kong is ruining Pei Xi.

519
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,500
This jungle is so annoying.

520
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:54,900
It's okay, we'll put up an act later.

521
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,590
-Pei Xi, farm in the jungle.
-Got it.

522
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,600
This jungler is in the bottom lane.

523
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,550
Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan are
working together at the bottom lane.

524
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,620
Pei Xi takes the opportunity
to farm in the top lane.

525
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,340
The jungler is missing.

526
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,600
It's okay, I will go after finishing this.

527
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,450
Go, stop fighting!

528
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,450
Retreat!

529
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:09,390
I can handle this.

530
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,570
They are on!

531
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,870
Xia Ling's Frost Formation
stuns the Hell Emissary!

532
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,750
[But, Newland's supports
are going to the turret.]

533
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,050
[Megaera strikes first
and stuns Xia Ling!]

534
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,320
Icy Devil follows up with Freeze Stun.

535
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:19,640
Hell Emissary launches an attack.

536
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,200
Xia Ling is killed, first blood!

537
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,020
Newland gets their first blood.

538
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,750
Hold steady, check the vision.

539
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,220
Protect Pei Xi.

540
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,740
It was a timely attack.

541
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,300
One second later, and Xin would
have taken down the Hell Emissary.

542
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,170
[Still, both supports in Newland remain
highly alert, ready to teleport anytime.]

543
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,270
[Perhaps the lack of
experience in playing mid lane]

544
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,780
[has made Xia Ling hasty.]

545
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,880
Find your rhythm back.

546
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,430
[Sun Ze Yi is being
constrained at the top lane.]

547
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,270
[Pei Xi makes a detour from
the top jungle to the top lane.]

548
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
Pei Xi, why did you go there?

549
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,620
I can't go there
with all these creeps here!

550
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,990
No, Pei Xi, run, you can't fight!

551
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,020
[Pei Xi is diving directly
to the enemy's turret!]

552
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,000
[But Sun Ze Yi is
constrained by the enemy.]

553
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,170
[Pei Xi's lack of damage has gotten
him killed directly at the turret!]

554
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,440
[Pei Xi chose the wrong
time to enter this wave.]

555
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,020
[It seems that Pei Xi hasn't
fully adapted to jungling.]

556
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,600
[I was pretty stable at top lane.]

557
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:09,350
Their jungler is in the field,
help me restrain him.

558
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,950
Go back a little.

559
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,580
My net worth is not lower than his.

560
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,170
You don't have enough HP to battle.

561
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,450
I can fight.

562
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,400
Okay, copy that, faster!

563
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,830
Come on.

564
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,450
[Xia Ling is killed again!]

565
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,170
Xia Ling, hold yourself steady!

566
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:31,690
Pei Xi, exchange positions
with Xia Ling at mid lane.

567
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,660
Okay.

568
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,870
Xia Ling, go farm yourself.

569
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,970
If this goes on, they'll lose for sure.

570
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,000
Xia Ling hasn't mastered
the rhythm of playing mid lane.

571
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,630
He is a newbie, after all.

572
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,350
Playing mid lane is so important...

573
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,050
Nonsense.

574
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:47,850
Come on.

575
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,330
Come on.

576
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,630
[The gap between both sides'
net worth is getting bigger.]

577
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,100
[Looks like Pei Xi and Xia Ling
haven't adapted to switching positions.]

578
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,870
As expected, Pei Xi goes back to mid lane

579
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,030
while Xia Ling farms in the jungle.

580
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,840
[The mid laner can't
keep up with the rhythm.]

581
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,450
[The jungle is being
controlled by Newland.]

582
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,870
[If they have a group fight now,
they won't stand.]

583
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,550
No one in Phenix can attack now.
They're losing too much.

584
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,850
It's okay, Xia Ling.

585
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,500
Find your rhythm back.

586
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,800
Don't lose your bearings.

587
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,000
[Ji Xiang Kong and Lin Yi Xuan
are entering the jungle secretly]

588
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,290
to provide vision for Pei Xi in mid lane.

589
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,690
But Newland has already controlled
the vision of the jungle earlier on.

590
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,290
[It looks like Ji Xiang Kong
and Lin Yi Xuan are exposed.]

591
00:32:20,490 --> 00:32:22,050
No, I'm controlled by the top solo!

592
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,800
I'll help Pei Xi.
Pei Xi, kill them here, quick!

593
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,980
-I'm coming.
-They're going to deal high damage.

594
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,120
-Pei Xi, hurry up.
-I don't know where the jungler is.

595
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,090
I'm on.

596
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,870
Pei Xi, run, the jungler is here.

597
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,030
Pei Xi, run, I'll help you!

598
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,190
What are you all doing?

599
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,070
Hey, you're surrendering?

600
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,770
We can see that Ji Xiang Kong
from Phenix has surrendered.

601
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,590
Congratulations to Newland on
winning the first round!

602
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,750
Congratulations!

603
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,920
[Let's congratulate Newland]

604
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,000
[for winning the game, 2 to 0!]

605
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:04,850
[Team Phenix will
enter the losers' bracket.]

606
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,070
[What a shame.]

607
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:07,090
Are you okay, Xia Ling?

608
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,700
We will win it back next round.

609
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,780
Relax.

610
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:16,400
[It's a pity that Pei Xi and Xia Ling
haven't fully adapted to their strategy.]

611
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,270
You said you'd get over him.

612
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,680
Why are you watching the game?

613
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,930
How's the preparation?

614
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:31,230
It's good.

615
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,980
This concert is my turning point.

616
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:37,320
I hope to transform
into a singer-songwriter,

617
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,120
not just an idol.

618
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,850
I support your decision.

619
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,140
But, isn't this too sudden?

620
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,370
You want to sing while playing the guitar

621
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,550
and wearing steel cables in this concert.

622
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,900
It's too dangerous.

623
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,920
I've made my mind.

624
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,330
Believe me.

625
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,000
Alright.

626
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,620
Since you've made up your mind,

627
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,830
good luck.

628
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,690
It's okay.

629
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,550
We still have chance.

630
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,199
It's my fault.

631
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:28,110
I haven't adapted to jungling.

632
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,110
No need to take responsibility for me.

633
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,530
If I didn't get killed so early
at the middle turret,

634
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,370
you wouldn't have been
affected in the jungle.

635
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,050
Our overall net worth and rhythm
wouldn't have gotten messed up too.

636
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,100
I also had problems playing mid lane.

637
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,469
Sorry.

638
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,670
I dragged everyone down.

639
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:46,150
What are you talking about?

640
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,600
What's this blaming game?

641
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,050
We are brothers.

642
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,250
No need to say all these.

643
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:54,429
I didn't do well today.

644
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,480
Xuan is right.

645
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,020
Today was an invaluable experience.

646
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,200
Now that we found the problem,
we can do better next round.

647
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,140
Yeah, it's just one round.

648
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,280
We'll fight back next round.

649
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,050
Alright, let's go back and rest.

650
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:23,110
Here.

651
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,450
Brother Sun.

652
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,730
Xiang Kong.

653
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,600
Sister Wen asked to talk to us in The King.

654
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,230
[The King]

655
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,070
As far as I know Xiang Kong,

656
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,020
he won't agree to switching Pei Xi back.

657
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,170
Then what? Everything will be the same?

658
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,150
You're going to do this? You saw the result.

659
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,170
Wait until they come.

660
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,820
You're here.

661
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,050
Are you okay?

662
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:54,450
Have a seat.

663
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,140
Alright, Xiang Kong.

664
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,750
Cheer up.

665
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,450
Don't get affected
by the criticism online.

666
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:12,130
But it's not just online criticism now.

667
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,200
Even professionals are criticizing
Xiang Kong and Xia Ling.

668
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,750
Today's loss is my responsibility.

669
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:24,790
Our Shadow Tactics aren't mature yet.

670
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,000
Next round, what's your plan?

671
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,820
I think...

672
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,370
I suggest you switch Pei Xi back.

673
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,770
It's more stable.

674
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:40,800
Before you came here,
we have been discussing that.

675
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,370
Your strategy is novel.

676
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,000
If Xia Ling and Pei Xi

677
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,820
can really follow your plan

678
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:48,040
and switch freely,

679
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,020
it can confuse the enemy.

680
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:54,090
But, can Xia Ling really execute this?

681
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,950
Xia Ling is a talented child.

682
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,970
But he

683
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,800
lacks experience in competitions.

684
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,000
But in such an important game,

685
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,200
you let a newbie play in the mid lane.

686
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,180
Are you giving him too much pressure?

687
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,970
Don't you think so?

688
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,800
Lose another round,

689
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,900
and Phenix won't get
into the world finals.

690
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,060
There's nothing wrong with Shadow Tactics.

691
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,550
No need to switch.

692
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,230
I understand what you said.

693
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,570
But I believe in Xia Ling.

694
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,500
Three of you don't have to worry so much.

695
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,130
Give us more time.

696
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:49,840
Xia Ling, come out and eat.

697
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:52,020
Don't coop yourself in the room.

698
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,420
Hey, Little Xia Xia.

699
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:55,930
Little Ling Ling.

700
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,640
Come out and eat, okay?

701
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,740
Be good.

702
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,950
Xia Ling. Come out and eat.

703
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,900
Don't coop yourself inside.

704
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah, don't look at those
stupid comments online.

705
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,250
They don't mean it.

706
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,450
Don't take it personally.

707
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,850
Stop yelling.

708
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,520
Let him calm down alone.

709
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,370
They are all back.

710
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,720
Let's go down first.

711
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:24,900
Okay.

712
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,970
I want to go up and see him.

713
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,830
Let him calm down.

714
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,050
You've been busy for the entire day too.

715
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,450
Eat first.

716
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,840
How can I eat?

717
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,470
How are you doing, King Pei?

718
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:49,230
I saw their comments about
you were pretty vicious.

719
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,400
I don't care.

720
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,900
The game is still on.

721
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,070
Cool.

722
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,680
I like your attitude.

723
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,180
How about you?

724
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:04,370
How are you doing?

725
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,430
Everyone online is doubting you all now.

726
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,250
We are fine.

727
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:16,850
We're used to it.

728
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,220
Right.

729
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,250
You are veterans.

730
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,920
You're used to the battering.

731
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:28,130
But, most of the criticism
is about Xia Ling now.

732
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,230
I don't know if he can take it.

733
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,270
Xiang Kong.

734
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,750
Don't think too much.

735
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,750
Everyone, sit.

736
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,100
Eat first.

737
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,480
Let Xia Ling calm down.

738
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,700
Xia Ling!

739
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:02,050
Come down and eat!

740
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:09,620
[Xia Ling played in the mid lane]

741
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,170
[and Pei Xi was switched to jungling]

742
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,320
[because of my decision as captain.]

743
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,050
[Please believe in us.]

744
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,770
[Before dawn comes, we will be braver.]

745
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:27,470
[I suggest you switch Pei Xi back.]

746
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,920
[It's more stable.]

747
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,770
[But it's not just online criticism now.]

748
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,770
[Even professionals are criticizing
Xiang Kong and Xia Ling.]

749
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,250
[Xia Ling is a talented child.]

750
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,590
[But he]

751
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,650
[lacks experience in competitions.]

752
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,170
[Lose another round,]

753
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,300
[and Phenix won't get
into the world finals.]

754
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:00,820
Xiang Kong.

755
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,630
Why are you here?

756
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:04,800
After you posted that on Weibo,

757
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,130
the netizens are blaming you now.

758
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,350
I'm always the popular guy.

759
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,790
Alright.

760
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,450
Don't worry.

761
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,500
I've gotten used to
what people say online.

762
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,350
Please switch Pei Xi and Xia Ling back.

763
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,070
Of course I can't.

764
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,090
If I give up now,

765
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,100
it would mean that I don't believe him.

766
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,040
I understand your intentions.

767
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,000
-But...
-No buts.

768
00:42:41,210 --> 00:42:43,050
It's hard for him to finally
build some confidence.

769
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,050
We should give him more
support and encouragement.

770
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,290
As long as he can overcome this,

771
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,180
he can achieve his dreams.

772
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,220
What if he can't overcome it?

773
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:51,990
This is a double elimination tournament.

774
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,370
If we lose one more round,

775
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,220
Phenix will have no chance
to enter the world finals.

776
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,850
Gu Fang, Sister Wen, Luo Tian
and Brother Summer

777
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,240
are all pinning high hopes on Phenix,

778
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:05,520
Brother Sun, Pei Xi, Xuan,

779
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:07,000
and you.

780
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,940
Their hopes might get dashed like that.

781
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,500
Xia Ling is not just your brother.

782
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,530
He is also our brother.

783
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:23,750
In the world of iConquer,

784
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:27,370
only trust and encouragement
among brothers

785
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,920
can help us win over and over again.

786
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,180
If we lose one game and abandon Xia Ling,

787
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:36,190
Team Phenix will never reach
the top of the world.

788
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:45,370
Yes, good.

789
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:48,570
Bear with it a little.

790
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:57,220
Pei Xi.

791
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:58,830
You can go back first.

792
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,340
I can handle this myself.

793
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,970
It's boring to practice alone
when Xia Ling isn't around.

794
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,780
It takes two to execute Shadow Tactics.

795
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,930
Thank you, Pei Xi.

796
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,070
I have to answer this call.

797
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,970
Hello, Dad.

798
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:24,940
Ying.

799
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,600
Is your brother going for rehab today?

800
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,870
Yes, he's doing it now.

801
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:30,950
I'm looking after him.

802
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,080
How is he?

803
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,970
I'm worried about him.

804
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:37,370
Many people are scold him online today.

805
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,650
It's okay. Don't worry.

806
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:46,830
Are you okay?

807
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,350
I want to get some fresh air alone.

808
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:54,380
Xia Ling.

809
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,030
None of your business.

810
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,190
I'll take care of him.

811
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,270
You can go first.

812
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,620
Doctor.

813
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,850
Hello, I want to ask

814
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:18,900
why my brother's condition
is getting worse.

815
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,420
I feel confused too.

816
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,170
He's actually recovering well.

817
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:25,670
He should be ditching
the walking stick by now.

818
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,870
Is he facing some sort of
psychological pressure?
