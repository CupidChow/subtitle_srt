4
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,270
Brother Xuan, you're back.

5
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,530
Why did you bring me back?

6
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,500
Everyone's here.

7
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,060
Let's start training.

8
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:53,530
Captain went to Chairman Ji
and vouched for you,

9
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,600
or Zhao Yang wouldn't have let it slide.

10
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,590
Now that you're back,
you've got to control your temper.

11
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,220
Stop causing trouble.

12
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:01,710
Pei Xi.

13
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't think I'll thank you for that.
I won't.

14
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,660
Lin Yi Xuan.

15
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,139
Get back to training.

16
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,970
Come on. Let's start training.

17
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,800
It's a training match with Newland.

18
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,110
We must take it seriously.

19
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,390
Four protect one.

20
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,200
It won't make a difference.

21
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,020
Stop wasting time. Hurry up.

22
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,590
What are you doing here?

23
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,450
I've been here for a long time.

24
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:59,750
How can you not notice a handsome guy
like me? You're so hardworking.

25
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,440
I'm not smart.

26
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,020
I was engrossed in studying the questions.

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,840
How did you know I'm here?

28
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,270
You weren't at Dream Traveler.
So I figured you'd be here.

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,160
And I was right.

30
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,690
Your eyebrows are ending up in a knot.
What's wrong?

31
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,220
I asked to be Luo Tian's apprentice.

32
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,750
But I was rejected.

33
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,890
Hang on. You asked him directly?

34
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,750
You're so bold.

35
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:36,790
Ask Brother Summer if Mr. Luo
has had any apprentices in recent years.

36
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,380
I know.

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,060
But Brother Summer said

38
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,550
that if Mr. Luo lectured me,
it means he thinks I have potential.

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,820
That's why he was strict with me.

40
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:50,890
You believe what Brother Summer said?

41
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,750
He is Mr. Luo's best friend
for many years.

42
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,600
I think he's right.

43
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,510
Was he just trying to comfort me?

44
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,120
Perhaps I'm hopeless.

45
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,910
I shouldn't have listened to you and
chose to be a professional commentator.

46
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,330
Does a decision let you achieve your goals
without putting in the effort?

47
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,390
Besides,

48
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,820
are you going to stop working hard
just because Mr. Luo turned you down?

49
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,840
Your goal is to be a commentator,
not someone's apprentice.

50
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:36,900
If you win the Rising Star competition,

51
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,530
then you'll be on the path
to becoming a commentator.

52
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,670
You are right.

53
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,880
But I think I am a little thickheaded.

54
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,190
I've gone through
all the questions I can find.

55
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,430
But I can only answer the questions.

56
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,850
I can't grasp the feeling of
being a commentator.

57
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,200
Remember I told you to play Yun Ti?

58
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,200
Getting into the real game
is the fastest way to improve.

59
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,430
Just like Mr. Luo.

60
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,800
He used to be a professional gamer,
then he became a top commentator.

61
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,860
He went through lots of practice.

62
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,450
That's far more effective than memorizing.

63
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,330
What you're saying is,

64
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,440
I should do a review on a match
and ask for advice?

65
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,600
I'm saying that you should go straight
to Mr. Luo after that.

66
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:32,640
Worst case scenario, you get rejected.
But what if he's willing to guide you?

67
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,050
You're right.

68
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,240
You're amazing, Ji Xiang Kong.

69
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,460
There are a lot of people here.
Please calm down.

70
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,470
Stop making rumors spread.

71
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,420
I was overjoyed.

72
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,370
Thank you.

73
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,180
Come on, we're friends.
No need to thank me.

74
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,230
Okay. I have to get back and rest
after enjoying this milk tea.

75
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,320
Lin Yi Xuan, stop losing points.

76
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,300
I did it on purpose.

77
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,070
Lin Yi Xuan, don't tower dive.

78
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,180
I'm about to collapse here at the back.

79
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,590
I got it.

80
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,550
Brother Xuan, support the ADC.

81
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,350
I'm out of money. Do it yourself.

82
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,230
Wait for me. Wait up.

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,070
I'm 100 points behind my opponent.
How am I supposed to fight?

84
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,830
Is this all you've got?

85
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:57,740
Yes, that's right. Put me back
in the reserve team if you don't like it.

86
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,050
So this is the best Support
that Ji Xiang Kong mentioned?

87
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,470
Even a new player performs better.

88
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,740
What do you mean?

89
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,610
Brother Kong talked to you?

90
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,310
Hey, I'm talking to you.

91
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,130
Brother Kong talked to him?

92
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,890
He went to see Brother Kong?

93
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,080
I don't know.

94
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,260
Why are you just standing there?

95
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,990
Let's begin.

96
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
I seriously don't know what you want.

97
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,900
What I want? Can't you play basketball?

98
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,710
That's impossible.

99
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,330
According to your file,
you are good at basketball.

100
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,630
That was before.

101
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,970
Three years ago, a Mid in Newland.

102
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,880
You had quite a good record.

103
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,960
So?

104
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,170
I don't believe
that you don't want to go back.

105
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,630
I don't want to.

106
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,550
You want to become a loser forever?

107
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,260
I've watched your matches.

108
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:41,490
When you tower dived,
my coach told me you're a scary beast.

109
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,920
But I can only think of one thing
looking at you now.

110
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,740
You've lost your spirit.

111
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,850
I don't understand
what Ji Xiang Kong is trying to do.

112
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:56,190
It's good to have ideas.

113
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,710
But playing basketball and E-sports
are completely different.

114
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,920
He's taking up training time
to play basketball. This is ridiculous!

115
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,160
Li Gan.

116
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,590
I only knew Lu Sheng likes playing safe.

117
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:12,330
But if he didn't reject
playing Mid this time,

118
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,600
I wouldn't have realized
that he has come to this state.

119
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,670
Not aiming for achievements,
just avoiding mistakes.

120
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,440
He has practically lost
his fighting spirit.

121
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,890
Lu Sheng has a balanced record.

122
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,430
He has a stable performance.

123
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,360
I don't think he has a problem.

124
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,560
Don't you think he is too stable?

125
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,620
He keeps defending
and never attacks first.

126
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,170
He even refuses to do anything risky.

127
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,070
Perhaps Ji Xiang Kong is using his way
to revive Lu Sheng's fighting spirit.

128
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,690
Even so, it's not something that can be
solved with a few rounds of basketball.

129
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,960
You and Ji Xiang Kong are still holding
onto the idea of letting Lu Sheng be Mid?

130
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,880
Should I give up the idea?

131
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,950
What are you doing here
if you are not training?

132
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,480
Why do you look so sad?

133
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,950
Brother Kong.

134
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,580
Did you

135
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,350
ask Pei Xi to put me back on the team?

136
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:50,540
Since you're back, you should train hard.
Why bother asking that?

137
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,920
Why did you do that?

138
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,620
He got rid of you as the captain.

139
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:00,130
You know I don't agree with him.
Why did you beg him?

140
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,330
I'm not going back.
I don't want his kindness.

141
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,550
Why are you like this?

142
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,230
Where else can you go?

143
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,160
Which team would want a player like you
who doesn't have team spirit?

144
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,750
I can go anywhere.

145
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,650
I can be a network manager
and train at Brother Sun's.

146
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:17,070
It's better than staying with
the current Legends.

147
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,310
-You sure?
-Yes.

148
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,070
You're leaving behind your teammates?

149
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,090
Yes.

150
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,350
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

151
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:29,260
-Let's go cancel your contract.
-No, hang on. Let's talk.

152
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,580
What's the rush?

153
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,700
You said it earlier. You can't backpedal.

154
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,460
Good going. From now on, you're the boss.

155
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,470
Canceling a two-year contract without
blinking an eye about the penalty fee.

156
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,150
I don't have money.
If I did, I would have left already.

157
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,130
I do. I'll sell my bike. Come on.

158
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,270
Wait. Hang on.

159
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,550
-Stop, stop!
-Come on.

160
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,870
Come back.

161
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,070
I was wrong. Happy now?

162
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,410
But let me set this straight.

163
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,200
I'm not doing it for Pei Xi.

164
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,790
I'm only doing it for you.

165
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,090
Okay. Go back then.

166
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,470
I still have time. Let's chat for a bit.

167
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,830
-Buy me a meal if you're staying.
-Bye, Brother Kong.

168
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,980
Thank you for watching. Bye!

169
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,430
You've recorded tons of reviews
since this morning.

170
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,870
How was it this time?

171
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,300
This is the best one so far.

172
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,600
But I still think it's awful.

173
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,070
I feel embarrassed
showing this to Mr. Luo.

174
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:49,910
Everything comes in order.

175
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,900
Be brave. Show this to Luo Tian.

176
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,140
That way you can improve. Right?

177
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,390
Good point.

178
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,850
This one it is. Let me make a copy.

179
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,070
By the way, when was the last time
you talked to Yan Yan?

180
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,390
Yan Yan?

181
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,930
It's been a few months.

182
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,860
She stayed at my place for a night
after quarreling with her boyfriend.

183
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,380
I called her after that,
but she said she was busy.

184
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,190
Why are you suddenly asking about her?

185
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:24,440
It's nothing. I was just curious.

186
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,250
Alright. I have to go.

187
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:32,150
I have to quickly
bring this video to Mr. Luo.

188
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,860
There's no need to rush.

189
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,840
Strike while the iron is hot.

190
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,360
Tidy things up for me.

191
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,820
Take an umbrella with you.
It looks cloudy outside.

192
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,010
I can only succeed if I am bold enough.

193
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,100
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

194
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,690
-Mr. Luo.
-What are you doing here?

195
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,980
This is my commentary video.
Please take a look at it.

196
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,060
Go get your umbrella. Go home.

197
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:32,510
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

198
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,530
-Go on.
-Bye, Mr. Luo!

199
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,690
Bye, Mr. Luo!

200
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,990
Great!

201
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,120
Look what you did to yourself.

202
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,480
Here. Drink this.

203
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,270
Careful. It's hot.

204
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,480
I've got to give it to you.

205
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,470
You really thought you're invincible?

206
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
You haven't slept all night
and stood in the rain for hours.

207
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:14,660
You should look after yourself.

208
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,670
I didn't expect it to rain so heavily.

209
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,450
Careful. It's hot.

210
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,560
Yi Yi.

211
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,380
How much ginger did you use?

212
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,670
More ginger will help you recover faster.

213
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:32,350
Go to bed
as soon as you're done drinking this.

214
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,990
I can't sleep now.

215
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,940
Mr. Luo has probably
gotten off from work by now.

216
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,830
He could have watched my video.

217
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,240
Yi Yi, I'm so nervous right now.

218
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,960
Relax.

219
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,160
Why don't you give him a call?

220
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,670
I'm not doing it. I'm scared.

221
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,700
What are you afraid of?

222
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,780
I went through hoops
to get his phone number for you.

223
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,070
Now you're telling me
you're afraid to call him?

224
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,840
If I were you,
I would have called him right away.

225
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,850
I would keep pestering him.

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,540
There's nothing to be afraid of.

227
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,650
[Hello?]

228
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,480
[Hello? Hello?]

229
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,850
Hello, Mr. Luo.

230
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:21,500
[Yes. Hello?]

231
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:24,530
Hello. I'm Qiu Ying.

232
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,120
[Hello.]

233
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,550
Have you seen the video I gave you?

234
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,390
[Your USB isn't working.]

235
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,110
What?

236
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,480
It's probably because of the rain.
I'm so sorry, Mr. Luo.

237
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,640
I'll make a new copy
and bring it to you now.

238
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,040
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,540
[You've lost your chance.]

240
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,960
Hello, Mr. Luo?

241
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,650
He hung up?

242
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,500
How could you break your USB?

243
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,020
It dropped into a puddle
because of the rain.

244
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,800
What?

245
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,890
I'm such an idiot.

246
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,440
Forget it.

247
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,109
Don't be so sad over it.

248
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,430
But isn't Luo Tian being too mean?

249
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,190
You didn't do it on purpose.

250
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,010
The world can still go round without him.

251
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,790
Trust me. One day, you'll show him

252
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,470
how amazing you are
when you're on the commentary stage.

253
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,490
Make him regret.

254
00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:27,380
"Show him".

255
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,860
Yi Yi, hurry. Bring me your USB.

256
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,480
What for?

257
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,900
He's doing a review tomorrow.

258
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,770
I don't care if he'll give me a chance.
I must show him.

259
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,320
Go on. Hurry up. Go get it.

260
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:48,000
Alright, alright. I'll go get it.

261
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,230
-Sister Wen.
-You've eaten your meal?

262
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,300
Your meal looks so bland today.

263
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,930
We guys are fine with anything.

264
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,440
Lu Sheng.

265
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,770
How did you get hurt?

266
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,030
He got injured while playing basketball.

267
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,160
A pro gamer's hands are very important.
How is he going to train like that?

268
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,340
Lu Sheng. You got hurt playing basketball?

269
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,400
Does it hurt?

270
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,670
I'm fine, Sister Wen. It's just a scrape.

271
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,570
Alright then.

272
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,140
Xiang Kong,
be careful while playing basketball.

273
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,120
Enjoy your meal.

274
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,760
Shen Yue.

275
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,010
Do you know what happens to a
lousy player after practicing basketball?

276
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,510
What?

277
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,090
He would still be a lousy player.

278
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,740
See you later.

279
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,310
See you later.

280
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:13,040
Lu Sheng.

281
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,790
We were helping you just now.

282
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,660
Why did you say you were fine?

283
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,240
Because I am fine.

284
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,500
Pull yourselves together.
We're getting revenge.

285
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:30,700
Mr. Luo.

286
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,870
You see, I made a new copy of my video.

287
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,330
I've told you. You've lost your chance.

288
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,200
-But it was raining...
-Can you stop a commentary abruptly?

289
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,160
Do not make excuses for yourself.

290
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,810
This is awkward.

291
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,970
I saw everything.

292
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
Qiu Ying.

293
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,020
Actually, I should thank you.

294
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:04,350
I feel a little bad having you as my foil
in the Rising Star finals.

295
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,940
Qiao Xin.

296
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,420
Aren't you tired?

297
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,300
You're always bluffing.

298
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,120
You never put in effort
to improve your skills.

299
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,670
You keep trying to climb higher
by stepping on others.

300
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,870
Aren't you afraid of falling over
by succeeding through dishonest ways?

301
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,530
You have no right to say that to me.

302
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,040
Thanks for your help earlier.

303
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,930
So? Would you like to play
a serious game with me today?

304
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,860
Show me your true ability.

305
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,020
You've seen my abilities.

306
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,400
Stop wasting your time. It's no use.

307
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,380
VNG's goal is to be the world champion.

308
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,190
If you're not capable,
I wouldn't put you as Mid.

309
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,880
But if you think you are incompetent,
then I can't help you.

310
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,400
Don't blame me if you get hurt.

311
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,310
Bring it on.

312
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:16,690
This tactic.

313
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,600
Ji Xiang Kong is truly
a Battlefield Trickster.

314
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,750
He's amazing.

315
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,190
"He's amazing".

316
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:29,720
What is this?

317
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:31,120
Brother Qi.

318
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,930
How amazing? Tell me.

319
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:35,690
It's nothing.

320
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:40,600
You've turned into Ji Xiang Kong's pet dog
in just a few days.

321
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:44,320
He showed me this video.

322
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,030
Oh, I see.

323
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,720
Who should you listen to?

324
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:51,270
Think carefully about it.

325
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,160
Yes, Brother Qi.

326
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,970
I'm thirsty. Go get me a drink.

327
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,820
Mr. Luo is here.

328
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Excuse me.

329
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,960
I did a commentary video.

330
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,240
I wish to show it to Mr. Luo.

331
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,560
[Hello, everyone. I'm Qiu Ying.]

332
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,130
[I'll be reviewing the third match of
iConquer 2017 World Finals,]

333
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,210
[which was won by two matches
out of three.]

334
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,360
[It's Team Legends
against Team En-ception.]

335
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,460
[Invisible Spirit slipped into the crowd
at the start]

336
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,270
[and used three skills
in attempt to kill Chariot Man.]

337
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,670
[However, Megaera
who was next to Chariot Man]

338
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,000
[trapped Invisible Spirit with a skill
and attacked together.]

339
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,460
I can do this too.

340
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:00,520
Exactly.

341
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,090
She's just embarrassing herself.

342
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:09,900
[Blade Master decided
to crash into the crowd and attack.]

343
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,790
[But before he could get there,]

344
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,060
[Minister sent him back to his position
and he was killed by the team.]

345
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,140
What a joke. You call that a commentary?

346
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,760
My apologies

347
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,710
for taking up your time.

348
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,110
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

349
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,920
Wait.

350
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:50,370
I believe many of you here
are like Qiu Ying.

351
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:53,750
You wish to become
a professional commentator.

352
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,750
So you came to see
my post-match commentary.

353
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:59,920
I'll take this chance
to explain to all of you

354
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,320
the essentials of live commentary
and post-match commentary.

355
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,650
You saw Qiu Ying's review earlier.

356
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:11,950
What she did was retelling everything
you've seen on screen.

357
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,750
A review like this has no meaning at all.

358
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,380
As the purpose of a commentary

359
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:21,350
is letting the audience
have a better grasp of the match.

360
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,900
We must lead the audiences
to understand.

361
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,660
To become a good commentator,
you should have these four aspects.

362
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:33,190
Lead, connect, explain,
and analyze the techniques.

363
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,410
But the most important thing
you must pay attention to,

364
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,530
is leading the audiences' emotions.

365
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:43,600
Alright. Let us watch the match.

366
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:51,010
The key point of this team battle

367
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:54,170
is that Mustang
picked the best timing to cut in

368
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,110
and even got to the center of the fight.

369
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,510
Not only did he reduce health points
of three opponents with one skill,

370
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,280
he also controlled the enemy's attacks
with the second.

371
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,590
The enemy's central attacker
has been controlled.

372
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,180
So the situation
has switched to four against five.

373
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,680
They have two choices now. To be killed
or protect their attacker and retreat.

374
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,390
But the best part is that

375
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,040
Mustang used a deceleration tool
before leaving.

376
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,110
It slowed down their enemy's retreat.

377
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,520
And by sacrificing one to save four,
they won the battle.

378
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,850
Don't show me
something meaningless next time.

379
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,040
Sorry, Mr. Luo.

380
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,650
Alright. Let's move on to the main topic.

381
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,630
Brother Summer.

382
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,390
Way to go.

383
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,360
Stop kidding me.

384
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,050
If there had been a crack in the ground,
I would have crawled in.

385
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,180
At least it ended well.

386
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,890
How was that good?

387
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,210
How was that not good?

388
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,100
What did Luo Tian say at the end?

389
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:10,690
He said not to show him
a video like this next time.

390
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:15,570
Exactly. He said "next time".

391
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,390
"Next time".

392
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,760
I have a next chance.

393
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,030
Xin Xin.

394
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,710
What do you want for lunch?

395
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,260
How about a drink?

396
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,040
Drinking during the day? Are you crazy?

397
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,470
What's the matter? Who made you so angry?

398
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,900
Who else?

399
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,260
It's that brazen Qiu Ying.

400
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:49,520
Qiu Ying?

401
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,490
She has left You Xing Video.
She's no longer a threat to you.

402
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,470
To me, you are the best.

403
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,490
Enough sweet-talking.

404
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,730
Luo Tian did a review
at Dream Traveler today.

405
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,470
You have no idea how Qiu Ying
kept pestering Luo Tian.

406
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,840
I must win Rising Star no matter what.

407
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,050
Or else, I won't get to be
next to Luo Tian even if I enter GDV.

408
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,380
How am I going to be
the top female commentator?

409
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,770
Am I right?

410
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:21,150
If you're worried about Luo Tian,
then I think it is unnecessary.

411
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,610
Are you sure?

412
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,660
Of course.

413
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,960
I know him very well. He hates people
who won't stop pestering him.

414
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,820
So the more Qiu Ying pesters him,
the more he'll hate her.

415
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,580
I've thought of that as well.

416
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:42,950
But today,
Luo Tian personally guided Qiu Ying.

417
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,150
That's impossible.

418
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,760
Why not?

419
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:49,550
It's not just Luo Tian.

420
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,390
Qiu Ying even works at Dream Traveler.

421
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,320
Apparently. Summer is helping her.

422
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,800
Those two are more than capable of
helping her win the competition.

423
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,060
So what if Luo Tian helps her?

424
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,950
I know a lot of people from GDV too.

425
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,330
Honey, just let me know
if you need my help.

426
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,420
My dear Xin Xin is so ambitious.

427
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,840
You Xing Video is no use right now.

428
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,290
But I'm determined to win this.

429
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,440
I understand.

430
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,230
So,

431
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,100
I might do something
that leaves me no choice.

432
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,180
But you must never get the wrong idea.
I'm faithful to you.

433
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,390
I'm just doing all that for my career.

434
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,620
Okay.

435
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:43,670
I support you in everything you do.

436
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,540
Wait a minute.

437
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,880
Wait. What's this?

438
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,350
Could you look into this for me?

439
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,590
What for?

440
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:15,260
This is a serious matter.

441
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,250
I know that. Otherwise,
I wouldn't have asked for your help.

442
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,820
[IP Address Investigation]

443
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,210
Are you sure you want me
to look into this?

444
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,820
Please let me know
once you've found something.

445
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,770
Yi Yi, I'm home.

446
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,150
-Qiu Ying.
-Yi Yi.

447
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,530
You know. Today, Luo Tian said to me,

448
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,430
"Don't show me
something meaningless next time."

449
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:48,240
I didn't understand it at first,
then I realized he said "next time".

450
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:51,470
Which means he'll give me
more advice next time.

451
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,030
What's wrong? Why aren't you happy?

452
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,080
Well...

453
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,430
What happened?

454
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,720
Look who's here.

455
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,360
Yan Yan.

456
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,370
What brings you here?

457
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:07,260
Yi Yi even talked about you two days ago.

458
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,660
Wait. Why are you crying?

459
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,640
Did anyone bully you? Don't cry.

460
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,360
Was it your boyfriend?

461
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,540
It's okay, Yan Yan.

462
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,120
Tell her.

463
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,690
What happened?

464
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,510
I am so sorry, Qiu Ying.

465
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:46,480
What's going on?

466
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,320
That fake assaulting video.

467
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,680
I was the one who uploaded it.

468
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,390
When did you do it?

469
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,680
When I stayed over at your place.

470
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:16,140
I secretly uploaded it with your computer.

471
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,860
Hang on.

472
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,920
Why did you do it?

473
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,860
She was blackmailed.

474
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,590
What?

475
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,070
Qiao Xin recommended me
to a lingerie advertisement job

476
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:39,970
that pays very well.

477
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,780
So I accepted it.

478
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,950
But after the job was done,

479
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:50,540
I received photos and videos of me
in the changing room.

480
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,850
I'm sorry, Qiu Ying.

481
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:02,070
I've looked into it.

482
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,190
The man who called me was Wang Bin.

483
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,310
Zhao Yang wanted
to kick Ji Xiang Kong out of Legends.

484
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,810
So he fabricated a video
of Ji Xiang Kong assaulting someone.

485
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,450
Qiao Xin wanted
to kick you out of You Xing Video,

486
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,850
which fit right into Zhao Yang's plan.

487
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,650
So Qiao Xin tricked Yan Yan
into doing the job.

488
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,490
Then Zhao Yang's assistant
took pictures of her in the changing room.

489
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,220
He even forced her to upload
the fake video using your computer.

490
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:44,260
It's my fault. I was stupid and weak.

491
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,990
You had to leave You Xing Video
and sell your house because of me.

492
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,520
Forget it.

493
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,940
It's all in the past now.

494
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,770
You are also a victim in this.

495
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,920
I don't blame you.

496
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,280
That's right.

497
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,140
Those who did wrong must be punished.

498
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:26,520
Qiu Ying.

499
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,990
Why are you back, Qiu Ying?

500
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,620
Mr. Liu isn't around. Qiu Ying! Qiu...

501
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,710
What are you doing here?

502
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,910
Are you going to beg Mr. Liu
to take you back?

503
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,350
I know.

504
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,350
You're here because of Rising Star.

505
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,260
You Xing Video is one of the sponsors.

506
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,410
You know Mr. Liu is close with GDV.

507
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,310
So you want him to put in a good word.

508
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,400
Qiao Xin.

509
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,190
I'm impressed with you even more now.

510
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:54,650
You act as if nothing happened
after doing something so dirty.

511
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,560
I have a show to record.
I don't have time to talk to you.

512
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,050
You want me to say how you blackmailed
Yan Yan and forced her to hurt me?

513
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,620
Everyone here knows
you are good friends with Yan Yan.

514
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,659
You think you can turn things around
with your terrible acting?

515
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,830
I've contributed so much to the company.

516
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,380
Do you think Mr. Liu will kick me out
based on what you two have said?

517
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,630
It's true that I won't do that now.

518
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,460
Mr. Liu, she is slandering me.

519
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,270
The iConquer edition is crucial
for our company's transformation.

520
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,440
I will win Rising Star for the company.

521
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,210
But you mustn't let them fool you.

522
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,030
You are something, Qiao Xin.

523
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,300
No one can beat you
at your way with words.

524
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,730
You can completely twist facts.

525
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,530
The company has spent so much
to help you change your image.

526
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,230
But has You Xing Video
succeeded in transforming?

527
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:51,370
Mr. Liu.

528
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,530
Have you ever wondered why?

529
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,240
It's because Qiao Xin has never focused on
improving her professional skills.

530
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,920
You're obsessed with being the top

531
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,780
and you get rid of anyone
who's a potential competitor.

532
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,940
If the whole company
agrees with your methods,

533
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,170
then I'm glad that I have left.

534
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,050
Instead, you should think carefully.

535
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:15,210
Who are you
to compete with me in Rising Star?

536
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,310
Qiu Ying, wait a minute.

537
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,040
Would you like to come back?

538
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,160
Represent You Xing in the competition.

539
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,770
If you're willing to come back,
the company will give you full support.

540
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,760
Thank you.

541
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,230
Mr. Liu.

542
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:44,560
Are you serious about her coming back?

543
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,840
You're even making her the ace?

544
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,930
Then what about me?
I've done so much for the company.

545
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,250
I...

546
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,640
Qiao Xin.

547
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,420
I trained you from day one.

548
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,560
I know everything
you've done for the company.

549
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,260
I hope you can think about this.

550
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,380
How much has the company given you?

551
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:16,210
[Summer]

552
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,480
Are you sure it's them?

553
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,810
With clear evidences. As you expected.

554
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,530
Call the police then.

555
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,850
What are you doing?

556
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,740
I asked you to show your faces
to support other stores.

557
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,410
Is that too much to ask?

558
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,570
All of you giving me excuses.

559
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,240
"No time".

560
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:58,310
"Busy with training".

561
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,710
Why don't I see all of you
usually working so hard?

562
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,320
I expected it from others,

563
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,750
but Huo Yao.

564
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,510
Who are you to turn it down?

565
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,760
You're not talented enough and you're old.

566
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,270
Your hands won't move faster
even if you train for another century.

567
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,970
How dare you give me excuses?

568
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:26,430
Mr. Zhao, you're being a little harsh.

569
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,360
It makes sense that we're training harder
as the competition is near.

570
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,560
Besides, Huo Yao
has been in good condition lately.

571
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,290
He has always been.

572
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,640
Our former captain often said

573
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,200
that Brother Yao could handle pressure
and rarely made mistakes.

574
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,700
Has your eyesight gotten worse?

575
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,240
Then you should get a new pair!

576
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,750
Can't you see your captain
sitting right across you?

577
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,390
Why are you mentioning
your former captain?

578
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,610
He has left.
What he said doesn't matter anymore.

579
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,560
You can handle pressure

580
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,600
and rarely make mistakes?

581
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:22,190
But you still got defeated by Pei Xi
in the closed beta test.

582
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,290
Huo Yao.

583
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:30,130
What was that lousy performance
during the closed beta test?

584
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:32,550
Yet you want me to renew your contract?

585
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,360
-What are you doing?
-Yi Xuan.

586
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,780
Stop! What are you trying to do?

587
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,430
Zhao Yang.

588
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,670
You want to frame people?

589
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,520
You got rid of Brother Kong.

590
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,990
It's time I make you pay
for what you've done.

591
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,350
What are you saying?

592
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,770
This scoundrel fabricated that video.

593
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,480
Nonsense.

594
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,800
You...

595
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,930
He did more than that.

596
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,050
He threatened me with renewing
my contract to screw up the game.

597
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,980
So that Handsome Ji leaves Legends.

598
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,530
-Zhao Yang, you scoundrel!
-Stop! Get back here!

599
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,940
What are you doing?

600
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,720
You said I'm not talented enough!

601
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,330
You said I'm old!

602
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,470
-You...
-That's right.

603
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,590
I screwed up the game. It was my fault.

604
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,740
It had nothing to do with Handsome Ji.

605
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,920
You people.

606
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,190
Accusing me with no evidence?

607
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,960
Show me proof!

608
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,240
Stop talking if you don't have proof.

609
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:37,090
How dare you insult a team manager?

610
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:39,650
I can fire all of you!

611
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,210
I am the captain.

612
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,090
No one has the right to punish
my teammates without my permission.

613
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,840
Pei Xi, I'm helping you here.

614
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,210
You're helping me?

615
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:56,320
But I feel that
you're just helping yourself.

616
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,580
Who said my condition for coming
to Legends was being the captain?

617
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,060
Pei Xi, now isn't the time for this.

618
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,520
No, I want to talk about it now.

619
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,160
Fine.

620
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,650
Pei Xi.

621
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,840
You know me.

622
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:24,400
I am capable of bringing you to this team
and kicking you out.

623
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:27,120
Better think twice
before going against me.

624
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,590
It's not your call to fire anyone.

625
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,180
Mr. Jin.

626
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,770
Someone is leaving today.

627
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,750
Zhao Yang.

628
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,420
You're fired.

629
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:45,140
No, Mr. Jin. There's a misunderstanding.

630
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,350
Let me explain.

631
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:52,070
These kids are spewing nonsense.
Don't listen to them.

632
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,670
It's true. I...

633
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,750
I would never do such a thing. Am I right?

634
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:02,150
Think about it.
I've fought beside you for many years.

635
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,100
I've brought in so many sponsors
for the company,

636
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,120
which led to the company's achievements.

637
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,190
If you fire me now,

638
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,010
the company might lose all those sponsors.

639
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,200
It has nothing to do with you.

640
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,610
Those sponsors are here because of me.

641
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,460
Wang Bin has been arrested.

642
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,370
You might be the next.

643
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:28,340
You can't deny it anymore.

644
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,220
Yes.

645
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,380
I care a lot about Legends'
business operations,

646
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,230
but what I want isn't making
endless amounts of money.

647
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,190
What I want is to form
the world's greatest team.

648
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,400
Making money isn't my goal.

649
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:50,110
Those money are for them to create
miracles under a good environment.

650
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:56,060
Zhao Yang.

651
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,310
You've been with me for many years.

652
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:01,220
But you've gotten so foolish.

653
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,710
Understood.

654
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,250
Mr. Jin.

655
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:10,980
Thank you for your guidance
all these years.

656
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,750
"The mission of Legends."

657
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,490
"Never giving up."

658
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,170
Brother Kong.

659
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,680
Handsome Ji.

660
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,620
What are you guys doing here
instead of training?

661
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:52,830
Brother Kong.

662
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,810
We know the things Zhao Yang did to you.

663
00:42:57,290 --> 00:42:58,440
Captain.

664
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,370
Handsome Ji.

665
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,540
We lost the closed beta game
because of me.

666
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,550
It had nothing to do with you.

667
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:08,560
Mr. Jin knows the truth now.

668
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,630
I'm sorry.

669
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:23,120
Handsome Ji, if that's not enough,
we can give him a good beating.

670
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,750
It's fine.

671
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,620
It's in the past now.

672
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,290
Don't cause anymore trouble.

673
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm doing pretty well here.

674
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,500
No.

675
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,000
Brother Kong.

676
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:43,170
All of us wish that you can come back
and be our captain again.

677
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:47,320
All of us feel low-spirited
at training without you.

678
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,470
Plus, you know how Pei Xi is.

679
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,980
Captain.

680
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,140
We need you.

681
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,020
Thank you.

682
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:07,430
But VNG took me in

683
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,680
when I was at my lowest.

684
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,810
Say something, guys.

685
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:30,620
Fine. I'll say it.

686
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:34,940
Brother Kong,
we don't mean to make you a traitor.

687
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,580
We just wish
to get back on the right track.

688
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,440
Don't forget that you promised Captain Gu

689
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:44,470
that you would lead us
to the championship.

690
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,010
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,640
My decision is final.

692
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:58,020
Captain Gu also said

693
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,630
that no matter which team you are in,
you should believe in your teammates.

694
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,420
No matter what kind of opponent you face,
you must do your best.

695
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:10,520
Therefore, I will do my best
to defeat you all in the competition.

696
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:12,760
That's the competitive spirit.

697
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,720
All of you are my dearest buddies.

698
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,290
You are also opponents that I respect
in a competition.

699
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,410
So pull yourself together.

700
00:45:34,290 --> 00:45:36,170
I'll see you at the Fall Championship.

701
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:45,470
Brother Kong.

702
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:48,320
See you at the Fall Championship.
