Why is it broken?

00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,170
It is?

6
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:50,450
Let me see.

7
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,830
It shouldn't be.

8
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,789
It was fine when I left
the house just now.

9
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,400
How about this?

10
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,870
Tell me its price and I'll pay you back.

11
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,760
Do you know what the word
'priceless' mean?

12
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:28,590
Well, since you think it's priceless,
money obviously can't compensate for it.

13
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,260
How about this?

14
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,530
Tell me what you want
and I will give it to you.

15
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,030
Ji Xiang Kong,
I thought you were a decent guy.

16
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,070
Now it seems that I was wrong about you.

17
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,390
Mom, I'm sorry.

18
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,010
I'm sorry I broke the necklace.

19
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,950
Whatever you think of me,
I'd still like your help.

20
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,790
Because Gu Fang is

Do you know what the word
'priceless' mean?

23
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,360
Why are you still playing with your phone?

24
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,590
What's wrong?

25
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,120
The captain wants to retire.

26
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,080
Where is he?

27
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,140
Downstairs.

28
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,890
Wait!

29
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,130
Captain.

30
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,790
Don't call me captain.

31
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,070
A better person will take my place.

32
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,800
But you're still our captain as of now.

33
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,530
Captain, are you really retiring?

34
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm 30 years old.

35
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,420
It's time to retire.

36
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,550
Xiang Kong,

37
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,540
the team can do well without me,

38
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,380
but they can't lose you.

39
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,700
If I was even the least bit useful

40
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:38,960
during the past few years,

41
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,360
it'll be because I've found you.

42
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,850
But after we came back from Vancouver,
people have been attacking you online.

43
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,700
I've always been a klutz among
all the professional players.

44
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,580
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,580
You've suffered a lot.

46
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,250
It's okay.
They can say whatever they want.

47
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,690
I don't care.

48
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,050
All my life, no matter what I did,

49
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:11,690
I was always being
questioned and ridiculed anyway.

50
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,750
I've gotten used to it.

51
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,130
I've been fighting for years

52
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,900
and yet I was still unable to
get the ring for the second championship.

53
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,610
I used to dream of

54
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,460
winning a second championship.

55
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,300
But now it is my dream
to see you guys win the championship.

56
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,090
The captain's burden falls on you now.

57
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,840
Captain, you think too highly of me.

58
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,550
I'm just a klutz.

59
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,530
How can I possibly be the captain?

60
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,810
Do you still want to put up a front
and pretend that you care nothing?

61
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,960
All of us can feel the passion in you.

62
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,860
Don't let external factors
dampen your spirits.

63
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:24,980
Good luck.

64
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,810
You are the only hope for me and the team.

65
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,300
Captain,

66
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,580
I don't know if I can do it.

67
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,060
Trust me.

68
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,610
You can do it!

69
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,430
Xuan is very talented.

70
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,159
Huo Yao is an experienced veteran.

71

Lu Feng has a good personality
and works well with others.

72
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,900
Putting such a good team in your hands

73
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,760
will probably resolve my regrets.

74
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,560
Don't reject me.

77

78

the championship next year.

Captain,

85
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,820
we've fought together for so many years.

86
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,550

Haven't you shed
enough tears in Vancouver?

90

Stop crying!

91

You said you would
lead us to the championship.

I'm still your big brother.

I'd killed you so many times just now.

You fell for his trick.

He purposely led you to
the top lane and let you kill him.

Manager Zhao from Leaders

I don't want to see him again.

If I were to become like Qiao Xin
just so that I can beat her,

140
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,770
wouldn't that make me lose myself?

Look what it says here.

Do you remember what I told you?

146
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,860
The path to our dreams
is filled with numerous obstacles.

147
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,570
Qiao Xin sees you as
her imaginary enemy now.

148
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,440
She made you miss the plane last time

149
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,170
and we have no idea
what she's going to do next.

Don't you think I'm right?

151

What are you shaking your head for?

152
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,700
It's yummy.

Morning. Have you had breakfast yet?

You're the most stable person in our team.

159

Something big has happened and yet
you're still in the mood for breakfast.

You're unbelievable.

161
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,640
It's not that big of a deal.

162
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,490
It's just a board meeting.

163
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,340
Not that big of a deal?

164
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,040
Gu Fang is retiring!

165
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,060
Who would bear
the burden of the captain now?

166
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,110
We'll decide the matter among ourselves.

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,320
Don't worry about it.

168
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,670
Coach Luo, don't you have
a particular someone in mind?

169
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,870
I'm thinking about Huo Yao.

170
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,480
Huo Yao is great!

171
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,350
He's stayed in our team
for the longest time.

172
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,490
We should go by seniority.

173
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,860
Don't you think so, Coach Luo?

174
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,560
Seniority is one thing,

175
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,420
but Huo Yao's past his prime.

176
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:59,300
Although his performance was
relatively stable in recent years,

177
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,760
no major breakthrough has been achieved.

178
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,310
Coach Luo, you're saying...

179
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,960
Not bad.

180
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,650
Your movement, tactics
and coordination are good.

181
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,700
You're talented.

182
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,810
It's because everyone coordinated well.

183
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,160
I was really nervous actually.

184
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,240
My palms were sweating profusely.

185
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,440
We don't believe in modesty here.

186
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,780
You don't seem like you've only
been playing for three years.

187
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,880
He's only played for three years
and he's already better than you.

188
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,090
You're with me now.

189
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,580
Why is it you again?

190
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,460
The new guy will stick with me.

191
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,990
-He's with me.
-Cut it out.

192
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,700
Brother Yao, what do you think?

193
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,420
Brother Yao?

194
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,600
He's great,
quite exceptional for a beginner.

195
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,650
Good luck.

196
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,280
Okay, I hereby announce that

197
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,180
Li Nan officially becomes
a member of Legends.

198
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,880
Thank you, Handsome Ji.
Thank you, everyone.

199
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,100
Good luck!

200
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,630
Dinner's on you!

201
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,410
You're paying for dinner!

202
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,730
You'll get used to it.

203
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:26,490
I believe everyone knows that
Gu Fang is retiring.

204
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,740
The reason why I gathered everyone here

205
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,930
is to pick a suitable person
to take Gu Fang's place.

206
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,070
As a matter of fact,
the best candidate is right here.

207
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:41,750
Ji Xiang Kong.

208
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,820
He's our conductor.

209
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:47,700
All the tactical formations and strategies
are set by him and Coach Luo.

210
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,740
His capability is evident to all.

211
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,800
I think he's the perfect candidate.

212
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,310
Sorry to interrupt.

213
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,260
Since everyone's here today,

214
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,650
let's have a look at
the statistics for the last game

215
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,240
and find out what exactly the problem is,

216
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,650
so that we know why we lost.

217
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,619
This is the first game.

218
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,440
Ji Xiang Kong was killed seven times.

219
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,920
He was killed five times
in the second game.

220
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,490
These are the statistics for all 16 teams
and a total of 80 players,

221
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,270
and Ji Xiang Kong came in last.

222
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:36,960
Shouldn't we reconsider
the ability of this player?

223
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,530
Guys, to be honest, I shall bear most of
the responsibility for losing this game.

224
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,130
It was caused by my awful selfishness.

225
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:47,920
Gu Fang!

226
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:52,110
Ji Xiang Kong lost seven points
in the first round trying to protect me.

227
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,370
And I heard everything he told you
in the lounge during halftime.

228
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:03,960
What did he say?

229
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,010
What are you doing here?

230
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,790
The meeting is very unusual today.

231
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,640
It's taking way too long.

232
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,520
Do you think something has gone wrong?

233
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,080
Since when do you
worry about the chairman?

234
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,520
Think about it.

235
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,320
Ever since we got back from Vancouver,
Zhao Yang's been bothering us.

236
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,030
He kept finding fault with us.

237
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,500
Look at him.

238
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:27,740
Do you think he will...

239
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,230
All right, don't worry about it.

240
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,650
-Let's get back to training.
-No, we...

241
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,610
-Let's go!
-I'm coming.

242
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,850
He knew I wasn't doing well.

243
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,980
He got himself killed so many times
but he still couldn't protect me.

244
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,690
His sacrifice gave the team
an edge in the competition.

245
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,370
Gu Fang, you brought
Ji Xiang Kong into the team.

246
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,070
You have plenty of reasons to protect him.

247
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:55,620
But the problem is,

248
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,470
even the fans know that
Ji Xiang Kong lacks the capability.

249
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:01,650
We're a professional team.

250
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,410
Why should we care about
the unprofessional comments online?

251
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,110
This is the era of fans' economy!

252
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,240
We can't just ignore them!

253
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,810
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,420
I got a bit carried away.

255
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,630
Sorry about that.

256
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,890
We're all doing this for our dreams.

257
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,160
That's why we're here today.

258
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,080
But dreams don't fill the stomach.

259
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:27,510
The most important position
in a professional team is the captain.

260
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,690
We have to find
another star player like Gu Fang

261
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,540
who can take on
the heavy responsibilities.

262
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,830
Judging from Ji Xiang Kong's
current public image,

263
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,330
the fans will eat our heads off
if we made him the captain.

264
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,320
Winning the championship is the best
explanation we can give to the fans.

265
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:47,190
How did Legends become
the best team in the country?

266
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,880
How did we get so many loyal fans?

267
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:51,500
By holding tight to our goal,

268
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,880
which is to win the world championship!

269
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,200
This is our foundation.
We mustn't confuse cause and effect.

270
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,200
But the thing is we're going to...

271
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,210
Enough.

272
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,660
Well, we're here to
discuss the matter together.

273
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,110
You all shared your views
and there's merit on both sides.

274
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,120
Let's do it this way.

275
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,680
We'll give him a shot.

276
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,010
I received word that

277
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,260
iConquer will hold a closed beta test
in order to launch five new heroes.

278
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,770
Let Ji Xiang Kong participate
in this game as an acting captain

279
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,270
so that we can evaluate his abilities.

280
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,310
Guys.

281
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,260
Captain. Coach.

282
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:46,120
May I have your attention, please.

283
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,890
I have an announcement.

284
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,130
Starting today, Ji Xiang Kong
will be our acting captain.

285
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,900
Acting captain?

286
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,490
-Why don't you just make him the captain?
-I know, right?

287
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,570
You talk too much.

288
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:05,080
The captain is unworthy of the position.

289
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,080
Even if you're in the position now,
you'll have to come down sooner or later.

290
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:11,990
You're right.

291
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:13,860
Manager Zhao has a point.

292
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,900
I've never even become a group leader.

293
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:18,870
I felt a bit of a misfit
to be promoted as the captain.

294
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,130
You'll get used to it.

295
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,230
Xiang Kong, this is just
a transition period.

296
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:24,490
I believe in you.

297
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,350
Listen to Xiang Kong
and follow his lead after this.

298
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,410
I'm sure he can lead you.

299
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,150
What do you say?

300
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,940
Is there any objection?

301
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,000
If so, do you dare
play a game with me first?

302
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,080
I'm fine with that. What about you?

303
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,030
-Do you dare?
-No, I don't.

304
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,670
Well then, Captain,
I'll follow you from now on.

305
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,100
Didn't you say you'd follow me?

306
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,350
Why would I do so? You're not the captain.

307
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,950
Isn't that right, Brother Yao?

308
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:54,990
Yes.

309
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,470
Congratulations, Handsome Ji.

310
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,550
Thank you, Brother Yao.

311
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,120
Thanks for all your support.

312
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,250
The closed beta test is coming up.

313
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:04,800
Since everyone has
the same goal -winning,

314
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:07,340
I'd like to make three requests
to the company.

315
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,420
You're eager to do your job.

316
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,790
You've got requests for the company?

317
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,930
Fine, let me hear it.

318
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,030
First of all, we must lose
no time in training

319
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,060
and so we don't have time
for commercial events.

320
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:28,350
Second, I hope everyone can comply with the
training plan I created with the coach.

321
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,050
Third, each team is
upgrading their equipment.

322
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,210
We need better equipment as well.

323
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,520
Okay.

324
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,880
I agree with what Xiang Kong's asking.

325
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,150
Clap your hands if you agree with him.

326
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,190
Manager Zhao has always
supported us unconditionally.

327
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,310
I don't think he'll say no.

328
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:02,610
Right?

329
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,200
Well, thanks, Manager Zhao.

330
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,780
Please take good care of us in the future.

331
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,620
Manager Zhao, goodbye.

332
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,490
We won't see you off then.

333
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,700
A group of insolent brats!

334
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,200
Manager Zhao, don't get mad.

335
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,600
The issue is still unresolved, isn't it?

336
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,180
Calm down and have a cup of tea.

337
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,100
I don't want it!

338
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,950
He's just an acting captain.

339
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,980
Why is he acting all arrogant?

340
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,320
How dare he challenge me
in front of everyone!

341
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:57,060
What? They don't have
time for commercial events?

342
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,550
That's not for him to decide!

343
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,250
I've set up everything.
I'd lose a lot of money if he doesn't go!

344
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,070
I know.

345
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:04,550
Ji Xiang Kong is
just trying to ruin my business!

346
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,100
Ji Xiang Kong's got
Gu Fang backing him now.

347
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,870
But once the retirement party is over,
Gu Fang will be gone.

348
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,940
We'll see how much longer
he can act this way.

349
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,580
Why don't we find an outsider

350
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,820
who is famous and
focuses only on the competition?

351
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,740
Chairman Jin wouldn't argue with that.

352
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:32,970
You're talking about him?

353
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,920
Mr. Liu, you wanted to see me?

354
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,120
Wait a moment.

355
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,480
We have an understanding then, Mr. Liu?

356
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,300
Sure.

357
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,240
Qiu Ying, take a seat.

358
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,470
Mr. Liu.

359
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:01,060
I've noticed that you haven't been
performing well lately.

360
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,560
The popularity of your personal column
and the followers of your live broadcast

361
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:05,910
have dropped drastically.

362
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,590
Mr. Liu, I've been
practising my heroes lately.

363
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:15,310
But I don't get why I'd make
a lot of mistakes during the match.

364
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,920
You can consider producing
a more diverse range of programmes.

365
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,440
For example, you can combine
the game analysis with your talents.

366
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,100
Mr. Liu, here's what I think.

367
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,420
Since iConquer specializes
in covering professional esports,

368
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,440
I don't want people to think
I'm unprofessional as a host.

369
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,690
It's good to have
high expectations for yourself.

370
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,930
But you know how intense
the competition in our industry is.

371
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,640
I can only give you another month.

372
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,310
If the problem hasn't been solved by then,

373
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,130
you'd have to go.

374
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,730
I understand.

375
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,590
Why is she taking so long?

376
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,690
Qiu Ying, how did it go?

377
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,760
One month.

378
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,170
One month?

379
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,560
If my show doesn't
catch on within a month,

380
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,460
I'll be fired.

381
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,530
Lu Yi Yi, come in!

382
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:18,150
I have to deliver the manuscripts to him.

383
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,950
Why is Mr. Liu doing this
to you all of a sudden?

384
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:29,820
I know.

385
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,090
Qiao Xin was in there for a long time

386
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:34,080
and he asked for you right after that.

387
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,470
I knew she was up to no good.

388
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,710
She helped Mr. Liu appease
Manager Zhao from Legends.

389
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,570
Of course he will help
the one who has a higher value.

390
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,020
It's perfectly natural.

391
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,870
I only have myself to blame
for my lack of professional capacity.

392
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:55,220
Everything is great about this company,
except for the coffee from the coffee maker.

393
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,840
It's no match to the hand-brewed coffee.

394
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,130
Yan Yan, I miss the days
when you bought me coffee.

395
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,490
You didn't fire me!

396
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,250
I fired you!

397
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,830
Don't be angry. Try the shrimp.

398
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,080
Cheer up.

399
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,710
Thank you.

400
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,700
Come on, cheers!

401
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,110
Cheer up!

402
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,560
You told me anti-motivational
quotes every day

403
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,100
and yet you did
an entirely different thing.

404
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,220
It was just a spur of the moment.

405
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,460
I really want to know
what Mr. Liu did to you

406
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,900
that made you explode in a fit of rage.

407
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,490
He didn't actually do anything bad.

408
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,350
He was just picking at his foot.

409
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,590
What?

410
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:55,310
He was picking at his foot
while reading my manuscript.

411
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,390
And I recalled what you said to me.

412
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,550
You have nothing to fear!

413
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:01,200
Lu Yi Yi, you're a thinker
and you're talented!

414
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,710
You can get a job anywhere!

415
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,540
Then, I got riled up and told him

416
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,640
not to touch my manuscript
with his hands after picking at his foot.

417
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,590
What are you laughing at?

418
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,520
You're so cool. I mean it.

419
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,640
Cool? I lost my job.

420
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:30,720
What about you?

421
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,260
Ever since you came back from Vancouver,
Mr. Liu never let you do a live interview.

422
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,750
You're not willing to sing and dance.

423
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,740
And your personal column
isn't doing well either.

424
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,090
But if you want to go professional,

425
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,710
it's not something you can
achieve in a month or two, is it?

426
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:48,530
Nowadays, you have to stir up rumors
if you want to be popular.

427
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,720
What do you mean?

428
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,990
Stir up rumors?

429
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,690
I have an idea!

430
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:03,010
Didn't you say your necklace
was broken by Ji Xiang Kong?

431
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,980
Don't talk to me about him.

432
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,250
And he said he'll grant you
anything you ask for, right?

433
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,200
Am I remembering this correctly?

434
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:10,540
So?

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,620
Take advantage of his popularity!

436
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,860
Tell him to do something
that will give you publicity.

437
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,280
Something like this,
a handsome esports player

438
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,370
accepted the invitation of
a beautiful host at two in the morning.

439
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,660
Stop!

440
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,260
That's such a bad idea!

441
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,730
Can you be more reliable?

442
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,620
What's so bad about that?

443
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:33,990
How about this?

444
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,570
Ask him to play
a duo-player match with you.

445
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,430
And I'll ask my friend to tweet about it.

446
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,370
The title of the article will be

447
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,560
Famous Professional Esports Player

448
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,580
Joins Hands with Beautiful Female Host.

449
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,750
I promise it'll open a way for you
to be popular among iConquer's fans.

450
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,900
What do you say?

451
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,500
Yi Yi, I really don't want to have
anything to do with him.

452
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,790
Besides, this sounds like a bargain.

453
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:06,590
I don't like the idea.

454
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,870
Come on, he was the one at fault, not you.

455
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,000
Besides, do you have
a better idea than this?

456
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,200
Don't forget that you have to
pay your mortgage payment every month.

457
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,690
Do I have any other options?

458
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,160
Chairman Jin, this is Pei Xi from VNG,
the player I told you about earlier.

459
00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:47,960
[Pei Xi]

460
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,130
He's the biggest dark horse
in the esports tournament this year.

461
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:54,590
He's currently the best mid laner
in the world.

462
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:00,690
I've also learned that his contract
with VNG is coming to an end.

463
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:07,500
If we can sign him over, we'll definitely
win the Vancouver championship next year.

464
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,700
Legends should welcome
such a gifted person with open arms.

465
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,670
So Manager Zhao is suggesting
to sign Pei Xi over

466
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:23,300
and take over Gu Fang's
position as a mid laner?

467
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,580
No.

468
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,440
I want him to be the captain.

469
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,130
Captain?

470
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,890
He was taught by Shu Wen.

471
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:39,050
How can they possibly
let him change teams?

472
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,650
Besides, I'd examined Pei Xi before.

473
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,860
His hand speed and strategies
are indeed top-notch.

474
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,640
But have you ever wondered
why VNG only came in fourth this year?

475
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,940
Because Pei Xi is the only
good player in VNG.

476
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,730
It's not that VNG is bad,

477
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,970
it's just that Pei Xi is too autocratic.

478
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,240
The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.

479
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,110
His personality is definitely
not a right fit for leadership!

480
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,410
Why are you yelling?

481
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,180
The audience like to
see Pei Xi play this way.

482
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,470
It's entertaining!

483
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:14,530
And it's epic!

484
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:19,420
No one likes to see
your complicated and esoteric tactic.

485
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,910
You...

486
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,260
My mouth is so dry.

487
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,470
The two of you always fight
when you see each other.

488
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:34,770
You never stop fighting.

489
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:39,980
What do you think, Luo?

490
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,450
I admit that Pei Xi is talented.

491
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,920
But he's definitely
not the right fit for captain!

492
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,970
On top of that, the signing fee
is so expensive.

493
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,920
Can we even afford it?

494
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,290
It's none of your business.

495
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:57,070
Why do you care?

496
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,570
So what if the signing fee is high?

497
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,990
Look how many fans he has.

498
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,220
He can attract a lot of investment.

499
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,210
Do you know how many sponsors
are waiting to sign him up?

500
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,400
Chairman Jin, ever since Gu Fang left,

501
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,340
we don't have any presentable
star players on our team.

502
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:24,490
It's very hard to get
an endorsement for next year.

503
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,310
I'm under a lot of pressure as well.

504
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:40,230
Zhao Yang, why don't you
try to talk to Pei Xi first?

505
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,720
Sure, no problem.

506
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,170
How many companies have I gone to?

507
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:59,600
I don't believe I won't be able to
make it after I left You Xing Company!

508
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,310
-Hello!
-[Hello, is this Miss Lu?]

509
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,000
Listen, I won't buy a house or a car!

510
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,780
I won't take out a loan either!
Leave me alone!

511
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:10,280
[Wait, we're calling from
Dynamic Esports Magazine.]

512
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,639
[You've passed
the first round of resume screening.]

513
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,389
Wait a second.

514
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,300
Dynamic Esports Magazine?

515
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:16,969
Please hold the line.

516
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,159
I'll be right there!

517
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:23,560
What should I say?

518
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:29,520
Hey, Ji Xiang Kong!

519
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:32,290
Didn't you say you will
grant me anything I ask for?

520
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,850
No, that's too harsh.

521
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,300
Ji Xiang Kong, could you please
do me a little favor?

522
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,980
No, that's too soft.

523
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,219
I guess I'll wing it.

524
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,720
Forget it.

525
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,550
This isn't right.

526
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,240
He broke my necklace
and he didn't apologize to me.

527
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:17,390
Who does he think he is?

528
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,320
He talked all sorts of nonsense to me.

529
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,720
Why should I forgive him?

530
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,100
This won't do.
