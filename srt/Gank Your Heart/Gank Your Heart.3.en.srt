[Episode 3]

4
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,560
You finally got the first place after
playing iConquer for so many years.

5
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,190
That's not easy. Congratulations.

6
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:44,530
Loser.

7
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,650
If we are losers just because
we lost once,

8
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,640
it means that you've been losers
for many years.

9
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,860
We will still be the champion next year.

10
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,009
Where is Gu Fang?

11
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,670
Is he crying in his bed?

12
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,800
-Watch your words.
-Calm down.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,860
He used to be very powerful
when he used the Holy Princess, right?

14
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,910
Why has he become

15
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,729
so useless now?

16
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,130
Who are you talking about?

17
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,370
Ji Xiang Kong is hitting someone?

18
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,960
And that person is Jeffery?

19
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:20,440
Hey, Jeffery. Stop.

20
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,500
Stop!

21
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,750
Get on the bus. All of you.

22
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,110
What are you doing?

23
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,390
Don't cause trouble abroad!
Get into the car!

24
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,760
-Sister Xin
-Sister Xin.

25
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,950
Your review of the International
iConquer Championship is fantastic.

26
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,630
You are indeed You Xing Video's best host.
Don't you all think so?

27
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,020
Yes!

28
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,560
Without your support,

29
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,870
I would never be where I am today.

30
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,500
How about I treat all of you to
some coffee next time?

31
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,330
Sure! Thank you, Sister Xin!

32
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,579
Go back to your work.

33
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,810
She is really the number-one glib talker.

34
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,170
Not bad.

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,750
Top real-time news.

36
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,300
-Mr. Liu.
-Come, Qiao Xin. Have a seat.

37
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,130
It's so late already, Mr. Liu?
Why are you still here?

38
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,690
-Stop doing this.
-You should take care of your health.

39
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,220
Sit down first. Come on.

40
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,640
I shouldn't let you do these.

41
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:03,480
Lately, our iConquer got a head start
because of your effort.

42
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,670
The future iConquer will play a vital part
in our company's transition.

43
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,870
-You have to work harder.
-Don't worry.

44
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,850
The click rate of my show
is always the first among the others.

45
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,740
But I am not that lucky.

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,790
The opportunity to interview the game
in Vancouver was decided by drawing lots.

47
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,420
Such a good opportunity. But I missed it.

48
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,820
Many people were transferred here
from the Lifestyle Programme.

49
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,780
Our boss wants to be fair.

50
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,850
So, he decided to draw lots.
I can't possibly say no, right?

51
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,810
Qiu Ying is not as professional
or experienced as you.

52
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,830
If possible, give her a hand.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,150
But she has surprised me.

54
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,560
She just sent me a video.

55
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,740
After the competition,
the Legends and Tatan got into a fight.

56
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,159
It became a hot topic as soon as
it was uploaded.

57
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,130
It's now the top real-time news.

58
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,840
IConquer of You Xing is still new.

59
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,260
We are no match for GDV.

60
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,100
So, we can only compete by making
more attractive content.

61
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,740
Qiao Xin, I've watched you grow.

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,060
I have high expectation in you.

63
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,190
GDV has a top commentator like Luo Tian.

64
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,350
I hope that you can be
You Xing Video's Luo Tian.

65
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:17,360
I won't let you down.

66
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,500
You are indeed Qiao Xin.

67
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,180
I didn't choose the wrong person.

68
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,940
Let me admire
this top real-time news again.

69
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,150
Congratulations, Ji Xiang Kong.

70
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,980
You are a hot topic again.

71
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,560
That's common, right?

72
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,960
Common?

73
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,650
Someone took a video of you fighting with
Jeffery and uploaded it online. Look.

74
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,240
Who did that?

75
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:55,760
It's so immoral to post it online.

76
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,720
It's posted by Qiu Ying

77
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,530
from You Xing Video.
Do you know her?

78
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,530
Pray that Manager Zhao
can handle this public relations crisis.

79
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,430
Or else,

80
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,870
all of you will be punished.

81
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,090
Why can't I

82
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,220
reach Ji Xiang Kong?

83
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,840
-His phone is always off.
-Qiu Ying!

84
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,610
-Yan Yan.
-Welcome back, our major contributor!

Do you know that your click rate

86
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,850
rose to the top at once as soon as
your video was uploaded last night?

87
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,580
Top.

88
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,630
-I surpassed Qiao Xin?
-Yes.

89
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,620
You've caused a stir in our company.

90
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,940
Mr. Liu is so happy.

91
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,750
Go and find him. He's waiting for you.

92
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:56,580
Okay. I'll go up now.

93
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,970
Where are you going?

94
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,900
I am going out to buy some drinks.

95
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,590
What do you want to drink?
I can buy it for you.

96
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,030
Did Qiao Xin ask you to
buy coffee for her again?

97
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:14,000
We are all colleagues.
I'm just helping her out.

98
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,450
Yan Yan.

99
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,950
You can't be so weak.
Let me teach you a solution.

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,070
Then, she will never ask you
to buy coffee for her again.

101
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:39,630
Let's go.

102
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:54,370
Wait.

103
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,230
Why isn't anybody here?
Don't they have to work today?

104
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,490
Aren't they supposed to
welcome us with flowers?

105
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,570
No matter what,
we are the second-best, globally.

106
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,440
Nobody cares about the runner-up.

107
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,270
-So realistic?
-The society is realistic.

108
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,770
All of you must be tired.
Unpack your bags and rest.

109
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,090
So where should we
put the trophy, Coach?

110
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,050
-Put it on the display area.
-Okay.

111
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,970
Bye, Coach.

112
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,100
I am going out. Help me keep my luggage.

113
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,370
Do not enter my room.

114
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,460
If you mess up my room again,
you'll sleep in the training room.

115
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,650
We lived together in harmony before this.

116
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,179
We'll talk about harmony after
you clean up your pig pen.

117
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,299
You also live in the...

118
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,350
Let's go.

119
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,600
Let's go.

120
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,020
You are back, Qiu Ying.

121
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,600
-That was great, congratulations!
-Thank you.

122
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,480
-Qiu Ying!
-Yi Yi!

123
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,170
Yi Yi!

124
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,070
You are amazing!
You are number one on the internet now!

125
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,760
Thanks to you.

126
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,890
What do you think? Isn't Qiu Ying great?

127
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,620
-Qiu Ying is back.
-Mr. Liu.

128
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:13,370
You did fantastic this time.

129
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,360
Come on.
Applause for her as encouragement.

130
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,480
Thank you, Mr. Liu. Thank you, everyone.

131
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,230
You've done well. Come.

132
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,990
-Let's have a chat about your achievement.
-Okay.

133
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
I'll go back to my work.
See you at home.

134
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,680
-Wait for me.
-All the best.

135
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,780
-[Hello?]
-Hi, Manager Zhao.

136
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:41,330
Xiao Xin Xin.

137
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,630
I want to ask about the fight
of your team members

138
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,670
in the parking lot.

139
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,440
You must be tired

140
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,050
after coming back from Canada.

141
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,870
I'm fine. It's my job.

142
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,740
Besides, I've made
many mistakes on this trip.

143
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,680
I am here to apologise.

144
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,850
No need to apologise. You did really well.

145
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,820
This is your first interview.
Everyone has witnessed your effort.

146
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,480
What you did was perfect.

147
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,280
Thank you, Mr. Liu. I'll keep it up.

148
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,880
All the best.

149
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,630
By the way,

150
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,080
Will the fighting video between
Legends and Tatan that I took

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,790
bring any troubles to our company?

152
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,590
Of course not.

153
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,410
You were just reporting the truth.

154
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,950
You didn't exaggerate it.

155
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:29,050
The Legends will not fault us for it.

156
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,070
-That's good.
-Don't worry.

157
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,880
-Hello.
-I am Zhao Yang from Legends.

158
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,960
Manager Zhao. Hello.

159
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,650
[Let me ask you.
Is Qiu Ying working for your company?]

160
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,240
Yes. She is.

161
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,940
I'm sure you know about
the video that she uploaded.

162
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,320
Qiu Ying hasn't come back yet.
What should I do?

163
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,160
I'll ask her about it when
she comes back, okay?

164
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,940
I don't want to hear this.
You better take care of this properly.

165
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,610
-Or else, I'll sue you. Understand?
-Wait, Manager Zhao.

166
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,890
Calm down. Don't be mad.

167
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,810
Boss Liu, have I caused trouble
to the company?

168
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,140
He said that the video has
affected them badly.

169
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,640
So, they will not accept
our interview anymore.

170
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,230
I'll explain and apologise to them then.

171
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,120
-Maybe we can solve this peacefully.
-You don't have to worry about this.

172
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:28,220
Leave this to the company.

173
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,200
I remember that Qiao Xin
is quite close to Manager Zhao.

174
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,640
Leave this to her.

175
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:37,620
As for the top real-time news,

176
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,390
the company should give you a bonus.

177
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:44,210
But now, we are in a transition period.
It's very stressful.

178
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,400
Maybe we'll have to delay your bonus.

179
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:53,460
[The King]

180
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,560
If Ji Xiang Kong had arrived early,
it wouldn't turn out to be like this.

181
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,820
He is famous for being useless.
What can they do?

182
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,800
Boss, do you have
free instant noodles today?

183
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,510
You are the international runner-up
and you still want free instant noodles?

184
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,050
-Boss, the computer crashed.
-Coming.

185
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:40,990
Wait for me on the second floor,
Xiang Kong.

186
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,010
Qiu Ying, I bought the coffee.

187
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,690
What about you?
What did Mr. Liu reward you with?

188
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,730
I didn't receive any reward.

189
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:06,030
If we can't settle this well,

190
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,620
I might have to compensate the company.

191
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,190
Why?

192
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,210
In the future, don't simply take a video.

193
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,890
Don't think that you can broadcast
a video just because it looks interesting.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,240
Or else, you may
bring trouble to our company.

195
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,490
Okay. We got it.

196
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,840
Yan Yan.

197
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,160
What took you so long
to buy a coffee for me?

198
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,900
Here you go.

199
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,860
I want coffee without ice.
Why did you buy me hot coffee?

200
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,820
I forgot.

201
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,670
What is this? Why does it taste so bad?

202
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,320
This is a new drink in the cafe

203
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,510
called sea-salt-butter-beer coffee.

204
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,520
I thought that you'll like it.
So, I bought one for you.

205
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,570
Are you sure this is for human?

206
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,320
You can't even do
such a minor thing properly.

207
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,940
You've enraged Sister Xin.

208
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,040
She still has to host a show later.

209
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,850
Right, Sister Xin?

210
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,050
I'm sorry, Sister Xin.

211
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:24,290
I'll make sure to buy you
the coffee you like after this.

212
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,090
I won't keep you from hosting your show.

213
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm sorry, Sister Xin.

214
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,720
I don't need you to buy coffee
for me anymore, understand?

215
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,000
So stupid.

216
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:37,700
Why is she so stupid?

217
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,230
She said that I don't need to
buy coffee for her anymore.

218
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,840
That's right.

219
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,890
How is Gu Fang doing?

220
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,720
Why didn't you ask about me?

221
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,850
You are used to the hate comments, right?

222
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,370
Why didn't you change the strategy?
Gu Fang was obviously not doing well.

223
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,090
I had suggested switching the position
of Brother Yao and the captain.

224
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,260
But Zhao Yang and Coach Luo
didn't agree with it.

225
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,270
That was a great idea.

226
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,210
If Huo Yao became the Mid,
he could control Jeffery.

227
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,070
You would have an 80% winning rate.

228
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,040
Gu Fang disagreed with it?

229
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,360
I didn't tell him about it.

230
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,570
He is almost 30.

231
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,290
He doesn't have much time left
in e-sports anymore.

232
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,680
If Gu Fang retires,

233
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,510
what are you going to do?

234
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,960
I have never thought about it.

235
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,360
But to be honest,

236
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,610
I can only stay in Legends because of him.

237
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,590
You have to remember

238
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,050
what you said when you were
taken away by him from me.

239
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,340
How can I forget it?

240
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,080
It's my dream to win the championship.

241
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,800
You will keep going

242
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,860
with Gu Fang's and my dream.

243
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,590
Brother Sun, if you say that,
I'll feel pressured.

244
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,190
Are you afraid? Do you want to give up?

245
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,340
I heard that Manager Zhao
doesn't like you very much.

246
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,190
I don't care about him.

247
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
He only cares about money.

248
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,860
He keeps on arranging commercial events
for us one after another.

249
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,470
When the captain is there,
he doesn't dare to do anything.

250
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,380
If the captain retires,

251
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,340
I have no idea what will happen.

252
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,280
Come, Anchorwoman Qiu.

253
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,190
Congratulations,
you are famous from just one game.

254
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,790
Don't laugh at me, Editor Lu.

255
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,849
You got it right.

256
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:10,890
After an unplanned trip,

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,550
what awaits me is just poverty.

258
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,240
It's okay. I didn't ask you
to pay me back, right?

259
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:21,010
There's no rush to pay me back.

260
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,440
Take your time.

261
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,069
You are the best.

262
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:28,220
Of course. Because I love you the most.

263
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,060
Enough. Let's eat.

264
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:34,720
-Eat more. You are too thin.
-I'm so hungry.

265
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,290
-It tastes so good.
-Right?

266
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,520
By the way,

267
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,620
on the day you went to Vancouver,

268
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,960
the company's car

269
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,940
went to the train station out of the blue.

270
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,830
What do you think happened?

271
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,280
It's obvious. It must be Qiao Xin's plot.

272
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,250
Why doesn't Qiao Xin

273
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,410
put her energy into work?

274
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,090
She always plots to jeopardise others.
So despicable.

275
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,750
Forget it. I'm not in the mood
to think about her.

276
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,330
Yes, let's not talk about her.

277
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,120
Do you know, Yi Yi?

278
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,270
This trip to Vancouver
has really affected me emotionally.

279
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,220
When Legends lost the competition,

280
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,120
many of their fans were crying.

281
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,380
I almost cried too.

282
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,810
Although I didn't understand
most of the competition.

283
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,940
-Why did you want to cry then?
-I was touched.

284
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,680
After that, I followed the Legends
to the bar.

285
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,870
I saw Gu Fang drinking in the corner.

286
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,410
Then, he talked to Ji Xiang Kong.

287
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:39,470
I suddenly understood that

288
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,080
it was not just a competition for many.

289
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,960
It was their dream.

290
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,610
I know. You are someone with a dream too.

291
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
So, when you saw others
chasing after their dream,

292
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,190
you couldn't help but to
resonate with them, right?

293
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,820
I really admire them actually.

294
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,670
They gave up everything for their dream.

295
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,080
And they could cry when they failed.

296
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,310
Unlike me.

297
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,790
Since my father married that woman,

298
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
my biggest dream

299
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,630
is to have my own home.

300
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,430
So, I tried my best to
earn money and work hard.

301
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,600
I spent all my savings
on the down payment of this house.

302
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,790
This house

303
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,510
is a promise to my mum.

304
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,550
Therefore, no matter what,

305
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,730
I'll keep this job in You Xing Video.

306
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:43,780
Anyway, Yi Yi.

307
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,260
Suddenly, I have a new idea.

308
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,990
Since I've chosen this career

309
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,990
and was transferred to iConquer,

310
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm going to become
a skillful and professional host.

311
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,740
It's good to have dream.

312
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,480
But I have to remind you.

313
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,160
There are many huge traps waiting for you
on your way to your dream.

314
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,150
Even if there are no huge traps,
many things

315
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,790
are different from expectation.

316
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,300
Forget it. Let's not talk about this.

317
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,260
Let me get us some fruits.

318
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,030
Who are you calling?

319
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,730
That despicable Ji Xiang Kong
from Legends.

320
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,830
I've been calling him and texting him
since Vancouver.

321
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,700
But he didn't respond to any of them.

322
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,060
Wait, did you say Ji Xiang Kong?

323
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,920
What? What happened?
How did you get his contact number?

324
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,880
He took my mother's necklace.

325
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,270
From now on,
I will call him every half an hour.

326
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:57,840
If he still doesn't respond by
tomorrow morning, I'll go to the Legends.

327
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,480
I have to take my necklace back.

328
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,930
How did your necklace
get into his possession?

329
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,160
It is a long story.

330
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,370
Get off.

331
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,750
-You kick me?
-Why are you sleeping here?

332
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,370
And put your feet on my pillow.

333
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,740
Is this your room?

334
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:54,490
Wait.

335
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,290
Your phone kept ringing last night.

336
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,740
I came here to take a look
and fell asleep.

337
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,390
It's okay. Don't be afraid. Keep sleeping.

338
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,600
-Go back to your room.
-No, don't touch me.

339
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,480
I'm going to continue dreaming about
getting the prize.

340
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:09,420
-Don't touch me.
-Getting the prize?

341
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,180
If you don't go back,
you'll sleep in the training room.

342
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,950
Don't be so fierce.

343
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,330
-Are you going to go back or not?
-Fine. I'll leave.

344
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,450
-Come back! Wash my pillow.
-What is it again?

345
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,620
So persistent.

346
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,390
How many times has she called?

347
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,140
This is the place.

348
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,120
Hello, who are you looking for?

349
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,200
Hi. I am looking for Ji Xiang Kong.

350
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,150
Do you have any appointment?

351
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,040
No.

352
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:04,010
You must be his fan. You are not allowed
to go in without an appointment.

353
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,770
Is he here today?

354
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,630
I don't know.
Maybe you can wait for him outside.

355
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,510
Okay, thank you.

356
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,800
Qiu Ying?

357
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,600
You are...

358
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,420
I am Lin Yi Xuan.

359
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,390
I am the first player of the Legends.

360
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,450
I know. I watched your game.
It was wonderful.

361
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,720
Really?

362
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:40,630
-I've watched your live broadcast too.
-Really? What a coincidence.

363
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,960
I really like the video
where you ate worms.

364
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,940
It was wonderful too when
you didn't get first place.

365
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,180
Are you here to apologise?

366
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,100
Do you know how badly you've hurt

367
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,700
Brother Kong by uploading
the video of him and Jeffery?

368
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:02,830
Yes.

369
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,890
That's why I'm here to apologise.

370
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,910
I think it's more sincere
to apologise in person. So, here I am.

371
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,270
Could you please take me
to see Ji Xiang Kong?

372
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,620
Sure.

373
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,330
But do you dare?

374
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,750
Of course. Thank you, Brother Xuan.

375
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,320
You are welcome. Let's go.

376
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,710
-This place is very huge.
-Of course. Let's use the shortcut.

377
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,670
This is one of my favourite heroes.

378
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,270
Hey!

379
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,190
-Brother Xuan.
-Brother Bao, all the best.

380
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,630
-Hi, Brother Xuan.
-Stop playing. You are too noisy.

381
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,420
-Give me a bottle of water, Yi Bo.
-It's okay.

382
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,290
Pass me the bag.
It's not for you. Come on. Give it to me.

383
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,270
Let's go.

384
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,680
Zi Xuan, Xiao Yu, do your work.

385
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,750
Don't gossiping.

386
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,820
Stop playing game here all the time.

387
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,850
-Go back to your workstation.
-Okay.

388
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:58,020
You are really authoritative.

389
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,810
I've restrained myself a lot.

390
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:03,800
This is the history of our team.

391
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,050
Every time I pass by here,

392
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,660
I'll be so touched.

393
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,670
I don't see you here.

394
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:15,170
Take a closer look.

395
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,750
These are our trophies.

396
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,930
Half of these are mine.

397
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,900
But this is only a small part.
Others are stored in the warehouse.

398
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,480
I know that one. It's the trophy of
the game where you got second place.

399
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,100
I saw you holding the trophy
with your two hands.

400
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,450
I was so touched.

401
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,510
This is the greatest place for Legends.

402
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,090
This is our war room.

403
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,750
-It looks amazing.
-Of course.

404
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,250
All of our equipment
are the best in the world.

405
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,940
They are our little brothers in training.

406
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,140
They are doing basic training.

407
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,540
Professional gamers need to do
basic training too?

408
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,540
Of course. Basketball players
need to practice ball handling too.

409
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,210
Ding Guan Sen. You are working too hard.
You have to get some rest, okay?

410
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,450
Take care of yourself.

411
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,130
Show me your spirit.
Let's hear the slogan.

412
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,420
Come on.

413
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,210
Legends!

414
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,310
Legends!

415
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,420
Never give up.

416
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,370
They are so enthusiastic.

417
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,430
We are almost done with the tour.

418
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,020
This is the fitness room.

419
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,270
We just had to take the stairs right?

420
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,190
Why did you drag me all over the places?
Are you playing me?

421
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,690
No. Hurry up and go in. Brother Kong
has been training there for a while.

422
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:41,720
Let me tell you.
Brother Kong is a very nice person.

423
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,880
Just beg him slightly

424
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,400
and he'll forgive you.

425
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,800
He must be thirsty.

426
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,010
Give this to him.

427
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,800
Melt his heart.

428
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,070
[He has played me so many times.]

429
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,470
[Why should I beg him?]

430
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,060
Thank you.

431
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,720
It's rude to come in
without knocking on the door first.

432
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,570
-Why are you here?
-I...

433
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,750
What am I here?

434
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,650
What are you doing?

435
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,390
You are here to find me
but you are standing so far away.

436
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,590
Don't you feel tired
to have to speak so loudly?

437
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:40,070
Please put on your clothes
before you talk to me.

438
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,170
-I am wearing my clothes.
-You...

439
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,830
You called me 50 times yesterday.

440
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,340
And you came here today.

441
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,750
What do you want?

442
00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,930
I'm sorry for uploading the video of
your fight and causing you troubles.

443
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:04,120
And I filmed your conversation with
Gu Fang without permission.

444
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,910
You are a gentleman.
Can you please forgive me?

445
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,890
Another thing.

446
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,670
Give me back my necklace.

447
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:17,440
So, you apologised because
you want your necklace back.

448
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,520
Don't go.

449
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,700
What are you doing? Wait.

450
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:25,990
I am so sweaty. Can't you let me
take a bath first before talking to you?

451
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,250
Fine. Go.

452
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:33,920
Do not run away.

453
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:37,840
Fine. I won't run.
I'll see you later at the cafe next door.

454
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,730
What are you wearing?

455
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,160
Here.

456
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:00,050
Put on this pink Romeo.

457
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,300
I assure you that
you'll be able to win her heart.

458
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,790
Win her heart? I have taste.

459
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,010
Keep acting then.

460
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,510
She even came here for you.
I know what happened.

461
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,480
You even got her a present. So attentive.

462
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,670
-I didn't prepare any present for her.
-Keep acting.

463
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:20,900
Yes. Go ahead and find it.
You can't find it, right?

464
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,090
Don't waste your time.

465
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,580
It's here.

466
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,400
-Give it to me!
-Wait.

467
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,110
Tell me first.
How intimate have you gotten with her?

468
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,210
What are you talking about?
I have to return it to her. Give it back.

469
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,270
I've seen this necklace in Canada.
But you are still...

470
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:39,340
-Stop talking nonsense. Give it to me.
-Stop. Be careful.

471
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,460
It's so fragile.

472
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,400
Brother Kong?

473
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,640
Am I in trouble?

474
00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:52,140
What do you think?

475
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,310
-Get out!
-Okay.

476
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,150
-Why am I feeling so shy?
-Here is your coffee.

477
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,760
So useless.

478
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,770
Are you anxious?

479
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:51,500
First, you left your necklace in the car.
And then, you gave me your phone number.

480
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,630
If this is in a drama,

481
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,000
it'll be the beginning of
a beautiful love story.

482
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,500
A great plot.

483
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,670
Ji Xiang Kong, do you think that I left
my necklace in your car deliberately?

484
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:08,980
Fine.

485
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,360
I admit that I lied to you that day.

486
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,260
I approached you on purpose.

487
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,300
But I am not so unscrupulous
to leave my necklace in your car.

488
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,920
I am here today
to get back my necklace.

489
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,070
Give it back to me.

490
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,040
Thank you.

491
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,740
Why is it broken?
