Preliminary Round, Begin To Answer]

00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,060
Qiu Ying.

6
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,350
You have to score a thousand points

7
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,620
in an hour for
the Rising Star online preliminary round.

8
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,950
Time is tight. You won't even have time
to search for answers.

9
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,560
Plus, one wrong answer,
and you'll have to start over.

10
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,550
You sure you've got this?

11
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,750
I have to fake it anyhow.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,350
Let's do this then.

13
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:04,530
Alright.

14
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:06,510
Are you ready?

15
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,070
-I've got this.
-Relax.

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,970
-You've got this.
-All set.

17
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,490
I choose A.

18
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,760
It's correct!

19
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,470
-Hurry up.
-D.

20
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,560
Correct again!

21
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,750
I choose C.

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,870
Quick. Hurry up!

23
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,490
B, C. I choose B.

24
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,110
-I choose D.
-That's right!

25
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,170
You rock!

26
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,340
Correct again!

27
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,950
Choose C. Choose A.

28
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,180
-Yes!
-Choose C.

29
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,370
And A for this.

30
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,490
You're doing great!

31
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,140

00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,420
Three, two, one!

35
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:55,710
I choose C.

36
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,890
You did it!

37
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,570
You're amazing!

38
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,620
Let's see what are the rules
for the preliminary round.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,060
[Congratulations on passing
the preliminary round to the semifinals]

40
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,270
Let me see. Those who passed
will be put into groups of five

41
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,160
to answer questions.

42
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,850
Only the top scorer
gets to the next round.

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,770
It's a cakewalk for you.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,720
You even aced this test.

45
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,930
Just relax when you get there.
Don't worry.

46
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,420
You'll definitely pass.

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,390
But the questions will be harder
than the online test.

48
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,880
Be more confident.

49
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,550
Sure.

50
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,530
Time for a practice test.

51
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,600
Alright. I'll keep you company.

52
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,159
[You don't even bother
telling me that you've passed?]

53
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,210
[It's just the preliminary round.]

54
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,760
[You are so busy.
I didn't want to bother you.]

55
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,460
[I thought of celebrating with you.]

56
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,610
[But if that's the case, forget it then.]

57
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,850
Qiu Ying.

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,220
What are you expecting?

59
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,930
If not,

60
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,230
then why does your heart feel so empty?

61
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,500
No matter how busy I am,
there is always time for milk tea.

62
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,750
Ji Xiang Kong?

63
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,650
What are you doing here?

64
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,130
I was missing
the strawberry milk tea.

65
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,420
But I ended up running into
my ungrateful apprentice.

66
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,810
It's not like that.

67
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,060
The preliminary competition
is just around the corner.

68
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,600
I'm a little nervous.

69
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,240
So I stopped by to go over my notes.

70
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,640
You need to take care of yourself
even if you're busy.

71
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,400
You looked so worn out.

72
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,940
This is for you.

73
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,200
The Unifon facial mask
that girls are crazy about.

74
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,220
Thank you.

75
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,820
You're swotting up on the test.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,410
Can you memorize everything?

77
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,670
I'll give you a tip.

78
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,650
Sure. What's the tip?

79
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:31,650
The secret...

80
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,270
Wait.

81
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,680
Secret tricks should be kept a secret.

82
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,220
Forget it.

83
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,050
Oh, please. I know your little tricks.

84
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,800
The great captain of iConquer Legends,
Gu Fang, once said,

85
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,230
"No matter which hero
Ji Xiang Kong plays,"

86
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,700
"he forever sticks to four modes,"

87
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,800
"which are"

88
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,680
"pretend not to see,
pretend to miss a shot,"

89
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:00,340
"pretend to be trapped,
pretend there's someone behind."

90
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,900
"In short,"

91
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,360
-"he is a textbook example of a jerk."
-Go on.

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,170
Say that again and you'll be sorry.

93
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,030
-Go on.
-I'm sorry. My bad!

94
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,180
My bad.

95
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,020
Why are you staring at me?

96
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,230
Am I not allowed to?

97
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,180
Once you become a top commentator,

98
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,990
I can only watch you on the screen.

99
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,020
Stop teasing me.

100
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,630
It doesn't matter if I become
the top commentator or not.

101
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,330
If you want to see me,
I will come for sure.

102
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,010
You also said this before.

103
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
We are buddies.

104
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,570
Ji Xiang Kong.

105
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,160
Are you and VNG's coach,
Shu Wen, very close?

106
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,330
In fact, we've known each other
for many years.

107
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,350
But...

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,760
You have somewhere else to be?

109
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,520
Today is the preliminary round.

110
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:29,130
Then let me give you a lift.

111
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,670
Sure.

112
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,520
Thanks for the lift.

113
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,150
Drive safe on your way back.

114
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,450
I'll be off then.

115
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,530
Bye.

116
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,670
Wait.

117
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,190
Your hair got messy.

118
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,840
Just take it easy during the competition.

119
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,550
Good luck! I have faith in you.

120
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,070
I will do my best.

121
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,480
Bye bye.

122
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:18,910
You're fired up today.

123
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,540
You won't lose face losing to me.

124
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,560
We'll surely be this year's CUBA champion.

125
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,410
Xia Ling. Good job!

126
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,260
It's nothing. I just played like usual.

127
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,450
How did it go? Are the results out yet?

128
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,300
Right on time. Look.

129
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,430
My sister entered the finals.

130
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,400
-Sweet.
-Xia Ling.

131
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,160
- Ask your sister for tickets.
-Exactly.

132
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,670
-We'll go cheer on her.
-Two tickets for each of you.

133
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,080
That's a deal.

134
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,920
-Come on.
-Let's go.

135
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,000
Hello, Sister Xin.

136
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,100
Qiu Ying.

137
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,140
Congratulations on entering
the Rising Star finals.

138
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,850
I won't feel bored with you there.

139
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,150
I'm also glad to finally
get to compete with you fair and square.

140
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:22,860
But I heard that you can only win
through true ability this time.

141
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,780
No playing dirty.

142
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,680
Speaking of which,
I'm actually quite worried for you.

143
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,330
But it's fine. Keep it up.

144
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:32,810
I have faith in you.

145
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,190
[I've sent you the test questions.
You'll definitely win.]

146
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,780
Alright, Mr. Can. I got it.

147
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:48,880
Thank you so much!

148
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,750
Want to compete with me?

149
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,680
Lu Feng!

150
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,510
Lu Feng!

151
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,030
Lu Feng!

152
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:10,670
It's my unlucky day.

153
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,930
This doesn't count.

154
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,610
What doesn't count?

155
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,250
You didn't win.

156
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,400
I was already running for a while.

157
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,610
I wasn't trying to outrun you.

158
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,890
You weren't?

159
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,620
Then why did you speed up when I did?

160
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,700
I usually run at that speed.

161
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,250
You were the one who sped up.

162
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,340
You're so annoying.

163
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,810
Let me ask you something.

164
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,170
Why did Huo Yao miss an attack
during the closed beta test?

165
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
If it wasn't for Zhao Yang playing dirty

166
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:20,650
to force Huo Yao
because he wanted you to win,

167
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,660
Brother Kong wouldn't get kicked out
due to the closed beta test.

168
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,260
So everything

169
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,600
was conspired by Zhao Yang?

170
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,470
Do you really not know
or are you playing dumb?

171
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,660
I'm telling you.

172
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,660
As long as you are here,
I'll make sure you suffer.

173
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,060
So this is why you hate me?

174
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:52,060
Should I have liked you instead?

175
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,340
Nutcase.

176
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,810
Wait. Where have you been?

177
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,060
Wang Bin and Zhao Yang
are clearing up Handsome Ji's stuff.

178
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,000
I heard they're even planning
to throw out his trophies.

179
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,960
Are they spoiling for a fight?

180
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,280
Oh no!

181
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,780
Throw all of these out.

182
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,070
This one. This, and this.

183
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,210
Okay.

184
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,350
Especially this photo. This one.

185
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,410
What are you doing?

186
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,030
Don't bother him. Carry on.

187
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,170
What's your problem?

188
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,500
Who said you could touch
Brother Kong's things?

189
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,410
He's gone.
These things are just taking up space.

190
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,970
Lin Yi Xuan.
This is the company's decision.

191
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:01,830
Hands off.

192
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,640
I dare you to lay hands on them.

193
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,700
Lin Yi Xuan.

194
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,350
I'm just asking Wang Bin
to throw out some trash.

195
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,420
Aren't you overreacting?

196
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,570
Wang Bin. Carry on.

197
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,690
Stop it! I'm calling the police.

198
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,010
I'm calling the police!

199
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,700
Do you hear me? What are you doing?

200
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,320
-You're a nutcase!
-What are you doing?

201
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,170
I dare you to speak ill of him again!

202
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,590
Pei Xi.

203
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,760
You are the captain.
Is this your teammate?

204
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,050
If he does this again,
I'll have him arrested!

205
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:36,020
Lin Yi Xuan. Calm down first.

206
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,720
Don't think I'm not aware
that you're with them.

207
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,240
You teamed up to get rid of Brother Kong.

208
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,620
Now you're even throwing out his stuff.

209
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,630
Zhao Yang. You big bully.
You've gone too far. You know that?

210
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,560
Lin Yi Xuan.

211
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,320
You don't know what's going on.

212
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,750
Don't jump to conclusions.

213
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,109
You.

214
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,300
You are benched for a year.

215
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,300
Go sit with the reserve team!

216
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,780
Mr. Zhao.

217
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,920
-I don't think that's necessary.
-Save your words!

218
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,369
So I'm a reserve player now?

219
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,599
Fine.

220
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,040
I'm telling you.

221
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,330
The last thing I need is a Support!

222
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,950
Pei Xi.

223
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,270
Pei Xi.

224
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,540
What are you doing?

225
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,320
I don't want these
to be thrown out as trash

226
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,520
when I leave Legends one day.

227
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,750
It's not like that.

228
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,070
Pei Xi.

229
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,020
Mr. Zhao.

230
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,780
They...

231
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,760
-They...
-Are you alright?

232
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,780
-Brother Nine.
-Another drink!

233
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,500
I haven't had enough.

234
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,950
This way. This way.

235
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,360
No. No.

236
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,730
My gosh!

237
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,170
Alright. I'm coming.

238
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,350
What's wrong with you?

239
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,350
Why did you call me over so late at night?

240
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,350
I have waited for you for an hour.

241
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,050
I was going to die if you showed up later.

242
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:01,930
Carry on.

243
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,650
You seem to be having quite a blast.

244
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,480
You won't be dying anytime soon.

245
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,350
Don't you have any compassion?

246
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,650
Look at me.

247
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,650
How could you be so sarcastic?

248
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,330
-You had a fight?
-It hurts!

249
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,810
Who beat you?

250
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,490
I'll avenge you.

251
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,070
"Beat me"?

252
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,680
Zhao Yang's assistant
threw out Brother Kong's trophies.

253
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,480
I made him get on his knees and say,

254
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,770
"Brother Xuan, please stop.
I'm begging you."

255
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,750
-"Please spare me."
-And then what?

256
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,260
Get to the point.

257
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,820
And then...

258
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,120
And then I got thrown into
the reserve team.

259
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,370
I won't get to compete this season.

260
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,470
-Are you stupid or what?
-It hurts!

261
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,170
You think I shouldn't have fought?

262
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,540
Well, duh.

263
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,170
Get me a drink.

264
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,270
You're hopeless. What an idiot.

265
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,990
You can get them back after that.

266
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,840
Now you're benched because of this.

267
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,120
-You're such an idiot!
-Ouch!

268
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,000
Why are you and Qiu Ying
being so loyal to him?

269
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,820
Did he bewitch you two?

270
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,320
You're acting like a fanboy all the time.

271
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,930
If it weren't for Brother Kong,

272
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,400
I'd still be bullied on the streets.

273
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:52,340
[I'm sorry. This meal is on me.
Please don't give me a bad review.]

274
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,340
[I don't care. That's your business.]

275
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,600
[You were late. That's a fact.]

276
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,660
[Do you expect me to eat this cold food?]

277
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,630
[You don't have to throw it.]

278
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,820
[Lost your job?]

279
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,650
[It's none of your business.]

280
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,640
[Remember the match
we had at The King two days ago?]

281
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,590
[If you lost, you'd call me big brother.]

282
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:49,200
[I did lose,
but why should I call you Brother Kong?]

283
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,730
[I can get you a job
that's a better fit for you. How's that?]

284
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,620
[I don't want to be a network manager.]

285
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,450
[No, not a network manager.]

286
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,050
[Do you want to be a pro gamer?]

287
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,140
[Heard of Legends?]

288
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,470
["Legends"?]

289
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:08,700
[Go spew nonsense somewhere else.
Leave me alone. I have to work.]

290
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:11,300
[Fine. I'm leaving then.]

291
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,070
[Wait a second.]

292
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,660
[Am I Brother Kong now?]

293
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,210
[Brother Kong, I am ready.]

294
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,570
[When does training start?]

295
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,100
Brother Kong.

296
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,790
A toast to you.

297
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,590
Let me see.

298
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,270
I never thought

299
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,460
this liar could be so loyal.

300
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:55,170
Here's a toast to you from me, Lu Yi Yi.

301
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,530
He is still alive.

302
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,510
How can you pour him a drink like this?

303
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,220
Then what about you toasting to a photo?
What does that mean?

304
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:12,370
Where's my phone? Where is it?

305
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,660
Here it is.

306
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,920
You stole my phone!

307
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,600
My dear Ying Ying is calling me.

308
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,120
Hello. Where are you?

309
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,090
Have you been drinking?

310
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:37,490
I haven't.

311
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,700
Why are you drinking? Don't drink so much.

312
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,730
Send me your location.
I'll come to get you.

313
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,620
Come over. Come drink with us.

314
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,660
-[Get up.]
-Wait for me. I'm coming over now.

315
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,870
Thank you.

316
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,770
Qiu Ying.

317
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,340
What are you doing here?

318
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:08,170
Lin Yi Xuan got drunk. I came to get him.

319
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,960
What about you?

320
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,250
I'm here to get Yi Yi. They're together.

321
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,330
I see.

322
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,620
I'm relieved then.

323
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,640
-Let's go then.
-Right.

324
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,770
How's your preparation for Rising Star?

325
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,740
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask me.

326
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,100
I'm just one call away.

327
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,320
[Qiu Ying. Wake up.]

328
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,470
[You're just a buddy to him.]

329
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,890
[He and his ex-girlfriend
are back together.]

330
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,050
[You must keep a distance from him.]

331
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,520
No. It's fine.

332
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,720
Aren't you preparing
for the next tournament?

333
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,590
I won't be bothering you.

334
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,990
Besides, there are many professionals
at Dream Traveler who can help me.

335
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,970
Why are you suddenly acting so distant?

336
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:55,650
Did I offend you?

337
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,880
Or you don't need me
as your teacher anymore?

338
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:00,210
It's not like that. Don't think too much.

339
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:01,880
I just don't want to bother you.

340
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,230
You are too heavy.

341
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,150
You can't outdrink me.

342
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,090
Lu Yi Yi, you can't outdrink me.

343
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,570
-How much on earth have you drank?
-Brother Kong.

344
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,440
-"Brother Kong"?
-A toast to you!

345
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:15,080
-That's my Brother Kong.
-Did you call me Brother Kong?

346
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,670
That's my Brother Kong.

347
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,470
-Why did you get so drunk?
-Qiu Ying.

348
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,470
-Why do you still have the microphone?
-Qiu Ying. You're here.

349
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes, I'm here. Why did you get so drunk?

350
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,330
You can't outdrink me, Lu Yi Yi.

351
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,100
-I'm telling you.
-Of course I can.

352
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:31,800
Reporter Lu.

353
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:34,930
If I'm not mistaken,
you just called me Brother Kong, did you?

354
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,610
I thought you saw me as a love rat.

355
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,600
"Love rat"?

356
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,770
Right.

357
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,570
You are a love rat.

358
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,510
Former sister-in-law.

359
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,550
You still flirt around
when you already have a girlfriend.

360
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,790
If you're not a love rat,
then what are you?

361
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,370
It's the drinks talking.

362
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,620
She's just babbling. She's too drunk.

363
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,030
I'm not drunk.

364
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,830
"Former sister-in-law"?

365
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,500
"Flirting around"?

366
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,170
Shu Wen.

367
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,820
Lin Yi Xuan told me everything.

368
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,290
Shu Wen is his former sister-in-law.

369
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,010
You're drunk.

370
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:12,150
Wait. What do you mean?

371
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,390
It doesn't mean anything. She's drunk.

372
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,770
I'm not drunk.

373
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,350
Shu Wen.

374
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,130
Ouch.

375
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:33,180
You spread online rumors of me
and Sister Wen, and even spiced it up.

376
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,790
You're going to get it from me, you punk.

377
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,470
No, you see.

378
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,320
Sister Wen is not only
his former sister-in-law,

379
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,190
but mine as well.

380
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,740
Sister Wen is my big brother,
Sun Ze Yi's, former girlfriend.

381
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,630
So you thought
those ridiculous rumors online were true?

382
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:59,010
I get it now.

383
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,520
No wonder you were acting so cold
towards me.

384
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,820
I wasn't.

385
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,740
Besides, the rumors sounded real.

386
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,640
It's hard for me to not believe them.

387
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,180
What if it was true?

388
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,670
So I needed to keep my distance.

389
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,730
Of all my rumored girlfriends,

390
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,720
the most believable one is you.

391
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,420
Good point.

392
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,190
Lu Yi Yi can't outdrink me.

393
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,220
Why are you so heavy?

394
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,430
Let's keep drinking.

395
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,420
Why did you get yourself so drunk?

396
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,700
Come on. Don't fall over.

397
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,890
I want another drink.

398
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,480
-What happened to your face?
-Don't touch me.

399
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,730
I'll fight you
if you touch Brother Kong's things again.

400
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,930
Fight who?

401
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,030
Xiang Kong.

402
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,620
Who is he talking about?

403
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,200
Well.

404
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,660
Coach Luo told me

405
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,960
that Zhao Yang and Wang Bin
wanted to throw out my trophies.

406
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:07,430
So he got angry and beat up Wang Bin.

407
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,160
He even ended up getting benched.

408
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,700
This punk.

409
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,360
That was bound to happen.

410
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,430
He's too hot tempered.

411
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,140
Exactly.

412
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,490
He still has two years of contract
with Legends. He can't leave.

413
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,400
Coach Luo asked me to talk to him,
but I found him being wasted.

414
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,160
I...

415
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:31,850
I've got a meeting tomorrow. This punk.

416
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:33,430
You should go then.

417
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,410
I'll talk to him when he wakes up.

418
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,620
Lu Yi Yi can't outdrink me.

419
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,920
Brother Sun. Sorry to leave him with you.

420
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,680
Don't worry about it. Go.

421
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,620
Don't go. Let's keep drinking.

422
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,150
Bye.

423
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,820
Don't go. Let's keep drinking.

424
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,850
Want some water? Are you thirsty?

425
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,970
Who is Lu Yi Yi?

426
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,920
Lu Yi Yi is so beautiful.

427
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,190
Put your hands inside.

428
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:04,300
Lin Yi Xuan. Let's keep drinking!

429
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,690
Alright. Go to sleep. Be good.

430
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,110
You can't outdrink me.

431
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,420
You are the best.

432
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,490
He can't outdrink me.

433
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,520
Let's keep drinking.

434
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,560
[Have you gotten home?]

435
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,480
[Yes.]

436
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:03,870
[Is Lin Yi Xuan alright?]

437
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,080
[He conked out. He's sleeping like a log.]

438
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,220
[By the way,
I forgot to congratulate you]

439
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:15,110
[on entering the Rising Star finals.]

440
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,120
[A great teacher
produces an accomplished student.]

441
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,960
[You're finally acting like normal again.]

442
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,970
[Rest up. Good night.]

443
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,670
[Good night.]

444
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,920
♫ I had no idea ♫

445
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,180
♫ I loved to smile so much ♫

446
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,530
♫ I want to keep your affection ♫

447
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,050
♫ That's only meant for me ♫

448
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,060
♫ But I also want to show it off
to the world ♫

449
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,270
Bunny.

450
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,520
Don't you know?

451
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,600
Ji Xiang Kong doesn't have a girlfriend.

452
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,200
He and Shu Wen aren't in a relationship.

453
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,720
Restrain yourself.

454
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,170
Do you know what that means?

455
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,430
What does that mean?

456
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,220
I have no idea.

457
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,790
Even if Shu Wen isn't his girlfriend,

458
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,950
that doesn't mean he likes you.

459
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,220
I think he likes me.

460
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,680
Otherwise,
why did he bother explaining to me?

461
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,940
What else could it be
if it wasn't because he likes me?

462
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,440
Am I right?

463
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,670
Go to sleep.

464
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,480
♫ All of a sudden ♫

465
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,870

467
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,550
Qiu Ying. Keep it up!

468
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,710
You must become the commentator of GDV.

469
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,890
We promised to climb to the top together.

470
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,970
Ji Xiang Kong.

471
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,650
You must wait for me.

472
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,990
I can definitely win
the Rising Star competition.

473
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,600
Keep it up.

474
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:03,890
Interesting.

475
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,040
What a pity. Such a waste.

476
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,340
Haven't slept yet?

477
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,000
I was just about to.

478
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:38,580
-Good night.
-Good night.

479
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,970
Okay. Good night.

480
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,830
That's a lot of food.

481
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,990
-Good morning, Captain.
-Good morning.

482
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:59,550
Are these breakfast
for Qi Yue and Shen Yue?

483
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,660
Do you want anything, Captain?

484
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,810
I'm good.

485
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,280
Tong Wu.

486
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:08,320
You finally get it.

487
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,679
Today's breakfast looks great.

488
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,600
Meat bun?

489
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,760
I don't like meat bun.

490
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,260
Buy vegetable bun next time.

491
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,239
There is no next time.

492
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:25,690
He won't have time
to prepare breakfast from now on.

493
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,980
He has to train with me for an extra hour.

494
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,620
Ji Xiang Kong.
You're doing this on purpose.

495
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:36,600
Qi Yue.

496
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,150
Do you know what people say about you?

497
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,940
What?

498
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,020
They say you bully newcomers as you wish
because you're Mr. Li's apprentice.

499
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,530
Who said that?

500
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,940
Tell them to come see me.

501
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,800
Brother Qi. Just let it go.

502
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,370
Alright. Eat up.

503
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,250
Meeting starts at half past ten.

504
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,670
Tong Wu,
your morning training starts today.

505
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,860
Don't feel burdened.
You're as good as everyone else.

506
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,200
Captain.

507
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,640
I have something to ask you.

508
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,000
What happened to Ji Xiang Kong

509
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,340
before I joined the team?

510
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:54,520
Why did he have to leave
after losing the game?

511
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,890
You really don't know?

512
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:02,720
What should I know?

513
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,850
Well.

514
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:15,030
After Gu Fang's retirement,

515
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,240
Handsome Ji made a pledge
in front of the board of directors.

516
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,790
He said if we lose the closed beta game,
he would leave the team.

517
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,050
But you were the one who made a mistake
during that game.

518
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,800
By right,

519
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,170
I should be the one leaving.

520
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,800
But Zhao Yang was determined
to get rid of him.

521
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,820
Plus,

522
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,770
you would only join the team under
the condition that you become the captain.

523
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,710
Having no choice,
Chairman Jin had to let go of Handsome Ji.

524
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,520
I would only join the team
if I get to become the captain.

525
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,340
Who told you that?

526
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:03,290
Zhao Yang kept stressing
that you wouldn't join us otherwise.

527
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,430
-Good morning, Brother Summer.
-Morning.

528
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,850
-Good morning, Brother Summer.
-Morning.

529
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,380
You did well in the preliminary round.

530
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,850
So did you get to become an apprentice?

531
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,170
Seriously, Luo Tian.

532
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,370
You're pretty.

533
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,600
You also work hard.

534
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,890
I can't figure him out.

535
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,960
Perhaps I'm just not professional enough.

536
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,980
You're not professional?

537
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,230
That means Dream Traveler
isn't professional.

538
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,210
I need to question him when he gets here.

539
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,790
No, don't do that.

540
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,380
I know you're trying to help me.

541
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,820
But if my professional skills
aren't good enough,

542
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:47,950
your help won't be of any use.

543
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,020
Alright.

544
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:52,000
You've got quite a bit of ambition.

545
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,820
Okay. Tell me how he turned you down.

546
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,890
He told me
to stop thinking about taking shortcuts.

547
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,130
If I want to be a commentator,

548
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:05,620
I should work towards it
in a professional manner.

549
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,520
What he said
wasn't necessarily a bad thing.

550
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,900
How come?

551
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,690
This means,
you have captured his attention.

552
00:38:15,850 --> 00:38:19,190
He thinks you have potential.
That's why he's being stricter with you.

553
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,570
-Really?
-Yes. Trust me.

554
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,900
Alright.

555
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,230
-I will definitely work harder.
-Keep it up.

556
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,440
Oh, right.

557
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,670
If you have any questions,
make sure you ask Pei Xi.

558
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,530
He'll be eager to explain it to you.

559
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,370
Keep up the good work.

560
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:41,850
Pei Xi?

561
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,400
Why?

562
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,910
Brother Qi.

563
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,140
Don't be angry.

564
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,490
Ji Xiang Kong
lectures anyone as he pleases too

565
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,910
because Shu Wen has his back.

566
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:57,470
I'm not letting
what happened earlier slide.

567
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,920
We're not attending the meeting later.

568
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,300
Let's see what he can do.

569
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:06,670
Brother Qi, if you cause trouble now,
then we'll be falling into his trap.

570
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,130
What trap?

571
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,980
He's clearly picking on us.

572
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,420
Can't you tell that he's alienating us?

573
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,090
He is really cunning.

574
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,790
First, he doesn't stay in his single room,
but goes to Lu Sheng's room.

575
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:23,250
Second, he stood up for Tong Wu today.

576
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,310
What does that mean?

577
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,690
It means he's trying
to conquer them one by one.

578
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,490
At this rate,

579
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,550
there won't be any place left
for you in VNG.

580
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,720
Fine.

581
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:39,290
If that's how he wants to play it,
then I'm game.

582
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:40,500
Alright.

583
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,630
But let's pretend to cooperate with him.

584
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,830
Especially in front of Shu Wen.

585
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,780
It's almost time for the meeting.
Let's go.

586
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,390
Sorry.

587
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,030
Alright.

588
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,200
Everyone is here.

589
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:13,150
Let's discuss our preparations
for the fall tournament.

590
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,820
Xiang Kong.

591
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,640
I've gathered everyone's records
from last season

592
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,500
and mapped out a training plan
according to your traits.

593
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,780
Shen Yue.

594
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:28,240
Your role remains the same.
You'll be the Support.

595
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,690
-Got it.
-Tong Wu.

596
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,280
You and I will play Top and Back.

597
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:34,350
Qi Yue.

598
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:38,270
You gave all your resources to Pei Xi,
yet you managed to perform really well.

599
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,450
This couldn't be done
without strong skills.

600
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,960
You can surely rank in professional
top three if you play Jungle.

601
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,290
Therefore, your role remains the same.

602
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,000
Come again?

603
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,350
Then who else is qualified to be Mid?

604
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,760
Lu Sheng.

605
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,990
You play the Mid.

606
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,880
Me?

607
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,430
Lu Sheng often took on three opponents
when he played Top.

608
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,360
But his mortality rate is extremely low.

609
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,080
That's extremely hard to accomplish.

610
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,530
After Pei Xi left,

611
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,610
VNG's Mid not only has to guarantee
attacks on opponents,

612
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:13,160
but must also handle
great amount of pressure.

613
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,550
I think

614
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,150
Lu Sheng is capable of playing Mid.

615
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,390
Then you should respect his opinion.

616
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,930
Mid can't be played by anyone.

617
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,430
All eyes will be on him.

618
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,800
Lu Sheng. Can you handle the pressure?

619
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,230
I don't want to play Mid.

620
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,070
Why not?

621
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,500
I can't do it.

622
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:36,920
Are you not confident in yourself?

623
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,090
Brother Qi should play Mid.

624
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,950
He has been playing Mid
ever since Pei Xi left.

625
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,590
We're used to it now.
There is no need for a change.

626
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,230
I'm well aware of my capabilities.

627
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,950
Xiang Kong.

628
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:00,240
We understand that you wish to change
VNG's current situation.

629
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,880
But the competition is near.

630
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,360
I think it's a huge risk
to make sudden changes to the roles.

631
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,610
On top of that,
Lu Sheng has never played Mid before.

632
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,050
Even if we had Pei Xi,
who is the best Mid,

633
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,290
we can't guarantee
that we'll win every game.

634
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:19,030
This shows that tactical cooperation
matters more than individual strength.

635
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:23,020
Since all of you think there's a risk,
let's try out the new plan for a month.

636
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,850
A month from now,
we'll decide who plays Mid.

637
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,860
How about that?

638
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:27,920
Alright.

639
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:29,570
Try it for a month.

640
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:30,820
It's decided.

641
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:32,140
Shu Wen.

642
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:35,710
Lu Sheng.

643
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,730
Aside from our usual training,

644
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,590
we'll both play an hour
of basketball daily as of tomorrow.

645
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,000
Play basketball?

646
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:44,680
That's ridiculous.
How is it relevant to the competition?

647
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,620
Why not have us go dancing with you?

648
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,870
You're the captain.

649
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,940
I accept your decision.

650
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:54,320
See you tomorrow.

651
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:19,750
Hey, Xiang Kong.

652
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,800
[Brother Sun.]

653
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,860
How is Xuan?

654
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,220
[I've chased him out.]

655
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,920
I told him to apologize to the team,
but he refused to.

656
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:29,120
He said he will stay benched
for two years.

657
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,310
[Xiang Kong.]

658
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,950
Your departure from the team
really affected him.

659
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,390
It's as if he has given up on himself.

660
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,960
That's how he is.

661
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,520
Once he gets reckless,
not even bulls can stop him.

662
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,830
Professional players will get rusty
if they stop competing for a long period.

663
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,370
[I know this very well.]

664
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,880
I don't want him following my footsteps.

665
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,240
[Understood.]

666
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,350
I'll take care of Xuan's matter.

667
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,630
Bye.

668
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:00,800
Hurry up. No need to change your shoes.

669
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,570
I have to leave in a bit. Make it quick.

670
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,670
Wait.

671
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,870
Why did you call me over in a hurry?

672
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,940
Don't just stand there.

673
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,240
Stop talking. Hurry up.

674
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,820
Wait a minute. Yi Yi.

675
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,950
Aren't we progressing a little

676
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:23,020
too fast?

677
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,530
I'm not ready yet.

678
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,860
It's my first time as well.

679
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:30,320
First time?

680
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:34,110
Didn't you say you're a computer expert
who can track down any hacker?

681
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,500
A hacker?

682
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,970
You called me over to...

683
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,690
To dig up information on Zhao Yang.

684
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:45,020
Didn't we agree to it the other night?

685
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,100
Right. Find out about Zhao Yang. Let's go.

686
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:49,990
What else did you think it was for?

687
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:51,750
To dig up information on Zhao Yang.

688
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:56,290
Lin Yi Xuan.

689
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:58,370
What were you thinking?

690
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,020
I wasn't thinking of anything.

691
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,660
-I dare you to say it again.
-No, don't hit me!

692
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,020
-You hooligan!
-No!

693
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:05,830
Don't hit me!

694
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,980
I'll beat you to death!

695
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,550
Qiu Ying isn't around.

696
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:36,570
I came to see you.

697
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,090
Me?

698
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:43,760
It's a new drink.

699
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,320
Try it. It's free.

700
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:47,200
Free again?

701
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,300
Don't you make 1 yuan per year at VNG?

702
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:54,000
So this drink is on me.

703
00:45:54,890 --> 00:45:57,200
Come on.
Even though my annual salary is 1 yuan,

704
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:59,110
I can still afford a cup of coffee.

705
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,300
Not bad.

706
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,160
I'll cut to the chase.

707
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,620
I came to see you because of Lin Yi Xuan.

708
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,100
He assaulted someone.

709
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,130
There's nothing I can do.

710
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:23,270
-You are the captain of Legends.
-So what?

711
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,390
There's nothing I can do
if he doesn't listen.

712
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,040
Matters of a teammate, regardless being
big or small, concerns the entire team.

713
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:32,420
You are the captain,
so it surely concerns you.

714
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,460
Based on Legends' current strength,

715
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,950
even if Lin Yi Xuan leaves,

716
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,640
we'll be able to find
our next Support in no time.

717
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,990
It won't be the same.

718
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,280
Xuan has a very clear grasp of a Support.

719
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,180
I'm not exaggerating if I say
no one comes in first place

720
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,960
if he comes in second
among national professional players.

721
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,580
Now you've had him benched.

722
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,280
Do you have a better replacement
for the fall tournament?

723
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,710
Even if he is as good as you mentioned,

724
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,210
a Support who doesn't listen
is no better than a reserve player.

725
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,470
Xuan seems like a hot-headed guy,

726
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,980
but he's actually kind and innocent.

727
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,260
Legends had gone through a lot lately.

728
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,550
He needs some time to adjust.

729
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,030
Do you hate me as he does?

730
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,810
"Hate" seems like a strong word.

731
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,980
I would like to consider you as
the most respectable opponent.

732
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:33,760
You really think Legends
needs Lin Yi Xuan?

733
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,260
You are the captain.

734
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:41,100
It's up to you to decide.

735
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,780
I was just giving you facts.

736
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,720
If you want to win the game, you need him.

737
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,890
Aren't you afraid that you'd lose to me
in the fall tournament

738
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,310
if I put Lin Yi Xuan back on the team?

739
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,150
The stronger the opponent,
the prouder I'd feel when I win.

740
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,800
Hold on.
How did this turn into a Q&A session?

741
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,210
Any more questions?

742
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:02,880
One last question.

743
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,330
What do you think of me?

744
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,800
A team with you is invincible.

745
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,830
But only for the first six minutes.

746
00:48:15,330 --> 00:48:16,740
"Only the first six minutes"?

747
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,850
Let me finish.

748
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,130
After six minutes,
it depends on who you're fighting against.

749
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,710
If you're unlucky
and get me as your opponent,

750
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:27,210
your team will crumble
in the seventh minute.

751
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:29,590
You're so full of yourself.

752
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:31,750
I will prove to you

753
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:35,260
that the only person in this world
who can defeat me

754
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:37,330
is myself.

755
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,270
Drink water.

756
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:50,360
How is it going?

757
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:52,010
Almost done.

758
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:59,070
We must start with footage from the
airport to find information on Zhao Yang.

759
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,490
This is Qiu Ying's computer.

760
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,330
If we can find out
who hacked her computer,

761
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,020
then we can ferret out Zhao Yang.

762
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,160
But

763
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:12,930
there's no signs of this computer
being hacked.

764
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,080
That can't be.

765
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:20,410
The fake assaulting video
was uploaded from this computer.

766
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:23,650
Qiu Ying wasn't the one who sent it.

767
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,650
Who could it be if not a hacker?

768
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:29,520
Usually in such cases,

769
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,300
there is only one possibility.

770
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,740
Which is?

771
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,550
It was committed by an acquaintance.

772
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,010
It must be Qiu Ying's best friend.

773
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:40,610
Like you, for example.

774
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:43,430
-What did you say?
-No, no.

775
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,620
It was just an example.

776
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,010
I didn't say it was you.

777
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,480
Wait a minute.

778
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,430
I think I know who did it.

779
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:56,580
Who?

780
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,750
Yes? Coach Luo?

781
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,750
[Lin Yi Xuan, come back for training.]

782
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,100
[If you are late, I'll put you
in the reserve team in the next match.]

783
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,780
I can compete again?

784
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,110
[Cut the crap. Come back here at once!]

785
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,960
But Coach Luo, I can't...

786
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:21,630
What's going on?

787
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:24,080
I have to go.

788
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,480
Bye.

789
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,310
No, wait...

790
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,050
Lin Yi Xuan!

791
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,350
It was committed by an acquaintance.

792
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,830
No, it can't be.
