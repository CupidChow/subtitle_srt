[Episode 23]

4
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,990
It's Hongfei.

5
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:43,410
Why is she here?

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,180
Chief.

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,940
Senior Yueming...

8
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,590
He's dead.

9
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,420
That witch killed him to silence him.

10
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,460
I want you to pay with your blood!

Young Lord.

13
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,260
Why don’t you leave after you're fully recovered?

14
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,980
I've almost recovered.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,290
It's time for me to return to my father.

16
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:24,850
Besides,

17
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,400
we haven't found the person who is practicing the Art of Starshift.

18
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,930
There are many things to do.

19
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,260
The murderer must be that witch, Hongfei.

20
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,020
Everyone in Hanshui Sect will train harder

21
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,170
and go get her.

22
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,160
Chief Han, don't be impulsive.

23
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,800
Firstly,

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,570
Hongfei is highly skilled.

25
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,370
You don't need to take this risk.

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,140
Secondly,

27
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,370
we haven't found out who is practicing

28
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,570
the Art of Starshift.

29
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Leave it to me.

30
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,550
I'll get to the bottom of it.

32
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,160
Do you think we'll ever see each other again?

33
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,020
Of course.

34
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,730
I'll come visit you sometime.

35
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,079
Come visit me too.

36
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,590
When you find a boyfriend,

37
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,790
I'll help you vet him.

38
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
No, no, no, no, no.

39
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,280
I want to become an emotionless

41
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,620
Chief Han, it's almost time.

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,240
Miss Han, we're leaving.

43
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,100
Take care.

Lord.

45
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,120
We caught Li San.

46
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,950
He's been sneaking around.

47
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:52,970
Li San.

48
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,710
Why are you here?

49
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,900
The Art of Starshift reappeared in the martial arts world.

50
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,180
Who took it?

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,290
That’s precisely why I’m here.

52
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:02,490
Didn’t you find it the Art of Starshift?

53
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,630
I don’t know where it's hidden.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,610
Master didn’t want Art of Starshift to harm the martial arts world again.

55
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,350
Before he went missing, he asked me to keep it a secret

56
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,910
but now it has reappeared.

57
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,490
I guess someone has stolen it from the cliff cave.

58
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,540
What did you say?

59
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,760
The Art of Starshift was hidden here?

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,040
Yes.

61
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,820
Back then, Master didn't take the secret manual away.

62
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,680
It was hidden in the secret compartment of the cave.

63
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,050
Could it be An Jingzhao and his people?

64
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,310
I don’t think Hongfei did it.

65
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,790
Why?

66
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,040
If Hongfei really did this,

67
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,080
I'm sure she wouldn't hide it.

68
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,780
Let's take a break.

69
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,800
Young Master, what's wrong?

70
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,500
I need to heal my wounds.

71
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,160
What's wrong?

72
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,230
Jingzhao.

73
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,430
There seems to be some water sources nearby.

74
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,560
I'll get some water.

75
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,230
We've been traveling for hours.

76
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,290
Let's take a break.

77
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,700
I'll go with you.

78
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,670
No, Qing can accompany me.

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,930
I'll take a walk too.

80
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,130
I'll be back soon.

81
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,230
Let's go.

82
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,540
Let's get down and have some fun.

83
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,600
Didn't you want to go get water with Ling?

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,520
Of course not.

85
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,940
I think Ling has been troubled lately.

86
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,540
As his sister-in-law, I should care about him.

87
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,700
Let's get some fresh air.

88
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,130
If you don't go with me,

89
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,280
I'll go with others.

90
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,140
Fine.

91
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,510
Let's go there.

92
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,140
Young Master.

93
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,940
That person seems to be Hongfei.

94
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,320
Why is she here?

95
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,430
Did she find something?

96
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,690
The Art of Starshift hasn't been completed.

97
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,900
She mustn't find out.

98
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,179
Come on.

99
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,080
Be careful.

100
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,580
Here's a bouquet of flowers for you.

101
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,100
Here.

102
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,640
Jingling, why are you holding a vine?

103
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,850
I've only seen Jingzhao use swords lately.

104
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,780
I found many vines on the way today.

105
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,740
It reminds me of when I first started training,

106
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,110
when Jingzhao used vines

107
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,240
to practice with me.

108
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,580
There's a lot of trouble in the martial arts world lately.

109
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,290
Father urged the disciples to practice hard.

110
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,420
I also learned a lot.

111
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,830
I wanted to show you

112
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,220
my recent progress.

113
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,090
Sure.

114
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:03,640
I'd love to be an onlooker.

115
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,080
Moreover, it's a match between two handsome men.

116
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,560
Come on.

117
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,900
Jingzhao.

118
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,680
No need, Ling.

119
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,750
I can do it empty-handed.

120
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,150
It's just a competition.

121
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:11,800
Come on.

122
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,780
Jingzhao.

123
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,060
Are you okay?

124
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,300
Jingzhao.

125
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,160
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,150
I learned a trick from the disciples of the villa.

127
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,030
I couldn't

128
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,100
control myself.

129
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,640
It's okay. It's just a minor injury.

130
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,950
Let's apply some medicine.

131
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:50,750
Getting hurt is no small matter.

132
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,580
Let me take a look.

133
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,480
An Jingzhao.

134
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,250
Where is the Art of Starshift?

135
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:09,650
Aren’t you the one who practiced the Art of Starshift?

136
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,740
Wasn't it you who killed Yeming

137
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,200
to silence him?

138
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,300
You pretend to be a gentleman,

139
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,560
but why are you

140
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,850
doing a bunch of sneaky things in secret?

141
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,300
The secret manual is hidden in the secret compartment of the cliff.

142
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,980
Now the hidden compartment has been moved

143
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,500
and the secret manual is gone.

144
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,890
You're the only ones

145
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,890
who've been to my cave recently.

146
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,700
- Miss Hongfei.
- Chuyue, don't go over.

147
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,150
It’s okay.

148
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:33,770
Leave it to me.

149
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,210
Don’t fight each other.

150
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,620
Miss Hongfei.

151
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,190
My man is upright.

152
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,640
He didn’t take any secret manual from you.

153
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,830
Hongfei, you...

154
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,300
It’s really you.

155
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,940
Let her go.

156
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,630
I'll only give you one day.

157
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:10,340
If you still don’t hand over the Art of Starshift tomorrow,

158
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,980
I’ll kill your beloved.

159
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,230
If you dare lay a finger on her,

160
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,740
I will kill you.

161
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,300
Miss Hongfei,

162
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,400
you are such a nice person.

163
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,870
You can't bear to hurt

164
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,090
a harmless little cutie like me, right?

165
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:24,940
Take a guess.

166
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,790
Donghua, send Second Young Master back.

167
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,890
An Jingzhao didn't take any secret manual from you.

168
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,600
If he could use the Art of Starshift,

169
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,530
he would have absorbed your power.

170
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,750
Besides,

171
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,320
when you were chasing that man,

172
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,120
An Jingzhao was not there at all.

173
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,180
Who can prove that?

174
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,780
Me.

175
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,910
I can prove that he wasn't there.

176
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,950
He was in bed with me.

177
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,630
In bed?

178
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,630
Don't think too much. It was just a kiss.

179
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,100
Nothing inappropriate.

180
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,820
An Jingzhao is a pure young man.

181
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,620
Why do you sound like

182
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,340
you want something to happen?

183
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,270
Of course.

184
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,510
That's not what I meant.

185
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,020
Anyway,

186
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,950
An Jingzhao was not at the scene.

187
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,310
There's a whip mark on his shoulder.

188
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,470
His injury wasn't caused by your whip.

189
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,520
Trust me.

190
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,760
Enough.

191
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,810
Stop quibbling.

192
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,820
I don't think explaining is going to work.

193
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,620
Let's lighten the mood a little.

194
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,920
Miss Hongfei.

195
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,100
I have nothing to do anyway.

196
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
Why don't we have a little sisterly talk?

197
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,610
I saw your boyfriend Yuege

198
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,670
when I went to the Pleasure Pavilion.

199
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,630
You know Yuege?

200
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,960
We met when I went to

201
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,350
the Pleasure Pavilion to look for someone.

202
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,130
He is indeed a beauty.

203
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,800
I haven’t seen Yuege for a long time.

204
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,530
Yuege is beautiful and sings wonderfully.

205
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,170
In my book,

206
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,880
he's on top.

207
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,340
If the full score is 100,

208
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,480
how would you rate

209
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,850
Yuege's figure, personality, and looks?

210
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:22,000
His figure...

211
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,410
He's got to be at least...

212
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,010
He's just an 80.

213
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,600
As for looks, he's just at 90.

214
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,320
His personality is at least 100.

215
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,560
What about you?

216
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,970
How many points would you give An Jingzhao?

217
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,630
Looks, 100.

218
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,270
Personality, 90.

219
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,260
Figure...

220
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:44,720
100.

221
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,700
No, no, no.

222
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
At least 200.

223
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,350
In one word,

224
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,010
hot.

225
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:55,430
It's been a long time since I've gone to see Yuege.

226
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,310
After this,

227
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,580
I have to visit him.

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,490
But I heard

229
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,900
Yuege is busy recently.

230
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,760
A lot of people go to see him.

231
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,270
Really?

232
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,620
Miss Hongfei,

233
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,920
if you really like him,

234
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,660
you should care more about him.

235
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:16,890
Chuyue!

236
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,570
Miss Hongfei,

237
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,550
please let An Jingzhao in for a little bit.

238
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,860
I can definitely prove

239
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,380
he wasn't there that day.

240
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,050
Please.

241
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,270
Eat this.

242
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,710
If you dare to play any tricks,

243
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,200
within an hour,

244
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,810
you'll bleed to death without the antidote.

245
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,330
If I can prove that

246
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
An Jingzhao was not there that day,

247
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,950
you would give me the antidote, right?

248
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,580
Aren't you afraid I won't give you the antidote later?

249
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,060
No.

250
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:03,900
You're not a person who doesn't keep her word.

251
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,670
An Jingzhao.

252
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,220
Chueyue.

253
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,590
Chuyue, did she hurt you?

254
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:19,500
No.

255
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's quickly prove to her

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,520
that you weren't around that night.

257
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,580
Show her the wound.

258
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,220
Here.

259
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,350
Look, Miss Hongfei.

260
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,150
If you still don’t believe me,

261
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,940
then try whipping on my arm.

262
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:37,670
Chuyue.

263
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,960
Don't you dare.

264
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:39,730
Fine.

265
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,180
You two love each other so much.

266
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,410
Your wound

267
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,940
doesn't seem like it was inflicted by my Nine Poisons Whip.

268
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,470
I was too eager to find

269
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,710
the Art of Starshift.

270
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,320
I didn't look carefully.

271
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,680
I'm sorry.

272
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:02,070
Now you'll believe me, right?

273
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:08,810
Who took the Art of Starshift?

274
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,430
She finally believed it.

275
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,470
Come on. It’s fine.

276
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:21,420
Hongfei!

277
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:21,980
Hong...

278
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,230
Hongfei! You don’t keep your word.

279
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
If you don’t give me the antidote...

280
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,130
You just need to be intimate.

281
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:30,600
The poison will lift itself.

282
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,800
Little girl, I've given you the chance.

283
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,150
You're welcome.

284
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,490
She poisoned you?

285
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Do you know what poison she gave you?

286
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,240
Did she say anything else?

287
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,210
She didn't tell me what poison it was.

288
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,400
She said,

289
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,640
if I don't take the antidote in an hour,

290
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,620
I'll bleed to death.

291
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,060
Chuyue.

292
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,750
There is no sign of poisoning in your body.

293
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,510
And if what she said was true,

294
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,030
you would die in an hour.

295
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,020
The time should have passed.

296
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,619
I think she didn't poison you.

297
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,380
The most important thing now

298
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,310
is to leave here.

299
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,740
I'll find the way out.

300
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:14,890
She didn't poison me?

301
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,180
Then why did she say

302
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,589
the poison would be detoxified after being intimate?

303
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,730
She even said I don't need to thank her.

304
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,510
Did she do it on purpose?

305
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,980
Hongfei.

306
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,650
You went all out to help me.

307
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,590
I won't waste this chance.

308
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,680
I feel terrible.

309
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:37,170
Chuyue.

310
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,700
Chuyue, what's wrong?

311
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,900
I'm not feeling well.

312
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:41,310
I have chest tightness and a headache.

313
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,270
I can't breathe.

314
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,460
I guess

315
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,270
we can only try what Hongfei suggested.

316
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,460
Chuyue.

317
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,810
This is not the time to mess around.

318
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,650
We need to get out of here.

319
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,940
We need to find the way out.

320
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
I need to restore my internal force.

321
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,180
You're right.

322
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,190
Actually, I know the way out.

323
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,250
I'll open the door.

324
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:16,430
Let's go.

325
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,510
Let's go.

326
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,160
[Yunwei Villa]

327
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,190
How is Chief Han?

328
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,770
He's fine now.

329
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,780
He's just lost his power.

330
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,010
When I recover,

331
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,860
I'll visit him.

332
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,910
I'll arrange your marriage with Miss Han as well.

333
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,530
Father.

334
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,300
Chief Han asked me to give this to you.

335
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Since Miss Han is unwilling

336
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,640
and Chief Han wants to break off the engagement,

337
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,850
I have nothing more to say.

338
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,060
In that case,

339
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,410
please allow me to marry Chuyue.

340
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,530
Zhao,

341
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,100
Chuyue doesn't belong to any sect.

342
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:26,460
You have to take charge of Yunwei Villa in the future.

343
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,050
She can't give you any help.

344
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:28,650
Father,

345
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,590
I'm looking for a wife,

346
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,590
not an assistant.

347
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,930
The only reason why I want to marry Chuyue

348
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,340
is because I love her.

349
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,330
Then find the person who is practicing the Art of Starshift

350
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,870
before you get married.

351
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,800
Thank you, Father.

352
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:04,110
I finally found a suitable embroidery method.

353
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,190
Master Ju

354
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,150
is a superstar in the embroidery world.

355
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,730
It's done!

356
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,550
But the deadline

357
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,870
is just three days away.

358
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,470
So I have to send the clothes back

359
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,960
within these few days.

360
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:47,780
But

361
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,030
there's been no thunderstorm lately.

362
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,210
I must find someone

363
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:58,830
who can predict the weather.

364
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,460
Young Master.

365
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,080
The Lord has agreed to

366
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,070
the marriage between Young Lord and Chuyue.

367
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:17,530
It’s going to be held soon.

368
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,390
I need to find out

369
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,670
where Chuyue's hometown is.

370
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,410
Only if we uncover this secret

371
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,650
might we find a way to separate them.

372
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,170
Send someone to follow Chuyue.

373
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:32,630
Yes sir.

374
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,680
Hottie.

375
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,150
Hottie! Hottie!

376
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:47,580
Chuyue.

377
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,550
Why are you panicking?

378
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,390
Hottie,

379
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,510
is there anyone who can predict the weather?

380
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,210
When is the next thunderstorm?

381
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,140
I want to go home.

382
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,420
I can't miss it.

383
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,790
Don't worry.

384
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,840
The master of Tianyun Temple can predict the weather.

385
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:04,570
You can ask him.

386
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,280
Okay.

387
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,360
I'll go now.

388
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:06,930
Okay.

389
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,650
Be careful.

390
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,220
Young Master.

391
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,750
Chuyue went to the temple.

392
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,020
I'm not sure why.

393
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
But I heard her say

394
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:19,950
she wanted to go home.

395
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:21,080
Go home?

396
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,990
Find a body in the suburbs

397
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,540
and pretend it was caused by the Art of Starshift.

398
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,000
Yes sir.

399
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,560
Young Lord,

400
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,440
a body was found at Sanli Pavilion in the suburbs.

401
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,770
He's suspected to have been injured by the Art of Starshift.

402
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,890
Since Hongfei is also looking for

403
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,490
to find the Art of Starshift,

404
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,600
that shouldn't be her.

405
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,580
Who is it?

406
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:58,850
Donghua.

407
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,690
Get the horse ready.

408
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,750
I want to check it out myself.

409
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,090
Yes

410
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,090
The Art of Starshift?

411
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,010
An Jingzhao.

412
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,360
An Jingzhao.

413
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:17,860
Young Madam.

414
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,640
Young Lord went out for business.

415
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,840
He’s not in the villa.

416
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,280
Chuyue.

417
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,040
I heard that

418
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,810
you finished a beautiful garment.

419
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:35,170
I've prepared a banquet at the tavern.

420
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:36,700
I'll take you to celebrate.

421
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,880
I have something important to do.

422
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,510
It won't take long.

423
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:43,320
You'll be back before dark.

424
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,230
Alright.

425
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,540
Jingling,

426
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,220
you're really a good friend.

427
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,180
This is what a brother should be like.

428
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:53,900
Next time,

429
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,960
I'll ask Li Chuyang to learn from you.

430
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,430
Let's go.

431
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,770
Please come in.

432
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,320
Please.

433
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,380
Please enjoy.

434
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,080
Okay.

435
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,740
Jingling,

436
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,240
You really know my foodie nature.

437
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,010
I'm glad you like it.

438
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,580
Eat up.

439
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,020
Is this tiramisu?

440
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,420
Could it be...

441
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,640
Are you from our town?

442
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,840
I specially asked the boss to make this dessert.

443
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,940
You're good at making desserts too?

444
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,460
I had nothing to do

445
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:47,410
so I've studied some dishes.

446
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,000
Among all these dishes,

447
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,200
this is my favourite.

448
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,370
We have this dessert at home too.

449
00:24:59,370 --> 00:24:59,900
Jingling,

450
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,760
you must have been my brother in your previous life.

451
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,430
I don't want to be your brother.

452
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,160
Nothing.

453
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,370
I've always heard you talk about your hometown.

454
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,370
Your hometown seems to have many interesting things.

455
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,100
Our hometown is rather different from here.

456
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,540
The cars run faster there.

457
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,000
We dress differently too.

458
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,150
Today is a happy day.

459
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,480
Let's drink to celebrate.

460
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,740
No, I have something to do tonight.

461
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,990
You won't get drunk.

462
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,820
Then I'll have a little.

463
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,020
Here.

464
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,340
Here.

465
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,140
Cheers.

466
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:51,980
Cheers.

467
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,150
Now that you mention it,

468
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,470
I really want to visit your hometown.

469
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,090
I'll take you there someday.

470
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,620
You will be very surprised.

471
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,660
Lanterns.

472
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,980
Take a look!

473
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,870
Come and have a look.

474
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,040
No problem.

475
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:33,750
Chuyue.

476
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,490
Where is your hometown?

477
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:36,420
Is it in Shangyu?

478
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,560
My hometown is not in Shangyu.

479
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:41,560
My home is very, very far away.

480
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,660
Jingzhao has been to your hometown, right?

481
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,060
Yes.

482
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,530
We even kissed.

483
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,680
How does one get to your hometown?

484
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,630
The passage.

485
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,460
A magical passage.

486
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,660
Where is it?

487
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,460
Chuyue.

488
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,980
Where is the passage?

489
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,500
In the room.

490
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,750
It's in the room.

491
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,470
I'm going back tonight.

492
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,560
How do you open it?

493
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:21,790
Chuyue.

494
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,990
An Jingzhao, you're back.

495
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,660
I miss you.

496
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,500
My dog.

497
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:35,680
You're ridiculously gorgeous.

498
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,850
You're like a peacock,

499
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:40,510
I can't help but sin.

500
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,350
Nonsense.

501
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,780
Why did you drink so much?

502
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,020
Ling,

503
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,080
why did you let her drink so much?

504
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,440
Jingling didn't ask me to drink.

505
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,020
I wanted to drink it.

506
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,340
Let's go back.

507
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,270
Yes, let's go back.

508
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:05,740
We're in public.

509
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,940
This is bad. It's a sin.

510
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:36,480
[He Sheng Restaurant]

511
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,130
You'll catch a cold at night.

512
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,260
Jingzhao,

513
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,960
I brought some hangover soup for Chuyue.

514
00:28:59,290 --> 00:28:59,770
Come in.

515
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,320
Be good.

516
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Put your hands in.

517
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,870
You'll catch a cold.

518
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,220
Are you sick?

519
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,220
Be good.

520
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:19,390
Put your hands in.

521
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,540
Jingzhao,

522
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,430
I shouldn't have let her drink like this.

523
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,710
If she drinks this soup, she'll be sober quickly.

524
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:30,770
Here.

525
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,660
You'll sober up after drinking.

526
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,320
You won't feel so bad anymore.

527
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,650
Have another sip.

528
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,220
Be good.

529
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:56,460
After drinking the hangover soup,

530
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,950
you can sleep.

531
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,380
Jingzhao, I'm leaving.

532
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,540
Why did you take them out again?

533
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,220
Go to sleep.

534
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,760
I can't sleep. Let's sleep together.

535
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,100
Be good. Go to sleep.

536
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,920
You're the one who started it.

537
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
You better not...

538
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,190
Chuyue.

539
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:13,310
You will be mine.

540
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,460
Don't be distracted.

541
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,060
Chuyue.

542
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,580
It's thundering.

543
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,230
Could we go back to visit your mother?

544
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,160
Chuyue. Chuyue.

545
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,500
Chuyue!

546
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,660
What are you doing?

547
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,580
Your hand!

548
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,290
Chuyue.

549
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,620
Chuyue.

550
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,540
Wait.

551
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,490
Let me think.

552
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,460
It seems that the thunder is not loud enough yet.

553
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,660
We haven't gone back.

554
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,340
Next time then.

555
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,910
An Jingzhao,

556
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,130
you are my man.

557
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,880
Tomorrow, I...

558
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,100
I'll make you some soup tomorrow.

559
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:32,530
Li Chuyue,

560
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:34,840
do you know shame?

561
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,970
Young Lord, are you awake?

562
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,980
Young Lord.

563
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,780
Coming.

564
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,140
Oh no.

565
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,710
I haven't returned my clothes.

566
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,440
How could I drink too much?

567
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
How could I miss a thunderstorm day?

568
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,030
This is the last day for me to submit my work.

569
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,220
Do I still have a chance?

570
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,740
God,

571
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:05,010
besides An Jingzhao,

572
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,140
you are the second most handsome.

573
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,540
The second most stylish.

574
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,590
Please tell your subordinate Dragon King

575
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:12,699
to let us

576
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,380
have a little thunderstorm today.

577
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,940
Get him to work a little overtime.

578
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,260
Please.

579
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,460
Please.

580
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,460
Please.

581
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,340
You're so mean.

582
00:34:58,050 --> 00:34:58,560
Hello.

583
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:05,240
All participants sent in their work by post.

584
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,420
You are the first one to bring them personally.

585
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:09,700
I have no choice.

586
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,630
As her guardian, I'm really worried about my sister.

587
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,720
Please register here.

588
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:36,710
Kid.

589
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,780
I'm looking for the person who released this news.

590
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,620
You're so strange.

591
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,120
How would I know who did it?

592
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,380
I've investigated it.

593
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:50,590
You are related to the owner of the jade pendant.

594
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,560
I've been watching those gangsters

595
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,760
who stole that sword.

596
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,990
According to reliable sources,

597
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:55,910
the sword

598
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,260
is in the jade pendant owner's hands.

599
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,110
I really don't know.

600
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,200
Stop pestering me.

601
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,300
I'm going to be late for school.

602
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,020
He's from Yunwei Villa.

603
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
I just want to know

604
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,550
how they came here.

605
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,080
Sir, I really don't know.

606
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,110
Stop asking me.

607
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,110
Young Lord.

608
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,300
Young Lord.

609
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,360
What’s up?

610
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,240
Young Lord.

611
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:44,910
A nun's body has been found

612
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,770
in a relay station in the suburbs.

613
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,580
She seems to have been hurt by the Art of Starshift.

614
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,910
Let's go and have a look.

615
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,470
Master.

616
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,470
Master.

617
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,930
Master!

618
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,170
Master!

619
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,530
Looks like Madam was killed a few days ago,

620
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,180
even before Chief Han.

621
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,800
Looks like your master

622
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,090
was the murderer's first target.

623
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,630
She was hurt by a sharp weapon from behind.

624
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,890
Only later did someone

625
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:23,380
steal her powers with the Art of Starshift.

626
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,090
Judging from the wound,

627
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,640
Madam didn't struggle at all.

628
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,150
Besides,

629
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,860
the murderer doesn't know martial arts.

630
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,460
I think

631
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,380
the murderer is she knows.

632
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,860
It shouldn't be Hongfei.

633
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:42,760
Do you know why your master came here?

634
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,450
A few days ago,

635
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,160
she received a letter.

636
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,040
She said she was going to meet an old friend the next day.

637
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,860
She went out

638
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,580
and didn't mention where she was going.

639
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,260
She never came back after that.

640
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,130
We searched for her for days

641
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,040
and only found her now.

642
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,990
But I didn't expect that...

643
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,600
Master.

644
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,080
Was there anything strange

645
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,220
about your master before she left?

646
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,220
Strange?

647
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,400
Master.

648
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,770
Master took an old letter

649
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,980
and looked at it for a long time.

650
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,720
There seemed to be a poem on it.

651
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,190
Could you please see

652
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,660
if she has it on her?

653
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,590
Okay.

654
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,360
Here.

655
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
Did Madam mention

656
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,680
who her friend is?

657
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:16,100
[Fang Yue]

658
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:17,730
Fang Yue.

659
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,650
This letter is exquisite.

660
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,540
It must be from a rich family.

661
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:32,640
Donghua?

662
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,240
Yes.

663
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,310
Find out who

664
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,320
Fang Yue is.

665
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:37,820
Yes.

666
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,260
Master.

667
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,440
Young Lord.

668
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:53,300
I’ve found out Fang Yue’s background.

669
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:53,830
Go ahead.

670
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,460
Fang Yue is the daughter of

671
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,010
the governor of Yuzhou over 20 years ago.

672
00:39:57,010 --> 00:39:58,270
She founded a poem club

673
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,150
and named it Fang Yue House.

674
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,490
Fang Yue has been friendly with

675
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,620
always been friends with the first ladies of Yuzhou's sects.

676
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,370
They often gather and recite poems together

677
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,160
and even made their own letters.

678
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,300
Because there were many people,

679
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,580
she said she doesn't remember

680
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,510
who participated in the poem club.

681
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,580
However,

682
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,710
there is a name list.

683
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,020
If there is a name list, there is a clue.

684
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:18,530
Did you bring it?

685
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,050
No.

686
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,180
Fang Yue said

687
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,940
you need to go in person.

688
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,420
She wants to see the Mingxiao Sword Technique for herself.

689
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,100
Pack up.

690
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,110
Let's go now.

691
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,440
Yes.

692
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,140
You've learned the soft and gentle skill of Hanshui Sect.

693
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,890
You need to master the Strong Power

694
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:05,620
and the Neutral Power quickly.

695
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,980
As long as you combine these three martial arts,

696
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,390
you can have the deepest inner power in the world.

697
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,430
The most powerful

698
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:20,110
Strong Power practitioner

699
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,840
is the master of the Iron Fist Gang.

700
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,980
The Iron Fist Gang is one of the strongest factions in the world.

701
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:30,680
Although you have some internal power,

702
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,070
you are no match for Tie Dalin

703
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,810
You won't be able to use

704
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,930
the Art of Starshift.

705
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,380
Someone else also practices Strong Power.

706
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,340
Who?

707
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:46,260
The Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley.
