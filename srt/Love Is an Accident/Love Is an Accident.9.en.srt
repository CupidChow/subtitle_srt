[Episode 9]

4
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,180
Don't tell me it's related to this ugly stone.

5
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,170
On the Huaxi Festival when I was seven,

6
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,180
the weather was abnormal.

7
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,310
A red light flashed.

8
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,630
Then, a magical stone fell from the sky

9
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,400
and smashed into the backyard of the Lingxiao Yard,

10
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,800
smashing out a large pit.

11
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:08,639
At that time, my father and the butler of the villa

12
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,400
thought that the stone fell from the moon,

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,800
showing an auspicious sign.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,100
It happened to be the Huaxi Festival that day.

15
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,079
So it was named as

16
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,190
Huaxi Stone.

17
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,250
Then, I embedded that stone

18
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,030
in my bed.

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,970
And then?

20
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,020
The Huaxi Stone is made of

21
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
the exact same material as this one.

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,420
In other words, Huaxi Stone and the meteorite

23
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,820
came from the same world.

24
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,200
Later, they split up

25
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,079
and went to different worlds.

26
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,560
Now I recall it.

27
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,590
It rained heavily that day.

28
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,829
There was lighting accompanied by peals of thunder.

29
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,690
Could it be that

30
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,850
a wormhole has formed between these two meteorites?

31
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,580
When energy is generated, the passageway opens

32
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,310
and connects to another world.

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,290
So,

34
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,360
the bed is not a passage,

35
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,680
but the stone is.

36
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,980
A thunderstorm?

37
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,710
That means

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,280
you can go back

39
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,260
during the next thunderstorm.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,820
The weather forecast said

41
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,170
there will be a thunderstorm the day after tomorrow.

42
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,720
You're going back the day after tomorrow.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,650
What did you say?

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,170
Nothing.

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,340
Congratulations.

46
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,470
You can go back soon.

47
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,610
Now, go back and get some rest.

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,650
I have work to do.

49
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,220
Go out now.

50
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,140
He's going back the day after tomorrow.

51
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,160
It's because

52
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,360
I like you.

53
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,120
Luckily, the plate is not broken.

54
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,650
I hope my heart is not broken too.

55
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,800
Why would An Jingzhao take a liking to me?

56
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,310
Didn't he always dislike me?

57
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,810
Come in.

58
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,120
Li Chuyue, my brother-in-law went out alone.

59
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,180
He also drank a lot.

60
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,340
He's so handsome.

61
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,410
He may be targeted by others.

62
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,530
He drank a lot?

63
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:10,770
Where is he?

64
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,340
He's in the hotel now.

65
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:16,230
He said he wanted to leave this place that was tearing him apart.

66
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:16,790
Look.

67
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,040
He drank so much.

68
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:20,290
Will he get into trouble?

69
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:30,260
I'll send you the hotel location and room number.

70
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,170
An Jingzhao, are you there?

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,430
An Jingzhao.

72
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,909
An Jingzhao.

73
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:00,740
An Jingzhao.

74
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,920
Why did he stop?

75
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,120
Li Chuyue, are you crazy?

76
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,380
Why are you here?

77
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:45,970
Yang said you were drunk.

78
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,030
So I came to see you.

79
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,150
Since you're fine, I'll go back now.

80
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,870
You haven't told me your answer yet.

81
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,220
I don't understand.

82
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,700
Didn't you always treat me as an assassin and hate me?

83
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,220
Yes.

84
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,730
I hate you.

85
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,180
I hate thinking about you all the time.

86
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,570
So what's your answer?

87
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:22,320
I need some time to think about it.

88
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,180
Do you want coffee?

89
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:45,950
Buy one.

90
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,460
Bring one for me.

91
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,060
Thank you.

92
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:49,990
You're welcome.

93
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,490
Here.

94
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,150
Look. Look carefully.

95
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,730
Is this what he wanted?

96
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,800
No.

97
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,520
Let me check the chat records.

98
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,390
Li Chuyang.

99
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,090
Is An Jingzhao not back yet?

100
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,230
It seems that someone

101
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,880
can't help caring about him.

102
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,310
I'm not caring about him.

103
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,280
I'm just being righteous.

104
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,190
He is unfamiliar with the place.

105
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,170
If anything happens,

106
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,210
I will feel bad.

107
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,270
You are afraid

108
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,870
he might be seduced by other girls, aren't you?

109
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,070
I haven't heard from him for two days.

110
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,670
Looks like he's got his heart set on going back.

111
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,690
Chuyue.

112
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,380
Today is your birthday.

113
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,280
I invited some friends and colleagues

114
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,540
to celebrate with you.

115
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,480
Okay.

116
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,390
Sister,

117
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,460
come to the park in front of our house.

118
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,120
I'm a bit scared to walk alone.

119
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,790
Li Chuyang.

120
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,710
Li Chuyang.

121
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,030
Where is Li Chuyang?

122
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,820
He even tried to make a surprise.

123
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,570
Happy birthday.

124
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,630
Thank you.

125
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,950
Here's the dinner I prepared.

126
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,580
Here.

127
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,110
Come on.

128
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,140
These are my gifts for you.

129
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:49,970
Pick one.

130
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,380
Now, you even know the concept of mystery boxes.

131
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,490
[Can you be my girlfriend?]

132
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:08,540
I don't really like that flavour of cake.

133
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,840
This one.

134
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,880
Are you sure?

135
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,300
Will you be my girlfriend?

136
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,720
These few days, I've been studying

137
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,120
the things in your world.

138
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:39,310
This is French.

139
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,390
It has the same meaning as

140
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,620
"Will you be my girlfriend?"

141
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,580
Will you be my girlfriend?

142
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,740
No, I...

143
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,440
I...

144
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,190
I didn't get it just now.

145
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,180
Chuyue.

146
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,990
Where are you?

147
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,540
We're already in the hotel lobby.

148
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,600
It's my colleague.

149
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,630
He wants to celebrate my birthday.

150
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,430
I'll go first.

151
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,320
How is it, Brother-in-law?

152
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,240
How did my sister react?

153
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
Did she agree?

154
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,810
Your sister was called away by Gu Qingfeng.

155
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,450
What?

156
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:47,680
You just let them go?

157
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,800
Gu Qingfeng, how dare he!

158
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:32,090
This song is for Miss Li Chuyue.

159
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,990
Happy birthday to her.

160
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,360
May she remain young

161
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,720
and beautiful forever.

162
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,010
Happy birthday!

163
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,580
Happy birthday!

164
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,430
Awesome!

165
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:45,150
Brother-in-law.

166
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:45,790
Let's go.

167
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,200
Qingfeng.

168
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,160
Why are you here?

169
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,040
You sang so well.

170
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,690
Sister.

171
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,320
Why did you bring him here?

172
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,770
Today is your birthday.

173
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,300
Of course we should be here.

174
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,600
Chuyue.

175
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,380
Are you okay?

176
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,060
I'm fine.

177
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:33,860
I need to go to the bathroom.

178
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,330
Chuyue.

179
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,140
Are you guys together?

180
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,470
No, no, no.

181
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,290
Don't fool me.

182
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:44,130
I saw it.

183
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,010
An Jingzhao is so nice to you.

184
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,780
When organizing the garment samples,

185
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,710
he inventoried the clothes

186
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,190
all by himself.

187
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,480
An Jingzhao inventoried the clothes?

188
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:53,820
Yes.

189
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,240
I saw it with my own eyes.

190
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,560
Chuyue.

191
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,720
Let me introduce you to a designer.

192
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,500
Sure.

193
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,579
This is my colleague,

194
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,380
Li Chuyue.

195
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,980
She is also a very talented female designer.

196
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,400
-Yes, I can tell.
-You can exchange experiences with each other.

197
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Brother-in-law.

198
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:23,390
Qingfeng, I'm a little hungry.

199
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,849
I'll go get some food first.

200
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:25,710
Sure, go ahead.

201
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,349
See you.

202
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,560
Catch you later.

203
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,030
Okay.

204
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
He's my junior,

205
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,540
only one grade younger than me.

206
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,000
And he has won half as many awards as I've won.

207
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:36,390
By the way, Chuyue,

208
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,780
the New Designer Competition is about to begin.

209
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,060
I heard from Ms. Qiao that

210
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,090
she recommended you to enter the second round,

211
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,490
right?

212
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,540
Chuyue?

213
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
What did you say?

214
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,690
I said

215
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,330
I heard you went straight to the second round.

216
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,060
Is that true?

217
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:53,140
I've been drawing designs lately.

218
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,680
In that case, can I view

219
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,110
your work in advance?

220
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,230
I'm flattered by your words.

221
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:01,380
Cheers.

222
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,600
Mr. Gu's new design

223
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,130
has come out.

224
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,860
Really?

225
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,630
The chairman gave him a special commendation

226
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,730
at the presidents' meeting.

227
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,330
Besides,

228
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:32,080
the president also announced that

229
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,400
he became the chief designer of men's clothes.

230
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,430
Chief?

231
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,060
Mr. Gu is really talented.

232
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,700
Exactly.

233
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,550
Look.

234
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,380
The design is so distinctive.

235
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,180
-This is beautiful.
-What are you looking at?

236
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,790
I like this one.

237
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:44,910
New design.

238
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,430
Look, it's nice.

239
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,880
-Look at here.
-It's also pretty, isn't it?

240
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,680
How nice it is.

241
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
The details...

242
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,200
Gu Qingfeng.

243
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,400
He's so talented.

244
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,220
So this is why you approached me.

245
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,910
It's so creative.

246
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,000
Look, here's another one.

247
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,980
That's a very distinctive design, isn't it?

248
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,620
Gu Qingfeng.

249
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:06,570
He is amazing.

250
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,530
What's wrong, Chuyue?

251
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,420
Did you copy my design?

252
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:12,660
Chuyue.

253
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,660
I don't know what you're talking about.

254
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,740
Stop pretending.

255
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,540
You plagiarized my work.

256
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:20,440
It can't be.

257
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,810
I've been working on the design

258
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,680
since I entered the company.

259
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,210
How could it be plagiarism?

260
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,900
You're indeed shameless.

261
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,020
Chuyue.

262
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,550
How would Gu Qingfeng copy your work?

263
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,260
He's from a leading design institute.

264
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,060
And you

265
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,390
are only

266
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,890
Ms. Qiao's assistant.

267
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,460
-Yeah.
-That's right.

268
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,880
Gu Qingfeng.

269
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,150
I, Li Chuyue,

270
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,380
am full of ideas and creativity.

271
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,280
I'll consider the design as a gift for you.

272
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,330
I also want to say something to you.

273
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,190
You can try to design it yourself.

274
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,010
It's not that hard.

275
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,500
Thank you.

276
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,220
Qingfeng, keep it up.

277
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,700
Bye.

278
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,580
Good luck!

279
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,870
So handsome.

280
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,020
Sister.

281
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,260
It's hard to find a toad with three legs.

282
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,260
But there are many men with two legs.

283
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,160
Don't get too upset.

284
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,250
It's not worth it for someone like Gu Qingfeng.

285
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:21,450
Yang.

286
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,290
I should have been heartbroken.

287
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,100
But why don't I feel like crying?

288
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,640
It means you've never liked Gu Qingfeng.

289
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,280
You were just bewildered at first sight.

290
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,870
From now onwards,

291
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,140
I can't judge a man by his looks.

292
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,250
I was really blind.

293
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,670
And I was too shallow.

294
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,890
If you can't judge a person by their appearance,

295
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,510
what else should you look for?

296
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,910
I'd better be shallower.

297
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,110
He must be more handsome than Gu Qingfeng.

298
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,110
Isn't that my brother-in-law?

299
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:48,580
Actually, I knew

300
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,680
you were interested in him from a long time ago.

301
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,280
Am I right?

302
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,120
You brat.

303
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,420
What nonsense are you talking about?

304
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,560
I'm hanging up. Go to bed early.

305
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,040
Bye.

306
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,460
I'll be home soon.

307
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,020
What's the secret hidden behind this sword?

308
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,520
How did it get here?

309
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,910
The weather forecast didn't say it would rain today.

310
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,050
Chuyue.

311
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,170
I'll be back.

312
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,760
Who are you?

313
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,010
What do you want?

314
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,360
Your dad is so wicked.

315
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,560
How dare he ruin our boss's business?

316
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,760
You are his daughter.

317
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,590
You should

318
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,900
pay for him.

319
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,030
Police!

320
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,160
Stop!

321
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,180
Stop!

322
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,320
[An Jingzhao]

323
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,620
Let go of me!

324
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,960
What are you doing?

325
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,180
Do you know my friend is a kung fu master?

326
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,660
Behave yourself.

327
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,380
If he shows up,

328
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,320
he can defeat you all in a breeze.

329
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:22,680
Let go of me!

330
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,680
Behave yourself.

331
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,900
You want to run away?

332
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,650
Fine.

333
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,420
Compensate us tenfold for our losses.

334
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,020
Otherwise, don't even think about it.

335
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,190
You are antique fraudsters.

336
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,780
Why should I compensate you?

337
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,650
You still want to quibble about it?

338
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,590
Still denying?

339
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:48,640
Hello, is this the police station?

340
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
Did you give up your chance to go home

341
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,380
to save me?

342
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,010
Nothing is more important than you.

343
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,730
We'd better go to the hospital.

344
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,640
The wound is so deep. What if you get infected?

345
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,190
No need.

346
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,920
Just bandage it for me.

347
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,950
Does it hurt?

348
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,710
Does it hurt?

349
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,950
No.

350
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:47,150
You lost a lot of blood.

351
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,510
How could it not hurt?

352
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,860
It doesn't hurt when you're around.

353
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,500
You...

354
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,600
go to bed early.

355
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,280
Will you be responsible to me?

356
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:14,620
Yes.

357
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:15,950
I will.

358
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,480
Then you have to keep your promise.

359
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,080
I will keep my word.

360
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,410
I'll make soup for you tomorrow,

361
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,270
which is beneficial to the recovery of your wounds.

362
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:43,780
What are you doing?

363
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,820
I'm making the milky white carp soup.

364
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:49,680
It's said online that it's good for wound recovery.

365
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,770
Just wait and see.

366
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,500
I'm quite good at cooking.

367
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,660
Put down the knife.

368
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,720
Put down the knife.

369
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,160
Let me do it.

370
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,610
I'm good.

371
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,450
Let me do it.

372
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,510
You're not chopping vegetables.

373
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,810
You're chopping your hands.

374
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,770
It's okay.

375
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,600
It's not okay.

376
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,020
I'm not okay with it.

377
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,940
Go stand next to me.

378
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,760
Li Chuyue.

379
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:14,980
Hang in there.

380
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,100
He is leaving in a few days.

381
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,690
I've watched the tutorial.

382
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,640
I'll do the rest.

383
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,950
Turn on the stove and pour some oil.

384
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,320
Did you burn yourself?

385
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,810
No.

386
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:10,970
Let me do it.

387
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,190
-It's okay.
-Just watch by my side.

388
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,050
Actually I know how to do it.

389
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,670
But your cooking looks delicious as well.

390
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:30,370
Try it.

391
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:31,630
You first.

392
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:34,660
Okay.

393
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,360
Let me try it for you.

394
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:45,720
It tastes good.

395
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,040
Have some.

396
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,770
I have no appetite.

397
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,370
I don't feel like eating yet.

398
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,370
I have a question.

399
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,060
What is it?

400
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,280
I've been wondering

401
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,380
who this man is.

402
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,140
Are you close?

403
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,410
Yes.

404
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,550
It's just a meme.

405
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,780
Everyone is using it.

406
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,920
I'm done.

407
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,670
Why don't you take a rest?

408
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,400
I'll slice some fruit for you.

409
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,270
An Jingzhao.

410
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,100
You're a man but so good-looking.

411
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,180
That's too much.

412
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,080
What a great nose bridge

413
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,160
and a perfect jawline.

414
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,550
If I were to compare it to a dish,

415
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,380
it would be a delicacy.

416
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,560
So do you want to taste it?

417
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,780
Have you made up your mind?

418
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,860
What is the answer?

419
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,730
Not yet.

420
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,470
It's not that easy to figure it out.

421
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,090
I... I still need time.

422
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,260
Do you usually peek at others?

423
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:10,050
I... I'm not peeking.

424
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,080
I'm here to brush my teeth.

425
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,100
Y-You shower first.

426
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,200
It's okay.

427
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:19,770
You brush your teeth,

428
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:20,700
I'll take a shower.

429
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,860
We do our own business.

430
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,380
No need.

431
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,220
Y-You shower first.

432
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,540
Chuyue.

433
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,410
Chuyue.

434
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,900
Mum, why are you here?

435
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,730
I... I'm in the bathroom.

436
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,980
Chuyang forgot to take his exercise book.

437
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,240
I came to get it for him.

438
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:40,730
Mum.

439
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,920
I'm taking a shower.

440
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,020
Don't come in.

441
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,430
Are you okay?

442
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,860
What are you doing?

443
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,120
What's with the noise?

444
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:56,140
Mum.

445
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,090
I'm fine.

446
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,220
Let me give you a reminder.

447
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,950
You'd better stay away from An.

448
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,410
I always feel something is wrong with him.

449
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,050
I get it.

450
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,200
It's getting dark.

451
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,390
Take care on your way back home.

452
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,790
Okay, I'm leaving.

453
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,050
Don't think too much of it.

454
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:21,110
I was afraid my mum might hear the noise.

455
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,280
Go ahead with your shower.

456
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,410
I'm going to bed now.

457
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,750
Ms. Qiao.

458
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:48,390
This is my design draft for the competition.

459
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:49,940
Okay.

460
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,340
Look.

461
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,710
So handsome!

462
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,060
He's so cool!

463
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,850
Morning.

464
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,690
Morning.

465
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:02,450
I like it too.

466
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,980
What are you talking about?

467
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:06,740
The advert filmed by An Jingzhao is now trending.

468
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,670
The netizens said An Jingzhao's charm is off the charts.

469
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,949
He is an icy noble

470
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,050
who has got a great temperament.

471
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,380
Chuyue.

472
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,000
You and An Jingzhao are not a couple, right?

473
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,120
If not, I'll take the initiative.

474
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,370
Me too.

475
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,600
I saw it first.

476
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,270
Let me tell you some gossip.

477
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,070
An Jingzhao doesn't like girls.

478
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:29,780
Really?

479
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:30,830
No way.

480
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,580
Chuyue.

481
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,290
-Come here.
-Manager.

482
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,760
In this year's Fashion Week,

483
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,580
Ms. Qiao is allowed to take an assistant with her.

484
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,250
She said although you're new here,

485
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,810
you did well.

486
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,460
So,

487
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,179
she wants to give you the chance.

488
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:52,400
R-Really?

489
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,719
That's great.

490
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:54,920
Congratulations.

491
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Thank you, Manager.

492
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,450
There's another good news.

493
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,200
As you can see,

494
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,860
the friend you brought here last time

495
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,180
was good at being a model for photographs.

496
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,340
He's even trending online.

497
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,540
So the company decided to sign with him.

498
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,450
Go and contact him.

499
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,390
Manager,

500
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,310
my friend was just helping out last time.

501
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:13,780
He

502
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,100
has his own profession.

503
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,860
He doesn't really want to be a model.

504
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,660
I understand.

505
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,740
I will offer him a salary

506
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,230
that he can't refuse.

507
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,940
He doesn't seem to be short of money either.

508
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,860
Are you kidding me?

509
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,750
He's not short of money?

510
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,060
I have a pretty good financial status.

511
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,740
I own a villa.

512
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,180
I also pay someone to cook for me

513
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,450
and I have a chauffeur.

514
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:38,040
Even I dare not say I don't lack money.

515
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:40,770
Chuyue.

516
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,220
Actually,

517
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,230
we haven't decided

518
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,720
who's going with Ms. Qiao.

519
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,280
So if you can't convince your friend

520
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,770
to become a model for our company,

521
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,320
then

522
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,250
you might miss this opportunity.

523
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,380
Manager.

524
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,300
This is my chance.

525
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,300
Yes, I know.

526
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,490
But you have to think for the company.

527
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,820
If you can't help the company,

528
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,720
the company may

529
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,120
take back your chance.

530
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,830
How can you do so?

531
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,420
Reconsider about it.

532
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,750
Think for yourself too.

533
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,080
Okay, Manager.

534
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,380
I... I'll try my best.

535
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,700
Come on.

536
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,680
It is estimated that there will be heavy rain next week,

537
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,130
along with the thunderstorms.

538
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,790
Dear citizens, you are advised to plan your schedules in advance.

539
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,370
Well,

540
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,790
are you interested in a profitable job?

541
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,530
The pay is very high.

542
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,280
I'm not short of money.

543
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:56,730
I know.

544
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,560
But who would complain about money?

545
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,980
All you have to do is shoot for one poster,

546
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,340
and you'll earn half of my annual salary.

547
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:05,750
You can enjoy yourself here

548
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,740
with this money.

549
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,590
What's fun here?

550
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,210
There's a lot of fun here.

551
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,560
Such as amusement parks, cinemas,

552
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,310
and a lot of delicious food.

553
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,990
Do you agree?

554
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,880
I'm not interested in filming.

555
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,570
Let me cut to the chase.

556
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,020
Actually,

557
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:30,370
I'd like you to help me

558
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,630
by modelling again.

559
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,880
If you don't,

560
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,740
I won't be able to make it to Fashion Week.

561
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,220
I said I'm not interested.

562
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,420
Our manager has gone too far.

563
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,690
How dare he threaten me?

564
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,330
How could I agree to

565
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,860
such an inane request?

566
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,260
I'm going to tell Ms. Qiao about this.

567
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,480
Ms. Qiao won't agree with

568
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,160
his disgraceful behaviour.

569
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:59,120
If you need,

570
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,680
I can help you one last time.

571
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:02,550
Really?

572
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,450
But you also need to do something for me.

573
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:06,950
Tell me.

574
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,630
What do you need from me?

575
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,060
Tell me what your sister likes to play the most.

576
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,310
This is from my sister's diary.

577
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,380
Please refer to it.

578
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,560
I'll have my finals in the next two days.

579
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,160
Good luck, Brother-in-law.

580
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,500
An Jingzhao.

581
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,340
I'm going out tomorrow. You accompany me.

582
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,150
No problem.

583
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,300
We were almost 100 metres away.

584
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,630
Why take a detour?

585
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,050
You said you'd be with me today.

586
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:05,660
Hold my hand.

587
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:06,780
My hand is cold.

588
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,780
Help me warm it up.

589
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,180
But your hand is warm.

590
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,120
I said it's cold.

591
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,720
Do you dare?

592
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,530
No.

593
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,870
It looks scary inside.

594
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,990
It looks boring.

595
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,770
It's obviously boring.

596
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,440
Are carousels

597
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:28,220
that fast?

598
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,840
Do you want to ride it?

599
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,020
Look at that.

600
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,060
Is Pikachu cute?

601
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:37,030
You want it?

602
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,110
Let's give it a shot.

603
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,070
Let's go.

604
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,280
I'm winning the biggest one today.

605
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,250
You're so arrogant.

606
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,510
I've been running a stall here for so long.

607
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,310
No one has ever won a grand prize.

608
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,080
Dad, I'm here.

609
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,530
We see you.

610
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,420
It's in the front.

611
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:03,480
This is beautiful.

612
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:04,970
It's in the front.

613
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:09,880
I'm full today.

614
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,630
We're not up for it today.

615
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,350
Let's play something else.

616
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,700
Slow down. Be careful.

617
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,580
I'll help you get it.

618
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:19,180
Boss, may I use this?

619
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,580
Sure, go ahead.

620
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,340
Are you hungry?

621
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:26,750
Be careful.

622
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,880
Look here.

623
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:38,730
Let's take a photo too.

624
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,950
One, two, three.

625
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,970
Awesome!

626
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:08,290
Thank you.

627
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,620
What's wrong?

628
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:16,980
Little girl,

629
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,510
this is for you.

630
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:20,940
Thank you, Sister.

631
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,050
But this is from your boyfriend.

632
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,100
I can't take it.

633
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,420
It's okay.

634
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,960
I'll get another one for her.
