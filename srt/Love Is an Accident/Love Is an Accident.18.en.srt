[Episode 18]

4
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,150
Peach blossom luck?

5
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,460
It means that many girls like you.

6
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:49,900
Chuyue.

7
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,870
Why do you always use

8
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,900
terms I've never heard of?

9
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,500
That's the official language of Hanshui Sect.

10
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
You can do koi, right?

11
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,940
I want to try it too.

12
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,020
Sure.

13
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,380
Is it like this?

14
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,070
It should be like that.

15
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:31,620
Chuyue.

16
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,610
I saw sugar figurines on my way back.

17
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,680
I brought one for you.

18
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,290
Thank you.

19
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,250
Young Lord bought you some koi too.

20
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,360
We are making wooden carvings.

21
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,860
The fish is burnt.

22
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,600
I don't know if it's edible.

23
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,450
If you grilled it, it has to be delicious.

24
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,200
Don't eat it.

25
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,560
It's burnt.

26
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,950
Donghua, why don't you try it?

27
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,840
I'm not hungry.

28
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,310
I've had my fill, watching your  lovey-dovey behavior.

29
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,150
Why did you learn these bad things from Li Chuyang?

30
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:11,880
Young Madam.

31
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,710
Mr. Li is a man of character.

32
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,170
He taught me valuable things.

33
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,540
How could he be a bad influence on me?

34
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,120
He became Li Chuyang's underling in just a few days.

35
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,840
Not is underling, I'm his brother.

36
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,340
Donghua.

37
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:25,980
Yes.

38
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,770
Send Ling back later.

39
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,610
Remember, don't let Zhou Wei's people find out.

40
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,500
Yes.

41
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,840
Master.

42
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,130
An Jingling is back.

43
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,220
He's severely injured.

44
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:04,720
He said

45
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,570
he's been recuperating in a villager's home.

46
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,460
Now, everyone is saying that

47
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,650
An Jingling is useless.

48
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,170
He's a weakling.

49
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,910
Master, you are ready to go.

50
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,770
But we haven't dealt with Madam.

51
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,190
Master Xuanfeng knows that Madam is fine.

52
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,040
We can't do anything to her.

53
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:43,870
Then we'll use Evil Sect to get rid of her.

54
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,260
Madam.

55
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:05,310
Chonghua Temple is holding a blessing event.

56
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,140
I made a donation on your behalf.

57
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,870
I’ll send someone to escort you there tomorrow morning.

58
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,300
I accept your kindness, Second Lord.

59
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,340
But

60
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,220
I'm an old woman.

61
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,920
Praying for Zhao at Chongyue Pavilion

62
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,280
is enough.

63
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,750
If you don't go,

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,360
let Qin go.

65
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,400
Qin.

66
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,310
You'd better change into a new set of clothes tomorrow morning.

67
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,659
It's a grand ceremony after all.

68
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,780
Zhou Wei,

69
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,659
don't go too far!

70
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,630
Madam.

71
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,530
If you want to protect your people,

72
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,600
I suggest you cooperate.

73
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,159
Chuyue.

74
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,670
Wait for me here. Don't go anywhere.

75
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,110
Okay.

76
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:16,940
Madam.

77
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,390
Madam, let's go.

78
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,540
Go!

79
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:24,700
Madam.

80
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,260
Go!

81
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,620
Madam.

82
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,100
Stop!

83
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,980
How did I offend Evil Sect?

84
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,770
How could you be so cruel?

85
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,990
I want to know the truth.

86
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,550
We are ordered by the Lord to kill you.

87
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,310
Cut the crap. Give us your life!

88
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,570
Say that again.

89
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,560
Who ordered you to do this?

90
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,300
Who?

91
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,030
How dare you be so arrogant? Show yourself!

92
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,340
You're under the order of the Lord of the Evil Sect

93
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,600
but you don't know her?

94
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,100
It's Hongfei.

95
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,700
How dare you call me Hongfei?

96
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,780
Where are you, An Jingzhao?

97
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,750
Get here quickly.

98
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,550
I'll be exposed if I keep acting.

99
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,340
So what if you're Hongfei?

100
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:33,470
Today, I'll kill you on behalf of the martial arts world.

101
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:52,810
Tell me.

102
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,980
Who sent you?

103
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,180
Zhou Wei sent you, right?

104
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,220
Grandmother, I'm late.

105
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,180
You must be startled.

106
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:04,780
Hottie.

107
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,710
Are you okay?

108
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm fine.

109
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,340
Thank you for saving Grandmother.

110
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,790
You really look the part.

111
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,510
I almost believed it.

112
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,270
Grandmother.

113
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,820
Zhou Wei really can't wait to kill you.

114
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,210
Fortunately, you found out beforehand.

115
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,010
I should thank the little in-law

116
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,420
for his trick for sending messages.

117
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,090
[Zhou Wei threatened me. Tomorrow]

118
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,420
We can't stay here for long.

119
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,060
I've sent a letter to Master Xuanfeng.

120
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,640
You should hide at his place.

121
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,290
Okay.

122
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,860
If I stay with you,

123
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,310
I'm afraid you'll be exposed.

124
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,910
With Master Xuanfeng there,

125
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,700
you can all rest assured.

126
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,250
Chuyue.

127
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,070
Take Grandmother there first.

128
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,720
I have something else to do.

129
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,860
Since Zhou Wei

130
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,570
wants to attack Evil Sect under the guise of Grandmother's death,

131
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,770
we'll grant his wish.

132
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,980
Okay.

133
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,980
I've deliberately sent Zhou Wei's two men

134
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,420
back to report this.

135
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,390
Let's go.

136
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,270
- Let’s go.
- Okay.

137
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,160
Be careful.

138
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,150
- It’s okay, Hottie.
- Let’s go.

139
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,830
I was scared to death.

140
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,680
Master.

141
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,630
Madam has been settled.

142
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,810
Good.

143
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:48,790
Have the guards been arranged?

144
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,230
Yes.

145
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,910
The chiefs are here too.

146
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,090
Then let's carry out our plan.

147
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,820
Everyone.

148
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,930
I didn't mean to be late.

149
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,550
I just received a report from the guards.

150
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,340
Madam was brutally murdered by Evil Sect

151
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,250
on her way to pray for the villa.

152
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,790
What?

153
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,270
This...

154
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,600
Madam died tragically.

155
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,580
Second Young Master came back defeated after attacking Evil Sect.

156
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,310
That's why the witch is so bold.

157
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:46,890
Not only did she create a series of tragedies in the martial arts world,

158
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,780
but she even dared to kill Madam.

159
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,740
This is a deliberate provocation.

160
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,500
We have to come up with a plan.

161
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:52,980
Yes.

162
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,270
I will lead my disciples to battle again

163
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,550
and eliminate Evil Sect.

164
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,690
Even if I have to risk my life,

165
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,160
I will stop at nothing.

166
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,100
The remnants of the Evil Sect have repeatedly violated us

167
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,440
and harmed the martial arts world.

168
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:22,170
I'm going to battle today

169
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,820
to wipe out Evil Sect,

170
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,580
seek revenge and uphold justice.

171
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,960
All of our Yunwei Villa disciples

172
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,820
are good men and heroes.

173
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,500
I, Zhou Wei, swear that

174
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,460
I will not return

175
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,590
before eliminating Evil Sect.

176
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,700
Destroy Evil Sect, uphold justice!

177
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,800
Destroy Evil Sect, uphold justice!

178
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,470
You stay in the villa

179
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,320
and protect everyone.

180
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,640
Report to me immediately

181
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,320
if there's anything unusual.

182
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,740
Yes.

183
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,440
Under Second Lord's order,

184
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,360
no one is allowed to enter Lingxiao Yard.

185
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,420
I'm here to pay my respects to Jingzhao.

186
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,620
Whoever dares stop me, shall die.

187
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:51,100
[Lingxiao Yard]

188
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,940
Jingzhao, I'm here to accompany you.

189
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,060
Don't worry.

190
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,800
I've broken off ties with that old bastard already.

191
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:17,450
He'll never use my poison

192
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,290
and the place where the sect practices to poison you again.

193
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,320
I will avenge you.

194
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,740
Jingzhao,

195
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,260
you will love me,

196
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,880
right?

197
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,280
Dear.

198
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,690
This embroidery pattern looks familiar.

199
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,220
I think I've seen it before.

200
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,400
Hongfei's inner chamber. Her cloak.

201
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,470
It's her cloak.

202
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,490
You're really skilled.

203
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,060
You've only looked at it once

204
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,640
and you can embroider the exact same pattern.

205
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,340
It looks the same at first glance.

206
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,120
But in reality, the stitches are very different.

207
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,110
It is very deftly embroidered.

208
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,570
It should be what I want.

209
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:22,710
Don't worry.

210
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,670
When Zhou Wei's matter is settled,

211
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,000
I'll go with you again.

212
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,540
I played her like that last time.

213
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,000
I guess when we meet again,

214
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,370
it won't be friendly.

215
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,980
Young Lord,

216
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,980
Zhou Wei and his men have returned to the villa.

217
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,440
His attack against Evil Sect

218
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,370
was indeed a lie.

219
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,300
His attack against Evil Sect

220
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,860
had always been a lie.

221
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:51,270
The purpose is to build momentum in the martial arts world.

222
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,850
According to our informant,

223
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,130
Zhou Wei is ready to ascend the throne.

224
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:04,940
It's time.

225
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,160
I'll go back to find Jingling and save my father.

226
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:10,710
Donghua.

227
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,700
Yes.

228
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:12,760
You stay.

229
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,300
Protect Chuyue.

230
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,630
Yes, Young Lord.

231
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,020
Zhou Wei is so evil.

232
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,720
You have to protect yourself.

233
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,190
Don't worry.

234
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,920
Be careful.

235
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,010
Congratulations on your return, Second Lord.

236
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,540
What’s happened in the villa

237
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,410
during my absence?

238
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,160
I think there's something wrong.

239
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,370
Tell me.

240
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
Miss Bai Zhi

241
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,810
went to Lingxiao Yard to drink until late at night.

242
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,369
I went to check it out

243
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,770
and heard a lot of drunk talk.

244
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,020
Apart from saying she wants to take revenge for An Jingzhao,

245
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,990
she also said that Fengnuan Pavilion would take action.

246
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,170
Just now, a servant reported that

247
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,690
Miss Bai Zhi seems to be leaving the villa.

248
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,119
Master, do you think...

249
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,450
This is what we call a wolf in sheep's clothing.

250
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,250
It's my fault for spoiling her too much.

251
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,460
Bai Zhi.

252
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,380
She knows too much.

253
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,830
She's short-tempered and has a big mouth.

254
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,960
Don't let her go far.

255
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,160
in case she gets into trouble.

256
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,100
I understand. I'll send someone to settle it.

257
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,260
Are you Zhou Wei's men?

258
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,380
That old bastard.

259
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,740
He even tried to kill me.

260
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,500
Please wait.

261
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,370
Thank you for your help. May I know your name?

262
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:15,340
No need.

263
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,990
I'm just following orders.

264
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,660
Following orders?

265
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,380
Jingzhao.

266
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,460
If Jingzhao is still alive,

267
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,450
he would definitely go to An Jingling.

268
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,290
That means

269
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,220
these symbols

270
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,460
should be tapped in a certain order.

271
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,570
As long as the order is right,

272
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,700
it will be unlocked.

273
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:02,700
Jingzhao.

274
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,740
Zhou Wei will ascend the throne soon.

275
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,660
When that happens,

276
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,790
he will kill Father.

277
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,290
We have to take action tonight

278
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:10,150
to save Father.

279
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,780
I've arranged everything.

280
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,700
We are ready.

281
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,840
I’ll cover you.

282
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,770
Lord.

283
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,460
I've destroyed Evil Sect,

284
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,940
so I came to report to you.

285
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,820
I heard that your condition worsened.

286
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,040
I didn’t believe it.

287
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,050
So, I have to come and see it for myself.

288
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,500
Look.

289
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,250
Look at you now.

290
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,220
You’re being manipulated by others.

291
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:24,500
You don't have the demeanor of a Lord at all.

292
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,280
Who's to blame?

293
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,410
Of course it's your fault.

294
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,110
I think you really forgot.

295
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,700
Back then, you and I

296
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,900
built Yunwei Villa.

297
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:45,160
We swore

298
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,590
to make Yunwei Villa big and strong

299
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,670
and make it the best sect in the world.

300
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,260
Didn't we agree then?

301
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,220
We'll share weal and woe together.

302
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,860
We'll share everything.

303
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:02,750
But...

304
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
But now,

305
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,070
you've made a name for yourself.

306
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,940
But I only got

307
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,980
the position of Second Lord, with no real power.

308
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,190
Back then, my martial arts and strategies

309
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,650
were superior even to you.

310
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,940
Why was I so loyal to you?

311
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:30,250
I did it for brotherhood.

312
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,190
But what about you?

313
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,870
You want to pass the position

314
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,170
on to your son?

315
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,520
I don't understand.

316
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:42,900
Since when is Yunwei Villa a house of An?

317
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,900
So, what am I?

318
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:52,050
Look at what you've done.

319
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,780
Now,

320
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,180
I killed your eldest son.

321
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Your second son

322
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,400
is just a coward.

323
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,700
So,

324
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,710
there's no hope for you.

325
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,380
Everything in Yunwei Villa will be mine soon.

326
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:22,380
So you should go and hear

327
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,370
how everyone has embraced me.

328
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,500
Really.

329
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,640
No less than you did in your day.

330
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,010
Considering how

331
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,460
we were brothers,

332
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,500
in a few days,

333
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,210
I'll send you off myself.

334
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:08,620
Who's there?

335
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:13,970
Chase him!

336
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:14,980
Yes.

337
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:24,960
Father.

338
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,150
- Please.
- Okay.

339
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,700
Here.

340
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:01,880
Father.

341
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
- Okay.
- Let’s go.

342
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:15,730
Slow down.

343
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,970
Someone is there.

344
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:23,770
Go after them!

345
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,890
It's you, Miss Bai Zhi.

346
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,860
I'm just taking a walk.

347
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,260
Why are you making a fuss?

348
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,700
I have orders from the Second Lord.

349
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,380
I know.

350
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,430
I'm leaving now.

351
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,060
Why don't you go back to stand guard?

352
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,460
Don't let anyone take advantage of the gap.

353
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,980
Don't tell anyone you've seen me

354
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,440
or I'll teach you a lesson.

355
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,630
Yes.

356
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:53,190
Over there.

357
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:13,400
[Yunwei Villa]

358
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,730
Keep searching.

359
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,540
Yes.

360
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,100
How is it?

361
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,680
I'm late.

362
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,180
Please punish me.

363
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,070
Forget it.

364
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,620
I've sent guards

365
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:42,070
to keep an eye on suspicious people around the villa.

366
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,500
What's going on at the old Lord's place?

367
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,660
Guards have been reinforced.

368
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,940
Lord is doing well.

369
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,680
Looks like there are many people

370
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,380
trying to block my way.

371
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,060
Don't delay the ascension anymore.

372
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,710
Otherwise, things will change.

373
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:05,940
Arrange it as soon as possible.

374
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,800
Do it tomorrow.

375
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,040
Yes.

376
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,230
I'll arrange it right away.

377
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,370
Thank you for your help, Miss Bai Zhi.

378
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,150
I helped you,

379
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,820
so you have to help me too.

380
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,190
Please go ahead.

381
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,350
I will do my best.

382
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,910
Is Jingzhao still alive?

383
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,280
Why do you say that?

384
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,980
I was hunted by Zhou Wei just now.

385
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,790
Someone highly skilled saved me.

386
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,590
He said he was ordered to come.

387
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,990
Jingzhao must have sent him there.

388
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,180
There are many skilled martial artists out there.

389
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,380
With all due respect,

390
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,240
you're overthinking.

391
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:39,460
No.

392
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,130
That person

393
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,980
must be related to Jingzhao.

394
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:46,080
I feel like Jingzhao isn't dead.

395
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,970
I'm sure I'm right.

396
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
I also hope Jingzhao is still alive.

397
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,940
But it's not true.

398
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,180
Maybe you were drunk yesterday.

399
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,060
So you're overthinking.

400
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,460
Is it really an illusion?

401
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,160
When I missed Jingzhao very much,

402
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,350
I had the same illusion.

403
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,530
You just said Zhou Wei wanted to harm you.

404
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,500
Don't mention that old bastard.

405
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,220
I respected him as my foster father.

406
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,950
How could he treat me like this?

407
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,600
Miss Bai Zhi, don't be sad for him.

408
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,420
He has never

409
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,100
had any fatherly love for you.

410
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,050
He just used your sect's poison

411
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,360
to help him do evil.

412
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,400
Pardon me for saying this.

413
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:35,220
Jingzhao's tragedy is irreversible.

414
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,320
Miss Bai Zhi, you can't indulge Zhou Wei's evil deeds anymore.

415
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,380
Jingzhao is gone.

416
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,280
I don't have to stay in the villa anymore.

417
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,980
I've decided to go back to Fengnuan Pavilion to meditate.

418
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,750
I'll seek revenge on Zhou Wei someday.

419
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,620
Jingzhao.

420
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,880
Father has been sent to Master Xuanfeng's place

421
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,460
to rendezvous with Grandmother.

422
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,060
Jingzhao,

423
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,380
I have something important to tell you.

424
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:11,840
Master.

425
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,740
The guards reported that

426
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,200
they found Young Lord’s wife in a small hut in the countryside.

427
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,870
What about An Jingzhao?

428
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,160
No trace of him.

429
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,850
As long as she is there,

430
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,380
it doesn't matter

431
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,840
if An Jingzhao is alive or not.

432
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,940
I wonder how An Jingzhao is doing.

433
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,140
Why isn't he back yet?

434
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,980
Speak of the devil.

435
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,330
Donghua?

436
00:31:59,460 --> 00:31:59,740
Zhou...

437
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,200
Zhou...

438
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:01,950
You...

439
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,320
Don't come over.

440
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,640
Young Madam.

441
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:11,590
It's time for you to die.

442
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,320
Congratulations on your triumphant return, Second Lord.

443
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,980
Second Lord is wise and brave.

444
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,500
He defeated Evil Sect,

445
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,620
resolving this problem for the martial arts world.

446
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,980
It's my duty

447
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,190
to do my part for the villa.

448
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,580
The villa has gone without leadership for a long time.

449
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,240
Please take this responsibility, Second Lord.

450
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,020
Please take your place, Second Lord.

451
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,250
To be honest,

452
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,720
I'm afraid the Lord is dying soon.

453
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:01,760
Madam and Young Lord passed away one after another.

454
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:07,690
The Lord has also advised me many times to take on the position.

455
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,540
Welcome, Lord.

456
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,060
Welcome, Lord.

457
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,190
How can our Lord

458
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,590
be changed so easily?

459
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,060
What's wrong?

460
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,740
You lost to Evil Sect

461
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:32,940
and you want to compete with me for this position?

462
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,300
How dare you!

463
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,440
Young Lord.

464
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,470
Young Lord.

465
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,020
Young Lord, how are you?

466
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,500
Young Lord is still alive?

467
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:57,580
Yes.

468
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,550
The Lord is still alive.

469
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,000
How can you appoint a new Lord?

470
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,969
As we all know,

471
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,989
the Lord is unconscious

472
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,940
and his condition is getting declining rapidly.

473
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,739
Do you think we're stupid?

474
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,760
Who said I’m declining rapidly?

475
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,489
Old Lord.

476
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,350
Lord.

477
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,980
Greetings, Lord.

478
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,610
You treacherous traitor.

479
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,080
What are you doing?

480
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,630
Please take a look.

481
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,020
This is the King Kong Iron Chain of Evil Sect.

482
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,380
Only the legitimate disciples of Evil Sect can use it.

483
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:08,420
Zhou Wei has been using it to lock the Lord up.

484
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,310
This exposes your identity as a member of Evil Sect.

485
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:14,780
This...

486
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,620
You hypocrite!

487
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,740
Not only that,

488
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,710
this is a letter I found in the Devil's Cave.

489
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,940
This letter was written by Zhou Wei.

490
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,340
He intended to collude with Evil Sect

491
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,200
to seize the position of the Lord.

492
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,610
Please have a look.

493
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,300
You have wild ambitions.

494
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:37,270
I think of you as a brother.

495
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,470
I can't believe you did this.

496
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,630
Brother?

497
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,170
How many times have I saved your life?

498
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,400
And you

499
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,020
treat me like a dog.

500
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,780
In terms of treachery and power,

501
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,460
everyone,

502
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,560
no one can beat you, An Chenghu!

503
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,820
So you poisoned me

504
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:11,350
and killed Zhao and Madam.

505
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,620
Luckily, Zhao found Doctor Luo.

506
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,340
Otherwise, I would have been poisoned to death by you.

507
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,980
Today, I'm going to clean up the villa.

508
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,500
An Chenghu,

509
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,900
I can tell you

510
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,980
I will become the Lord today.

511
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,900
Look at this villa,

512
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,300
see who still listens to you.

513
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:37,870
Guards!

514
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,930
Arrest them!

515
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,460
Young Lord,

516
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,480
the guards of Black Eagle Hall and Fengnuan Pavilion

517
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,680
have been taken down.

518
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:57,460
Li Qing.

519
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,420
Do you want your whole family to die?

520
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,980
Young Lord has saved all my family.

521
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,740
You were kept in the dark

522
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,580
because we bribed the guards

523
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,620
and didn’t tell you the truth.

524
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,340
Young Lord,

525
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,260
I’m guilty.

526
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,250
I deserve to die.

527
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,020
Zhou Wei's men have been following me closely.

528
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,060
If I didn't poison you,

529
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,120
my family will die.

530
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:17,990
Young Lord.

531
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:18,450
I…

532
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Please punish me.

533
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,460
Li Qing.

534
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:31,480
Raise your head.

535
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,780
I don't blame you.

536
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:41,670
Since you've poisoned me,

537
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,730
Zhou Wei will trust you more.

538
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,850
You can take advantage of him.

539
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,440
Let’s play along.

540
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:56,350
I swear to follow your orders.

541
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,020
You weren't killed at the Linxiantai birthday banquet.

542
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,220
Zhou Wei was furious.

543
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,730
He will do whatever it takes

544
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:03,790
to kill Young Lord.

545
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,020
Fulfil his wish then.

546
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,420
You mean...

547
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:10,500
Feign death.

548
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:25,340
Zhou Wei sent me to decimate Zhuyin Pavilion and Qingning Nunnery.

549
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,430
I'll get people from Zhuyin Pavilion and Qingning Nunnery

550
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,570
to cooperate with you.

551
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,410
Just go.

552
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,540
Yes.

553
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,950
It's fine.

554
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,100
You...

555
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,010
In order to seize the position of the Lord,

556
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,340
Zhou Wei has been secretly training elite soldiers

557
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,060
in Fengnuan Pavilion.

558
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,310
This...

559
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:15,130
He thought he had it all worked out.

560
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,580
If you weren't so cruel

561
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:19,370
that you wouldn't even let your foster daughter off,

562
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:21,300
we wouldn't have known about this.

563
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,940
I'm such a fool.

564
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,420
I always obey him.

565
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,040
I even let him use my sect's secret training base,

566
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,320
let him recruit troops

567
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,190
to help him take the throne.

568
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,150
How could he treat me like this?

569
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,520
Qing.

570
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,300
Young Master.

571
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,620
Send someone to follow her.

572
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,070
Okay.

573
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:51,620
Zhou Wei,

574
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,500
you planned everything.

575
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,470
You've lost your heart.

576
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:57,500
Confess now.

577
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,470
Young Lord, Young Madam is missing.

578
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:13,590
Zhou Wei.

579
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:14,700
Tell me.

580
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:15,940
Where is Chuyue?

581
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,830
I killed her this morning.

582
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:22,780
It was as easy as killing a mosquito.

583
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,780
Tell me.

584
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:48,930
What did you do to Chuyue?
