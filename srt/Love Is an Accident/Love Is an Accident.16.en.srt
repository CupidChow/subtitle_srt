00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:49,990
An Jingzhao.

5
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,570
How are you?

6
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,410
-Brother-in-law. -Young Lord.

7
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,420
Young Lord.

8
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,870
An Jingzhao, stop pretending.

9
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,480
Do you think I'll be fooled

10
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,140
just because you're handsome?

11
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,200
Let me tell you. I've quit the desire.

12
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,500
An Jingzhao, are you really not okay?

13
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,940
I was just saying it.

14
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,079
Quitting the desire for men is more difficult than quitting meat.

15
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,210
I'm not able to do it.

16
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,540
Wake up, An Jingzhao.

17
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,920
An Jingzhao.

18
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,140
Don't worry about me.

19
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,430
Just now, I gave treatment to myself with the spell

20
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,850
which my grandmother told me about.

21
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,690
I'm fine now.

22
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,600
But I feel a bit cold now.

23
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,700
Can you help me?

24
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,170
Let's leave at once.

25
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,320
Sister, we have to go.

26
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,750
My brother-in-law's health is the most important thing.

27
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,480
You should do whatever he says.

28
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,360
Let's go.

29
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,380
Forget it.

30
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,550
I should wait until he recovers.

31
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:22,329
So warm.

32
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,780
How are you? Are you feeling better?

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
Much better. Don't worry.

34
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,550
After you fully recover,

35
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,829
you should go back to your world at once.

36
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,570
We should go back together.

37
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,520
We are from two different worlds.

38
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Who wants to go back with you?

39
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,120
Li Chuyang, come here.

40
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:32,940
Sister.

41
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,530
Come on. Take this

42
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,650
to An Jingzhao.

43
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,560
Sister.

44
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,470
My brother-in-law is still very weak now.

45
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,520
Besides soup,

46
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,659
what he needs most

47
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,540
is your love, care and company.

48
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,700
Then he can recover faster.

49
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,040
If this is helpful for the young lord's recovery,

50
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,770
Young Madam,

51
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,550
I can share your burden.

52
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,680
I can give him love.

53
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,350
This is not something you can help with.

54
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,720
Don't make trouble.

55
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,970
Don't look down on me.

56

I'm the strongest man in the Yunwei Villa.

57
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,640
From now on, you should shut up.

58

59
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,730
Sister.

60
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,280
My brother-in-law has been depressed because you ignored him.

61
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
If this continues,

62
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,550
not only will his health not recover,

63
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,680
but his condition will also get worse.

64
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,850
Sister, please save this kid at once.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,480
How can you describe our young lord as a kid?

66
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,280
Young Madam.

67
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,700
Our young lord is the manliest man

68
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,159
in the martial arts world.

69
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,120
He's not a kid.

What a stupid teammate.

00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,420
You want me to leave?

72
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,870
Yes.

73
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,040
I want you to look me in the eyes and say it.

74

What’s wrong?

79

Sister,

80

we'll go buy some supplements for my brother-in-law.

Let's go.

Come on.

85

You haven't fully recovered yet.

Come on. Lie down.

87
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,840
Just lie there and don't move.

Chuyue, I'm sorry.

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,680
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

91
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,120
Just take a rest to recuperate first.

don't be angry. Okay?

What did you say? I couldn't hear you.

Master, you're wise.

138

Have you found out where An Jingzhao is?

139
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,430
I've dispatched half of the men in the villa to look for him,

but they didn't find An Jingzhao's trace under the cliff.

141
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,780
I think he must be dead.

What about An Jingling?

When can I see you?

151
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,430
Master Jingling, the second lord is here.

152
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,230
Why is he here?

153
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
Master Jingling.

154
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,380
Second Lord.

155
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,420
Are you feeling better now?

156
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,030
Much better.

157
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,930
Thank you for your concern.

158
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,990
I should have come to visit you earlier.

159
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,330
This is too absurd.

160
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,060
Bingqin should be blamed for being too reckless that day.

161
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,980
She wanted to kill the assassin who broke into the villa,

162
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,610
but she hurt you accidentally.

163
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:27,470
It's all right.

164
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,970
Bingqin acted like this because she wanted to

165
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,030
protect the villa.

166
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:33,800
Come on.

167
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,630
Let me see how well you've recovered.

168
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,680
Don't bother, Second Lord.

169
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,470
It's okay.

170
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,610
Fortunately, my elder brother taught me in advance

171
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,870
how to disrupt my heartbeat with a spell.

172
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,900
How about this?

173
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,510
I'll exert my inner force to help you heal your wound.

174
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't bother, Second Lord.

175
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,250
The disciples of our villa give treatment to me every day.

176
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,370
That's good.

177
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,670
I won't disturb you any longer.

The next one is that old woman.

180
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,280
We must kill her at once.

181
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,060
Otherwise, there will be more trouble.

Don't let even a fly come out.

185
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,500
Yes.

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,300
is heartbroken and is critically ill.

188
00:12:58,330 --> 00:13:01,660
I'm afraid she won't be able to survive these one or two days.

189
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,450
Spread this news.

190
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,080
If she dies, she will die of illness.

191
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,810
I won't be blamed.

192
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,580
I'll do it right away.

193
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,250
There's one more thing.

194
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,110
Although An Jingzhao is dead,

195
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,680
we still haven't seen his corpse yet.

196
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,450
It's still a hidden danger after all.

197
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,050
We can take this opportunity

198
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,060
to verify it again.

199
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,800
If he is still alive,

200
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,440
when he hears that the old madam is critically ill,

201
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,640
he'll surely understand that the old madam is my hostage.

202
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,680
He'll definitely come back to rescue her.

203
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,920
Master, you're wise.

204
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,370
Chuyue.

205
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,340
Ms. Qiao.

206
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,710
Why do you look so sad?

207
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:44,680
Nothing.

208
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,450
Give me the notice.

209
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,920
You passed the second test.

210
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,980
This is the notice.

211
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,230
[Notice]

212
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,230
[Li Chuyue: You've passed the second round of the New Apparel Designer Competition]

213
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,230
[Now you're officially invited to participate in the final of the competition]

214
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,040
-Thank you, Ms. Qiao. -Don't be happy so soon.

215
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,700
This is just the second round.

216
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,750
You still need to participate in the final.

217
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,480
In the final,

218
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,510
competitors need to present their own design drafts.

219
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:13,840
That's the final test.

220
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,650
I will work hard

221
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,030
to get a prize.

222
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,050
There's still half a month before the competition.

223
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,550
With your current level,

224
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,970
you can only focus on one thing.

225
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,090
So, you don't need to

226
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,170
come to work in the next half month.

227
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,980
You should go prepare for the clothes.

228
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,600
But that's the maximum amount of time I can give you.

229
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,950
You should work hard after you come back.

230
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,610
Okay, okay, okay.

231
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:39,250
Ms. Qiao.

232
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,340
Bring me the fragment

233
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:42,980
on my desk.

234
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,420
Okay.

235
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,850
In your design,

236
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:50,530
you've used a lot of extremely soft and exquisite fabric

237
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,800
and the elements of embroidery.

238
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,380
Normally, when embroidery is used on this kind of fabric,

239
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,300
it'll deform.

240
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,300
So,

241
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,330
we must find

242
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,280
very good embroidery techniques.

243
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,540
I've found this piece of

244
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,080
embroidery which may suit your clothes.

245
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,440
Although it was made many years ago,

246
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,650
this technique is very rare.

247
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,570
You can take it to look for this technique.

248
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,330
Ms. Qiao, please accept my bow.

249
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Your cutest brother will treat you to dinner tonight.

250
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,650
Okay.

251
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,680
Give me a few minutes.

252
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:02,770
Let me finish.

253
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,630
If you want to leave after that, I won't force you to stay.

254
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:09,030
Ten minutes. I still have work to do.

255
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,300
I didn't let you go back with me that day

256
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,250
because I received the news that

257
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,980
Zhou Wei was going to kill Ling.

258
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,810
Although the plan of fake death

259
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,940
has made Zhou Wei relax his vigilance,

260
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,800
he still won't believe it easily.

261
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,230
Are Hottie and Jingling all right?

262
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,150
They're fine.

263
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,150
Don't be angry, okay?

264
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,480
Do you know why I'm angry?

265
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,620
We agreed to be together.

266
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,480
At a dangerous moment like that,

267
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,010
we should face it together,

268
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,680
instead of letting me hide away to avoid danger.

269
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,560
Right. It's my fault.

270
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,790
But I did this because

271
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,760
you are the most important person to me in the world.

272
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,740
I can't put you in danger.

273
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,730
I know you did this for my own good.

274
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,530
But you didn't tell me anything.

275
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,220
I didn't know

276
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,300
what kind of danger you would encounter.

277
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,030
I didn't even know that you almost lost your life.

278
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,860
It's my fault.

279
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,510
It's my fault. I made you worry.

280
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,810
What I need is that

281
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,470
no matter what happens,

282
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,420
we should face it and solve the problem together.

283
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,020
Okay?

284
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:11,760
Okay.

285
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,220
No matter what happens in the future,

286
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,480
we'll face it together

287
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,300
and solve the problem together.

288
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:21,520
Have you recovered from the injury caused by the Cold Ice Palm?

289
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,500
Don't worry about me.

290
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,990
I have practiced

291
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,619
according to the spell which my grandmother told me about.

292
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,350
I'm feeling much better today.

293
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,760
Who's worried about you?

294
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,290
I haven't forgiven you yet.

295
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,810
There's one more thing I want to tell you.

296
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,320
There will be thunder and rain tomorrow.

297
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,030
I need to go back to the Yunwei Villa again.

298
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,450
Everything is going according to plan.

299
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:49,040
I will save Ling and my grandmother from the villa

300
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,840
so that they can get away safely.

301
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,550
Now I have nothing to hide from you.

302
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,020
I won't hide anything from you anymore.

303
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,680
Can we make up with each other?

304
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,170
You promise?

305
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:00,940
I promise.

306
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,890
Young Madam.

307
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,930
I have something to say.

308
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,170
Since our young lord met you,

309
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,060
he has always cared about you.

310
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,400
He has changed from a pure young man

311
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,920
to someone who loves his wife so affectionately.

312
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,110
Everyone is jealous about

313
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,510
his love for you.

314
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,950
Just don't be angry.

315
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,080
Young Madam,

316
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,740
please forgive our young lord

317
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,780
so that the fans of

318
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:27,420
loving couples like us

319
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,870
can smile like an aunt.

320
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,100
Is the statement online wrong?

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,650
I'm a man.

322
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,690
It should be smiling like an uncle, right?

323
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,420
Alright. I forgive you.

324
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:49,030
You haven't seen what I prepared for you.

325
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,200
This is a photo of you when you were five, right?

326
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,110
At that time, your dream was to

327
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:14,150
eat all the snacks, right?

328
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,170
So I've brought some snacks.

329
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,140
I made these snacks myself.

330
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,950
They're snacks from the Yunwei Villa.

331
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,280
I hope it's not too late to bring them here.

332
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,780
In that case,

333
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:36,550
it seems we once went to school together.

334
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,660
When you studied, I practiced martial arts skills.

335
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,300
We both worked hard for our career.

336
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:47,890
So,

337
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,570
it's not a big deal to belong to two different worlds.

338
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,240
As long as we are together,

339
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
there's nothing we can't overcome.

340
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:02,890
How come there's no other content after that page?

341
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:03,730
From now on,

342
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,790
we'll be together forever.

343
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,330
We will never be apart from each other.

344
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,410
Let's fill it up little by little.

345
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,290
[Yunwei Villa]

346
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,970
This letter must be sent to the Qixia Mountain.

347
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,140
[To Master Xuanfeng]

348
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,610
Madam, don’t worry.

349
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:46,290
Madam, since you will hold a ritual for the young lord tomorrow,

350
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,350
I'll ask someone to send the letter out with the excuse of

351
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,740
going out to buy incense.

352
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,590
There are Zhou Wei's spies everywhere outside.

353
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,900
Tell the messenger to be very careful.

354
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,450
Don't let them find out.

355
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't worry, Madam.

356
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,910
Madam.

357
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,170
Zhou Wei.

358
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,520
What do you want to do?

359
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,870
At this point,

360
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,270
there's no need to pretend between us.

361
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,630
You can choose one of these two things.

362
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,080
Before I die,

363
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,630
I want to see Chenghu.

364
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,290
It's natural for you to feel like seeing him.

365
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:08,810
Sure.

366
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,340
I...

367
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,180
I want to go closer and see how Chenghu is.

368
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,120
Go.

369
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,290
Chenghu!

370
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,820
My son!

371
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,220
My son!

372
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,850
What happened to you, my son?

373
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,540
Chenghu!

374
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,620
Don't listen to Zhou Wei anymore.

375
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,150
-He wants to take the villa away! -Madam.

376
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,950
He's just a treacherous man!

377
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,490
-Madam. -He's just a treacherous man!

378
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,750
It's almost time for you to leave.

379
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:12,640
We should go.

380
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,840
My lord.

381
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:19,160
The old madam has been feeling unwell recently,

382
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,820
and she has many misunderstandings towards me.

383
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,480
Madam.

384
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,770
His Lordship needs to rest quietly.

385
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,370
Let’s go.

386
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:30,340
Chenghu.

387
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,020
Chenghu!

388
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,770
My son!

389
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:48,550
Madam.

390
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,760
I think you should give up.

391
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,140
Zhou Wei,

392
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,420
I have one last request.

393
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,620
What is it now?

394
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,560
Tomorrow is the seventh day after Zhao's death.

395
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,830
I want to hold a ritual for Zhao.

396
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:10,260
Sure.

397
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,060
Find a way

398
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:52,810
to replace Zhou Wei's men in the Lingxiao Yard.

399
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,960
The priest will send disciples

400
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,590
to pray in the Lingxiao Yard.

401
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
I've replaced the disciples

402
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,570
with our men who are very reliable.

403
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:00,150
By then,

404
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:03,270
they will find a way to replace Zhou Wei's guards.

405
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:03,890
Okay.

406
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:08,180
Don't let Zhou Wei find Zhao's trace.

407
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,580
Master.

408
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:20,420
The old madam asked someone to send a letter, and it was intercepted at the Qixia Temple.

409
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:25,020
The letter says that she wants to have a get-together with Master Xuanfeng at the Chongyue Pavilion.

410
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,800
Xuanfeng?

411
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,240
The old madam wants to get reinforcements.

412
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,250
It's not that easy.

413
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,800
Amitabha.

414
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:47,220
Madam, the young lord will surely ascend to the paradise soon.

415
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:49,310
My condolences, Madam.

416
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,270
-Madam. -Madam.

417
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,840
I've sent my disciples to the Lingxiao Yard

418
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,760
to see the young lord off.

419
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,150
Thank you, Master.

420
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,860
Amitabha.

421
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,640
Follow them. Keep an eye on them.

422
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,700
Don't let them play any tricks.

423
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:11,410
Yes.

424
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,770
As you expected,

425
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,410
there's something fishy about these people.

426
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,810
There must be a secret in the Lingxiao Yard.

427
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,240
Maybe An Jingzhao is still alive.

428
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:29,890
Madam.

429
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:33,010
Since the ritual is over,

430
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,480
please go back.

431
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,820
Madam.

432
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,370
That's the wrong direction.

433
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,770
Where do you want me to go?

434
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,160
Lingxiao Yard.

435
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,740
Be careful when you go back.

436
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,710
Don't worry.

437
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,850
I'm ready.

438
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,180
Why don't you let Donghua go back with you?

439
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,130
You can take care of each other if there's any problem.

440
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,140
It's easy to attract attention if there are many people.

441
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,780
No need.

442
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,490
According to the weather forecast,

443
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:08,030
there will be strong thunder and lightning in six hours.

444
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,490
Can you come back tonight?

445
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,100
Don't worry.

446
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,740
I'll be back as soon as possible.

447
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,270
Okay. I'll wait for you.

448
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,240
It's the first time that I’ve come to the young lord's bedroom.

449
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:01,600
The decoration is really elegant.

450
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,880
[Lingxiao Yard is full of Zhou Wei's spies. Zhao, be careful when you come back.]

451
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,860
Grandmother.

452
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,200
There will be thunder and rain at 3 p.m. in three days.

453
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,140
You must delay the time of my father regaining consciousness.

454
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:16,700
Besides,

455
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,220
since Zhou Wei has strengthened his defense in the Lingxiao Yard,

456
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,480
let's change our plan.

457
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,520
When you send the letter to Master Xuanfeng,

458
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,620
Zhou Wei will definitely send someone to follow the messenger.

459
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,890
Just purposely let Zhou Wei's man

460
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,220
intercepte the letter.

461
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,300
Then send the letter to Master Xuanfeng secretly.

462
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,120
This is the first step.

463
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:34,740
Secondly,

464
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:37,380
when the priest goes to the Lingxiao Yard to deliver the joss paper,

465
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,250
ask our men to mingle with the crowds

466
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,980
and deliberately give away the hidden information.

467
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,980
This matter will definitely make Zhou Wei suspicious.

468
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,980
He'll suspect that I'm still alive,

469
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,870
and will be sure that I might appear in the Lingxiao Yard.

470
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:13,140
[Chongyue Pavilion]

471
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,450
Is An Jingzhao really dead?

472
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,640
Madam.

473
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,860
It's time to make a choice.

474
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,270
An Jingzhao

475
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,710
hasn't shown up till now.

476
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:57,090
That means he's really dead.

477
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,220
Madam.

478
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,190
Second Lord.

479
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,350
Xuanfeng wants to see the old madam.

480
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,950
Xuanfeng?

481
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,560
Yes.

482
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,750
Zhao once saved Master Xuanfeng.

483
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:10,350
So,

484
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,980
Master Xuanfeng has come to attend Zhao's ritual.

485
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,250
Madam, what a good tactic you've used.

486
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,560
You deliberately let me intercept the secret letter,

487
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,080
and then sent

488
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,390
the real letter stealthily.

489
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,600
Send my message.

490
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,120
The old madam is seriously ill. She can't see any visitors.

491
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,540
Yes.

492
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,950
Second Lord, Master Xuanfeng has barged in.

493
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,150
We couldn't stop him.

494
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,660
If he knows that the old mandam is killed by me.

495
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,600
it'll be unjustified for me to become Lord of Yunwei Villa.

496
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,480
Put away the things.

497
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:55,920
Yes.

498
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:08,940
Madam.

499
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,620
Master Yunwei.

500
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,150
Second Lord.

501
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,610
How are you, Madam?

502
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:18,700
People outside have been saying that you are seriously ill.

503
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:19,300
I'm fine.

504
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,150
I'm feeling much better after resting for a few days.

505
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:24,700
That's good.

506
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,650
I've been dealing with some chores near the villa.

507
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,590
I've come to the villa to talk to you.

508
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,220
Second Lord, sorry to bother you.

509
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,790
Don't say that, Master Xuanfeng.

510
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,460
The old madam has been in a low mood recently.

511
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,860
Please help to ease her anxiety.

512
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,890
Amitabha.

513
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,320
Madam, enjoy your chat with Master Xuanfeng.

514
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,580
I'm leaving.

515
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,520
Second Lord.

516
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,300
There's something unusual in His Lordship's residence.

517
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,020
Let's go have a look.

518
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,580
Father.

519
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:36,270
Father.

520
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:41,570
-Zhao. -It’s me.

521
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,790
How come it's you? Well...

522
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,940
What's going on?

523
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:50,389
Why is there a chain?

524
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,880
Help me up.

525
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:57,850
Zhao.

526
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,680
How come it seems that I have forgotten many things?

527
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:08,250
Father, you've finally recovered.

528
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,620
Father, Zhou Wei has been lying to you.

529
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,720
He fed you with the medicine that made you lose your mind,

530
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,150
and asked you to do everything according to his intention.

531
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,220
Nonsense!

532
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,770
Zhou Wei is my buddy who has gone through many kinds of danger with me.

533
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,450
He was the one who saved my life.

534
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,730
That's why I was able to establish the Yunwei Villa.

535
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,460
He would never do such a thing.

536
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Father, I'm telling the truth.

537
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,360
Zhou Wei was once a member of the evil sect.

538
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,470
He disguised himself as someone with a decent background and entered the Yunwei Villa.

539
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,530
His purpose is to take over the Yunwei Villa.

540
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,190
He has always had this ambition.

541
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,640
He repeatedly hurt me.

542
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,600
He sent people to guard the Yiju Hall day and night

543
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,580
and fed you with the medicine that made you lose your mind.

544
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,380
If it weren't for Dr. Luo who gave you treatment...

545
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:49,270
An Jingzhao?

546
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,010
Are you a human or a ghost?

547
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,860
Surround the house.

548
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,040
Don't let even a fly out.

549
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,460
Yes!

550
00:36:33,690 --> 00:36:34,820
Surround the house!

551
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:48,860
Father.

552
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,990
Anyway, you must believe in what I said.

553
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,560
Zhou Wei sent someone to kill me.

554
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,700
Fortunately, I took precautions in advance

555
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,440
and jumped off the cliff to escape.

556
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,550
All these years, he has been obedient to me.

557
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,020
I didn't expect that

558
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,780
he was actually so ambitious.

559
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,700
There's no time to lose. Let's leave now.

560
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,330
Okay.

561
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:28,970
Father.

562
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,100
Leave at once!

563
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,580
Father!

564
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,970
-Leave at once! -Why are you doing this?

565
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,930
Leave at once!

566
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,240
Zhao. Zhao.

567
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:47,890
There is a secret tunnel here.

568
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,290
You should leave at once.

569
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,240
Let's leave together.

570
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,160
With my condition like this,

571
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,800
neither of us will be able to leave by that time.

572
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,910
Don't worry. I'll protect myself.

573
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,450
After you arrange everything,

574
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:59,400
you can come and save me, and it won't be too late.

575
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,610
Be good. Go.

576
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,820
Go!

577
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:06,300
Go! Go!

578
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,140
How is it?

579
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,290
Things have changed. The young lord has been discovered.

580
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:53,420
Don't worry, Madam.

581
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,130
I'll protect the young lord.

582
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,730
Okay.

583
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,510
An Jingzhao,

584
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,820
You must come back safely.
