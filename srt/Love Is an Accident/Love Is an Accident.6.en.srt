00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,560
Here comes the fish.

5
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,530
Chuyue, dinner is ready.

6
00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:45,350
Let's have dinner.

7
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,020
Be careful.

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,740
Come on.

9
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,130
Let's eat. Come on.

10
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,020
Come on. Sit down.

11
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,020
Where is that guy?

12
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,650
Hurry up.

13
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,400
Come on, sit.

14
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,620
-Have a seat here.
-Chuyang.

15
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,330
Sit over there.

16
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,190
Come on.

17
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:02,770
-Sit. -Okay.

18
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,580
Relax.

19
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,350
Since I'm a guest,

20
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,650
you can eat with me.

21
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:13,650
Dad, Mom.

22
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:14,950
He's an actor.

23
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,240
He just finished a period drama.

24
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,300
Maybe he's too immersed in the drama.

25
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,290
No wonder.

26
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,040
You're immersed.

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,670
An Jingzhao.

28
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,060
This is my home, not Yunwei Villa.

29
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,320
Can you talk normally?

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,260
Did I say anything abnormal?

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,500
No.

32
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,380
No.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,329
What's his name?

34
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,720
An Jingzhao.

35
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,160
Oh, it's An.

36
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,560
An,

37
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,610
do you have a house?

38
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,130
Mom.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,400
Why do you ask that?

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,540
I'm asking him.

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,570
Why do you care so much?

42
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:46,730
Of course.

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,120
Which floor do you live on?

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,870
The first floor.

45
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,460
A bungalow?

46
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,290
It might be in a "village in the city".

47
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:02,490
Will your house be demolished in the future?

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,250
Demolished?

49
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,570
He's not very rich.

50
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,660
A good-looking face is useless.

51
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,220
I wonder how much he earns.

52
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,740
Let's just eat.

53
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,660
Let me ask about the income.

54
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,590
Please eat.

55
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,160
An.

56
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,320
It must be tough being an actor.

57
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,400
What are you filming these days?

58
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,410
Mom.

59
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,880
I'm asking him.

60
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,040
Dramas are played with this.

61
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,470
People film a story with the equipment

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,920
and then play it on TV.

63
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,650
The boat scene.

64
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,450
Good.

65
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,420
You actors work so hard.

66
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,160
How much can you make for a TV drama?

67
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,820
Mom,

68
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,180
An Jingzhao is still a newbie.

69
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,140
He can't make much money.

70
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,320
Can you stop prying

71
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,890
and eat like a normal person?

72
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,010
Let's eat.

73
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,690
Chuyue, come here.

74
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,420
I have something to tell you.

75
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,760
Chuyang,

76
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,610
eat up.

77
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,279
Then finish your homework.

78
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:21,290
An,

79
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,060
make yourself at home.

80
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,850
This fish

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,830
is made by Chuyue's mom.

82
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,890
It's very yummy.

83
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,240
Yummy?

84
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,350
It means delicious.

85
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:38,600
Am I right, Yang?

86
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:40,700
Try it.

87
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,370
I have another question.

88
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,620
What does "fricking thickhead" mean?

89
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,460
Fricking thickhead?

90
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:46,920
Fric…

91
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,580
Isn't that just my sister?

92
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,220
Yang.

93
00:04:51,409 --> 00:04:52,290
It is.

94
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:53,659
Well...

95
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,960
Fricking thickhead means…

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,620
a bigheaded person

97
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,930
f-freaks

98
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:08,370
out.

99
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,140
Yes.

100
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,530
A big-headed person freaks out.

101
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:16,900
Thank you.

102
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:48,710
Hello?

103
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,740
Chuyue.

104
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,890
Where have you been these days?

105
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,550
You didn't reply the messages

106
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,720
and your phone has been off.

107
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,580
Zhou Meizi asked about you several times,

108
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,580
and she got angry.

109
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,900
You need to be mentally prepared
when you come to work tomorrow.

110
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,240
Okay.

111
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,909
I see.

112
00:05:59,409 --> 00:06:01,230
I've encountered some special situations recently.

113
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,560
I'll explain tomorrow.

114
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,650
Are you talking to me?

115
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,780
Whatever Zhou Meizi says tomorrow,

116
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
just bear with it.

117
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,480
Okay.

118
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,570
I see.

119
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,820
Thank you, darling.

120
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,490
Gug hug.

121
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,280
What are you doing?

122
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,760
Didn't you just say

123
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,820
"hug hug?"

124
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,330
I'm talking to my colleague.

125
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,170
Oh, nothing.

126
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:26,700
Nothing.

127
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,810
This thing

128
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,400
allows people to hear each other from a distance?

129
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,180
Chuyue,

130
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,030
we're going out to buy some fruit.

131
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,090
We'll be back soon.

132
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,820
I have to go.

133
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:40,710
I'm hanging up.

134
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,400
I'm going to wash up and go to bed.

135
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,330
Enjoy yourself.

136
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,100
Chuyue, what took you so long?

137
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,210
Oh, An.

138
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,450
Where is Chuyue?

139
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,390
She said she went to wash up and sleep.

140
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,790
Mom! Mom!

141
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,740
What's wrong, Mom?

142
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,890
What are you doing?

143
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,540
Open the unit door for me.

144
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,800
I didn't bring the key.

145
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:40,970
This painter

146
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,419
is very skilled.

147
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Your portrait

148
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,300
looks the same as you.

149
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:48,290
That is not painted by a painter.

150
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,150
That is a photo.

151
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,180
Here.

152
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,790
Let me take a photo for you.

153
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,660
Smile.

154
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:56,180
Look.

155
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,180
With this, you can take photos anytime anywhere.

156
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,380
It's better than your painters, right?

157
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,810
A painter

158
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,570
can paint several people at the same time.

159
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,300
Can this thing do that?

160
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,100
Of course.

161
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,250
Come on.

162
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,860
Smile.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,440
Mom.

164
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
An Jingzhao said

165
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
he wanted to crash here tonight.

166
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,490
We still have

167
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,300
something work-related to talk about.

168
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,490
We're going back to our room.

169
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,020
Let's go.

170
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,300
Let's go.

171
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,820
Let's go.

172
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:42,820
Hurry up.

173
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,770
Let's go.

174
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,610
Let's go.

175
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,830
I want you to help me go back.

176
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,560
Go back?

177
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,070
Impossible.

178
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:57,780
What if I can't come back again if I go back?

179
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,300
An Jingzhao,

180
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,250
you took me as an assassin and wanted to kill me.

181
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,660
Now I promise to take you in for one night.

182
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,190
I'm far more than generous.

183
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,490
Hurry up.

184
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,490
This...

185
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,000
An,

186
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,330
it's late.

187
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:14,610
How about

188
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,700
you crash

189
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,250
in Chuyang's room tonight?

190
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,200
I never sleep with anyone else.

191
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,250
But you can't sleep here all night.

192
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:24,750
This...

193
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,560
Mom, Mom.

194
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,560
I'll sleep in the guest room.

195
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,820
He can sleep in my room.

196
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,020
Then we won't tell you

197
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,130
when we go back tomorrow.

198
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:32,580
Okay.

199
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:34,770
Here.

200
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,030
Is An Jingzhao stupid or what?

201
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,240
Why is he that rude?

202
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,890
I think that kid

203
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:02,130
is unsophisticated and upright.

204
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,720
He doesn't mess around.

205
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,450
That's good.

206
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,860
How did you see that?

207
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,740
Is it enough not to mess around?

208
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:12,890
However,

209
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,190
luckily, Chuyue said

210
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,500
they just met

211
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,970
and they had nothing to do with each other.

212
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,050
Go to bed.

213
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,650
Go to bed.

214
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,940
Pervert!

215
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,480
Rascal!

216
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,440
Indeed.

217
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,670
Somebody

218
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,220
sneaked into my bed in the middle of the night.

219
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,610
She is indeed a pervert

220
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,150
and a rascal.

221
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:54,580
Wait.

222
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,820
This is my home.

223
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
This is my bed.

224
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,670
An Jingzhao,

225
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,650
I've taken you in for a night.

226
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,180
Don't stay at my home today.

227
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:10,790
I've thought about it.

228
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,160
We can try kissing.

229
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,220
If you agree,

230
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:18,360
I won't have to stay here anymore.

231
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,570
Impossible.

232
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,050
I finally escaped from the fire pit.

233
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,580
How can I jump into it again?

234
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,800
If you agree,

235
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,310
when we return to Shangyu,

236
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,130
I'll give you 10,000 taels of gold

237
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,390
and several mansions.

238
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,510
Gold, silver,

239
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,370
and jewelry,

240
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,650
you can have as much as you like.

241
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,180
Ten thousand taels of gold?

242
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,140
Then I can lead a retired life

243
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,850
in advance in Shangyu.

244
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,420
If I have several houses,

245
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,410
I can keep lovers in my luxurious houses.

246
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,620
Not only can I have Consort Gu,

247
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,840
but also Concubine Zhang and Concubine Li.

248
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,220
Looks like you've made up your mind.

249
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,730
No.

250
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,710
I'm staying at home.

251
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,460
I have to fulfill my dream as a designer.

252
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,840
I need to wash my face, brush my teeth, and go to work.

253
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:33,590
[Prince Charming]

254
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,260
An Jingzhao.

255
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,840
Stop following me.

256
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,540
I told you, it's impossible.

257
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,900
All right.

258
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,200
I finally got rid of that pain in the neck.

259
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,160
Please wipe your card.

260
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:13,770
Sir.

261
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,890
I'll pay for him with my card.

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,390
Hey,

263
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,220
you're so handsome.

264
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,340
So good-looking.

265
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,810
Darn, in this era, you're only judged by your face.

266
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,650
I actually started to like

267
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,650
the shallow style of your hometown.

268
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,530
Shameless!

269
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,850
I'll say it again.

270
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,380
I won't help you go back.

271
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:53,510
It's useless for you to follow me.

272
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,610
Why don't you try

273
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:55,950
the high-tech here.

274
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,840
The mall here is a good place to loiter around.

275
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,270
Things are much more abundant
here than in Shangyu.

276
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,050
What's the use of the pure quantity?

277
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,380
Everything is the same.

278
00:17:03,570 --> 00:17:05,859
How can they compare to the items in Yunwei Villa?

279
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,569
Our things are exquisite and interesting.

280
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,810
I have a dozen kinds of paperweights alone.

281
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,260
They all have different styles.

282
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,900
Green jade dragon paperweights with reliefs.

283
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,660
White cloud-patterned paperweights.

284
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,240
Rosewood paperweights inlaid with jade.

285
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,250
White jade paperweights with mountain and river sculptures.

286
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,130
Each of them

287
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,140
takes craftsmen at least a year

288
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
to carve.

289
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,619
And each one is a treasure for the experts.

290
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,410
Each one is unique.

291
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,050
Stand up.

292
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,290
Get up and offer your seat.

293
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:46,750
Come on.

294
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,080
Sit here, please.

295
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,740
Thank you.

296
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,250
You're welcome.

297
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,110
How interesting.

298
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,220
Thank you.

299
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,770
Go ahead.

300
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,970
This young man…

301
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,420
It's so funny.

302
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,670
Be careful.

303
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,780
Are you getting carsick?

304
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,200
What is carsick?

305
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,380
Be careful.

306
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,650
Come here.

307
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,290
Go get some air.

308
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,460
Go.

309
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,070
Get some fresh air.

310
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,850
You'll be fine after a while.

311
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,170
Or,

312
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:41,800
when we get to the next stop,

313
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,930
we can get off for some fresh air. Okay?

314
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:54,600
Come on, get off.

315
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,220
Careful.

316
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,580
You'll be fine after getting some fresh air.

317
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:15,220
Come on.

318
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,490
Have a seat.

319
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,080
Ten minutes have passed.

320
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,670
Are you feeling better?

321
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
A little.

322
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,550
I'm going to be late.

323
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,690
Don't follow me.

324
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,750
Don't follow me.

325
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,870
Don't follow me.

326
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,130
Don't follow me.

327
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Remember to print it and put it on my desk.

328
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:08,790
Okay.

329
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,190
Director,

330
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:54,990
Mr. Dachuan, the photographer, has arrived.

331
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,390
When will the model come?

332
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,570
Oh no.

333
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,510
I drank too much yesterday.

334
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,720
How could I forget the shooting date?

335
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,320
I haven't sealed the deal with Yang Daming.

336
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,250
What should I do?

337
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,140
Meizi.

338
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,320
Where's the model?

339
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,020
When will he arrive?

340
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:12,690
Do you know

341
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:15,460
how important the poster for the first season is?

342
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,860
We must get the photos shot today,

343
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,220
so we can print them tomorrow.

344
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,710
We must

345
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,990
launch it earlier than our competitors.

346
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:25,960
Li Chuyue,

347
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,700
not only did you skip work for no reason,

348
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,990
but also didn't do what I told you to do.

349
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,580
Let me ask you.

350
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,840
Where is the model I asked you to contact?

351
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:35,330
Director Zhou.

352
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,870
I didn't come to work

353
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,230
because of an accident.

354
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,620
Besides,

355
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,730
you didn't leave the model thing to me.

356
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,360
You said you would contact him yourself.

357
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,320
Are you even lying and looking for excuses?

358
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,420
When did I say I would take charge myself?

359
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,350
I'm telling you.

360
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,360
The poster shooting is very important.

361
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,960
If you can't finish it today,

362
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,260
get lost immediately.

363
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,240
I have to make it clear before I leave.

364
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,940
I won't take the blame if it's not my fault.

365
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,470
What kind of person are you?

366
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:08,460
Boss,

367
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,890
this is my discussion of work with Zhou Meizi.

368
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,600
She never

369
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,550
entrusted me with the model thing.

370
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,390
Do me a favor.

371
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,460
Let's walk out of here like the big bosses.

372
00:22:59,460 --> 00:22:59,940
Go.

373
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,490
Fine.

374
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,180
I don't care which of you is responsible.

375
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,440
The model must be here,

376
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,870
and the poster must be done today.

377
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,230
Or you'll have to get lost too.

378
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,700
[General Manager's Office]

379
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,280
Director Zhou,

380
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,610
shall we ask Mr. Dachuan

381
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,650
if he can accept a different model?

382
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,050
You're right.

383
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,610
That guy seems to have a good figure.

384
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,080
Why don't we give it a try?

385
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,590
Who is he?

386
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,380
Will it work?

387
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,470
Let me ask

388
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:43,020
if Mr. Dachuan can accept changing the model.

389
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,200
What?

390
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,710
Changing the model?

391
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,110
What I want is

392
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,790
Yang Daming's handsome face.

393
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,850
Now you're telling me you're replacing him?

394
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,510
Newbies nowadays don't have that temperament.

395
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:58,020
Mr. Dachuan, please make an exception for us.

396
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,680
Yang Daming can't come today,

397
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,360
but we have to finish our poster shooting today.

398
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,210
I don't care.

399
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,220
If Yang Daming doesn't come today,

400
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,570
we won't be able to shoot.

401
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:07,630
Let's call it a day.

402
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,730
Who is he?

403
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:15,570
His temperament is as good as Yang Daming's.

404
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,920
I think he can give it a try.

405
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,370
Chuyue.

406
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,730
Chuyue.

407
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,520
Could I borrow your handsome friend

408
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,760
to be the model today

409
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,460
and finish the poster shooting?

410
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,140
Model?

411
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,000
Are you kidding me?

412
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,940
Mr. Dachuan and Gu Qingfeng both recommended him.

413
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,270
There'll be no problem.

414
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,440
Gu Qingfeng?

415
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,250
Yes.

416
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,990
Are you kidding me?

417
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,540
Do I need his recommendation?

418
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
Let's go, Chuyue.

419
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,570
What?

420
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,620
Handsome,

421
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,950
please do us a favor.

422
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,450
I brought him here.

423
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,310
If I say he won't go, then he won't.

424
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,090
Chuyue,

425
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,530
I know

426
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,590
your dream is to be a designer.

427
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,210
But I heard

428
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,900
you missed the designer competition this time.

429
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,650
If you help me this time,

430
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,910
I'll recommend you

431
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,860
to be Ms. Qiao's designer assistant.

432
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,000
The person recommended by Ms. Qiao

433
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,130
can enter the quarterfinal directly.

434
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,180
Ms. Qiao?

435
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,180
She is one of the best designers in China.

436
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,090
Plus, I can even be recommended
to the quarterfinal by her.

437
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,940
My goodness.

438
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,780
I must seize this opportunity.

439
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,950
Since you begged me like that,

440
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,190
I'll help you.

441
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,010
You…

442
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,730
Young Lord,

443
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,380
can you do me a favor to be the model?

444
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,660
You just need to take photos and act cool.

445
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,340
With your body, appearance,

446
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,570
and noble temperament,

447
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,060
I'm sure you can do it.

448
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,860
I said I wouldn't go if it was Gu Qingfeng
who recommended me.

449
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,980
What does this have to do with Gu Qingfeng?

450
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,800
Young Lord,

451
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,050
I really need this chance.

452
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:53,980
Please help me.

453
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:56,520
Please. Please.

454
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,340
If you promise to help me go back to Shangyu,

455
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,980
I'll help you.

456
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,860
Ms. Qiao rarely recruits an assistant.

457
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,380
This is a rare opportunity.

458
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,800
I can't miss it.

459
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,810
The passage is open anyway.

460
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,390
Even if we're really taken to Shangyu by accident,

461
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,070
I can still come back later.

462
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:19,920
Deal.

463
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,470
Great suit.

464
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,890
How is this great?

465
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,640
It's so strange and inappropriate.

466
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,770
And what is this?

467
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,700
Can I take it off?

468
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,610
No.

469
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,340
This suit is very decent.

470
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,220
You're a handsome young man in it.

471
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:15,610
Ready?

472
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:16,490
Can we start now?

473
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,490
Yes, Mr. Dachuan.

474
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:18,570
Come on.

475
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:19,940
Let's go over there.

476
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,410
It's okay.

477
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,980
These are all pieces of equipment
for photo-shooting.

478
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,510
They can make you look cool.

479
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:28,870
Mr. Dachuan,

480
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,490
it's my friend's

481
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,360
first time to shoot in such a professional place.

482
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,610
Can you give him some time to get used to it?

483
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,050
Okay.

484
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,050
Go get used to it.

485
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:34,730
Go.

486
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,180
Look.

487
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,160
There isn't any problem.

488
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:42,170
Come here.

489
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,960
Try it.

490
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,360
Stand here.

491
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,570
Okay,

492
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,370
Mr. Dachuan.

493
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,620
-Is it okay to start?
-Yes.

494
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,140
Come on.

495
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:01,700
Okay.

496
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,620
You can

497
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,340
make a pose randomly.

498
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:06,470
Let's do it this way.

499
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,030
Do as I do.

500
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,460
Put one hand

501
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,500
on the collar of your suit,

502
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:13,330
and the other one in your pocket.

503
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,040
Very good.

504
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,620
Great.

505
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,410
Your friend should be able to do it.

506
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,370
Relax.

507
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,050
Thank you for your recommendation, Mr. Qingfeng.

508
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:21,620
It's my pleasure.

509
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,050
Okay.

510
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,460
Look at me.

511
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,770
Okay, look at me.

512
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,210
Mr. Dachuan, please wait a moment.

513
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,610
Get your position ready.

514
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:31,960
Hurry up.

515
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:33,810
Come on.

516
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:36,700
Come on.

517
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,110
An Jingzhao.

518
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,280
Behave well.

519
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,460
Otherwise, I won't help you go back to Shangyu.

520
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:47,790
Come on.

521
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,390
That's the pose. Don't move.

522
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,250
Come on.

523
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,020
All right,

524
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,750
Mr. Dachuan.

525
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,710
Let's begin.

526
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:53,860
Here.

527
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,670
Let's try it.

528
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,020
That's it. It's good.

529
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,180
Mr. Dachuan.

530
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,550
I'm sorry.

531
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,090
Please...

532
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,490
just wait a little while.

533
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,290
What now?

534
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,010
You said it was not dangerous.

535
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,860
What is that?

536
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,180
It is not dangerous.

537
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,290
It can make you more handsome

538
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,420
and more charming.

539
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:12,730
It will make me blind.

540
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,710
No.

541
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,740
What's wrong?

542
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,700
She kept staring at me,

543
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,740
which made me uneasy.

544
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,200
Can you control yourself?

545
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,250
Okay.

546
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:30,220
Work harder! Come on!

547
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:31,640
Okay.

548
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,300
Let's do it.

549
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,610
Like that.

550
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:34,740
Okay.

551
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,410
Great.

552
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,380
Look at this one.

553
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,090
Great.

554
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,140
Good.

555
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,070
Nice!

556
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,090
Keep it like that.

557
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,940
Keep it like that.

558
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,660
Good.

559
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,990
You've got the feeling.

560
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:44,700
It's natural.

561
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,570
Very good.

562
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:46,940
Good.

563
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,460
Okay.

564
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,140
Let's change to the second outfit.

565
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,620
Okay.

566
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,700
Over here.

567
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:53,050
Thank you.

568
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:53,620
An Jingzhao.

569
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,290
I need to take this call.

570
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:54,700
Here.

571
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,010
Have some water.

572
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:58,460
Okay.

573
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,340
Look.

574
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,680
Look at the last picture.

575
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,420
Hello, Mom.

576
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:04,840
Chuyue.

577
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,220
I'm calling to tell you

578
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,820
your dad and I are going back.

579
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,370
Okay.

580
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,250
Take care.

581
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm still working.

582
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:10,920
Bye.

583
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,250
Wait.

584
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:13,940
Tell me.

585
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,600
Is An Jingzhao really your colleague?

586
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,290
Yes.

587
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,240
I'm hanging up.

588
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:19,680
Bye.

589
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,900
The second group of photos

590
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,530
aims to show you're handsome and charming.

591
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,070
Okay.

592
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,480
Give me a look that is handsome and powerful.

593
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,410
Or pose that way.

594
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:32,910
Let's try.

595
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,770
You must be tired.

596
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,100
Thank you.

597
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,370
Be handsome.

598
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,060
Open your mouth slightly.

599
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,540
Open your mouth slightly.

600
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,110
No.

601
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,050
That's not right at all.

602
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:44,780
Mr. Dachuan.

603
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:45,990
Allow me.

604
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:47,590
Give me a little more time.

605
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,220
An Jingzhao,

606
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,460
for our common goal,

607
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,080
just sacrifice a little.

608
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:56,460
Please help me.

609
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,520
What are you doing?

610
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,940
Please help me.

611
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,630
I really want to go to the Design Department

612
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,090
and to be Ms. Qiao's assistant.

613
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:02,750
Don't move.

614
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,810
This place is different from Shangyu.

615
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:09,010
Taking off your clothes not only doesn't matter,

616
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,410
but also it will attract girls' attention.

617
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:12,420
Come on.

618
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,190
You can do it.

619
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,480
That's it.

620
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:17,980
It's okay, Mr. Dachuan.

621
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,580
Is it okay?

622
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,290
Yes.

623
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,220
That's good.

624
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,190
Great.

625
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,440
Good.

626
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,330
Great.

627
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,150
Keep smiling. Good.

628
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:31,910
The look in your eyes is good.

629
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,710
Very good.

630
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:33,900
Come on.

631
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,770
Okay.

632
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,240
Show the magazine to the model

633
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,240
for reference.

634
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,420
Let's take the couple's photo later.

635
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,900
Here.

636
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:41,900
Chuyue.

637
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,770
I have something else to do. I'm leaving.

638
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:44,180
Okay.

639
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,580
Thank you, Mr. Qingfeng.

640
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,420
Mr. Qingfeng.

641
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,890
I want to learn fashion design too.

642
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,460
If I have any questions, can I ask you?

643
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,770
Of course.

644
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,900
Bye.

645
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,940
Let me see you off.

646
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,360
Okay.

647
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,370
Excuse me.

648
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,050
For the next group, I want to
take this kind of photo.

649
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:10,910
Photos for two.

650
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:12,370
With her.

651
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:15,670
Okay.

652
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:22,550
Come on.

653
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,210
Li Chuyue.

654
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:24,080
Lean closer.

655
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,080
Come closer.

656
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,910
Closer still.

657
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,830
Li Chuyue, your posture is not right.

658
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,750
Relax.

659
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,980
That's better.

660
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,150
Good.

661
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:42,540
Keep it.

662
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,420
Let's change to another pose.

663
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,610
Come on, change a pose.

664
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,410
Change a pose.

665
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:50,550
Yes.

666
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,260
That's it.

667
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,400
Nice.

668
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,740
Very good.

669
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,460
Yeah, let's change to another pose.

670
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,460
Another pose.

671
00:32:59,090 --> 00:32:59,570
Okay.

672
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,050
Okay.

673
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:06,440
Relax.

674
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,320
You're getting better at this, aren't you?

675
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:17,920
Here.

676
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,210
My dear colleagues,

677
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,460
we gather here today

678
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,220
to celebrate the success of the poster-shooting.

679
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,820
Of course,

680
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,050
first of all, thank Mr. Dachuan,

681
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,210
Mr. An Jingzhao,

682
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,380
and…

683
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,250
our colleague from the Marketing Department.

684
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,400
Thank you.

685
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:41,280
Have a good meal now.

686
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,590
Enjoy yourselves.

687
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,260
We'll go to karaoke later

688
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:45,290
and have fun.

689
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:45,940
Come on.

690
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:46,890
Cheers.

691
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,390
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

692
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,020
-Cheers.
-Thank you for your hard work.

693
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,730
Thank you.

694
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,700
-Here. -Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

695
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,830
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

696
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:00,980
Let's eat.

697
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,710
Do you want to have this?

698
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,800
Director Zhou.

699
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,300
Li Chuyue has only been here for a few months,

700
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,570
yet she dares to steal your thunder

701
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:11,570
and cut a smart figure like this.

702
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,370
Are you really

703
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,909
recommending her to be Ms. Qiao's assistant?

704
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:17,210
How is that possible?

705
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:27,409
Excuse me.

706
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,580
Coming.

707
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,300
This place is really nice.

708
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,679
You can even eat king crabs at this price.

709
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:46,739
Come on.

710
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,760
Come on.

711
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:52,210
Have a leg.

712
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,040
Here.

713
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,489
Li Chuyue.

714
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:58,650
The king crabs are for Mr. Zhou and the photographer.

715
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:01,510
Do you think lowly employees
like you can have them?

716
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,910
Are you too poor to be sensible?

717
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,710
You even take advantage of that.

718
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,090
But it also makes sense.

719
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,220
Your monthly salary

720
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,350
is not enough to buy two king crabs.

721
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,480
Zhou Meizi,

722
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:14,210
don't look down on me.

723
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,230
Do you think

724
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:17,160
I can't afford the king crab?

725
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,550
I'll pay for this king crab today.

726
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,570
And

727
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,650
I'll give one to everyone here.

728
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:23,690
My treat.

729
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,400
Hello, check, please.

730
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,520
You can scan my QR code.

731
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:35,830
Okay.

732
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:42,200
Sorry, Miss.

733
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,990
The balance on your card is not quite enough.

734
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,620
Hold on.

735
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,910
I'll use another card.

736
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:57,050
Look.

737
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,470
The gentleman next to me

738
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,670
is so delicate.

739
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,210
How about you let him stay in your restaurant

740
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:03,260
and work for a few days

741
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,390
to offset this meal?

742
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:06,780
That...

743
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,460
What a disgrace!

744
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,350
You're so poor.

745
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,620
Since I helped you,

746
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,090
should I be paid?

747
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:19,900
Of course.

748
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,250
In that case,

749
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,400
I will treat you with my remuneration.

750
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:26,190
One king crab for each.

751
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:28,070
By the way,

752
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,780
give this lady two.

753
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:33,580
You got so angry over a crab.

754
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,090
I don't think you can afford it at other times.

755
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,380
Good idea.

756
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:41,940
Meizi.

757
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:43,520
Meizi.

758
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,400
Arrange it.

759
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,230
An Jingzhao,

760
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,690
you are really a good friend.

761
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:53,240
Don't worry.

762
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,640
I will help you go back to Shangyu this time.

763
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,210
Here.

764
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,980
Have a leg.

765
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,490
Mr. An Jingzhao.

766
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:03,730
Here.

767
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,160
For your good work.

768
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,240
Thank you.

769
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:15,260
Li Chuyue,

770
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,580
go to the warehouse and find

771
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,940
a spring/summer 2011 red windbreaker.

772
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,230
No matter how late it is,

773
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,300
it must be found today.

774
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,340
I need it tomorrow.

775
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,780
Wait.

776
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:26,960
Zhou Meizi.

777
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Do you think I'll let you bully me like that?

778
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,440
At worst, I'll resign now.

779
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,340
And I'll apply for the designer assistant tomorrow.

780
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:35,940
Li Chuyue,

781
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,700
don't you know the basic requirements

782
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,740
to recommend an assistant internally?

783
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,070
He who's recommended must be an employee.

784
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,260
If you resign now,

785
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,430
you won't be qualified to be recommended tomorrow.

786
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,770
Then it'll not be me who breaks the promise.

787
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,400
Besides,

788
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:52,380
if you can't find the windbreaker today,

789
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,440
it means you're unable to do your job.

790
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,390
Don't come back to work tomorrow.

791
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:57,980
You...

792
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,340
Fine.

793
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,380
Fine.

794
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,780
Everyone, enjoy your meal.

795
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,420
Fine.

796
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:10,870
What's going on?

797
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,350
I don't know.

798
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,010
Why is she gone?

799
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,170
So many boxes.

800
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,460
How can I find it?

801
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,310
There's no year

802
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,770
or date marks on the boxes.

803
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,860
Should I look for it one by one?

804
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,210
Compared to my dream of becoming a designer,

805
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,170
this is nothing.

806
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:10,610
When can you find it if you look for it like that?

807
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:11,420
What should I do then?

808
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,080
I don't know

809
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,980
when these clothes came in.

810
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:17,820
How many years of clothes are stored here?

811
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,060
When was the batch you are looking for stored?

812
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,400
The samples should have come
in the warehouse three years ago.

813
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,060
I'm looking for the sample from three years ago.

814
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,400
Did anyone move

815
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,270
that batch after it came in?

816
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,080
I don't think so.

817
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,140
This place hasn't even been cleaned.

818
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,930
The shelf has the most dust on it.

819
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,230
I guess the batch of clothes you're looking for

820
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,090
should be here.

821
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,050
I'll get the ladder.

822
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,490
An Jingzhao.

823
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,290
Give me a hand.

824
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,300
Let me do it.

825
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:20,760
No need.

826
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,720
I can handle it.

827
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,760
You don't even know what the coat looks like.

828
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,110
Be careful.

829
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,020
How is it? Is it there?

830
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,980
It seems to be here.
