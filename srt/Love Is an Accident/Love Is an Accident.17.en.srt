4
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,640
Zhao.

5
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,070
The meteorite.

6
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,210
Hide.

7
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:51,990
Go after him!

8
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,579
He's from Yuwei Hall.

9
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,800
Why isn't there any news yet?

10
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,630
What's going on?

11
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,510
Zhao?

12
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,340
-Grandmother.
-Zhong Wei didn't find you, did he?

13
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,070
Don't worry.

14
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,110
They thought I was a member of the Yuwei Hall.

15
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,100
This time, Zhou Wei

16
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,550
must think I'm dead.

17
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:01,910
Fine.

18
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,950
Why didn't you go back when it thundered just now?

19
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,910
Chuyue must be worried about you.

20
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,120
I had been dealing with Zhou Wei's people all along.

21
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,250
The meteorite fell.

22
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,550
I couldn't make it when it thundered.

23
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,570
I don't think I can go back soon.

24
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:17,459
Hurry.

25
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,210
Grandmother.

26
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:35,980
Ling.

27
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,460
Brother.

28
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,340
I heard something was going on at Father's.

29
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,970
I guess that you might come to save Father.

30
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,250
So I secretly went to the Yiju Hall

31
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,340
and saw you leaving.

32
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,270
So I followed you to Lingxiao Yard.

33
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,970
Did Zhou Wei give you a hard time?

34
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,400
You taught me how to hold my breath.

35
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,200
Zhou Wei believed I'd been hit by the Cold Ice Palm.

36
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,620
But as to Grandmother...

37
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,640
Zhou Wei will definitely treat Grandmother as a thorn in his eyes.

38
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,440
Grandmother.

39
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,350
Ling is right.

40
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,430
Zhou Wei won't give up easily.

41
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,500
How about I find you a safe place?

42
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:07,650
No.

43
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,830
Since Zhou Wei believes that you're gone,

44
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,470
Zhao,

45
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,530
it's the best time for you to fight back.

46
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,940
If I leave suddenly,

47
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,820
Zhou Wei will suspect that you're faking your death.

48
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,340
Now Master Xuanfeng knows you're fine.

49
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,620
Zhou Wei wouldn't dare to kill you directly.

50
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,740
But he will think of another way.

51
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,140
I'll arrange for people to protect you at Chongyue Pavilion.

52
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,700
If Zhou Wei is up to anything,

53
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,830
you can inform them.

54
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,920
Okay.

55
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,620
By the way,

56
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,930
before Chuyang left,

57
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,740
he left his backpack in his room.

58
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,690
His invisible pen is in the backpack.

59
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,490
You can contact me with that pen.

60
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,800
Don't worry.

61
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,070
Grandmother.

62
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,210
Let me send you back to rest.

63
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:51,950
OK.

64
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,430
I'm leaving.

65
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,530
Find a chance to go back.

66
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,409
Don't let Chuyue worry about you.

67
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,900
An Jingzhao.

68
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,390
Come back.

69
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,810
Please come back safely.

70
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,100
Please.

71
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,270
Please come back safely.

72
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,690
It's Chuyue's voice.

73
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,210
Why is she here?

74
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:18,900
No.

75
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,130
I want to go there.

76
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,070
Tomorrow...

77
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,040
There will be a heavier thunderstorm tomorrow.

78
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,210
Please.

79
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,050
Ling.

80
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,530
Brother.

81
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,110
I'll find somewhere else to hide for a few days.

82
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,240
When I find a stable place,

83
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,610
I'll send someone to inform you.

84
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:35,270
OK. I’m leaving, Brother.

85
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,220
An Jingzhao.

86
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,340
There will be a thunderstorm tomorrow.

87
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,710
Wait for me.

88
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,460
Young Lord is injured.

89
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,480
I wonder how he is now.

90
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,030
Don't worry.

91
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,820
My brother-in-law is a great hero.

92
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,350
Those minions can't beat my brother-in-law.

93
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,610
Young Madam said there would be a thunderstorm tomorrow.

94
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,539
I must go back.

95
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,460
Boss.

96
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,520
Can you get the meteorite for me?

97
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,300
No.

98
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,190
That's my sister's treasure.

99
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:54,390
If she knows I took it,

100
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,340
she’ll kill me.

101
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,480
Before Young Lord left,

102
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,100
he asked me to protect Young Madam.

103
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:00,760
He also said

104
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,990
if he didn't come back,

105
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,450
we couldn't let her go back and take the risk.

106
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,340
You're right.

107
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,730
Although my sister has many problems,

108
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,560
she is my only sister.

109
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,230
I can't let her take risks.

110
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,970
Boss.

111
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,030
I'll secretly go back to Yunwei Villa tomorrow.

112
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,730
You must protect Young Madam.

113
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,670
When she wakes up,

114
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:47,270
you must hide the meteorite well.

115
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,470
Don't let her find it.

116
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,540
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

117
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,150
Let's go.

118
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,790
Why is my phone also against me?

119
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,850
An Jingzhao, I can go back soon.

120
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,030
Where is the meteorite?

121
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,640
Li Chuyang.

122
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,310
Li Chuyang, did you take my meteorite?

123
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,790
Fortunately, Young Madam hasn't woken up yet.

124
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,210
Donghua, give me the meteorite.

125
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,330
Please forgive me, Young Madam.

126
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,880
At this moment, Shangyu is full of dangers.

127
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,600
Young Lord repeatedly asked me

128
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,620
to protect you from danger.

129
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,270
An Jingzhao is injured.

130
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,050
How can I stay here?

131
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,190
Give it to me.

132
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,960
Young Madam, please forgive me.

133
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,420
-I can't agree.
-Donghua.

134
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,510
Since you call me Young Madam,

135
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,710
I order you to hand over the meteorite.

136
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,970
Young Madam, please step aside.

137
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,360
Young Madam.

138
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,580
Chuyang.

139
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:01,420
I need to go back to Yunwei Villa.

140
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,270
If Dad and Mom ask,

141
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,010
cover for me.

142
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:05,250
Sister, don't go.

143
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,320
Don't you have to make clothes?

144
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,850
Haven't you found a suitable embroidery yet?

145
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,570
I'm going to look for it in Shangyu these days.

146
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,550
I will bring the clothes back

147
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,060
in half a month to participate in the competition.

148
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,290
Just in case, stay here in these days.

149
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,920
Go to my room if you have time.

150
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,740
Maybe the clothes will be back one day.

151
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,260
Sister.

152
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:21,960
Don’t go.

153
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,060
An Jingzhao.

154
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,700
Young Lord.

155
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,210
Chuyue, why are you here?

156
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,260
It's not safe here.

157
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,690
I received your blood-stained clothes.

158
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,550
I thought I'd never see you again.

159
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,620
Those aren't my clothes.

160
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,280
I'm fine.

161
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:53,960
I got scared.

162
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,060
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,560
It’s OK. Luckily you’re fine.

164
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,240
Young Lord.

165
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,690
This is a secret letter I received today.

166
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,700
You may leave.

167
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,900
[Zhou Wei sent a letter to Hongfei. They want to join forces.]

168
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,820
Chuyue, where have you been during these days?

169
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
How have you been?

170
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,220
We've been good.

171
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,000
I came to visit my brother yesterday.

172
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,590
Why didn't I see you?

173
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,130
It was because of the weather...

174
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:42,470
It was because the weather was bad

175
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,400
and it rained a little,

176
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,480
that your sister-in-law and I

177
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,410
stayed in the room a little longer.

178
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,100
Ling.

179
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,300
What kind of girl do you like?

180
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:55,090
I can find a girl for you.

181
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,800
That's right.

182
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,920
What kind of girl do you like?

183
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,510
Tell me.

184
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,990
I know girls best.

185
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,710
It's impossible forever.

186
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,590
Nothing.

187
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,110
Donghua.

188
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,580
I'm going to the Devil's Cave later.

189
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,870
Take care of Chuyue.

190
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,100
Yes.

191
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,440
I'll ask Donghua to accompany you

192
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,170
to look for the embroidery you want.

193
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:20,700
No.

194
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,420
I want to go with you.

195
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,230
We promised to never be apart.

196
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,650
After you finish your work,

197
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,850
let's deal with mine.

198
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,060
Then you have to stay by my side all the time.

199
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,790
Understand?

200
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,180
Brother.

201
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,270
Didn't you destroy the Evil Sect?

202
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,530
Why are there still...

203
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,990
They are the branches of the Evil Sect led by Hongfei.

204
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,410
Hongfei wasn’t at the base of the Evil Sect that day.

205
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,470
I didn't fight her.

206
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,830
Hongfei?

207
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,230
Is she a girl?

208
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,550
It sounds so cool.

209
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,240
Zhou Wei colluded with the Evil Sect.

210
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,370
What does he want?

211
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,980
I must get the letter from Zhou Wei to Hongfei.

212
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,510
Let’s go.

213
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,300
Let's go!

214
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,340
Let's go.

215
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,580
Hurry up.

216
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,240
Let's go. Hurry up.

217
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,050
There are too many forks here.

218
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,570
Shall we split up?

219
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:23,740
Be careful.

220
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,270
Let's go.

221
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,000
Where is he?

222
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,940
I told you to keep an eye on him.

223
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,110
My Lord...

224
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,500
I was preparing the flower water for a bath.

225
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,980
When I turned around,

226
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,250
he disappeared.

227
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:50,050
Useless!

228
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,280
Her steps are so impressive.

229
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,119
Her room is over there.

230
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,380
Okay. I'm done.

231
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,970
The outfit fits perfectly.

232
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,340
You go find it first. I’ll guard the door.

233
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,980
Ling, go take a look.

234
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:31,370
This cloak's fabric looks very light.

235
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,390
The embroidery technique is also excellent.

236
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,930
Could it be the embroidery I'm looking for?

237
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,300
No, it's not the right time.

238
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Did you find it?

239
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,860
How's your search going?

240
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,870
Are you afraid of me?

241
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,500
Of course not.

242
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,620
Then why did you run away?

243
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,230
I really like you.

244
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,530
If you can stay by my side,

245
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,030
I will treat you well.

246
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,470
Yes.

247
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:42,360
My Lord.

248
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,090
We found that

249
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,900
Yueming has a servant named Li San.

250
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,760
He is a cripple.

251
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,490
Maybe he knows where the Art of Starshift is.

252
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,060
Good.

253
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,200
Where is he now?

254
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,260
We'll keep looking.

255
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,460
We will find him.

256
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,930
Report to me if you have any news.

257
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,520
Yes.

258
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,670
Did you find it? She's back.

259
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,020
No.

260
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,410
If she finds out,

261
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,300
the two of you leave first.

262
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,600
I'll try to stall her.

263
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,060
No.

264
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,460
How can I leave you behind?

265
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,220
It's okay.

266
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,900
I'm less likely to be noticed on my own.

267
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,020
And I've brought what she likes the most.

268
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,480
I'm confident I can handle her. Don't worry.

269
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,830
If you make me angry again,

270
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,740
I won't be so nice.

271
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,740
Hide.

272
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,220
My Lord, please forgive me.

273
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,200
My Lord. My Lord.

274
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,710
Rise.

275
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,250
My Lord. My Lord.

276
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:54,460
I won't rise if you don't forgive me.

277
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,740
I beg you, My Lord.

278
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,410
When did I ever punish you?

279
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,100
Rise.

280
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,070
I won't rise. My Lord.

281
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,050
Rise.

282
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,600
Ling.

283
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,110
Raise your head.

284
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,520
Who are you?

285
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,920
Why are you in front of my bedroom?

286
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,330
My Lord, I have always admired you.

287
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,290
I want to be your disciple

288
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,130
and serve you.

289
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,310
But you don't have any recruitment recently.

290
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:34,270
I had no choice.

291
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,620
That's why I barged in.

292
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:38,460
I desire to witness your beauty.

293
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,040
What a sweet talker.

294
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,030
Tell me why you are here.

295
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,880
Or I'll kill you!

296
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,180
I'll tell you.

297
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,980
I'll tell you.

298
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,640
My Lord.

299
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,170
I also have a few young boyfriends.

300
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,420
I heard that you have a beauty-enhancing bathing pool here.

301
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,920
A man who has bathed in this pool

302
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,740
will get fair skin.

303
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,770
So,

304
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,180
I want to draw some bathwater from here

305
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,930
and give them a try.

306
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,500
My Lord,

307
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,370
I think you like this young master very much.

308
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,260
My Lord.

309
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,820
I have some man-taming skills.

310
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,840
They can help you.

311
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,340
You have certain skills?

312
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,310
But this thing needs to be displayed under the sunlight

313
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,190
to show its effect.

314
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,550
Are you planning something?

315
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,140
My Lord, I don't know martial arts.

316
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,580
If I plan something,

317
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:40,720
I'll die.

318
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,700
Brother, let's save Chuyue.

319
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,740
I have an idea.

320
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,110
My Lord.

321
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,940
This is

322
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:13,520
a scented bathing lotion used in my hometown.

323
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,780
The scent is attractive.

324
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,860
Apply it to your body

325
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,900
and you'll be seductive.

326
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,800
Just so-so. But I'll accept it.

327
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,420
I'll try it later.

328
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,320
Guards!

329
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,060
Remove one of her arms and release her.

330
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:47,700
Yes.

331
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:48,940
My Lord.

332
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:51,070
My Lord.

333
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,660
The bathtub in your bedroom was destroyed.

334
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,370
What?

335
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,780
You...

336
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,700
You...

337
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,120
It's destroyed.

338
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,820
Chuyue, let's go.

339
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,810
Master, the letter has been sent to the Lord of the Evil Sect.

340
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,470
This is a letter from Hongfei.

341
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,490
[To Second Lord Zhou Wei. This is great. I’ll try my best to help you become the Lord]

342
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,490
[Wait for us to work together and create the glory of our sect]

343
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
Great.

344
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:39,220
Hongfei has agreed to cooperate with us.

345
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,030
Congratulations, Master.

346
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,040
Get ready.

347
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,500
The plan has begun.

348
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,820
Yes.

349
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,870
Get lost!

350
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,390
Zhou Wei.

351
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,350
These are the things you gave me before.

352
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:05,810
I'm returning all of them.

353
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,120
What are you doing?

354
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,470
I have found out

355
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,720
you were the one who assassinated Jingzhao

356
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,080
and made him fall off the cliff and die.

357
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,930
You used your identity as my godfather

358
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,720
and lied to me that you could let me marry Jingzhao,

359
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,010
but you have been using me to harm him.

360
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,170
Zhou Wei.

361
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,040
From now on, you are no longer my godfather,

362
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,070
but my enemy.

363
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,260
Zhi.

364
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,300
Where did you hear

365
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,640
such nonsense?

366
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,750
Why would I hurt Young Lord?

367
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:37,770
Stop pretending.

368
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,870
Don't think that with your current momentary power,

369
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,200
you can do as you please.

370
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,270
I'm not afraid of you.

371
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,330
Well.

372
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,010
I will avenge Jingzhao.

373
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:49,360
Zhi... Zhi.

374
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,700
Master.

375
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,140
Miss Bai Zhi isn't going to do something, is she?

376
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,420
She won't be able to take revenge on me.

377
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,210
Throw these things away.

378
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,220
I’ll be the Lord soon.

379
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,900
These kind of small fry are not worth mentioning.

380
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,780
Guards!

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Throw these away.

382
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,150
Acting is too hard.

383
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:42,720
Has Jingling left?

384
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,810
Donghua made this red bean rice porridge.

385
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,100
Donghua knows these things?

386
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,570
He said he would start practicing now

387
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,100
for his future girlfriend.

388
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,600
What nonsense did Li Chuyang

389
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,880
teach him?

390
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,000
What are you doing?

391
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,120
I want to declare ownership over you.

392
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,050
What do you mean?

393
00:27:10,550 --> 00:27:12,410
Have you forgotten what you said?

394
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
You have several young boyfriends?

395
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,950
I said this because it was a special circumstance at the time.

396
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,210
Only in this way could I attract Hongfei's attention

397
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:22,490
and distract her.

398
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,260
Besides,

399
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,680
how could I have several boyfriends?

400
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,740
With a gentleman like you in front of me,

401
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,450
I can't love anyone else.

402
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:34,170
I only love you in my life.

403
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,070
I can't hear you.

404
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,870
I only love you in my life.

405
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,460
Chief Li.

406
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,700
I need you to do me another favor.

407
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,470
Zhou Wei.

408
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,340
You said that once that matter was finished,

409
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,940
you would release my family.

410
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,040
You didn't keep your promise.

411
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,480
Did I say that?

412
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,170
Why don't I remember?

413
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,020
Zhou Wei.

414
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,080
How about this?

415
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,540
Help me

416
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,810
kill the young master of Zhuyin Pavilion

417
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,730
and kill all the nuns in Qingning Nunnery.

418
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:30,640
Leave no one alive.

419
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,710
They are from righteous sects.

420
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,660
How can I kill them for no reason?

421
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,770
Chief Li. The beginning is always difficult in all things.

422
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,800
Since you have done this before,

423
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,080
I think it'll be easy to do it again.

424
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,000
Come out.

425
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:07,270
Bingqin has mastered the Cold Ice Palm of the Evil Sect.

426
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:09,920
She can kill someone with one palm strike.

427
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,920
She will teach you some palm skills.

428
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:32,710
Who are you?

429
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,750
[Qingning Nunnery]

430
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:19,710
Stop!

431
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,080
Men are not allowed to enter Qingning Nunnery. Get out!

432
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,710
Ice Cold Palm?

433
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,170
Master.

434
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,190
People in the martial world say

435
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,560
that the Evil Sect killed those people.

436
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,300
The Martial Arts Gathering is in a few days.

437
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,220
By then,

438
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:22,110
you can volunteer to eliminate the Evil Sect.

439
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,420
When it's done,

440
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,640
you will be respected by the martial artists.

441
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,020
No.

442
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,380
It's still early. I'm one step behind.

443
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,140
To win,

444
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,500
no matter how small the obstacle is, I must remove it.

445
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:44,090
The Evil Sect's Ice Cold Palm is a fatal evil technique.

446
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,460
Zhuyin Pavilion and Qingning Nunnery

447
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,530
have both suffered a brutal massacre.

448
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:51,410
Will it be our turn next?

449
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,460
Master Li.

450
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,540
Your sect is one of the three major sects.

451
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,980
You once fought with the Evil Sect.

452
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,550
Are you willing to get rid of the evil for the martial world?

453
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,150
I did fight the Evil Sect.

454
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,420
But that was a year ago.

455
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,260
Our sect suffered a great loss from it.

456
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:08,210
As the leader of the sect,

457
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,010
I can't let the whole sect

458
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,780
take the risk with me.

459
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,960
This...

460
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,670
The Evil Sect committed such heinous deeds.

461
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,800
As the leader of the three major sects,

462
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,050
our Yunwei Villa should set an example.

463
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,380
I'm willing to go to destroy the Evil Sect.

464
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,460
Chief He.

465
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,880
It's good to have such ambition.

466
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:31,270
But how can our esteemed Yunwei Villa

467
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,270
allow you, a chief, to step forward?

468
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,560
Now the Lord is seriously ill,

469
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,450
and the Young Lord was killed by the Evil Sect.

470
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,020
The Second Young Master is the future Lord.

471
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,540
He should take the responsibility.

472
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,690
Yes.

473
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,980
Second Young Master, you should take this responsibility.

474
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,460
Yes.

475
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,510
He's right.

476
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,810
That's right.

477
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,260
Yes.

478
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:02,050
Although I'm not capable,

479
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,770
I'm willing to go to exterminate the Evil Sect.

480
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,150
Young Master, Madam sent a message

481
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,580
to ask you to hide away immediately

482
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,240
and never go to fight Hongfei.

483
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,180
Zhou Wei did this

484
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,160
because he wanted you to never return.

485
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,480
Madam also said that she had an old friend.

486
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,690
You can go to that friend.

487
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,550
Madam will help you win the villa back in the future.

488
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,030
I'm not interested in winning the villa back.

489
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,040
No one ever cared

490
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,620
about me in my life.

491
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,580
And I won't be able to be with the one I love.

492
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,290
So if I can't return,

493
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,980
just let it be.

494
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,659
Young Master, just hide out.

495
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,270
As long as you're alive,

496
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,469
how can you not win Miss Chuyue's heart?

497
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,179
I've made up my mind.

498
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,520
No need to persuade me.

499
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,310
-Young Master.
-If...

500
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,110
If I'm gone...

501
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,040
Take good care of my mother.

502
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,699
Young Master.

503
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,489
You may leave.

504
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:54,420
Young Master.

505
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,980
Leave!

506
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,680
Is there no one left capable at Yunwei Villa?

507
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,190
How can they send a weak kid like you to fight?

508
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:01,690
I heard that you're An Chenghu's

509
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,200
least valued son.

510
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:07,890
Now it seems

511
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,840
that you are indeed much worse than

512
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,500
An Jingzhao who's dead.

513
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,420
Brother? How did you know I was here?

514
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,700
Zhou Wei proclaimed that you were going to attack the Evil Sect.

515
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,830
How could I not know?

516
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,520
Zhou Wei wants to use the Evil Sect to get rid of me

517
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,220
and destroy his last obstacle.

518
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,550
I won't let him succeed.

519
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,460
Let's go.

520
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:12,300
That girl is so cruel.

521
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,100
Didn't she know how to treat a handsome boy?

522
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,660
Miss Chuyue.

523
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,110
Miss Chuyue.

524
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,070
This is the herb I collected on the mountain.

525
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,720
It's very effective for treating external wounds.

526
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:31,090
Thank you, Uncle.

527
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,270
You're welcome.

528
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,350
I heard

529
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,740
that in the battle between Yunwei Villa and Hongfei from the Devil Sect,

530
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,870
the Second Young Master was defeated.

531
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:43,540
After all, he's much worse than his elder brother.

532
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,070
He can’t be trusted.

533
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,860
If Young Lord were still alive,

534
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,980
he would easily

535
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,680
wipe out the remaining forces of the Evil Sect.

536
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,740
Uncle.

537
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,340
The Second Young Master was originally only skilled in literary pursuits

538
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,940
and not adept at wielding knives and spears.

539
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,000
It's brave enough for him

540
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,490
to confront the villains.

541
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,570
Don't mind what he said.

542
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,570
This is how the world is like.

543
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:23,820
If you do well, they'll say you're bragging.

544
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,100
If you don't do well, they'll say you're incompetent.

545
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,460
Don't take it to heart.

546
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,860
Here, have some more.

547
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,920
Then we'll apply the ointment.

548
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,410
Let's apply the ointment.

549
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:38,860
Here.

550
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,500
Master.

551
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,820
An Jingling was seriously injured,

552
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,950
but he disappeared.

553
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,120
He disappeared?

554
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,780
Where can he go?

555
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,090
We've sent our men to look for him.

556
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:31,800
Jingling.

557
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,810
Jingling, you haven't recovered yet.

558
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:39,740
Go back and rest.

559
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,640
I'm almost recovered.

560
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,570
It's good to go out for a walk now.

561
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,020
You're right.

562
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,020
But there's nothing fun here.

563
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:49,980
Wait.

564
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,610
How about I make a wooden carving for you?

565
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,730
Then carve a koi fish.

566
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,210
Wish me a rich woman this year.

567
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,210
Wishing you abundant romantic opportunities.

568
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,670
Romantic opportunities?

569
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,630
That means many girls will like you.

570
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,710
Chuyue.

571
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,100
How come you keep using words

572
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,540
I haven't heard of?
