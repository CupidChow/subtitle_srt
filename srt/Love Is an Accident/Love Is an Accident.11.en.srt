[Episode 11]

4
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,800
Please take a look.

5
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:53,060
Mr. Gu Jun.

6
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,700
I'm really sorry.

7
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,509
I have something urgent to do now.

8
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,640
I might need to leave.

9
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,450
Please read the proposal carefully.

10
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,090
Let's talk on the phone later.

11
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:01,890
I'm sorry.

12
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,660
Sorry.

13
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,680
You threw the arrow well, Master.

14
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,110
I've found the place where that woman lives.

15
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,700
She is probably a member

16
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,050
of Li Qing's family.

17
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,570
I have sent someone to keep an eye on her.

18
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,770
Once Li Qing shows up,

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,360
I'll report it to you immediately.

20
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,990
Good.

21
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,440
How about this?

22
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,510
Go find the best doctor in Shangyu at once.

23
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,700
Ask him to go with me

24
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:35,329
to check our young lord's pulse.

25
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,579
Master,

26
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,720
I don't understand.

27
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,940
Since we are going to find Li Qing soon,

28
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,770
as long as I use a small trick,

29
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,860
he can be used by me.

30
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,270
If he doesn't accept it,

31
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,450
I'll kill him.

32
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,720
Then An Jingzhao will also lose an important general.

33
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,040
Now,

34
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,329
the key is to prove that

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,820
An Jingzhao is really missing,

36
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,880
Then I'll find a fake corpse,

37
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,230
and announce that

38
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,600
An Jingzhao was killed by someone from the evil sect.

39
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,280
Then others will have nothing to say.

40
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,840
It'll be justifiable for me to become

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,130
Chief of Yunwei Villa.

42
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,550
Master, you're wise.

43
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,870
It seems thunder is not the way to go back.

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,270
Second Lord.

45
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,079
Our young lord hasn't recovered.

46
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,840
He's still recuperating.

47
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,110
Why did you suddenly break into

48
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,000
our Lingxiao Yard with knives?

49
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I've hired the best doctor to

50
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,670
treat our young lord's disease.

51
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:06,280
He's resting.

52
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,080
Second Lord.

53
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,680
Please go back.

54
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,440
Who dares to fight?

55
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,589
Madam.

56
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,130
Madam.

57
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,400
Second Lord.

58
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,540
What on earth do you want to do?

59
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,510
Grandmother.

60
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,940
Madam.

61
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,220
All the Chiefs of Hall and I

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,390
are so worried about our young lord's condition that

63
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,720
we can't sleep at night.

64
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:40,070
That's why I came to

65
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,180
visit our young lord today.

66
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,770
The young lord has caught a cold

67
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,850
and needs to have a good rest to recuperate.

68
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,180
It's not convenient for him to see guests.

69
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,310
So,

70
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,070
the young lord is in his room now?

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,120
He's in his room now.

72
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,740
Madam.

73
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,280
The doctor I've hired today

74
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,050
is best at treating cold.

75
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,260
For our young lord’s health,

76
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,160
let him treat his disease.

77
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,060
Let’s go.

78
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,500
Second Lord.

79
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:14,940
Second Lord.

80
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,780
You're so bold.

81
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,280
How dare you break into my Lingxiao Yard!

82
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,680
Young Lord.

83
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,380
Don't misunderstand.

84
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,260
I heard that you had been sick for some days.

85
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,360
I'm very worried.

86
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,880
So today,

87
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,080
I've hired the best doctor

88
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,430
to treat your disease.

89
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,220
Second Lord.

90
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,780
I'm fine.

91
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,250
Please go back.

92
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,800
Young Lord,

93
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,800
your health

94
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,480
concerns the safety of the entire Yunwei Villa.

95
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,150
Just let this doctor check on you.

96
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,870
Let's go.

97
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,670
An Jingzhao.

98
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,909
Go to sleep.

99
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,370
You've wasted your energy for so long.

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,710
Second Lord.

101
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,120
You heard it.

102
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,140
I'm resting.

103
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,080
Go back at once.

104
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,090
Say one more line for me.

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,280
Just say,

106
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:20,120
"My foster father will come from the Laotie Gang tomorrow."

107
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,310
Then there's no next line?

108
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,680
I'll say the next line.

109
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,950
Dear,

110
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,340
my foster father will come from the Laotie Gang tomorrow.

111
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,230
Second Lord.

112
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,760
Don't hinder me from having a great grandchild.

113
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,940
That's it?

114
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,350
Are there any other lines?

115
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,130
An Jingzhao,

116
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,260
you've gone too far.

117
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,790
You took liberties with me.

118
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,100
Just now, the thunder could be heard all the time.

119
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,360
Why didn't you go back?

120
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,300
Could it be that

121
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,630
thunder isn't the way to open the passageway?

122
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,230
I guess whether we can go back

123
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:12,840
is related to the size of lightning.

124
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,620
Just now, the lightning wasn't big enough.

125
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,620
It could only make the sounds transmitted between these two worlds.

126
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,750
But I didn't go back.

127
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,040
However, if it's an object with a light weight...

128
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,230
Madam.

129
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,720
The young lord is back.

130
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,000
Be careful.

131
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,320
Be careful, Madam.

132
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,190
Maybe this can go over there.

133
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,700
Great.

134
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:47,580
Be careful.

135
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,890
Zhao, Chuyue.

136
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:49,980
Where are you?

137
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,010
Come out!

138
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,400
Madam.

139
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,360
Grandmother, Donghua.

140
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,820
I'm in another world now.

141
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,650
It's also Chuyue's world.

142
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,800
There is a passageway between these two worlds.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,200
Sounds can be transmitted in the weather with thunder and lightning.

144
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,600
I should be able to go back at the right time.

145
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,460
Donghua.

146
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,470
Ask my grandmother to go back and rest first.

147
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,400
I have something to tell you later.

148
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,100
Okay.

149
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,770
Tell me if there's anything special.

150
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,310
Yes, Madam. Don't worry.

151
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:24,900
Okay.

152
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:35,360
Donghua.

153
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,309
Yes.

154
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,600
Young Lord.

155
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,020
I'm here.

156
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,960
Since Zhou Wei dared to break into our Lingxiao Yard,

157
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,490
it means he had heard about my disappearance.

158
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,130
He'll definitely hurry up with his action next.

159
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,730
But I've set up a bait for him.

160
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,240
Next, he'll definitely ask about the Laotie Gang.

161
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,590
You should spread the news that

162
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,060
this gang has always been mysterious,

163
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,900
and it's very powerful,

164
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,430
so the young lord doesn't allow you to tell others about it.

165
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,900
Yes, I understand.

166
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,160
Young Lord.

167
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,490
Is everything fine with you?

168
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,050
When will you come back?

169
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,130
There will be another thunderstorm tomorrow.

170
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,140
I will try again.

171
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,270
Donghua,

172
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,560
I'll tell you another good tactic.

173
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,030
Keep it well.

174
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,870
Yes.

175
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,820
I'll obey your order.

176
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:53,620
You...

177
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,860
You...

178
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,590
Isn't An Jingzhao missing?

179
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,350
Why is he in his room?

180
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,290
Please punish me, Master.

181
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,200
An Jingzhao indeed went missing that day.

182
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:11,090
But he showed up today.

183
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,990
I don't know the reason, either.

184
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,730
Why?

185
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,210
An Jingzhao has been pretending, right?

186
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,820
And Li Chuyue, too.

187
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,570
She has a foster father?

188
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,100
He's from the Laotie Gang?

189
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,500
What kind of gang is that?

190
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,250
Why have I never heard of it?

191
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,340
I'll go investigate it at once.

192
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,360
How is it giong with Li Qing?

193
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,810
Our men have been watching him.

194
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,420
We'll report to you immediately if there is any news.

195
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,620
Just go.

196
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,270
I'm leaving.

197
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,470
What are you going to do now?

198
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,620
The weather forecast says there will be another thunderstorm tomorrow.

199
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,630
I'll try again.

200
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,100
You've wasted your energy for so long.

201
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,160
It's time to sleep.

202
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:25,760
I was acting.

203
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,080
Acting.

204
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,600
I sacrificed so much to save you.

205
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,370
How are you going to thank me?

206
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:32,700
I'll give myself to you.

207
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,270
What are you talking about?

208
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,710
Don't think too much.

209
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:37,950
I don't like you.

210
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,570
I just wanted to take liberties with you

211
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:42,080
because you look good.

212
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,800
What are you doing?

213
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:50,050
You want to take liberties with me, don't you?

214
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,700
I agreed.

215
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,100
What?

216
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,630
You don't dare to do that now?

217
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,250
Look at you.

218
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:04,820
You insist on coming to see your sister to check your homework.

219
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,080
And you're even doing this on a rainy day.

220
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:12,940
Girl.

221
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,090
A full mark for this homework.

222
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:23,750
A full mark.

223
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,070
Tell me.

224
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,960
Are you dating him?

225
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,500
No, no.

226
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,860
He's going back soon.

227
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,950
Alright. Stop it.

228
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,880
Stop lying to me.

229
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,210
Empress Dowager Your Highness, with your prestige,

230
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,450
I dare not lie.

231
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,610
You should go back to your room first.

232
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,010
I need to talk to An alone.

233
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,950
An, tell me.

234
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
Are you dating Chuyue?

235
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:11,890
No.

236
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,760
But I do like her.

237
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,400
Are you an actor or not?

238
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,080
No, I'm not.

239
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,010
I knew it.

240
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,580
Then where are you from?

241
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,420
What's your job?

242
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,980
My hometown is far away.

243
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,050
It's sort of a management job.

244
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,220
He doesn't even dare to tell me where his home is.

245
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,950
There must be something wrong.

246
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,250
Fine.

247
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,250
Show me your ID card

248
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,200
and household registration book.

249
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,750
ID card and household registration book?

250
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,300
Mom.

251
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,580
Who would bring the ID card and household registration book with him when he's out every day?

252
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,290
You don't even have an ID card.

253
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,370
You're really a rascal who has no job.

254
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,360
If you mean something used to prove my identity,

255
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,060
I have it.

256
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,310
To be honest,

257
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm from a parallel world,

258
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,400
a place which is called Yunwei Villa.

259
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,530
Yes, Mom.

260
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,250
Actually, I've long known that

261
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,980
my brother-in-law is from a parallel timespace.

262
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,710
He is the young lord of Yunwei Villa.

263
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,440
Yunwei Villa is the top sect in the martial arts world.

264
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,260
It's very powerful

265
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,190
and very famous.

266
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,630
Young Lord?

267
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:37,700
I got it.

268
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,280
Your job is making fake certificates, right?

269
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,900
His job isn't making fake certificates.

270
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,530
He's really a young lord.

271
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,340
You don’t understand.

272
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,470
He's famous in the martial arts world.

273
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,770
Everyone knows him.

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,330
Everyone respects him.

275
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,570
People of the Yuwei Hall led by him are even highly skilled in martial arts.

276
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,200
Really?

277
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,670
Yuwei Hall?

278
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,180
Yes.

279
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,950
Come on.

280
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:01,240
Stop describing a gangster

281
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,840
as such an brilliant man.

282
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:05,990
An,

283
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,440
let me tell you.

284
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,500
Can't you find a proper job?

285
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,620
Stop messing around in society.

286
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,250
Mom.

287
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,680
What are you talking about?

288
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,990
He's really a young lord.

289
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,910
Shut up!

290
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,240
From now on, you and your sister should avoid associating with him.

291
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:18,870
Got it?

292
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,190
Ms. Liu Ying.

293
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,240
You'll regret it.

294
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,100
An,

295
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,470
every mother

296
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,220
wants her daughter to be happy.

297
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,920
Me, too.

298
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
But you can't give her happiness.

299
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:36,650
So please.

300
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:39,100
Can you stop associating with Chuyue?

301
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,240
Okay?

302
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:46,920
Alright.

303
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,850
I have to go back.

304
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,450
Keep an eye on your sister.

305
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,020
Don't worry, Ms. Liu.

306
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,120
I will keep an eye on my sister.

307
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,190
Don't worry.

308
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,420
[Yunwei Villa]

309
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,770
Do you know that Young Madam

310
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,860
has a foster father?

311
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,600
Foster father?

312
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,980
It is said that he has a strong background.

313
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,980
What background?

314
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,950
I've heard that he's from Laotie Gang.

315
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,880
Laotie Gang

316
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,950
is a mysterious sect in the North.

317
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,740
Although it's not quite famous in the martial arts world,

318
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,440
people of the gang are highly skilled in martial arts.

319
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,790
They're good at disco,

320
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,300
and they like Zhou Huajian.

321
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,860
They're quite fashionable.

322
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,420
Really?

323
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,420
What does it mean?

324
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,990
I don't know, either.

325
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,460
I merely heard it from others.

326
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,990
Then what is disco?

327
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,400
How would I know?

328
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,120
I overheard it accidentally that day.

329
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,540
Master.

330
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,070
A tall and strong man

331
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,609
appeared in that woman's residence.

332
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,089
Our spy pretended to have an accident

333
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:08,490
and was saved by that man.

334
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,150
The clothes he was wearing got broken.

335
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,030
Although they have been mended,

336
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,760
they match the fabric we have.

337
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,490
This person is Li Qing.

338
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,530
Good.

339
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,710
Catch Li Qing's family first.

340
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,079
Then I'm not afraid that he won't work for me.

341
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:28,980
Yes.

342
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,390
Besides,

343
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,940
prepare for the armed uprising.

344
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,990
Yes.

345
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,760
Master.

346
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:38,910
Say it.

347
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,250
Our spy has sent a message that

348
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,210
Laotie Gang

349
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,100
is a mysterious sect in the North.

350
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,940
Although it's not quite famous in the martial arts world,

351
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,020
people of the gang are highly skilled in martial arts.

352
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,280
They're good at disco,

353
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,030
and they like Zhou Huajian.

354
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,630
They're quite fashionable.

355
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,880
Disco?

356
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,120
Is disco

357
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,170
a unique and powerful technique?

358
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:07,130
They like Zhou Huajian?

359
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,890
Why have I never heard of Zhou Huajian?

360
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,140
What kind of swordsmanship is that?

361
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,890
They're quite fashionable.

362
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,180
Master.

363
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,990
Is fashion

364
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,800
Zhou Huajian's best technique of swordsmanship?

365
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,740
Does An Jingzhao really have reinforcements?

366
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,670
Master, should we go on with our action?

367
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:36,980
Just wait.

368
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:40,870
Zhou Huajian.

369
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,500
Disco.

370
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,210
Hello.

371
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,740
Li Chuyue.

372
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,400
Why did you leave suddenly in the middle of

373
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,590
your discussion with Mr. Gu Jun?

374
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,850
Do you know that you almost ruined my job?

375
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,880
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiao.

376
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,360
-I will... -I don't want to hear your explanation.

377
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,870
I'll give you another chance.

378
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,760
You should find me a batch of embroidery products.

379
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,900
I'll send you the specific requirements later.

380
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,830
Don't make any mistakes this time.

381
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,280
Okay, Ms. Qiao.

382
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:15,930
Don't worry.

383
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,330
I will complete the task.

384
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,130
Judging from the weather,

385
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,780
I think the thunderstorm should be heavy this time.

386
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,380
You should be able to go back.

387
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,030
Don't you have anything else to say to me?

388
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:36,730
No.

389
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,570
After you go back this time, continue to be a young lord.

390
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,830
Don't come back again.

391
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,900
After I finish dealing with the matters in Yunwei Villa,

392
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,830
I will come back.

393
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,040
Besides,

394
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,690
I'll fulfill your wish, too.

395
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,710
I'll go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to get the marriage certificate with you.

396
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:57,000
Who wants to go to the Civil Affairs Bureau with you?

397
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Brother-in-law!

398
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Brother-in-law!

399
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,150
Are you going back?

400
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,670
Take me with you.

401
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,760
Since I'm on my spring vacation,

402
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,500
I can have a trip to Yunwei Villa for a few days.

403
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:06,840
No.

404
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,500
You're just a kid. Why are you going there?

405
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,590
Our parents won't agree.

406
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,790
I've told our mom that

407
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,260
I'll be with you these several days.

408
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,480
You know how to open the passageway anyway.

409
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,830
I'll be back in a few days.

410
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,890
If you're worried,

411
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,150
you can go with me.

412
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,870
I'm not going.

413
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,170
Only two people can pass through this passageway.

414
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:27,900
If there are more than two people, you may not necessarily succeed.

415
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
It's almost time.

416
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,270
Li Chuyang.

417
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,280
It's not a big deal.

418
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,310
It's just a simple matter.

419
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,620
I'm sorry, Sister.

420
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,490
I'm sorry, my dear sister.

421
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,100
Chuyang.

422
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,910
Chuyang, what are you doing?

423
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:51,970
Didn't you say that

424
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,310
kissing is the way to open the passageway?

425
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,990
It's the weather and the meteorite.

426
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,020
You can't go there.

427
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,960
He disappeared.

428
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,230
Brother-in-law!

429
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,570
Li Chuyang!

430
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,880
Chief Li.

431
00:21:50,090 --> 00:21:51,550
It must be torture for you.

432
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,670
This is made from Glaze Fire.

433
00:21:57,170 --> 00:22:00,700
Even the Supreme Lord of the martial arts world can't unlock it.

434
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,550
So,

435
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,030
if you don't want to stay here,

436
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,330
I advise you to work under me as soon as possible.

437
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,140
When I become the head of the martial arts world,

438
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:13,020
I can give you any position

439
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,930
in the Yunwei Villa.

440
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,980
Dream on!

441
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,810
Don't waste your time to persuade me.

442
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,780
Let my family go.

443
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,510
Then my life is yours.

444
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,600
It's up to you whether you want to kill me or torture me.

445
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,420
You are a top-notch master of martial arts.

446
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,940
How could I kill such an elite?

447
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,270
Where are my family now?

448
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,030
Chief Li.

449
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,010
It's such a beautiful scene.

450
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,910
I think it's very suitable for us

451
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,280
to have a drink together.

452
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,510
So I've brought some dishes.

453
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,330
Qing!

454
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:58,810
Mother.

455
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,610
Mother!

456
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:00,430
-Qing. -Huan.

457
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,400
Are you okay?

458
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,350
-Qing. -We are fine.

459
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,460
Qing, how are you?

460
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,190
Chief Li.

461
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,550
Now,

462
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,530
you have two choices.

463
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,980
If you agree to my previous suggestion,

464
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,650
your family

465
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,150
can be reunited with you.

466
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,790
We can also

467
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:23,440
drink this wine together,

468
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,150
enjoy a good meal together,

469
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,130
and talk about the stories in the martial arts world.

470
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,030
If you disagree,

471
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,610
we can still drink this wine together,

472
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,340
and enjoy a good meal together.

473
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,340
But there will be an extra dish

474
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,060
on this plate.

475
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,860
This dish will surely

476
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,880
come from this lady.

477
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,850
No!

478
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,990
Huan. You...

479
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:51,900
Zhou Wei, you...

480
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:52,700
Huan.

481
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,070
No.

482
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:55,750
No!

483
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,550
No!

484
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:58,460
Huan!

485
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,260
Huan.

486
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:02,990
No!

487
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:05,540
Stop!

488
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,180
Chief Li.

489
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:09,700
It's up to you.

490
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,100
Qing!

491
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:19,030
You can't!

492
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,780
I agree.

493
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:33,730
Chuyang? Are you alright?

494
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Brother-in-law.

495
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,280
I'm really in Shangyu now?

496
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,180
Brother-in-law.

497
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,180
Is this your room?

498
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:54,530
Your sister...

499
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,270
It seems that someone can't bear to leave me.

500
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,800
Who can't bear to leave you?

501
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,960
I came here to take good care of him.

502
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,650
It has nothing to do with you.

503
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,710
Don't be like this.

504
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,310
Li Chuyue.

505
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,170
Don't use me as your excuse.

506
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,830
You're here for my brother-in-law, aren't you?

507
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,530
Put me down.

508
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,930
Come on. Be quick.

509
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,810
It looks like there is no problem if several people come here together.

510
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:45,200
There seems to be no limit to the number of people.

511
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,260
Li Chuyang didn't come here at first.

512
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,700
Only after he went closer to the meteorite did he come here.

513
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,330
Perhaps

514
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,410
it's only effective within one meter of the meteorite.

515
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,430
Brother-in-law.

516
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,790
Brother-in-law.

517
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,790
Brother-in-law.

518
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,740
Is this the legendary precious sword in the martial arts world?

519
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:13,750
Can I try using it?

520
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,220
Sure.

521
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,940
But don't hurt yourself.

522
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,300
You're... Young Lord?

523
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,290
You…

524
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,470
You're finally back.

525
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,650
I was so worried.

526
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,060
I heard your voice outside the room.

527
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,210
-I even… -Brother-in-law.

528
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,610
How do I wield this sword?

529
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,500
You don't need to wield it.

530
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,290
Just hold it.

531
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,290
Just hold it like this.

532
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,700
Young Lord.

533
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,870
Is everything fine with you?

534
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,190
Brother-in-law.

535
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,010
Look.

536
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,230
Brother-in-law.

537
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,830
This knife is so beautiful.

538
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,750
Its name is Cold Moon Knife.

539
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,220
It looks like a new moon.

540
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,880
It was made by the best craftsman in Shangyue

541
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,600
through countless times of forging.

542
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,660
Why do I feel that someone is jealous?

543
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,660
I'll explain to you when I have time.

544
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,240
I'm fine.

545
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,900
How is everything going?

546
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,980
Young Lord,

547
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,400
Zhou Wei's informant

548
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,350
must have heard

549
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,450
the news we spread.

550
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,460
So, nothing unusual happened today.

551
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,030
Besides,

552
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,620
you asked me to investigate Yuan Shu.

553
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,350
I've found out about the truth.

554
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,410
He was bribed by Zhou Wei because of money,

555
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,230
so he has been reporting the news about you to Zhou Wei.

556
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,360
I've asked him to leave with an excuse.

557
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:21,090
Okay.

558
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,860
Young Lord.

559
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,830
Who is this?

560
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,660
This is my brother-in-law.

561
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,280
If he wants to go somewhere,

562
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,940
just take him there to take a stroll.

563
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,470
Chuyang.

564
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,740
This is Donghua.

565
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,980
If you want to learn martial arts skills,

566
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,030
you can ask him to teach you.

567
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,090
If there's anything else,

568
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,550
you can ask him to help you.

569
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,160
Donghua.

570
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,140
Hello.

571
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
I'm An Jingzhao's brother-in-law,

572
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,220
a future bigshot of the Central Plains.

573
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,840
You can call me Mr. Li.

574
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,030
Young Lord.

575
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,870
There are many affairs to deal with in the Villa.

576
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,130
I have something to do.

577
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,050
I will ask someone else to teach him martial arts skills.

578
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,780
I'm leaving.

579
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,510
Don't be like this.

580
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:00,180
Come back.

581
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,860
I think

582
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,410
you're someone who can make me feel secure.

583
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,140
Brother-in-law.

584
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:05,710
Let him teach me.

585
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,270
Okay?

586
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:06,910
Okay.

587
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,710
I can have an adventure with him in the martial arts world.

588
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,670
Young Lord.

589
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,520
Madam is still waiting for you to come back.

590
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,550
[Chongyue Pavilion]

591
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,020
Madam.

592
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,020
You haven't eaten anything for several days.

593
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,180
Just eat something.

594
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,930
Hottie.

595
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:28,860
Chuyue.

596
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,290
-You’re finally back. -I miss you so much.

597
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,280
Zhao.

598
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,750
Do you know how worried I was?

599
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,010
I'm back now, aren't I?

600
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:41,910
Who is this?

601
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,710
Hottie, this is my brother.

602
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,740
He wants to have fun,

603
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,470
so he came with me to take a look.

604
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,210
Hello, Chuyue's little brother.

605
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,780
Hello.

606
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,430
Madam.

607
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,700
My elder sister is used to being rude.

608
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,400
Please don't mind.

609
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:59,280
Your elder sister is smart.

610
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,770
I really like her.

611
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:06,510
These two kids are a perfect match.

612
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:09,490
I hope I can become an uncle soon.

613
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,440
That's exactly what I want.

614
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,390
Since they are married,

615
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,600
they'll live together naturally.

616
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,230
I'll have a great grandchild soon naturally.

617
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,930
No.

618
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,820
Our marriage is fake.

619
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,260
How can we live together?

620
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,950
Chuyue.

621
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,850
Do me a favor.

622
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:33,150
Zhou Wei has been keeping an eye on the Lingxiao Yard.

623
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,550
Don't let him know that your marriage is fake.

624
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,230
It's a deal.

625
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,740
I agree on behalf of my sister.

626
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,390
-Okay. -Hottie.

627
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,420
I'll go around to see your house.

628
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,390
Please. Please.

629
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,550
Li Chuyue, show me around.

630
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,780
Go.

631
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,020
Grandmother.

632
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,630
How is my father?

633
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,930
Has he taken the medicine?

634
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,540
I've fed the medicine to your father twice.

635
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,180
For the first two times, I made a scene,

636
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,270
and Zhou Wei's men let me go inside.

637
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,700
But later,

638
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,630
Zhou Wei noticed it,

639
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
so I couldn't go inside again.

640
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,840
According to Dr. Luo's prescription,

641
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,230
he needs to take the medicine

642
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,950
for the last time in three days.

643
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,350
If he still can't take it,

644
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,830
the poison won't be removed from his body.

645
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,990
Grandmother, don't worry.

646
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:23,310
I will figure out a way.

647
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,430
Okay.

648
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,260
I'll go check on Chuyue and her brother.

649
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,490
Master.

650
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,790
An Jingzhao showed up.

651
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,590
He's fine.

652
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,190
How's the investigation about the Laotie Gang?

653
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:45,370
There has been no clue so far.

654
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,540
No matter how mysterious

655
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,710
a gang is in the martial arts world,

656
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,450
it's impossible that there's no clue.

657
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,070
I remember it now.

658
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,970
Why did we only hear

659
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,850
An Jingzhao's voice yesterday?

660
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,150
He didn't dare to show his face,

661
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,940
but he suddenly showed up today.

662
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,190
There must be

663
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,600
something fishy about it.

664
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,270
There's one more thing.

665
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,980
Li Chuyue said her foster father would come tomorrow.

666
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,940
Why did she say

667
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,020
such important information so easily?

668
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,200
Because An Jingzhao told us about it on purpose.

669
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,080
He's trying to stall us.

670
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,630
There must be a scheme behind this.

671
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,160
We can't wait any longer.

672
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,420
Jingzhao.

673
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,980
You finally showed up.

674
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,420
How are you?

675
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,500
Have you recovered from your cold?

676
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,260
Jingzhao.

677
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,400
You have no idea

678
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:05,500
how much I missed you these days.

679
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,300
Bai Zhi.

680
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,640
Don't you know what you've done?

681
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,290
Considering that we're old friends,

682
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,290
I won't scold you.

683
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,790
From now on,

684
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:19,050
you're not allowed to come any closer to the Lingxiao Yard.

685
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,320
Nor can you come any closer to Chuyue.

686
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:22,140
Jingzhao.

687
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:22,900
Leave now.

688
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:35,480
My brother-in-law is so virtuous

689
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,490
as a husband.

690
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,700
By the way,

691
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,210
I'll go to the market later

692
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,870
to look for the technique

693
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:43,330
with which people can embroider patterns on very thin fabric.

694
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,470
I'll go, too.

695
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,080
I'll take a stroll around the market

696
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,010
and go shopping.

697
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,020
Ask Donghua to go with you.

698
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:49,600
Donghua.

699
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:50,630
Yes.

700
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,240
Go with them.

701
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,220
-Let’s go. -Okay.

702
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,130
-Donghua, let's go. -Let’s go.

703
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,530
-I'm leaving. -Hurry up.

704
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:00,990
Grandmother.

705
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,670
I'll go see Ling.

706
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,990
Okay.

707
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,350
Master.

708
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,190
Chief Li is here.

709
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,700
Sit down, please.

710
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,020
No need to be so hypocritical.

711
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:27,030
Just tell me what you want me

712
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,750
to do.

713
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,000
Chief Li is really straightforward.

714
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,090
I like it.

715
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:40,520
This is a colorless and tasteless poison.

716
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:42,010
After one eats it,

717
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,410
he will become irritable and grumpy,

718
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,190
and will lose his mind.

719
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,990
His organs will collapse gradually.

720
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,470
He'll die in seven days.

721
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,740
As long as you can make An Jingzhao take the poison,

722
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,780
I will let your family go.

723
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:59,810
I can't do that.

724
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,300
Just kill me.

725
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:11,050
If you want this plate to be filled with stuff,

726
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,639
you can refuse it.

727
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,560
Zhou Wei!

728
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,199
Do you have any humanity?

729
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Think about it carefully, Chief Li.

730
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,280
I don't hope that this plate will be full

731
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,610
when I eat next time.

732
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,460
That's right.

733
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,070
You have to poison him secretly,

734
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:47,900
and you can't let An Jingzhao suspect you.

735
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:48,780
Chief Li.

736
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,110
Do you have any good idea?

737
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,150
The young lord needs to drink

738
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:58,810
a cup of tea brewed with dew on lotuses every three days.

739
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,130
I can put the posion

740
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,870
into the tea.

741
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:05,120
He won't suspect me.

742
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Good. Just go.

743
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:14,620
Master.

744
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,430
Will he do it?

745
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,360
I have his family.

746
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,810
Would he dare to quit?

747
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,450
Master.

748
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,360
There's one thing I don't understand.

749
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:25,610
Do you want to ask

750
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:30,000
why I don't use a poison which can kill him instantly?

751
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:31,340
Yes.

752
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:34,940
I just want An Jingzhao to lose his mind.

753
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,150
Then we just need to provoke him secretly.

754
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,270
He'll be unable to restrain himself from killing people.

755
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,000
By that time,

756
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:45,290
An Jingzhao will be a murderous demon in the martial arts world.

757
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,170
After he dies,

758
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,740
I can become the Chief of Yunwei Villa,

759
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:51,530
and others will have no objection to it.

760
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,090
Master, you're wise.

761
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,200
Young Lord.

762
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,420
Where did you go?

763
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:44,600
People of the Yuwei Hall have searched all over the martial arts world,

764
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,090
but there was no news about you.

765
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,120
Now I still can't

766
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,070
tell you where I went.

767
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,720
Zhou Wei's ambition is obvious.

768
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,350
He started the plan a long time ago.

769
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,950
Now you have two things to do.

770
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,910
First,

771
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,790
find out about Zhou Wei's defensive deployment

772
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,790
and strongholds.

773
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,320
Second,

774
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,390
protect yourself well.

775
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,180
He started to keep an eye on you a long time ago.

776
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,570
Young Lord, don’t worry.

777
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,570
I will be careful.

778
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,430
Now the Lingxiao Yard

779
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,500
is already full of Zhou Wei's spies.

780
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,470
Go back at once.

781
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:17,750
Yes.

782
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:25,790
Young Lord!

783
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,190
What’s wrong? Anything else?

784
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,790
Nothing.

785
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,560
Take care, Young Lord.

786
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,310
You, too.

787
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,990
The tea is poisonous.

788
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,220
How is he?

789
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,800
What poison did he get?

790
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,190
This poison is very rare.

791
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,750
After one is poisoned by it,

792
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,430
his disposition will change greatly,

793
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,610
and he'll become irritable and grumpy.

794
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,910
He'll also lose his mind.

795
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,090
Meanwhile, the poison will gradually invade his organs, and he'll die from it.

796
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,090
If the young lord hadn’t forced the poison out in time,

797
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,920
I’m afraid he would die

798
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,620
within an hour.

799
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,070
I’ll prescribe some medicine to protect his heart.

800
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,670
The young lord needs to take the medicine on time.

801
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:47,140
Can Zhao recover from it?

802
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,850
I'm not sure.

803
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,660
The poison inside his body may be removed.

804
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,610
There may be an unexpected situation, too.

805
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,660
Donghua.

806
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,190
Yes.

807
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,580
Follow the doctor to get the medicine.

808
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,620
Madam.

809
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:02,900
I'm leaving.

810
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,100
Thank you.

811
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:04,900
Please.

812
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,430
Hottie.

813
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,350
What's wrong with him?

814
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:28,170
What poison did he get?

815
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,620
The doctor isn't sure, either.

816
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,190
He only prescribed some medicine to protect his heart.

817
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:35,900
Hottie.

818
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,950
Don't worry.

819
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:37,820
He'll be fine.

820
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,320
An Jingzhao is a lucky man.

821
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,250
He will be fine.

822
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,540
You still need to enjoy your life with your future great grandchild.

823
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,340
Don't worry.

824
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,060
Great grandchild?

825
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,140
Can I have a great grandchild this year?

826
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,690
Yes.

827
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,440
Of course.

828
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,810
Hottie.

829
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,550
Go back to take a rest first.

830
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,330
When he wakes up,

831
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:55,970
I'll send someone to ask you to come.

832
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:56,470
Okay.

833
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,100
Spend more time with him.

834
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:57,540
Okay.

835
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,190
Okay.

836
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,520
An Jingzhao.

837
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,970
Wake up.

838
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,190
I still have a lot to tell you.

839
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,340
You're awake.

840
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:23,170
So,

841
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:32,060
what do you want to tell me?

842
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,650
What's wrong with you?

843
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,340
You told my grandmother that she could have a great grandchild this year.

844
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,010
Shall we start

845
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,540
working on that from now on?

846
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:55,020
An Jingzhao,

847
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,540
you are not poisoned at all.

848
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,670
You are pretending.

849
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,390
I'm sorry.

850
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,070
I didn't do it on purpose.

851
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,280
I'm fine.

852
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:09,030
You don't have to say sorry to me.

853
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,090
I feel cold.

854
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,670
Cover yourself up with the quilt if you feel cold.

855
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,460
Don't move.

856
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,860
The quilt is useless.

857
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,750
I want you to stay with me.

858
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,070
You can keep me warm.

859
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,570
Wha poison did you get?

860
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,520
Why do I feel that you're like a different person now?

861
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:35,920
The poison is quite strong.

862
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,200
Besides, it has gone into my bone marrow.

863
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
It can't be cured.

864
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:41,940
That's impossible.

865
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,780
In this world,

866
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,500
there must be a way to cure it.

867
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,130
There is indeed a way.

868
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,070
Say it.

869
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:49,970
I'll help you find the medicine.

870
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,810
The way is that you can't leave,

871
00:41:56,810 --> 00:41:57,380
and have to stay with me.
