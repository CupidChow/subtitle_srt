[Episode 31]

4
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,390
Sir,

5
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,600
you two danced so well just now.

6
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:43,440
People who don't know

7
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,039
would think you are a couple.

8
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,740
-My daughter Chuyue looks pretty.
-Impressive.

9
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,770
She has a tender personality

10
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,780
and is a designer.

11
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,320
She is outstanding in all aspects.

12
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,960
This is her father.

13
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:58,190
We run a company.

14
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,470
We're preparing for an IPO.

15
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,230
You're exaggerating.

16
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,630
This kid is her brother.

17
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,440
He gets good grades in school.

18
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,170
Basically, he's been the top student every year.

19
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:12,580
Sir,

20
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,430
what do you think of Chuyue?

21
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,620
She's not very tender.

22
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,260
She has a freewheeling attitude

23
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,540
and is careless.

24
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,130
But

25
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,780
she is kind.

26
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:31,510
She loves to defend people against an injustice.

27
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,170
She will be the love of my life.

28
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,060
I hope

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,960
to be with her forever

30
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,010
and never to be separated.

31
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,250
Great!

32
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,930
That's great.

33
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,740
How come it's you?

34
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,590
You're the boss?

35
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,190
Why are you laughing?

36
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,620
You all knew it, right?

37
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,100
It's so touching.

38
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:11,990
Mom,

39
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,920
you asked me

40
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:13,990
to win his heart.

41
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,210
I've succeeded.

42
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,510
You brat.

43
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,660
An,

44
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,240
this experience hall is not bad.

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,880
Why didn't you tell me?

46
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,450
Because of the weather,

47
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,730
the Fashion Week has been shifted to an earlier date.

48
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:34,860
We have to leave now.

49
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,570
I've booked an air ticket for you.

50
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,600
Leave now?

51
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,250
Yes.

52
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,710
If you don't want to go, I won't force you.

53
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,550
I want to go.

54
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,530
How can I not go?

55
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,680
I'm gonna go home now and pack my things.

56
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,520
It's too late.

57
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,370
If you need anything, you can buy it after we arrive there.

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,380
We're leaving immediately.

59
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:48,820
Okay.

60
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,570
I'm gonna tell my family.

61
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:51,170
Okay.

62
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,210
An Jingzhao,

63
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,700
the Fashion Week has been shifted to an earlier date.

64
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,820
I have to leave now.

65
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,350
Tell my parents.

66
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:07,890
Yes. Yes.

67
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,380
Yes.

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,170
That's it.

69
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,210
Okay, thank you.

70
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,260
Bye.

71
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,270
Brother-in-law.

72
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,019
Brother-in-law.

73
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:16,820
Good news!

74
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,850
Good news!

75
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,170
Half an hour before the Fashion Week,

76
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,230
the embroidery on Ms. Qiao's last dress was scratched.

77
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,150
There was no time to fix it.

78
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,870
Guess what?

79
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,440
Ms. Qiao thought of my sister's design draft.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,330
Coincidentally, my sister made it

81
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,840
during the Fashion Week.

82
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,250
Just like that,

83
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,210
my sister's dress was displayed as the grand finale

84
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:42,890
and won everyone's acclaim.

85
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,790
Brother-in-law,

86
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,020
you don't seem very excited.

87
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,780
Who said I'm not excited?

88
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,280
It's just that I always knew

89
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,220
your sister would achieve this kind of success.

90
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,880
She has been preparing for it.

91
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,670
How do you know that?

92
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,000
Is your sister back from the Fashion Week?

93
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,140
She just came back.

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,470
She said she was going to a live interview.

95
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,850
She said she called you,

96
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,050
but the line was busy.

97
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,510
Live?

98
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,210
Yes, that's it.

99
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,710
Ms. Qiao,

100
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,180
your new collection

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
has achieved great success,

102
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,960
especially the last dress.

103
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,900
It won wide acclaim.

104
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,090
It's very creative.

105
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
Can you tell us about this creation?

106
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,700
Of course.

107
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,140
The designer of it is right here.

108
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,270
Chuyue, introduce it.

109
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,000
On the right shoulder of this dress,

110
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,290
there is ancient-style dim ornamentation of plum blossoms.

111
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,340
There's the silhouette of the Mingxiao Sword on the right side.

112
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,360
On the left is a white spun yarn skirt

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,760
of modern elements.

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,170
The theme is Eternal Love.

115
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,909
It means even though two people who love each other

116
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:56,440
are from different worlds,

117
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,000
they can overcome difficulties to be together.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,830
I even embroidered flowers on it.

119
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,430
They are called Immortality Flowers.

120
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,460
It symbolizes eternal love and being together forever.

121
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,420
Thank you for accepting my interview.

122
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,600
Congratulations.

123
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,170
Ms. Qiao,

124
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
thank you for giving me this chance.

125
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,570
I remember you wrote in your resume

126
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,600
that you want to be an independent designer.

127
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,200
I do want to have my own brand,

128
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,750
but it's not the time yet.

129
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:32,890
Good.

130
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,600
You don't need to come to work tomorrow.

131
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,710
Why?

132
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:37,909
Ms. Qiao,

133
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,820
did... did I do something wrong?

134
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,460
No.

135
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,170
I have nothing more to teach you.

136
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:46,290
You have your own design style.

137
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,430
But I have to remind you.

138
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,470
It's very difficult to be an independent designer.

139
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,800
You need to be prepared for difficulties.

140
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,790
Why are you looking at me like this?

141
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,720
Thank you for your cultivation.

142
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,170
I don't want to leave you.

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,890
Stop.

144
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,290
Write a report on the Fashion Week as soon as possible.

145
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,830
You're still my employee now.

146
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,260
Focus on your final task.

147
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:09,990
Okay.

148
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,970
Who are you?

149
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,890
No one is allowed

150
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,090
to enter the dungeon.

151
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,840
I'm from Yuwei Hall.

152
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,730
Young Lord went to travel around the world

153
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,990
and found an old case related to Zhou Wei.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,860
So he asked me to interrogate him.

155
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,480
Second Lord,

156
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,830
how have you been?

157
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,940
An Jingling?

158
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,110
Aren't you a prisoner too?

159
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,110
Why did you come here?

160
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,980
Although you are imprisoned here,

161
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,240
you're still well-informed.

162
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm here to offer you a good idea

163
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,980
to help you get out of here.

164
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,580
An Jingling,

165
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,970
you can't even protect yourself.

166
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,770
Yet you are here to offer me a good idea?

167
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,970
This is the good idea I mentioned.

168
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,040
An Jingling,

169
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,590
do you think I'm a three-year-old kid?

170
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,790
You want to fool me with a stupid stone.

171
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,070
Do you still remember this?

172
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,020
After An Jingzhao fell off the cliff,

173
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,830
you sent many people to search for him,

174
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,230
but no traces were found.

175
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,920
After that, you used Madam as bait

176
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,170
and set up a sophisticated trap.

177
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,310
But An Jingzhao

178
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,370
gave the antidote to Lord

179
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,620
without anyone knowing.

180
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:14,320
Do you know why An Jingzhao always appears and disappears mysteriously?

181
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,120
Because he knows

182
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,290
a channel that leads to another world.

183
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,100
He travelled between the two worlds several times.

184
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,510
Is...

185
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,490
Is there a wonderful thing like this in this world?

186
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,650
The Huaxi Stone

187
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,340
can open the channel.

188
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,740
What's the use of telling me this?

189
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,700
I'm useless now.

190
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,800
An Jingzhao and Li Chuyue

191
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,940
have gone to another world again.

192
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,430
I hope you can go there too

193
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,810
and kill An Jingzhao.

194
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,300
If you kill him,

195
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,160
when you come back,

196
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,290
I'll give you the Profound Earth Sutra.

197
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,690
[Profound Earth Sutra]

198
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,250
The...

199
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,200
The Huaxi Stone has been broken in two.

200
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,150
Are you sure I can get there?

201
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,490
Second Lord,

202
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,340
this is your only chance.

203
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,680
Why don't you give it a try?

204
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,730
Maybe

205
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,750
this is the only chance in your life for you to change your fate.

206
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,300
That world

207
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,700
is completely different from Shangyu.

208
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,030
In that world, there are cars that run very fast.

209
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:24,230
There's something called a cellphone.

210
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,110
It's square.

211
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,870
Even if people are thousands of miles apart,

212
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,130
they can communicate.

213
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,830
One more thing.

214
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,450
People in that world

215
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,510
don't know martial arts like Chuyue.

216
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,700
Don't show your martial arts easily

217
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,370
to attract others' attention.

218
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,460
I wanted to wait for you at home,

219
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,110
but there's an emergency in the experience hall.

220
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:57,990
I understand.

221
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:58,940
It's okay.

222
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,310
Congratulations, my dear wife.

223
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,750
Your talent has finally been recognized.

224
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,140
Thank you for your compliments.

225
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:07,840
Right.

226
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,650
Ms. Qiao said I can be an independent designer.

227
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,750
Do you think I can?

228
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,460
Isn't it too fast?

229
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,030
How can you know if you don't try?

230
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,590
Besides, you are so talented.

231
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,460
You can do it.

232
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,170
I gotta go.

233
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,900
Someone is calling me.

234
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,720
I need to answer it.

235
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,180
Okay.

236
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:26,580
Hello?

237
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:27,950
Chuyue,

238
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,630
are you free tonight?

239
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,850
I heard that you've graduated with full marks from Ms. Qiao.

240
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,830
I happen to have a block booking night ticket for the amusement park.

241
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,820
Do you want to celebrate with us?

242
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,610
Of course.

243
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,780
How can I be absent from a place for fun?

244
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:42,510
Okay.

245
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:44,110
See you in the amusement park at 20:00.

246
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:44,590
Okay.

247
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,360
Right, remember to bring your boyfriend.

248
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,500
Okay, see you later.

249
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,470
Hello.

250
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,130
My colleague

251
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,090
has invited me to the amusement park later.

252
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,020
Do you want to go?

253
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,510
I don't think I can go.

254
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,690
I can't finish my work in a short time.

255
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,440
Okay, go on with your work.

256
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,010
See you at home tonight.

257
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:05,950
Okay.

258
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,940
Bye.

259
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,510
Bye.

260
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,160
I should wear beautiful clothes when I go out to have fun.

261
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,070
Li Chuyue.

262
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:04,570
An Jingzhao.

263
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,570
An Jingzhao.

264
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:24,150
It's dark.

265
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,740
Be careful on your way.

266
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,250
Okay. I know.

267
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,800
Bye.

268
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,589
-Chuyue.
-Chuyue. Hurry.

269
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:16,290
Come on.

270
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,859
Booking the whole place feels great.

271
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,470
It feels like we have the entire amusement park.

272
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,440
That's right.

273
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,430
I don't know if we should choose the merry-go-round

274
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,829
or the jet coaster first.

275
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:25,510
That's right.

276
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,700
-Come and have a look.
-Try this?

277
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,250
Try it.

278
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:31,790
The lucky draw

279
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,650
is free of charge.

280
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,260
Welcome.

281
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,080
How do we play this?

282
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,150
What are the prizes?

283
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,020
There are a lot of prizes.

284
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,420
You'll know after you draw it.

285
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,300
Why don't you go?

286
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,330
Then... I'm going first.

287
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,130
Go.

288
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,190
4C.

289
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,490
What lucky draw?

290
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,480
What is this?

291
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,120
I want to have a try too.

292
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,960
You go.

293
00:17:57,670 --> 00:17:58,640
I'm gonna try it.

294
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,990
I hope I can win the grand prize.

295
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,190
Good luck. Good luck.

296
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,180
Where can I get the prize?

297
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,060
This is your lucky note.

298
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,870
Go to the merry-go-round with it

299
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,020
and find the corresponding number.

300
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,540
The prize is on the seat.

301
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,140
Thank you.

302
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,750
Let's go.

303
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,220
Let's go.

304
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,910
Come on, girls. Have a try.

305
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,720
The lucky draw is free of charge.

306
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,010
-I'm gonna play it.
-I want to play it too.

307
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,810
No way.

308
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:37,510
No way.

309
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,330
Am I the only one without a prize?

310
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,640
Look for it carefully.

311
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,710
Come on.

312
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,560
Congratulations.

313
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,140
Li Chuyue,

314
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,910
will you marry me?

315
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,610
Will you marry me?

316
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,650
Yes.

317
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,420
Kiss!

318
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,290
So sweet.

319
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,340
Brother-in-law,

320
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,810
we're family from now on.

321
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,460
You can tell me anything.

322
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:05,990
And

323
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,630
if my sister dares to bully you,

324
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,630
I'll protect you.

325
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,740
Thank you.

326
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,470
From now on, as long as you want,

327
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,170
you can bully me every day.

328
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,980
Keep your promise.

329
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,670
Li Chuyang,

330
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,420
why are you everywhere?

331
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,670
How did you get here?

332
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,460
Of course I came here with my brother-in-law.

333
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,170
Besides,

334
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,950
how can I miss such a scene?

335
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,690
Mr. An,

336
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,580
we helped you a lot.

337
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:33,130
Tell us your story.

338
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,980
How did you meet?

339
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,980
Who pursued whom?

340
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,010
Tell us.

341
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,150
I'd better not tell you.

342
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm not good at telling stories.

343
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,380
-Tell us.
-Tell us.

344
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,870
Tell us.

345
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,790
I suddenly want to go to the bathroom.

346
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,480
I'll go with you.

347
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,000
No need.

348
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,580
You need to tell a story.

349
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:46,920
I...

350
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,930
Tell a story.

351
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,210
Tell a story.

352
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,070
Tell a story.

353
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,310
You can't leave.

354
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,750
You have to tell us today.

355
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,010
Yes, you have to.

356
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,670
Fine.

357
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,670
We met in my hometown.

358
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:07,340
We had a bad impression of each other at first.

359
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:31,920
Who are you?

360
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,180
Young Madam,

361
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:41,140
how have you been?

362
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:42,800
Zhou Wei.

363
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,580
The channel has been damaged.

364
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,160
How did you get here?

365
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,500
Thanks to Mr. Jingling.

366
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,180
He's still waiting for you in Shangyu.

367
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,350
Young Madam,

368
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,460
in the next several days,

369
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,840
you have to cooperate with me.

370
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,830
Otherwise, I will kill you.

371
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,350
An Jingzhao,

372
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,280
don't come here.

373
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,270
An Jingzhao.

374
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:21,560
-Chuyue.
-An Jingzhao.

375
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:21,980
Sister.

376
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,780
An Jingzhao.

377
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:25,910
Chuyue.

378
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,500
Chuyue.

379
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:29,610

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,010
An Jingling sent him here.

568
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,360
So An Jingling already knows

569
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,820
the secret of the meteorite and the weather.

570
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,360
Take the meteorite with us when we go to the exhibition.

571
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,040
At the first glance,

572
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,720
these two pieces of clothes

573
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,470
show a strong style of Shangyu.

574
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:28,340
But after taking a closer look,

575
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,370
they look like formal dresses in your world.

576
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:35,650
Dear, you're really amazing.

577
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,100
I made more than 10 sample pieces

578
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,480
to achieve this effect.

579
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,830
I'm imagining

580
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,910
myself walking on the runway wearing this outfit.

581
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,040
In Chuyang's words,

582
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,010
it would be the best moment in my life.

583
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:51,640
After this exhibition is over,

584
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,320
I want to create a brand.

585
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,630
The brand's name will be YZ.

586
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,390
It consists of the first letters

587
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,900
of the last words in our names.

588
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:00,370
It will be printed on every piece of clothes

589
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,510
designed by me.

590
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,630
What do you think?

591
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,920
[Sloth Delivery]

592
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,400
What is this?

593
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,030
Welcome to Sloth Delivery.

594
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,700
You can write a letter to your future self here.

595
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,030
We will deliver the letter to you

596
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,540
on the designated date.

597
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,220
The delivery date

598
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,150
doesn't matter.

599
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,080
It can be some day in 1 year, 3 years, or 10 years.

600
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,790
It doesn't matter.

601
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,560
Let's write a letter to each other.

602
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,130
We can't tell each other

603
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,350
about the delivery date and the content of the letter.

604
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,350
What do you think?

605
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,500
Okay. Sounds interesting.

606
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,870
Just write it?

607
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,480
Yes.

608
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,790
What kind of letter paper do you like?

609
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,500
This one.

610
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,100
It hurts.

611
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,620
Did I do something wrong

612
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,340
to make you punish me like this?

613
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,400
It's so wonderful.

614
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,340
I want to verify if I'm dreaming.

615
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,920
To verify if you are dreaming,

616
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:19,370
shouldn't you pinch yourself?

617
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:20,500
Why did you pinch me?

618
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,540
If I pinch myself, won't you be concerned?

619
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,380
I will.

620
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,430
But I also want to verify it.

621
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,140
Have you verified it?

622
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,780
No.

623
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,350
I think I need to verify it for the rest of my life.

624
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,810
You played a trick with me.

625
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,200
What's on your mind now?

626
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,220
I'm wondering

627
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,860
what you wrote in the letter.

628
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,830
Nothing.

629
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,160
Just saying hello to you

630
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,470
and those kids.

631
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,990
I said we can't tell each other about the content.

632
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:11,470
What kids?

633
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:13,420
You haven't even discussed with me.

634
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:13,990
Come on.

635
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,070
I'm looking forward to the show tomorrow night

636
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:26,800
and many days

637
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,180
we will have together in the future.

638
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,830
Your dress is so beautiful.

639
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,780
It shows an ancient noble style.

640
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,950
It's as if it's tailor-made for you.

641
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,870
The designer is my wife.

642
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,430
So pretty.

643
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,130
You are the only person suitable for this dress

644
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,960
in this world.

645
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,600
You are the creator of all this.

646
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,810
I have a surprise for you tonight.

647
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:19,280
I'm going to see if models are ready.

648
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,250
Go.

649
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,060
Did you bring the outfit?

650
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,260
Assistant.

651
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:29,950
Here.

652
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,560
It's not this one.

653
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,080
Did you take the wrong one?

654
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,310
No. 28.

655
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,460
This one is right.

656
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:39,790
Okay, I'm going to take a look.

657
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,240
I did put it here.

658
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,440
Why is it gone?
