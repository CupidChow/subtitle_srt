4
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:43,710
Tell me.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,200
What did you do to Chuyue?

6
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:02,040
Wait.

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,530
Li Chuyue is still alive.

8
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,539
If you kill me,

9
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,890
you will never see her again.

10
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,610
Where is she?

11
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,410
I've told my men

12
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,060
to kill Li Chuyue

13
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,790
if they don't get any news by 7:45 a.m.

14
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,300
You still have half an hour left.

15
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,660
Fine.

16
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,990
I won't kill you.

17
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,790
Tell me where she is.

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,870
Yunwu Mountain.

19
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,840
Brother! Brother!

20
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,420
Don't make a move yet.

21
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,650
If I die,

22
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,460
you won't make it to tomorrow.

23
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,390
What did you say?

24
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,079
Look at your palm.

25
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,540
What is this? What did you do?

26
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,960
I poisoned your wine.

27
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,060
It's my very own

28
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,900
Black Death Poison.

29
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,700
If the poisoned one doesn't take the antidote

30
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,140
within two hours,

31
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
he or she will die.

32
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,200
Where is the antidote?

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,980
It's with me.

34
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,730
But you tied me up.

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,260
How can I get it for you?

36
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,380
Behave yourself.

37
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,920
Get the antidote quickly.

38
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,260
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

39
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,390
Why are you so hard on me?

40
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:13,140
Since it's the antidote, of course it has to be hidden well.

41
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,600
Find it.

42
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:15,780
Hurry!

43
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,920
Where can I get it?

44
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,810
Hurry up.

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,870
Are you kidding me?

46
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,580
I'll find it.

47
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,760
Let me see...

48
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
Chuyue, are you okay?

49
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,710
You're here.

50
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
If you were a little later,

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,610
I would have been killed.

52
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,420
Don't worry. I'm already here.

53
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,050
Young Lord, please spare my life.

54
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,010
Young Madam, please spare my life.

55
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,620
Please give me the antidote.

56
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,010
I recall it now. You have to eat dirt.

57
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,780
Dirt?

58
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,610
If you don't buy it, forget it.

59
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:56,890
Time is limited anyway.

60
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,750
Suit yourself.

Thank you for sparing my life.

00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,670
Chuyue, I came late.

65
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,550
You've suffered a lot.

66
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,950
I was really freaked out.

67
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,780
But I knew

68
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,200
you would come to save me.

69
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,210
You even know how to poison people?

70
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,050
No.

71
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,220
I fooled him

72
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,420
because I saw powder on his palm.

73
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,630
You're indeed my wife.

74
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,370
How resourceful you are.

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,460
Now that

77
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,480
the traitors have been eliminated, we'll be back on track.

78
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,650
After this incident,

79
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,200
Young Lord can finally manage everything on his own.

80
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,980
Before I recover,

81
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,860
Young Lord will be given the authority

82
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,810
to take care of everything in the villa.

83
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,140
I hope you all can stand shoulder to shoulder with him.

84
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,900
We surely will strain every nerve

85
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,650
and do our utmost.

86
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,360
I appreciate that very much, elders.

87
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,400
Please have a seat.

88
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,200
After the removal of Zhou Wei and his gang,

89
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,260
the position of butler was left vacant.

90
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,250
Therefore, we must organise some talent competitions

91
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,340
to develop more young people

92
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,850
so that they could serve in our villa.

93
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,460
That's a good idea.

94
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:35,280
Let's start with the mounted archery.

95
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,970
Zhao, you're taking part too.

96
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,260
Yes.

97
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,240
The man on the horse is so handsome.

98
00:06:58,610 --> 00:06:59,210
Am I right?

99
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,720
Guards!

100
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,550
Ling, you know how to shoot arrows too?

101
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,430
Father has been urging us to practise mounted archery since we were young.

102
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,930
You do have both brains and brawn.

103
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:22,530
Show me.

104
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,120
Brilliant!

105
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,550
Don't worry.

106
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,730

110
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,030
May I borrow a good horse from you?

111
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
I want to join too.

112
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,320
Ling, aren't you usually not interested

113
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,510
in mounted archery?

114
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,130
What happened today?

115
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,260
It's just a whim.

116
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:12,850
Good.

117
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,900
Choose a good horse for Jingling.

118
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,250
Come with me.

119
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,480
Ling is not good at riding horses.

120
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,950
He does not usually participate in this activity.

121
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,169
What happened today?

122
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,200
He is biting off more than he can chew.

123
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:48,150
Participation is more important than winning.

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,290
Let's begin.

125
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,580
Today, the villa is holding a mounted archery competition.

126
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,890
The aim is to select the best disciples

127
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,520
to take up key positions at the villa.

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,120
Next, I'll announce the rules.

129
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,170
The red and blue teams

130
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:15,160
will respectively be represented by one player for each round.

131
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,140
The players have to hit the target in front of them.

132
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,590
They'll get one point if they hit the bullseye.

133
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,320
Or else, they'll get no points.

134
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,890
The one with the highest score wins the game.

135
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,960
Now I announce that

136
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,300
the game begins.

137
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,870
Awesome!

138
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,620
Awesome!

139
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,170
Go! Go! Go!

140
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,520
Let's welcome the last team.

141
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,120
Bravo!

142
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:44,270
Bravo!

143
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,420
Bravo! Bravo!

144
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,020
The teams are level now.

145
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,620
They are going to have an extra game.

146
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,140
There's only one target.

147
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,960
The one who hits it first wins.

148
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:32,870
Well...

149
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,720
Young Master.

150
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:39,920
Young Lord!

151
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,500
Jingzhao.

152
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,240
-Young Lord.
-An Jingzhao.

153
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,270
An Jingzhao, are you alright?

154
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,580
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

155
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,090
Ling,

156
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,060
Are you okay?

157
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,020
I'm fine. It's all my fault.

158
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:56,740
Zhao.

159
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,220
Grandmother, I'm fine.

160
00:11:59,220 --> 00:11:59,770
Don't worry.

161
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,440
Don't act tough if you're not capable enough.

162
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,500
You almost killed Zhao.

163
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,440
What a good-for-nothing.

164
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,490
Father.

165
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,640
It was an accident. It's not Ling's fault.

166
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,500
Now you know you are incompetent.

167
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,760
Why don't you just amuse yourself with writing at home?

168
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,400
Shooting while riding horses is a skill.

169
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,070
So is writing.

170
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,450
Who dares to compete with Second Young Master in terms of writing and painting?

171
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,850
I'm afraid most of you are even illiterate.

172
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:26,690
Lord,

173
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,950
diverse talent

174
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,910
leads the villa to a better future.

175
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,780
Jingling is excellent. Don't scold him like that.

176
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:34,980
That's right.

177
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,380
Dear,

178
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,540
go help me apply the medicine.

179
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,170
Are you okay?

180
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,400
Are you homesick?

181
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,340
But,

182
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,730
I'm willing to stay here with you all the time.

183
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,240
The moment you saved Jingling today

184
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,500
really freaked me out.

185
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,050
If you weren't there,

186
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,840
there would be the devil to pay.

187
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,310
My husband

188
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,460
is really a great hero.

189
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,150
Am I getting a reward for that?

190
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,750
Young Lord, Young Madam.

191
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,910
Chef Zhang made these sugar cakes with Sophora flowers.

192
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,040
Please have a taste.

193
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,260
Try some?

194
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,520
Does it still hurt?

195
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,670
It doesn't matter.

196
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,630
Young Lord, Young Madam.

197
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:10,140
How is it?

198
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,150
Chef Zhang's really good at making Sophora cakes.

199
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,730
Try it.

200
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,150
How is it?

201
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,210
Let's give some to Ling.

202
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,890
He is usually meek and mild.

203
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,860
I'm afraid he's had a shock today.

204
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,120
Let's go and visit him.

205
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,100
You are really the best brother in Shangyu.

206
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:32,630
Let's go.

207
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,250
Let me do it. You're injured.

208
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,220
Let me do it.

209
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,240
Young Lord.

210
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,770
Lord wants to meet you

211
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,770
for some reason.

212
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,260
Go ahead.

213
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,760
Let me do it.

214
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,700
Go.

215
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,510
Chuyue.

216
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,470
You're indeed a good boy who studies hard.

217
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,860
I'm just looking around as I have nothing to do.

218
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,340
Here.

219
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,490
This is the Sophora cakes newly made today.

220
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,580
Try some.

221
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,400
It's delicious and sweet.

222
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,860
Thank you for giving me the sweet cakes.

223
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,790
You're welcome.

224
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,060
Don't mind what happened during the day.

225
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,340
Anything you say.

226
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,310
You are so obedient.

227
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,330
An Jingzhao is right.

228
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,350
I really envy my brother.

229
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,540
Why?

230
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,990
He's competent.

231
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,820
Why are you still thinking about it?

232
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,910
Didn't I tell you?

233
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,160
No matter it's zither-playing, chess, calligraphy or painting, you excel at everything.

234
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,220
Most importantly, you're talented.

235
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,960
What's wrong? Can't I take a look?

236
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,580
No.

237
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,040
It's just an unworthy work I'm ashamed to show.

238
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,630
It's such a good painting.

239
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:37,690
Why is it unworthy?

240
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,110
Jingling,

241
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,160
your confidence

242
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,820
isn't level with your talent.

243
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,310
I wish it could.

244
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,000
Of course it can.

245
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,710
If I were as talented as you,

246
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,440
I would have been over the moon.

247
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,580
Over the moon?

248
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:53,190
It means you are excellent,

249
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,340
unique and smart.

250
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,460
Do you really think so?

251
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,340
But the last time I compared notes with my friends,

252
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:06,030
they said the woman in the painting walking on the river

253
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,619
was strangely vague.

254
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,140
Her steps on the water were lit by a faint light.

255
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,130
Isn't that an artistic expression?

256
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,359
It's not strange at all.

257
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,359
It's just that they've got no taste.

258
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,660
Her steps on the water

259
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,829
were lit by a faint light...

260
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,710
What are you thinking about with rapt attention?

261
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,150
I'm thinking that,

262
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,560
Chuyue,

263
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,460
you really know me the best in the world.

264
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,280
I'm just having more

265
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,700
appreciation for fine art than them.

266
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,610
So, be confident.

267
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,860
With your image,

268
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,220
you would be a very well-liked young hunk

269
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,950
among the girls in my hometown.

270
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,030
What about you?

271
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,660
I mean,

272
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,370
is your hometown very different from ours?

273
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,800
When I was young,

274
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,580
I went to Furong Town near Hanshui Sect.

275
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,810
It didn't seem to have much difference

276
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,880
from our villa.

277
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,420
Well,

278
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,120
I've left Hanshui Sect since I was a kid.

279
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,090
The place where I grew up

280
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,440
does have a lot of difference.

281
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,000
What's the difference?

282
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,370
Are you reading the ledger?

283
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,690
The test this time is to sort out the villa's accounts.

284
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,630
I'm not good at it, and I'm always slower than others.

285
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,790
I'm afraid I might disappoint you.

286
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,430
Look.

287
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,280
You're denying yourself again.

288
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,830
Undoubtedly, you are smart.

289
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,800
Most importantly, you have koi fish to give you blessings.

290
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,060
You will definitely win the first place.

291
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,020
Why do you have to write so many words for a transaction?

292
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,040
No wonder the progress is so slow.

293
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,780
I have an idea.

294
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Give me the brush.

295
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:13,490
Chuyue.

296
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,380
What are you writing?

297
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,420
Numbers.

298
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,250
It is a calculation method in my hometown.

299
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,720
I see.

300
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,850
No wonder I saw them

301
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,610
in your album of paintings too.

302
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,620
It seems to be

303
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:32,020
much faster than our calculation methods.

304
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,220
So,

305
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,940
I'm going to teach you the method today.

306
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,600
And you'll be number one

307
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,820
when sorting out the ledgers tomorrow.

308
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,400
Look.

309
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,590
One and zero make up the number ten.

310
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,460
Ten.

311
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,390
One and one make up the number 11.

312
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,880
One and two make up the number 12.

313
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,380
One and three make up the number 13.

314
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,540
Chuyue.

315
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,690
Where did you grow up?

316
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,800
You're so different.

317
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,880
Look. Umbrellas.

318
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,980
Fragrant sachets.

319
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,450
[Huangyue House]

320
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,780
Excuse me.

321
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,440
You're here.

322
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,200
Please have a seat.

323
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:29,420
Which song would you like to listen to today?

324
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,660
I'll ask them to come over

325
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,660
so that you can take your pick.

326
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,260
No need.

327
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,290
Get Yuege here.

328
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,650
What a pity.

329
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,900
Yuege is occupied now.

330
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,940
Why don't you...

331
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,540
Forget it.

332
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,180
I'd like a pot of good wine.

333
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,460
Okay, right away.

334
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,360
I'll inform Yuege now.

335
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,590
When he is available later,

336
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,240
I'll send him over to keep you company

337
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,370
Have some tea first.

338
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,440
Serve the wine.

339
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,180
Miss, do you need anything else?

340
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:53,170
I'd like another pot of wine.

341
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:53,980
Wine?

342
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,640
No problem.

343
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:56,190
Do you need any desserts?

344
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,990
Yes, I'd like a plate of desserts.

345
00:20:58,990 --> 00:20:59,420
Sure.

346
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,910
Lord,

347
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,180
we found

348
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,290
Li San's traces

349
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,330
around the downtown streets.

350
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,460
Good.

351
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,340
Lord,

352
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,990
I have one more thing to report.

353
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,020
There's a sudden change in Yunwei Villa.

354
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,170
Zhou Wei, who made an alliance with us,

355
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,050
has been taken down as a traitor.

356
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,430
Before this, he did all kinds of evil

357
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,200
in the name of our sect.

358
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,010
Now, all the other sects

359
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,680
hate us more than ever.

360
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,180
So you must be very careful

361
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,900
in this operation.

362
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,700
Back then, I allied with Zhou Wei

363
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,160
because he assured me that

364
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,340
after he succeeded to the position of the Lord,

365
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,000
he would stop the other sects from picking on us.

366
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,870
But judging from his behaviour,

367
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,570
he is just a deceitful and arrogant villain.

368
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Those who claim to be righteous are also treacherous.

369
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:09,460
Don't have dealings with

370
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,780
such a person anymore.

371
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,230
Lord, you are wise.

372
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:15,450
Now, our sect has a deep grudge against the others.

373
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,060
I'm afraid there's no room for turning back.

374
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,470
Why don't we take this opportunity

375
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,420
to settle the score with them,

376
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,900
along with the death of the former lord?

377
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:28,320
The former lord lost his mind because he practised witchcraft

378
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,890
and committed innumerable murders.

379
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,950
So he deserved it.

380
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,340
We don't have to risk our disciples' lives

381
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,480
for such a person.

382
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,310
I'll go find Li San.

383
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,940
You go back to the cliff cave and ask the disciples to strengthen their defence.

384
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,340
Yes.

385
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:06,420
Young Master.

386
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,900
Didn't you say Miss Hongfei is waiting for me?

387
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,630
Where is she?

388
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,380
She just left.

389
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,400
Take care, sir.

390
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,500
Lord.

391
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,220
We found that Yueming has

392
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,480
a servant named Li San.

393
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:45,790
He is a cripple

394
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,650
He might know where the Art of Starshift is.

395
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,150
[Tavern]

396
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:02,980
Here.

397
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,010
Come on.

398
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,140
Come on.

399
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,900
Sir, a bottle of wine.

400
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,180
Noted that.

401
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,770
What kind of wine is this?

402
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,370
I don't smell alcohol at all.

403
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,520
How dare you sell it?

404
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,380
Sir,

405
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,740
you've drunk so much of it.

406
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,460
Now you say it's tasteless.

407
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,200
Isn't it a bit...

408
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,010
Screw you!

409
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,820
Give me two more jars of wine.

410
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,450
Then I'll spare you today.

411
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,990
Everyone in the Qingling Sect is a kung fu master.

412
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:40,430
Can you afford to offend us?

413
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,310
He doesn't know martial arts at all.

414
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,220
I think I got the wrong person.

415
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,260
It's not easy...

416
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:46,710
Go to hell!

417
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,700
It's not easy...

418
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,100
They've gone too far.

419
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,530
Say it again!

420
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,110
Nine Poisons Whip?

421
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:32,040
You are Hongfei from the Evil Sect.

422
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:37,870
Today, I'll kill the witch from the Evil Sect.

423
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,850
She is somehow a little pretty.

424
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,730
Why don't we have some fun before killing her?

425
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,980
You asked for death.

426
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,200
So I'll grant your wish.

427
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,690
[Yunwei Villa]

428
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,980
Ling, don't be nervous.

429
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,860
Ling, hurry up.

430
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,290
They are waiting for you.

431
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,110
Good luck.

432
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,080
Go.

433
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,210
Father.

434
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,380
Thirty minutes are given.

435
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,130
Time begins.

436
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,900
They're all young and promising.

437
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:09,500
Yes.

438
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:10,740
Right?

439
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,070
The younger generation will surpass us in time.

440
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,440
I've finished it. Please have a look.

441
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,220
So soon?

442
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,490
Remember not to be careless

443
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,790
and full of oneself,

444
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,140
or you'll embarrass yourself.

445
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,260
I'm sure I've finished it.

446
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,470
Show me.

447
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,430
Second Young Master has indeed completed

448
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,900
in sorting out all accounts

449
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,980
with no mistake.

450
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,680
Not bad, Second Young Master.

451
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,340
Yes.

452
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,050
You've made some progress.

453
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,400
You have to learn more in the future

454
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,370
to help your brother.

455
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:58,940
Yes.

456
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Zhao, follow me to the hall for a meeting.

457
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,670
See you, Lord.

458
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,300
Is it true?

459
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,220
Rumour has it that

460
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,380
the witch of the Evil Sect has been frequenting

461
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:32,180
and threatening the righteous sects.

462
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
How arrogant!

463
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,790
How are the disciples?

464
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,850
I heard that the Nine Poisons Whip is extremely toxic.

465
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,250
It'd be worse than death if the poison diffuses into the bone.

466
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,430
As for this matter,

467
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,700
how did the others react?

468
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,570
Some sects went to the Devil's Cave to denounce it

469
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,720
but failed.

470
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,950
So the martial artists who came today

471
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,010
are all here for this?

472
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:56,810
Yes.

473
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,220
Young Lord defeated the former lord of the Evil Sect before

474
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,770
and became well-known for that.

475
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,450
All the other sects are now hoping for Young Lord

476
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,740
to seek justice for the righteous sects.

477
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,560
Zhao,

478
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,700
what do you think about this?

479
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,770
I'm willing to go to the Evil Sect

480
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:19,900
to get the antidote.

481
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,020
I told you.

482
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,080
You surely can get the first place with the koi fish.

483
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,440
Thank you, Chuyue.

484
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,260
I'm just kidding.

485
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:32,200
You got the first place because you are capable.

486
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:34,540
No.

487
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,490
It's because of you.

488
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,470
How honey-tongued you are.

489
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,580
It gratifies my vanity a lot.

490
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,540
I don't know how to thank you.

491
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,130
I wonder

492
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,530
if you'd like this painting.

493
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,050
Is this me?

494
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,450
Sorry for the inexpertness.

495
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,050
That day at the racecourse,

496
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,050
you were so afraid of being seen.

497
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,660
I thought you were drawing your crush.

498
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:10,970
It turns out that you were afraid of being misunderstood.

499
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,260
It's a good painting.

500
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,720
Thanks.

501
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,340
Chuyue, I...

502
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,410
I...

503
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,200
Thank you.

504
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,130
You're welcome.

505
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,590
You're amazing on your own.

506
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,550
Trust yourself.

507
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,630
You can fulfil any of your wishes.

508
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:32,810
Really?

509
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,490
Of course.

510
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,940
You have to believe in yourself.

511
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,700
You deserve all the good things in the world.

512
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,740
What are you thinking about?

513
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:49,860
I know it.

514
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,150
You have a crush, don't you?

515
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,700
No.

516
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,320
Who is it? Do I know her?

517
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,220
If I do have a crush,

518
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,850
will she like me?

519
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,310
Of course she will.

520
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,910
Don't you look in the mirror every morning?

521
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,050
You are so charming.

522
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,680
Can't you see it yourself?

523
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,170
Do you really think so?

524
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,310
I mean it.

525
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,050
Hurry up and confess your love.

526
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,070
Be brave.

527
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,460
Will she really accept me?

528
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,610
If a prince charming like you confesses to her,

529
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,060
not only will she accept it

530
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:28,230
but also jump for joy.

531
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,150
Really?

532
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:38,910
Mother.

533
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,760
Ling, you're here.

534
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,220
Why are you so cheerful today?

535
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,740
I won first place

536
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,680
in the accounting test today.

537
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,760
Did your father give you a reward?

538
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,530
I knew it.

539
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,170
Mother.

540
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,090
Don't mind the trivia.

541
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,510
Father has treated me well recently.

542
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,740
When I get a chance,

543
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,200
I'll ask him to let you out.

544
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,040
Stop lying to yourself.

545
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,440
I can tell your current status

546
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,500
from the attitude of the servants when they serve me the food.

547
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,140
Mother.

548
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,390
Please say no more.

549
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,740
I'm imprisoned here

550
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,280
and bullied by others,

551
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,400
hoping that one day you can be successful

552
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,440
and take me out.

553
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:26,660
But you...

554
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,500
You expect An Chenghu

555
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,630
and An Jingzhao will have mercy on you.

556
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,220
Stop dreaming, Ling.

557
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,940
They will get rid of you sooner or later.

558
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,970
Just see what happened to Zhou Wei.

559
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:42,300
Mother,

560
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,260
you've misunderstood Jingzhao.

561
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,810
He's not that kind of person.

562
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,740
All these years,

563
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,430
he's been taking care of me.

564
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,220
Son,

565
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,270
you're so silly.

566
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,850
Why didn't you tell me you fell off the horse

567
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,910
during the mounted archery that day?

568
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:00,110
I didn't want you to worry.

569
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,230
There was something wrong with my horse that day.

570
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,500
Luckily, Jingzhao saved me.

571
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,900
That's why I didn't get hurt.

572
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,300
Do you really think that was an accident?

573
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,969
Mother, what do you mean?

574
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,670
I don't understand.

575
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,159
You can get the answer from the horse breeder.

576
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,429
So there was another reason

577
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:41,570
for me falling off the horse that day?

578
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,100
Yes.

579
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,239
Its palm was not nailed right.

580
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,580
It would definitely fall when running.

581
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,429
What did you say?

582
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,770
Please don't tell Young Lord,

583
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,409
or I'll be in trouble.

584
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,370
Did Young Lord know there was something wrong with it?

585
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,390
Young Lord always knows his horses very well.

586
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:07,970
You may leave now.

587
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,450
Jingzhao

588
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,500
purposely picked a horse that would fall for me.

589
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,420
It could have killed me,

590
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,540
or at least embarrass me.

591
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,460
He himself ended up stealing the limelight.

592
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:26,890
Yes.

593
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,880
He's been like this since childhood.

594
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,880
He seems to be protecting me all the time,

595
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,620
but in fact, he has caused Father to hate me more.

596
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:37,820
No.

597
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,820
Jingzhao is not that kind of person.

598
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,320
But why did he harm me?

599
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,880
I need to ask him in person.

600
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,000
[Yunwei Villa]

601
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,580
It's just a painting.

602
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,310
Why did you make such a fuss?

603
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,810
You and Jingling have been too close recently.

604
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,870
Don't you think so?

605
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,100
You asked me to care more about him.

606
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,980
Moreover, he's your own brother.

607
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,990
No, even if he is my brother,

608
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,950
I can't stand it.

609
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,620
Something's wrong with

610
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,540
the way he looks at you now.

611
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,870
Didn't you notice that?

612
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:14,060
Young Lord,

613
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,400
you're being too possessive.

614
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,820
He's just becoming more confident.

615
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,670
You've given it too much thought.

616
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:20,730
It's not like that.

617
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,780
I'm a man.

618
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,740
I know the feeling better than you.

619
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,050
An Jingzhao, listen properly.

620
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,560
An Jingling is just my brother.

621
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,060
He used to be, and he'll always be.

622
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,980
There's no chance between him and me.

623
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,230
Absolutely not.

624
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:40,260
If you mind,

625
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,230
I'll keep a distance from him.

626
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:44,850
Also,

627
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,120
if your sixth sense is so good,

628
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,580
can you feel that

629
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,110
I treat you differently?

630
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,900
I want to be with you forever.

631
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,780
You don't believe me?

632
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,660
You can feel it if you don't believe my words.

633
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,730
Do you really think it was an accident?

634
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,870
Young Lord always knows his horses very well.

635
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,060
An Jingling is just my brother.

636
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,980
He used to be, and he'll always be.

637
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,660
There's no chance between him and me.

638
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,100
Absolutely not.

639
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:03,460
Why are you doing this to me?

640
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,870
Why?

641
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,290
Chuyue,

642
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:11,060
you will be mine.

643
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,060
An Jingzhao, you hypocrite!

644
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,000
Everything you stole from me,

645
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,110
I will take them back.

646
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,390
Ling.

647
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:42,540
You...

648
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:44,590
What's wrong with you?

649
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:46,250
Mother,

650
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,890
can you give me the box

651
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,710
you wanted to give me last time?

652
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,090
Can you?

653
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,190
Why?

654
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,460
Have you thought it through?

655
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,420
You are right.

656
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,300
Only when I become stronger

657
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,380
can I save you

658
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,680
and get what I want.

659
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,470
Good.

660
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,220
Good.

661
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,380
That day,

662
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:38,780
something was wrong with the hoof of the horse that Second Young Master fell off.

663
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,180
You...

664
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,470
How did you know?

665
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,630
I have my own way.

666
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,030
Your negligence almost killed Second Young Master.

667
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,180
Should I deliver a message to the Lord?

668
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,020
I'm guilty. It's my fault.

669
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,970
Please don't tell Young Lord,

670
00:39:53,970 --> 00:39:55,650
or I'll die.

671
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:56,740
Please.

672
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,950
I can keep it a secret.

673
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:00,560
But

674
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,730
you have to do something for me.

675
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:07,240
Tell Second Young Master as I say.

676
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,380
Ling,

677
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,010
don't blame me for being cruel.

678
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,910
If I didn't do so,

679
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:18,000
you'd be meek and submissive to An Jingzhao for the rest of your life.

680
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,290
We will never be able to make a comeback.

681
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,300
Ling.

682
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,790
Come, sit down.

683
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:48,410
Ling.

684
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,680
Sit.

685
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,460
Your grandfather left this box for me.

686
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:17,840
Father,

687
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,380
these are the accounts you asked me to tally.

688
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,440
Please have a look.

689
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,820
Pretty good.

690
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:47,100
Pass these accounts to Young Lord

691
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,360
and ask him to have a look.

692
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,330
You may leave now.

693
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,200
Anything else?

694
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,640
Recently, Father and Jingzhao have been discussing

695
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,140
ways to deal with the Evil Sect.

696
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,670
I'm too incompetent to get a word in edgewise.

697
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,180
So I researched the poison of the Nine Poisons Whip

698
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,480
and figured out the toxic substances

699
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,180
that the witch used to make the Nine Poisons Whip.

700
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
The detox is hard

701
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,210
because it mixes with our inner force.

702
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,140
I also heard that

703
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,270
these toxic substances are kept in the Devil's Cave.

704
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,890
I shall ask for your permission for me

705
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:32,850
to go find the toxic substances and destroy them

706
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:36,310
so that the threat of the martial arts world can be eradicated.

707
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,360
It's rare to see my son with such an ambition.

708
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:47,020
But it's hard to enter the Devil's Cave.

709
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
Are you sure of it?

710
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,700
I would like to ask Jingzhao to go with me.

711
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:54,840
We went to the Devil's Cave once to find the letters

712
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,860
that proved Zhou Wei had colluded with the Evil Sect.

713
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:59,140
Together, we'll succeed and come back.

714
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,520
That's my son.

715
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:02,990
Go.
