[Episode 25]

4
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:54,620
Li Chuyue.

5
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,700
I heard you broke Jingzhao's heart.

6
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,900
Unlike you,

7
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,090
I will only treat him well.

8
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,020
I will do whatever he likes.

9
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,539
I'm willing to do anything for him.

10
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,030
He will absolutely be mine in the end.

11
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,100
Bai Zhi,

12
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,340
I hope you can be with An Jingzhao.

13
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,079
Don't worry.

14
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,540
I will.

15
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,170
Jingzhao.

16
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,220
With Bai Zhi by your side,

17
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,470
I'll be relieved.

18
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,450
Come here.

19
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,960
Take the torch.

20
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,930
Hongfei.

21
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:06,700
Hongfei.

22
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,100
Hongfei.

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,460
We're here to save you.

24
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
Come on.

25
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:15,990
Don't move.

26
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:19,390
These vines are connected to some mechanism.

27
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,310
Once they're broken,

28
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,110
the whole prison will collapse.

29
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,100
All of you will die.

30
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,690
The mechanism?

31
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,870
Just turn it off.

32
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,770
I've been observing for a long time.

33
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,620
There's no button for the mechanism here.

34
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,880
You'd better leave now

35
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,200
in case you die with me.

36
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,620
We will find it.

37
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,579
Hang in there.

38
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,200
What's wrong with you two?

39
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,510
Li Chuyue broke Jingzhao's heart.

40
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,800
She said she never loved him.

41
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,760
The bricks here

42
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,820
seem to be different from the others.

43
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Chuyue, don't...

44
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:34,140
Are you okay?

45
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,840
I don't think the button for the mechanism is here.

46
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,280
No, this is it.

47
00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:41,380
There's another one over there.

48
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,560
These two should be pressed at the same time

49
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,560
at the same speed to untie the vines.

50
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:46,380
Jingzhao,

51
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,620
I'll press it at the same time with you.

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,430
There's no such tacit understanding between us.

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,159
If we can't press them at the same time,

54
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,960
the whole prison will collapse.

55
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,300
Chuyue.

56
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,620
Are you sure?

57
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:28,730
It's open.

58
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,890
Let's go.

59
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,140
Bai Zhi.

60
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,130
Stop following us.

61
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,300
I have something to tell Hongfei.

62
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,620
It's easy to attract attention
if there are too many people.

63
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,280
Just leave.

64
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,090
Okay.

65
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,350
Let's go too.

66
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,330
Let's go.

67
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:42,860
Let's go.

68
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,890
Thank you for saving me.

69
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,650
I've always been fair.

70
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,040
I will repay you

71
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,050
for what you did for me today.

72
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,860
You are not the murderer.

73
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,570
I was just telling the truth.

74
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,520
You shouldn't have been wronged like this.

75
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,750
The most important thing now

76
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,350
is to find the real murderer.

77
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:18,970
Witch.

78
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,050
Today, I will enforce justice on behalf of Heaven!

79
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,610
Attack!

80
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,170
An Jingzhao,

81
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,400
you let the witch go on purpose.

82
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,900
Indeed you collude with the Evil Sect.

83
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,020
You broke your promise

84
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,570
and tried to assassinate Hongfei in the first place.

85
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,630
That's why I did it.

86
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,460
I was just afraid that she would run away.

87
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,140
Now you collude with her.

88
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,450
Is there something shameful

89
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,700
between you two?

90
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,710
Zhu Maoqing.

91
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,520
Stop confusing right and wrong.

92
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,310
Besides,

93
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,630
I'm the young lord of Yunwei Villa.

94
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,890
I don't think you can mind my business.

95
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,770
I'll mind your business today!

96
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,090
Guards, arrest him!

97
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:58,700
Yes.

98
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,020
Wait.

99
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,000
Young Lord,

100
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,170
you emphasized over and again

101
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,970
that Hongfei is not the culprit,

102
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,330
but there is no concrete evidence to prove her innocence.

103
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,930
Now you let Hongfei go

104
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,870
and hurt our Young Master.

105
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,740
You made the mistake first.

106
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,350
I agree with Young Master.

107
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,670
Young Lord, you'd better not go out for now.

108
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,360
We'll decide

109
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,720
after Lord is here.

110
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,419
I told you

111
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,679
I have a reason no matter what I do.

112
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,730
Don't leave my side for the next few days.

113
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,780
Young Lord.

114
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,100
What's wrong?

115
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,630
Nothing.

116
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,100
I'm a little tired.

117
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,060
We'll talk later.

118
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,770
Jingzhao.

119
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,320
Jingzhao.

120
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,710
I heard everything.

121
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,620
I'll explain it to them now.

122
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,390
If they don't let you go,

123
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,380
we'll fight our way out.

124
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:16,980
Calm down.

125
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,540
The most important thing now is to find the murderer.

126
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,290
Jingzhao.

127
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,190
Let me help you.

128
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,960
Some people don't like it anyway.

129
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,630
Since you don't want to be Young Madam,

130
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
then do some tasks like serving tea.

131
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,700
I want to eat soup.

132
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:40,900
Go make it.

133
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,220
Sister.

134
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,970
Minion.

135
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,460
Boss.

136
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,680
Why are you here?

137
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,010
Li Chuyang.

138
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,330
Who allowed you to come here?

139
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,840
I finished my summer vacation homework.

140
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,570
I'm so bored.

141
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,970
There happens to be a thunderstorm.

142
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,280
So I came here

143
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,410
to visit my brother-in-law,

144
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,870
the in-laws and my minion.

145
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,660
You must go back on the next stormy day.

146
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,000
How are you feeling?

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,960
Are you okay?

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,900
I'm fine.

149
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:12,290
I'm still that handsome young man.

150
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:15,520
Is it because Chuyang didn't come back and forth often

151
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,320
so he hasn't suffered anything?

152
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,650
Sister.

153
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,220
Why is my brother-in-law being held by Bai Zhi?

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,100
Don't call him that.

155
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,030
We've broken up.

156
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,100
Break up?

157
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,090
Why?

158
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,950
What could you know as a kid?

159
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,170
Donghua, what happened?

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,830
Young Madam broke up with Young Lord,

161
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,360
saying she never loved him.

162
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,560
She also said it was just
for a moment of freshness.

163
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,620
It was just for fun.

164
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,860
What?

165
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,400
Who'd believe my sister's nonsense?

166
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,600
How is that possible?

167
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Why not?

168
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,970
Young Madam mentioned it several times.

169
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,610
Young Lord was injured.

170
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,000
With these many times of harm,

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,330
he was even more hurt.

172
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,920
He's more painful than ever.

173
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,850
I don't even know

174
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,860
how there could be such a cruel woman.

175
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,620
Trust me.

176
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,220
I know her best.

177
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,570
My sister must have her reasons.

178
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,410
How about this?

179
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,930
Leave it to me.

180
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,280
I'll figure it out.

181
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,680
Trust me.

182
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,520
Sister.

183
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,090
Sister.

184
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,930
Sister.

185
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,090
After I handed in your second exam work,

186
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,890
I met a strange old man on the way.

187
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:24,330
He knows that my brother-in-law is from Yunwei Villa.

188
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,140
Could it be Elder Yueming

189
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,640
that An Jingzhao has been looking for?

190
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,020
Why don't you tell my brother-in-law?

191
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm not going.

192
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,460
You go.

193
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,950
Sister,

194
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,350
you like him so much.

195
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,900
It's impossible it was just for fun.

196
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,390
What on earth happened?

197
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,320
Nothing.

198
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,800
I'm just not interested anymore.

199
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,420
No way.

200
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,710
You like him so much.

201
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,960
He's so hot,

202
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,140
handsome,

203
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,800
and good at martial arts.

204
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,550
They say men are like flowers in their 20s.

205
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,770
He'd be a flower even if he's 30

206
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,770
or 40.

207
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,530
He'll still be when he's 50.

208
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,730
See? You must have some hidden reasons.

209
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,920
What happened?

210
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,110
Tell me, your closest brother.

211
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,260
I just wanted to praise him. That's all.

212
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:14,030
I have nothing to do with him anymore.

213
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:19,620
No.

214
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,410
I have to find another way to let her tell.

215
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,970
Jingzhao,

216
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,570
let me pat the back for you.

217
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,200
No need.

218
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:34,690
The soup is ready.

219
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,700
Pat my back for me.

220
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,730
Jingzhao,

221
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,960
you are weak.

222
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,960
Let me feed you.

223
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,000
Jingzhao,

224
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,380
if you are tired,

225
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,420
you can take a rest on my shoulder.

226
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:17,250
His right waist was injured.

227
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
Don't overthink.

228
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,890
I just take you as a friend,

229
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,890
so I reminded you.

230
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,040
My waist was injured
because someone had bad sleeping habits.

231
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,790
I had bad sleeping habits

232
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,650
because you were inexperienced.

233
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,970
What sleeping habits?

234
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,320
What experience?

235
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,910
What are you talking about?

236
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,730
Bai Zhi, you can leave now.

237
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:44,110
I...

238
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,980
Get out.

239
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:46,730
No.

240
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:49,220
I don't know what they're talking about.

241
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,680
I can't intervene either.

242
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,700
I have to come up with something.

243
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:56,830
I'm leaving.

244
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,420
Inexperienced?

245
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,110
It's all in the past.

246
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,040
Young Lord,

247
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,360
we've got news that

248
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,020
the place with this soil has been found.

249
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,560
What soil?

250
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,990
You found a clue?

251
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,350
It's none of your business.

252
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,040
I will find it out.

253
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,030
How?

254
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,410
I can definitely help.

255
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,520
-Take me with you.
-I told you.

256
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,050
It's none of your business.

257
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,790
Take me with you.

258
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,710
Hurry up and leave.

259
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,970
Do you want to sleep with me?

260
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,700
Boss.

261
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,560
You're growing.

262
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,530
Eat more.

263
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,790
Li Chuyang.

264
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,180
What are you doing here?

265
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,900
I'm here to ask you

266
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,500
to teach me how to
speak your hometown dialect.

267
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,700
Okay.

268
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,570
Miss,

269
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,660
I can teach you.

270
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,800
But as you can see,

271
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,880
my brother-in-law and my sister are still close.

272
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,180
There might be
some misunderstanding between them.

273
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,420
I will compete with Li Chuyue fairly.

274
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:18,320
Miss,

275
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:19,470
look at you.

276
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,830
You are so beautiful

277
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,100
and rich.

278
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,550
Why are you so obsessed with one person?

279
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,510
Only mutual love is meaningful.

280
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,750
The reason's simple:

281
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,900
I like it.

282
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,060
Okay.

283
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,380
What do you want to learn?

284
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,300
How do you praise others
in your hometown dialect?

285
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,900
Handsome.

286
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,940
Dead handsome.

287
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,860
Dead handsome.

288
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,960
Dead?

289
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,140
How could that be a word of compliment?

290
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:55,420
When you combine the words together,

291
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,620
sometimes their meanings change.

292
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,790
Let me give you an example.

293
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,780
For example, my boss and I are dead close friends.

294
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,360
It means we are good friends.

295
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,530
Why did I tell her that much?

296
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,710
There are other examples.

297
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,940
For example, he's a little devil.

298
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,230
Miss,

299
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,280
I brought you a special perfume
from our hometown.

300
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:32,960
Spray it,

301
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,240
and you can definitely attract thousands of people.

302
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,770
Come and smell it.

303
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,340
Nice.

304
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,190
I'll take it.

305
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,540
Is Master Xuanfeng's situation, as rumor has it,

306
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:03,250
that he seems fine

307
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,480
but is in fact seriously injured?

308
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,190
God is on my side.

309
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,069
Master Xuanfeng's Neutral Kung Fu

310
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,000
is exactly what I need.

311
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,500
This is the perfect timing to take action.

312
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,020
After sucking Master Xuanfeng's power,

313
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:20,349
and proving that Hongfei is the murderer,

314
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,030
then

315
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,640
no one will suspect me.

316
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,589
You're brilliant.

317
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,670
What about my brother's situation?

318
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,240
He has been locked in the courtyard

319
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,840
and hasn't taken any action.

320
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,920
We still need to confirm

321
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,180
if he is investigating the clues I gave him.

322
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,510
Young Master,

323
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,830
Young Lord is already locked in his room.

324
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,930
Do we still need to worry about him?

325
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,680
He is highly skilled.

326
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,090
How could he be locked in his room?

327
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,610
[Zhuyin Pavilion]

328
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,970
The Profound Earth Sutra is so mysterious.

329
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,140
No wonder Father still hasn't mastered it all

330
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,920
after more than ten years of cultivation.

331
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,110
As you said,

332
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,060
I made a few.

333
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,940
I suddenly don't feel like eating anymore.

334
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,000
They're all yours.

335
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,020
Jingzhao,

336
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:28,890
I brought something for you.

337
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,300
Jingzhao,

338
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,540
I found

339
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,490
the most nutritious thing in the world.

340
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,900
This is the Jingyuan Elixir

341
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,520
made by God Nanqiao after 12 years of research.

342
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,140
This must be a luxury in the martial arts world.

343
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,950
12 years.

344
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,270
The luxurious goods in our place
would be like trash in front of this.

345
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:50,880
And this

346
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,170
is the ginseng of Fengnuan Pavilion.

347
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,560
There are only dozens of them in the world.

348
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:57,130
Oh my god.

349
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,660
This is so big.

350
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,940
It smells like banknotes.

351
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,870
Is it valuable?

352
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,650
Of course it's valuable.

353
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,560
You can't buy it even if you have money.

354
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,960
If you take this ginseng,

355
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,300
it will surely strengthen your body.

356
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:08,980
Jingzhao,

357
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,100
these are some everyday-use items.

358
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,740
And here

359
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,740
are the new clothes I made for you.

360
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,620
Can you change my sister now?

361
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,780
Let me see.

362
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,840
Jingzhao, you must look very handsome

363
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,860
if you wear this.

364
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,260
Do I look good?

365
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:32,940
Yes.

366
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,060
It looks like an outfit for a couple.

367
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,260
There will be many to come in the future.

368
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,300
An outfit for a couple?

369
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,430
What does that mean?

370
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,720
Jingzhao.

371
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,110
Let me help you put it on.

372
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,750
No hurry.

373
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,650
Put it back.

374
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,520
Congratulations.

375
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:52,020
One is tall, rich, and handsome. And the other is rich and beautiful.

376
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
You are a great match.

377
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:53,920
Of course.

378
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,180
I want to wear those beautiful clothes,

379
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:58,860
hang out with Bai Zhi,

380
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,700
and set up a tent

381
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,060
to spend the night together.

382
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,780
Jingzhao,

383
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,300
did you say you wanted to hang out with me?

384
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,370
Not just hanging out,

385
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,440
but also we'll travel around the world

386
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,710
and see all the beautiful scenery.

387
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,280
May you get the certificate soon

388
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,810
and have two in three years.

389
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:13,770
The certificate?

390
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,770
The certificate

391
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:18,820
and have two in three years,

392
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,850
what do these words mean?

393
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,050
Why should I tell you?

394
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,060
The certificate

395
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,020
means you become a couple of sworn brother and sister.

396
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,280
Have two in three years

397
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,610
means you swore twice in three years.

398
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,530
Jingzhao,

399
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,980
I don't want to get a certificate with you.

400
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,420
I curse you have two in three years.

401
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:39,800
No.

402
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,730
Have three!

403
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,350
Zhi.

404
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,540
How's the thing I asked you to do?

405
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,430
Don't worry.

406
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,710
Everything is ready.

407
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,690
Thank you.

408
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,230
An Jingzhao,

409
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,360
you've found a clue, haven't you?

410
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,410
I want to go with you.

411
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:55,870
I told you to stay out of it.

412
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:57,680
I will find out myself.

413
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,230
Jingzhao.

414
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,620
Jingzhao.

415
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,020
Are you feeling better?

416
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,300
I made some medicinal food today.

417
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,610
I sent some to Master Xuanfeng

418
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:12,850
and had some left for you.

419
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,720
How is Master?

420
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,710
Much better.

421
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,410
But he'll need more time to get well completely.

422
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,610
An Jingzhao found clues about the murderer.

423
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,330
I want to go with him.

424
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,160
He won't let me.

425
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,360
Help me persuade him.

426
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:26,900
Jingzhao,

427
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,540
I can go with you.

428
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,510
Take Chuyue,

429
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,900
so we can take care of each other on the way.

430
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,460
No need.

431
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,490
You can't go out now.

432
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,410
I'll go with Jingling.

433
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,140
We will be careful.

434
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:40,840
Ling.

435
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,420
Bai Zhi.

436
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,750
I'm a little tired.

437
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,480
You guys can leave now.

438
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,000
You stop right there!

439
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,200
Did I ask you to leave?

440
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,130
You stay.

441
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,780
Why do you let her stay?

442
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,990
Maybe I can fulfill your wish

443
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,790
and have three in a year with her.

444
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,540
An Jingzhao, what are you doing?

445
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,420
I told you

446
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,700
if you want to leave,

447
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,880
do as I say.

448
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,100
I can't get close to you now.

449
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,500
Why in the world are you behaving like this?

450
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,620
I mean…

451
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,830
we have no relationship now.

452
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,350
We need to keep a distance.

453
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:27,980
Li Chuyue,

454
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,460
if you don't want to be next to me,

455
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,690
I'll let you throw yourself in my arms.

456
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,410
Li Chuyue.

457
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,020
Go.

458
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,080
I don't want to see you again.

459
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:42,980
I can leave,

460
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,180
but I also want to know who the murderer is.

461
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Can I take some soil to investigate?

462
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:47,810
No.

463
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:48,740
Go!

464
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,420
Go!

465
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,860
Li Chuyue.

466
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,960
I told you I didn't want to see you again.

467
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,020
Since you throw yourself in my arms,

468
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,220
I'll grant your wish.

469
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,090
It's just sleeping with you.

470
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,490
You're handsome anyway.

471
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,860
Brother-in-law,

472
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,390
my sister must have her reasons.

473
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,390
I know how to make her tell the truth.

474
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,590
Let's go.

475
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,670
My sister finally fell asleep.

476
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,500
Sister,

477
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,460
where do you keep
your private money in your room?

478
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:08,980
Sister.

479
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,480
Under the calendar in my room.

480
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,500
You'll never find it.

481
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,090
If you don't give it to me,

482
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:19,390
I'll ask my brother-in-law for it.

483
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,670
He won't give it to you.

484
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,570
Who said that?

485
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,060
Brother-in-law is the best.

486
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,450
He will give me money for sure.

487
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,180
He's not only handsome
but also has a nice figure.

488
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,460
Yes.

489
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
His figure is alluring to everyone.

490
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,950
But

491
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,590
he's already mine.

492
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,660
So the novelty I felt about him has worn off.

493
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,790
I just want to go home now.

494
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:00,750
Brother-in-law.

495
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Brother-in-law.

496
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:03,210
Brother-in-law.

497
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,140
My sister must have some hidden reasons.

498
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,140
Brother-in-law.

499
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,250
Li Chuyue,

500
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,560
did you pretend to be asleep

501
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,800
and said that on purpose?

502
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,400
Do you know how angry he was
after hearing that?

503
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:37,440
Donghua said

504
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,570
they were going to look for some clues.

505
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,630
I think my brother-in-law
is avoiding you with that excuse.

506
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,690
Where are they now?

507
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,500
They probably have already left.

508
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:54,750
[Zhuyin Pavilion]

509
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,450
I've searched all the rooms,

510
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,870
but I didn't see him anywhere.

511
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,030
Has he really left?

512
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,220
No.

513
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:11,040
I have to go out to look for them.

514
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,900
How can I get out?

515
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,160
The room next door is
the resting room of Fengnuan Pavilion.

516
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,610
Maybe there are servants' clothes there.

517
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,330
If I disguise as a servant,

518
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
people from Zhuyin Pavilion won't stop me.

519
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,010
Donghua! Donghua!

520
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:09,910
Young... Young Madam.

521
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,940
Are you going to look for
the clues about the murderer?

522
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,800
I want to go too.

523
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,330
I...

524
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:15,970
Donghua.

525
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,320
From now on,

526
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,790
I don't want to see her again.

527
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,630
Take her back to the villa

528
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,330
and send her back

529
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,190
on a stormy day.

530
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,440
I'll go home

531
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,930
after I find the murderer.

532
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,720
Well...

533
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,220
Did they really go out of the town?

534
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,700
Yes.

535
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,590
How about Master Xuanfeng?

536
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,300
He is packing up.

537
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,090
He's going back to the temple to recuperate.

538
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,500
Good.

539
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,020
It's time to take action.

540
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,450
This soil is exactly the same
as that in your handkerchief.

541
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,460
It seems that someone has been here.

542
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,260
But he seemed to have left again.

543
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,030
Let's wait here

544
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,260
and see if he'll come back.

545
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,140
Donghua.

546
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,270
Young Lord.

547
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:41,040
Send Chuyue back to the villa.

548
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,990
Young Lord, but...

549
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,860
No buts.

550
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,730
Do as I say.

551
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,620
What time is it now?

552
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,270
Around six o'clock.

553
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,730
If you leave now

554
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,940
and take a shortcut,

555
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,940
you can go to the meeting place
with Master in advance.

556
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,190
Master, please.

557
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,530
Young Master, no need to go further.

558
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,440
Today, the gathering didn't end successfully.

559
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,350
I feel ashamed.

560
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,940
Don't mention it.

561
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,120
You helped me capture the witch, Hongfei.

562
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,380
It's all thanks to you.

563
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,240
I'm flattered.

564
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,360
Young Master, please go back.

565
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,520
Take care, Master.

566
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,910
Amitabha.

567
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,060
You finally showed up.

568
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:24,890
Ling?

569
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,130
Why is it you?

570
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,650
You hurt Lord Han?

571
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,140
Were both Madam and

572
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,860
the Magic Flower Valley Lord killed by you?

573
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,160
Why did you know the Art of Starshift?

574
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,690
Why did you do those things?

575
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,380
Why?

576
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,130
Father only loved you.

577
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:53,730
Since we were young,

578
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:55,130
I was never favored.

579
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,300
I ate what you didn't like,

580
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,810
wore the clothes that you picked over.

581
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,450
Everything in the villa is yours.

582
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,680
You are the young lord who's high above.

583
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,900
What about me?

584
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:09,390
I'm just an illegitimate son that no one likes.

585
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,820
I don't want to be looked down upon anymore.

586
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,970
I don't want to be bullied.

587
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,170
And I don't want my father to despise me.

588
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,230
I can only become strong by myself.

589
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,280
What are you talking about?

590
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:24,690
Father and Grandmother love you very much.

591
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,220
Love me?

592
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,780
What a joke.

593
00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:36,570
Do you know

594
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,220
what will happen to you

595
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,470
after you killed those people?

596
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,360
Zhuyin Pavilion will use their Shenyuan Whip

597
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,820
to impose flogging on you.

598
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:46,510
With only one whip,

599
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,240
you may lose all your primordial energy.

600
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,510
Zhao.

601
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,610
What happened?

602
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,820
Why did Master Xuanfeng get hurt?

603
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,100
Why did you release Hongfei of the Evil Sect?

604
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,600
It's a long story.

605
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,420
Although I've been looking for the Art of Starshift,

606
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,180
I've never seen the book.

607
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,950
But on the Holy Token of our sect,

608
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:34,330
there are three symbols of water, fire, and ice.

609
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,650
I wonder if they are related.

610
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,690
Lord Han's Cold Power corresponds to ice.

611
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:43,820
The Strong Power of
the Magic Flower Valley Lord is fire.

612
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:47,180
Then the next target of this person

613
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,900
should be the one whose cultivation
responds to the element of water.

614
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,160
Water corresponds to the Neutral Power.

615
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,690
Master Xuanfeng.

616
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,500
His next target is Master Xuanfeng.

617
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,860
I have an idea

618
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,680
to lure him out.

619
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,690
I need two people to work with me.

620
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,020
One is Master Xuanfeng,

621
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,130
and the other…

622
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,020
Who?

623
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,220
You.

624
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:10,660
Me?

625
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll set a trap...

626
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,680
and arrange for you and Master Xuanfeng to fight.

627
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,580
You need to create an illusion
that you hurt Master Xuanfeng severely

628
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,510
and lure him out.

629
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,260
If we can spot him by this plan,

630
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,750
I'm willing to do it.

631
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,910
But how can you be sure

632
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,660
this person will appear?

633
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:30,080
As long as his target is Master Xuanfeng,

634
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,490
he'll keep an eye on him in the dark

635
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,620
to look for a chance.

636
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,950
Young Lord, you asked me here.

637
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,440
Do you have anything urgent?

638
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,200
May I ask

639
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,980
you to help me

640
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,000
find the evil one behind this?

641
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,440
Please go ahead.

642
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,290
At the Martial Arts Gathering,

643
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,180
I hope you can put on a show with Hongfei.

644
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,930
I'm sure she's not the murderer.

645
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,660
If she did anything bad,

646
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,250
I'm willing to bear all the consequences.

647
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:58,980
At that time,

648
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,850
I'll let Hongfei pretend to attack you,

649
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,590
but she won't hurt you for real.

650
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,990
Of course she should do it for real.

651
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,990
If that person comes to test us

652
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,060
and he finds out it's fake,

653
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,590
our efforts will be in vain.

654
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,460
But...

655
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,420
You don't need to say more.

656
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,750
It's my duty

657
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,820
to remove the evils from the martial arts world.

658
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,640
Thank you, Master.

659
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,040
How dare you!

660
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:21,780
Arrest her!

661
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,390
Hongfei.

662
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,330
Don't hurt the innocent.

663
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:47,900
Zhao, that was a good plan.

664
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,900
But who on earth is the murderer?

665
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,680
And where is he?

666
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,060
Is he someone I know?

667
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,160
Say it.

668
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,810
It's Ling.

669
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,180
L-Ling?

670
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,350
H-How is that possible?

671
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,180
He doesn't even know the martial arts.

672
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,780
Impossible.

673
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,460
Impossible.

674
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,290
It is Ling.

675
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:22,180
He practiced the Art of Starshift.

676
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:38,900
Tell me.

677
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,770
What is it with the Art of Starshift?

678
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,610
What happened?

679
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,820
I bought it from an old bookstore by chance.

680
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:54,940
Father.

681
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:55,930
Say it!

682
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:57,510
Father.

683
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,490
Grandfather

684
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,980
once saved Elder Yueming from the Evil Sect.

685
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,980
Elder Yueming told my grandfather

686
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:10,090
about the hidden place of the Art of Starshift.

687
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,290
I learned it from my mother.

688
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,780
That evil woman.

689
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,820
Ling,

690
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,880
I always thought you were a modest child.

691
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,180
Tell me.

692
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:27,190
Why did you practice that kind of evil kung fu?

693
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,180
I just want Father to think highly of me.

694
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,940
Ling,

695
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,300
a life for a life.

696
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,420
I will hold a Martial Arts Gathering tomorrow.

697
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,010
You will tell everyone in person.
