[Episode 14]

4
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,220
I didn't know

5
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,340
Donghua was so adept at archery.

6
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,670
He could even kill two birds with one shot.

7
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:13,690
Young man.

8
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,840
You're here to hunt, aren't you?

9
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,420
Yes.

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,000
You made this?

11
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:19,500
Yes.

12
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,650
You have good archery skills.

13
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,110
Thank you for your praise.

14
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,340
Young man.

15
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,020
Are you a newbie?

16
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,170
Yes.

17
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm just a rookie.

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,940
I can tell.

19
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:33,090
Only newbies would hunt here.

20
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,780
The forest isn't deep, and people are constantly passing through.

21
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,490
You have no chance of hunting big game here.

22
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,460
I usually hunt there.

23
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,750
Exactly.

24
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,690
It's either a pheasant or a wild bird.

25
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,020
Nothing more than that.

26
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,520
What's over there?

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,730
The forest gets much deeper

28
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,660
over this hill.

29
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,880
There's a lot of wild animals there.

30
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,340
It's a great place to hunt.

31
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,380
But,

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,880
I think you are still inexperienced.

33
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,640
Just stay here and have fun.

34
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:00,180
No, no, no.

35
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,770
You are so good at hunting.

36
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,430
Please take me along with you so I can broaden my horizons.

37
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,380
Fine.

38
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,640
Let's go.

39
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:09,940
Sure.

40
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,030
Give me a second.

41
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,990
I shall leave a note for my brother.

42
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:34,420
I'm done.

43
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,050
You're done?

44
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:35,610
Let's go.

45
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,100
Come on.

46
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,280
Be careful.

47
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,630
Okay.

48
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:39,630
Let's go.

49
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,670
Keep up with me.

50
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,010
Be careful.

51
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,220
What kind of animals are there?

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,860
There are foxes,

53
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,760
boars,

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,770
and others.

55
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:57,060
Brother.

56
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,980
I'm back from fetching water.

57
00:03:58,980 --> 00:03:59,510
Brother!

58
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,820
Brother!

59
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,350
Brother!

60
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,390
Brother!

61
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,350
Brother!

[Donghua, I ran into an old hunter who said there's a good hunting ground]

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:23,500
[over this hill. I'll go with him first. Meet us asap.]

64
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,950
Young... Young Lord. Young Madam.

65
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,070
What's the rush?

66
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
When I...

67
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,260
went to fetch water just now,

68
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,020
my brother,

69
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:40,490
Li Chuyang,

70
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,700
disappeared into thin air.

71
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,680
He said he was going to hunt in the West Mountain.

72
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
But even though I searched the hill

73
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,980
for a very long time, I could find neither hide nor hair of him.

74
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,010
I knew it.

75
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,220
Hurry up and send someone to find him.

76
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,880
It'll be more challenging as it's getting dark.

77
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,900
How could it happen?

78
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,220
Young Lord.

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,980
I only have one little brother.

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,850
There's no need to find him.

81
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,490
The west side of Yunwu Mountain

82
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,850
is Zhou Wei's territory.

83
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:08,050
Just now, Chu Feng sent me an invitation

84
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,940
to attend Zhou Wei's birthday.

85
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,980
I don't think it's that simple.

86
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,340
I see.

87
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
You mean...

88
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,140
It seems that they have abducted Chuyang.

89
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,980
I must go there

90
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,060
to bring Chuyang back.

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,740
Also, to celebrate the Second Lord's birthday.

92
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,640
Zhou Wei, the wicked, is holding the banquet with ulterior motives.

93
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,340
I'll go with you.

94
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,940
You can't.

95
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,060
This trip is bound to be perilous.

96
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,409
Wait for me at Lingxiao Yard.

97
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:34,520
Don't go anywhere else.

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,970
I...

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,130
Don't worry.

100
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,830
I will bring Chuyang back.

101
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,670
Donghua.

102
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,700
Get the horse ready.

103
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,140
Yes.

104
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,350
Donghua!

105
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:58,820
Young Madam.

106
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,370
Young Lord has ordered you

107
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,370
not to go.

108
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,650
-Chuyue, you…
-Young Lord, please forgive me.

109
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,120
-An Jingzhao.
-I was forced.

110
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,990
Young Lord.

111
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,140
I did it on purpose.

112
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:14,950
Chuyue, you…

113
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:15,980
Young Lord,

114
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,390
with your sickly image,

115
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,980
you can't do it if I'm not around to cooperate with you.

116
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:19,660
Don't worry.

117
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,960
I'll only be of assistance to you,

118
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,520
and I won't be a burden.

119
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,580
Young Lord, listen to me.

120
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:35,330
Let's go.

121
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,500
[Black Eagle Hall]

122
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,710
Young Lord is here.

123
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,080
Young Lord.

124
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,030
Jingzhao.

125
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,010
Jingzhao.

126
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,870
Are you feeling better?

127
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,540
How did you take care of him?

128
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,390
He hasn't recovered for so long.

129
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,420
Zhi,

130
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,160
mind your manners.

131
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,810
Thank you, Young Lord.

132
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,350
You came to the banquet even when you hadn't recovered.

133
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,560
It's such an honour to have you here.

134
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:34,790
You're welcome, Second Lord.

135
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:36,260
By the way,

136
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,150
these are some gifts

137
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,970
I specially prepared for you

138
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,670
to celebrate your birthday.

139
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,580
I appreciate your generosity very much.

140
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,380
Servants!

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,290
Young Lord, you must be tired after the long journey.

142
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,970
Let me help you to your seat.

143
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,930
Second Lord.

144
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,370
I'll be jealous if you touch my man.

145
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:07,030
Young Madam, you're really good at joking.

146
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,350
Let's go.

147
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,660
Come on.

148
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,310
His pulse is so weak.

149
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,970
Was he really poisoned that severely?

150
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,270
Come on.

151
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,200
Take a seat.

152
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:33,580
Everyone,

153
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:38,669
today I'm holding a banquet in the name of my birthday.

154
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,409
In fact,

155
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,760
I want to find an excuse

156
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,860
to gather with you

157
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:48,360
and have fun by drinking together.

158
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:49,290
Here.

159
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,570
Let me propose a toast to you.

160
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,680
We wish you good luck and longevity.

161
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,440
Cheers.

162
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:04,650
Have a seat.

163
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,430
The flowers smell so good.

164
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,210
It seems that Old Zhou

165
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,810
is trying to portray the persona of someone

166
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,410
who knows how to enjoy life and appreciate art.

167
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:27,710
An Jingzhao.

168
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,600
That is Li Chuyang's bracelet.

169
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,290
Li Chuyang is here.

170
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,340
Donghua.

171
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:35,740
Yes.

172
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,530
Follow that servant who serves the soup.

173
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,440
You might find Chuyang by following him.

174
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,500
After you find him,

175
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,820
use the cuckoo's sound as a signal,

176
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,280
and we'll meet in the yard.

177
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,560
Alright.

178
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,470
Young Lord,

179
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,150
you're coughing again.

180
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,580
It's time to take your medicine.

181
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
I'll go get it now.

182
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,640
Go quickly.

183
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,520
Yes.

184
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,820
Please.

185
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,460
There's always music at a banquet.

186
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Today, the Second Lord has prepared a piece of dance music

187
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,940
to cheer you up.

188
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,650
We hope you all have a great time drinking and talking.

189
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,170
Come on. Let's have another drink.

190
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,100
Stop drinking.

191
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,700
Come on.

192
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,090
Sure.

193
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:29,720
Please.

194
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,850
Cheers.

195
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:05,700
What's wrong?

196
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,720
There was a hidden weapon.

197
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,740
The flowers and wine are both poisonous.

198
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,410
It's Muscle Relaxant Powder.

199
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,740
You'll get poisoned if you smell too much.

200
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,030
Not only did he put poison,

201
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,110
but he also arranged for the dance as a cover for his attempt.

202
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,560
Old Zhou is indeed experienced in workplace politics.

203
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,820
As things stand,

204
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,940
we can't defeat him

205
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,560
unless we become villains.

206
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,130
Let's go

207
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,140
and find Chuyang first.

208
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,670
We can't.

209
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,170
Only when we are here

210
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,700
can we buy time for Donghua.

211
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,130
But it's so dangerous here.

212
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,730
I don't want you to stay here.

213
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,620
We'll lose our chance to leave

214
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,820
if we don't leave now.

215
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,110
Although you are a big shot,

216
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,450
I'm a burden.

217
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,450
But even though I'm a nobody, I'm quick-witted.

218
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,290
I have an idea.

219
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,150
-What should we do?
-Stop dancing.

220
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,450
What kind of dance is this?

221
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,580
It's like practising swordsmanship.

222
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,460
Li Chuyue is a coward.

223
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,660
She was so scared that she couldn't even hold her glass.

224
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,700
And she spilt the wine all over Jingzhao.

225
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,360
Stop dancing. Get out of here.

226
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,980
Well...

227
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,200
No manners.

228
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,720
Go back to your seat.

229
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,630
I'll take Jingzhao to get changed.

230
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,220
Everybody is having fun now.

231
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
You can do it later.

232
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,000
Second Lord.

233
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,620
It's not decent to be like this.

234
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,360
Please allow me to get changed.

235
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,700
I'll be right back.

236
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,220
Let Chu Feng...

237
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,740
No need.

238
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,730
My wife will take care of me.

239
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,930
Chuyue, let's go.

240
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm on duty tonight. Let's talk tomorrow.

241
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,080
Okay.

242
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,270
He's young but so bad-tempered.

243
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:14,840
Yes.

244
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,720
No outsiders are allowed to enter this room.

245
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:13,240
Isn't Young Lord changing here?

246
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,720
I'm here to have a look.

247
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,930
You came to the wrong place.

248
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,910
I'll find somewhere else, then.

249
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,230
Brother.

250
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:30,590
Brother!

251
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:32,830
Brother!

252
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,110
Brother!

253
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,350
Brother.

254
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:39,980
Come on.

255
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:40,600
Hurry up.

256
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,980
Let me untie you.

257
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,610
Are you alright?

258
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,710
Have you been holding it in for a long time?

259
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,840
-Come on.
-I'm fine.

260
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,580
Be careful.

261
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,710
I coaxed the guards into putting on my bracelet.

262
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,880
I knew my sister would find out.

263
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,460
Look.

264
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,460
This is called siblings' wisdom.

265
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,520
In this operation,

266
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,300
not only are you two smart,

267
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,310
but I also deserve credit

268
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,310
for my IQ and EQ.

269
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,910
-You?
-You're welcome.

270
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,340
Let's go somewhere safe first.

271
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:05,870
Let's go.

272
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,000
Be careful.

273
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,100
Slowly.

274
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,960
Don't be afraid.

275
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,760
Brother, here's your backpack.

276
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:12,740
Let's go.

277
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,340
Hurry up.

278
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,270
Let's go.

279
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,820
It's getting dark.

280
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,230
When can we get out?

281
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,300
I wonder if Donghua has found Chuyang.

282
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,320
Chuyue.

283
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,950
Believe in Donghua.

284
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:32,580
Just wait.

285
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,010
This is not the time.

286
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,820
Dear, you just can't let me go.

287
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,070
You are so irresistible.

288
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,090
I'm totally into you.

289
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,290
What should we do now?

290
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,580
They are already here.

291
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,700
Just wait.

292
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
He found Chuyang.

293
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,820
Say something out loud.

294
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,350
Cover me so that I can go out and deal with them.

295
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,580
Stop it.

296
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,340
Everyone is waiting for us at the banquet.

297
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,500
We'll have plenty of time to cuddle in Lingxiao Yard.

298
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:37,480
Go. Hurry up.

299
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,140
Li Chuyang.

300
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,230
Li Chuyang.

301
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,090
How are you?

302
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,960
Are you hurt?

303
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,950
I'm fine.

304
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,250
You mussed up my hair.

305
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,220
Let's not talk about this now.

306
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,740
We should get out of here first.

307
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,540
Hurry up.

308
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:47,890
Go!

309
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,060
Let's go!

310
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,020
Be careful! Donghua!

311
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,110
Young Lord.

312
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,840
You go first.

313
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,300
Go!

314
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,780
Hurry up!

315
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,300
Brother-in-law!

316
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:12,940
Run!

317
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,270
-Hurry!
-Go after them!

318
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Brother-in-law.

319
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,640
What happened?

320
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,580
Why do you want to kill Jingzhao?

321
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:49,950
Oh no.

322
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,930
The assassins of the evil sect must have snuck in here.

323
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:53,930
I have to help him.

324
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,060
Silly girl.

325
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,960
Young Lord is highly skilled.

326
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,320
Don't worry about him.

327
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Why don't you take the opportunity to kill her

328
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,900
so you can be Young Madam?

329
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,160
Thank you for your guidance, Godfather.

330
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,500
Li Chuyue.

331
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,090
How dare you steal Jingzhao from me!

332
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,760
Go to hell!

333
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,190
Pretty lady,

334
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,030
as long as you let her go,

335
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,960
I'll do anything for you.

336
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm really smart.

337
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,020
I'm the one who taught my sister.

338
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,450
Step aside.

339
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,980
Bai Zhi.

340
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,040
Jingzhao, I...

341
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,560
Young Lord.

342
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,790
Get in the carriage.

343
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,750
Let's go.

344
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,540
Go!

345
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:57,430
Run!

346
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:58,720
Stop there!

347
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,800
Get in quickly.

348
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,500
That's true love.

349
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:15,700
Hurry up!

350
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,420
Never make, but always mar.

351
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,810
Master, what should we do now?

352
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,700
In for a penny, in for a pound.

353
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:50,700
Yes.

354
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,030
It's all my fault.

355
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,630
I was lured away by a villain

356
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,430
and almost got everyone killed.

357
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,770
I apologize.

358
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,130
You deserve to be punished.

359
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,640
But luckily,

360
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
everyone is safe.

361
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,980
It's full of danger in the martial arts world.

362
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,670
You're still young.

363
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:07,800
It's not your fault.

364
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,870
Brother-in-law,

365
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,410
your crafty escape plan was fantastic.

366
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,060
Yeah.

367
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,480
How did you do that?

368
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Zhou Wei allowed us

369
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,930
to get out of his territory so easily.

370
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,050
That means he still has a backup plan.

371
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,370
He has always been like this.

372
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,830
Do I need to think about it?

373
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,640
If you know both the enemy and yourself, you will never lose.

374
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,370
Young Lord.

375
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,410
Speaking of which,

376
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,230
When you said the wine at the banquet was poisonous,

377
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,430
I really freaked out.

378
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,870
Everyone knew the wine was poisonous.

379
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,200
How could I be poisoned?

380
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,640
You're indeed the most

381
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,970
courageous and intelligent in the villa.

382
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,450
No.

383
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,240
You're the number one in the universe.

384
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:50,110
Shouldn't I be rewarded?

385
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,420
I... I'm injured.

386
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,030
I... I'm going to bed first.

387
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,650
What are you doing?

388
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:57,580
Close your eyes.

389
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,220
One is not enough.

390
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,870
Are you hurt?

391
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:14,900
I'm fine.

392
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,780
Zhou Wei has made up his mind to kill you.

393
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,110
There's no way he's just going to let it go.

394
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:21,880
Chuyue,

395
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,060
there will be a thunderstorm tomorrow.

396
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,060
You go back first.

397
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,010
I'll be worried if you stay here.

398
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,210
If that's the case, you should go back with me.

399
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,850
I'm also worried about you being here alone.

400
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:30,510
Promise me.

401
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,140
No matter what,

402
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,130
go back with Chuyang first.

403
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,390
Wait till I get back.

404
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,180
What's wrong?

405
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,820
You don't believe me?

406
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,600
Your husband

407
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,930
is the most courageous and intelligent man in the universe.

408
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:44,620
Fine.

409
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:48,040
Don't hide anything from me if you have any plans.

410
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:48,780
I won't.

411
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,560
Get some rest.

412
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,660
I'm leaving now.

413
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,640
What are you doing?

414
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,860
When we were at the Black Eagle Hall,

415
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,980
you said you'd serve me well tonight.

416
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,840
It's just a matter of expedience.

417
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,440
You can't take it seriously.

418
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,750
Where did your dominance when you jumped on my carriage

419
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,390
go?

420
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,690
I'd like you to continue.

421
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,180
You... You can't do anything stupid.

422
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,040
I'll get angry.

423
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,580
I'll really be pissed off.

424
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,070
Don't... Don't come over.

425
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,520
I really...

426
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,980
I... I'm really going to get mad.

427
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,240
Don't do anything stupid.

428
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,400
Don't do anything stupid.

429
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:33,800
I...

430
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,430
An Jingzhao.

431
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:42,950
An Jingzhao.

432
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,150
An Jingzhao.

433
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,700
You tricked me again.

434
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:03,090
I'm staying here to protect you.

435
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,590
Zhou Wei knows you are my Achilles' heel.

436
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,770
What if he comes in the middle of the night

437
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:07,760
and abducts you?

438
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,670
I'm not going out there to save your life.

439
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,860
You know what?

440
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,860
You are not only brave and resourceful,

441
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,000
but you're also the most affectionate and righteous,

442
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,220
the gentlest

443
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,010
and cutest gentleman.

444
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,220
Chuyue.

445
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,020
Don't look at me and say those words.

446
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,920
I can't control myself now.

447
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,540
Rest assured.

448
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,890
We are not officially married yet.

449
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,670
I won't cross the line.

450
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,350
Have a good rest.

451
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,830
[Black Eagle Hall]

452
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,660
It's all my fault.

453
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,460
What a pity.

454
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,160
I missed such a good opportunity.

455
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,880
It's not easy to assault him again.

456
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:17,810
Pass my order.

457
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,690
An Jingzhao must die

458
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,260
by any means necessary.

459
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,610
Yes, Master.

460
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,280
If An Jingzhao fights back,

461
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,690
as An Chenghu is in our hands,

462
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,230
he won't dare to act rashly.

463
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,650
So, nothing can go wrong

464
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,280
with that old man now.

465
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,640
Let me tell you.

466
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,680
I couldn't believe Zhou Wei

467
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,580
dared to commit the murder of Young Lord

468
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:02,190
in broad daylight.

469
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,770
How dare he!

470
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,910
What happened today

471
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,750
made us put everything out in the open.

472
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,420
I'm afraid Zhou Wei will harm Father in the heat of the moment.

473
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,650
We must rescue your father as soon as possible.

474
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,640
Otherwise, at the critical moment,

475
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,800
Zhou Wei will use your father to threaten us.

476
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,860
Lord.

477
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:48,370
Lord.

478
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,670
Are you alright?

479
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,380
Actually,

480
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:08,970
you don't have to hide anything from me.

481
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,630
Just tell me straight.

482
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,920
I'll be frank then.

483
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,080
Okay.

484
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,120
The new medication prescribed by the physician

485
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,520
is effective

486
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,980
but has a side effect.

487
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,180
After taking this medicine,

488
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,180
you can't control your inner force in your sleep.

489
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,030
You may have nightmares

490
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,280
and hurt yourself.

491
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,200
And it will get worse

492
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,460
as the dosage increases.

493
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,360
Look.

494
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,370
So,

495
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,260
please forgive me.

496
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,140
What are you doing?

497
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,380
Get up and talk.

498
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,200
Get up.

499
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,310
I can only lock your hands and feet

500
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,660
in case you hurt yourself.

501
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,460
Okay.

502
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,840
Get up.

503
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,600
I'll listen to you.

504
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,860
Get up.

505
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,070
Thank you, Lord.

506
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,700
I beg your pardon.

507
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,540
Lord,

508
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,470
it's time for medicine.

509
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,490
Have a good rest.

510
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:17,910
Okay.

511
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,190
Who is it?

512
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,990
Is Lord dreaming again?

513
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,560
Donghua.

514
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,650
Young Madam.

515
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,520
How's your injury?

516
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,440
Thank you for your concern, Young Madam.

517
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,370
I'm all good now.

518
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,180
Where did you and An Jingzhao go this early morning?

519
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,840
Where is he?

520
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:05,490
Young Lord said he had to go out for some reason.

521
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,940
Tell me the truth.

522
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,100
No, Young Madam, you...

523
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,900
Where is An Jingzhao?

524
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,360
Tell me.

525
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:15,760
Young Madam, calm down.

526
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,260
It's true.

527
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,810
Young Master told me repeatedly

528
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:19,940
not to mention this.

529
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:21,790
Hold on.

530
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,010
Put down your sword first.

531
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:24,739
Young Lord asked me to remind Young Madam that

532
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:25,850
no matter what happens,

533
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:27,340
you must go home during the next thunderstorm.

534
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:27,800
Sister.

535
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,190
It's just infighting.

536
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,360
Don't make such a fuss.

537
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,010
Yes.

538
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:32,659
Put down the sword first.

539
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,389
Young Madam.

540
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,210
Take me to An Jingzhao.

541
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,679
Oh no.

542
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,469
Donghua.

543
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,139
My sister is serious.

544
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,650
If she gets hurt,

545
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,540
Brother-in-law must feel so sorry for her.

546
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,460
Stop resisting.

547
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,380
Take us there.

548
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:44,949
No.

549
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:45,770
I really can't go.

550
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,830
The back mountain is very dangerous.

551
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,320
The back mountain, right?

552
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,350
You useless thing.

553
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:59,320
Young Madam! Young Madam!

554
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:01,090
That won't do.

555
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,260
As things stand, it will be fraught with danger.

556
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,920
I have to do some preparation.

557
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:08,020
I need to take the meteorite along with me.

558
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,480
What if we have to run away?

559
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:21,910
Donghua.

560
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:22,620
Wait.

561
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:26,950
Young Lord.

562
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,790
Sister, hurry up.

563
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,400
Donghua.

564
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,190
Why did you bring them here?

565
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,220
I asked him to come.

566
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:33,720
We won't leave

567
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,560
without you.

568
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,870
An Jingzhao,

569
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,980
I am here under the Second Lord's orders to arrest you,

570
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,820
dead

571
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,800
or alive.

572
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,020
Li Qing,

573
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,420
you have been in the villa since you were young.

574
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,900
Lord taught you martial arts personally

575
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,360
and promoted you to Yuwei.

576
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,700
You've been my guard for more than ten years.

577
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,560
I treated you like my own brother.

578
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,990
How could you betray the Lord?

579
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,340
You can't defeat the Second Lord.

580
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,500
As the saying goes, a wise man submits to circumstances.

581
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,100
I'm sorry.

582
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,500
Take him down.

583
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,940
Young Lord, you go first.

584
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:05,210
Brother-in-law, run!

585
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:05,710
Go!

586
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:41,810
Brother-in-law.

587
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:43,010
What should we do?

588
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,620
You're injured.

589
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,890
I'm fine.

590
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,370
Brother-in-law!

591
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:02,600
Sister!

592
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,470
Young Lord!

593
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,320
Young Lord, wake up.

594
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,130
Sister.

595
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:36,480
What should we do?

596
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:37,910
Young Lord.

597
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,390
-Sister. Wake up.
-Young Lord.

598
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,510
Young Lord.

599
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,350
Sister.

600
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:43,840
Sister.

601
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,660
Young Lord.

602
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,220
Sister.

603
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,400
You're awake.

604
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,060
Young Lord.

605
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,530
Young Lord, you're...

606
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:52,940
Sister.

607
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,340
Am I still alive?

608
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,660
Of course.

609
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,620
It's all thanks to Brother-in-law.

610
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,900
When we jumped off the cliff,

611
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,790
he protected us very well.

612
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,490
So,

613
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,750
not only are we alive

614
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,080
but also safe and sound.

615
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,120
Are you okay?

616
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:08,430
I'm fine.

617
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,900
But Brother-in-law…

618
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,890
Young Lord.

619
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,910
-An Jingzhao.
-Young Lord.

620
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,190
An Jingzhao.

621
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,940
An Jingzhao.

622
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:22,530
Wake up, An Jingzhao.

623
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:24,390
Young Lord.

624
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,130
Chuyue.

625
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:29,130
I'm glad you're fine.

626
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,970
An Jingzhao, you promised to marry me.

627
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,060
You've got to be okay.

628
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:35,780
Chuyue.

629
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,830
Do... Do you like me?

630
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,180
I like you.

631
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,110
I've liked you for a long time.

632
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,230
You promised to marry me.

633
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,650
You can't go back on your word.

634
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,410
You must live well.

635
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,620
Please don't die.

636
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,480
Fine.

637
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,060
I promise you.

638
00:39:58,850 --> 00:39:59,310
Come on.

639
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,840
Get up slowly, Young Lord.

640
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,380
Young Lord.

641
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,420
Chuyue,

642
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,140
I will marry you.

643
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:13,980
You rascal!

644
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,500
You said you wanted me to marry you.

645
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,580
You said it several times.

646
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,020
Yes.

647
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,160
You said it.

648
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,340
I heard it too.

649
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,020
He was dying.

650
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,500
So I made up some nonsense for him.

651
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,580
Don't take it seriously.

652
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,130
Nonsense?

653
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:26,820
But you were so serious.

654
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,620
Young Lord, your arrow wound...

655
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,800
I see, it's Gold Silk Soft Armour.

656
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,880
What is Gold Silk Soft Armour?

657
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,300
Gold Silk Soft Armour is only found in Yunwei Villa,

658
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,500
with no second piece in the world.

659
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,760
It's made of gold silk.

660
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,100
It's soft like a cloth

661
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,930
but can be impervious to any pointed objects.

662
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,390
Sister.

663
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:50,790
Help Brother-in-law take it off quickly.

664
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,080
So I can have a thorough look at it.

665
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,480
His hands are fine.

666
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,710
Why should I help him?

667
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,940
Brother-in-law.

668
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,860
Why is your arm bleeding?

669
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:05,330
What should we do?

670
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,420
He's bleeding so much.

671
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:08,420
What should we do?

672
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,190
Sister.

673
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:12,730
Let me see.

674
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,390
Young Madam.

675
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,130
This is the medicine I just applied to Young Lord.

676
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,290
Donghua, let's go.

677
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:25,830
Let's go. Hurry up.

678
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,980
Go.

679
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:28,780
Don't worry.

680
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,180
It's just a minor injury.

681
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,850
It hurts.

682
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,520
You lied to me.

683
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,800
You always lie to me.

684
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,410
I'm sorry.

685
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,280
I scared you just now.

686
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,450
But what you said just now

687
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,270
wasn't a lie, right?

688
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,230
Is it true?

689
00:41:59,260 --> 00:41:59,640
No.

690
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,390
What's wrong with Young Madam?

691
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,330
Women are always fickle

692
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:05,600
and hard to understand.

693
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,730
Hard to understand?

694
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,910
It's none of your business.

695
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,030
Donghua.

696
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,230
It's getting cloudy.

697
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,240
Go tell them.

698
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,940
Young...

699
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,670
Young Lord, Young Madam,

700
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,430
Li Chuyang asked me to tell you

701
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,510
it's getting cloudy.

702
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,110
The thunderstorm is coming.

703
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,300
Does it hurt?

704
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,770
-Let's go somewhere safe.
-Donghua.

705
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,300
Let's go.

706
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:31,950
Let's go.

707
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:37,420
Let's go.
