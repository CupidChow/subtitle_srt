00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,260
Ling must have been careless,

00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,000
mistaking "left slash, right dragon" for "left dragon, right slash,"

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,060
which caused my meridians to reverse

10
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,900

Young Lord, how are you feeling now?

12
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,900

Who could be behind this?

00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,000
Young Lord.

193
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,680
Chuyue.

194
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,180
I...

195
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,220
I really had hallucinations.

196
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,350
You must believe me.

197
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,600
Please behave yourself.

198
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,780
Otherwise, I wouldn't have mistaken you for someone else.

199
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,830
Please behave yourself.

200
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,310
An Jingzhao.

201
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,990
He already has a girlfriend.

202
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,050
What are you doing?

203
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,300
Chuyue, as long as you trust me,

204
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,700
-I’ll do as you say in the future.
-Please behave yourself.

205
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,650
I am Chuyue.

206
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,540
Come at me.

207
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,130
How can you be Chuyue?

208
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,370
Chuyue's eyes

209
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,910
are bigger and rounder than yours.

210
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:25,900
Look at me.

211
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,350
Aren't they big and round enough?

212
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,750
You resemble her a bit.

213
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,740
Chuyue.

214
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,090
How is it?

215
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,680
Is this technique a perfect score of 120?

216
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,120
How do I copy that?

217
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:58,060
Of course, you can copy it,

218
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,280
but it's a bit challenging.

219
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,180
After all, our Young Lord

220
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,110
is a top-notch student. It's not easy to imitate him.

221
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,400
Well, An Jingzhao.

222
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,530
Didn't you recognize me just now?

223
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,390
Why do you suddenly recognize me?

224
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,700
Maybe the kiss just now woke me up.

225
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
Do you really have hallucinations?

226
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,530
Yes, I do.

227
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,710
I don't believe you.

228
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,180
Chuyue.

229
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:31,990
I still need your help.

230
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,680
Just now, I set up a bait,

231
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,640
saying I'd met the owner of the pharmacy.

232
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,280
The spy took the bait

233
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,080
and is following me now.

234
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,590
How can I assist you?

235
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,160
Earlier,

236
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,300
the spy became suspicious.

237
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:55,910
So, this time, it's not easy

238
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,370
to get him to take the bait.

239
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,130
I need you to display affection with me

240
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,510
to confuse them.

241
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,060
The culprit is very cunning.

242
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,360
He won't fall for it easily.

243
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,650
So, I have to act differently from usual.

244
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:16,300
Only when I seem more relaxed

245
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,700
and am talking sweetly to you

246
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,710
will he think

247
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,540
I'm about to take the next step

248
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,940
and take the bait.

249
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:24,950
An Jingzhao,

250
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,670
can't you pursue a girl in a different way?

251
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,610
The old methods are effective.

252
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,200
Aren't you also trying to find the spy

253
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,460
and help Taoyun?

254
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:37,250
Then let me make it clear.

255
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,260
I'm just doing you a favour.

256
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,080
Take a look.

257
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,620
Excuse me.

258
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,310
An Jingzhao.

259
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,910
There's really no one following us.

260
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,370
Don't lay your hands on me.

261
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,860
The person following us won't let you discover him.

262
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,790
He's watching us in a hidden place.

263
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,180
Take a look.

264
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,990
Just being seen together

265
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,420
is enough to create confusion.

266
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,360
Behave yourself.

267
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,890
I haven't forgiven you yet.

268
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,430
An Jingzhao.

269
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,620
-Stop pretending.
-Young Lord.

270
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,660
You might experience hallucinations.

271
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,770
But you're not weak.

272
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,770
Stop pretending.

273
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:21,820
Chuyue.

274
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,300
I really haven't fully recovered.

275
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,420
I just feel dizzy

276
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,580
and weak in my limbs.

277
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,220
Come on.

278
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,510
For the mission.

279
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,990
For our mission, okay?

280
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:39,170
Miss, please buy some pastries.

281
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,420
Chuyue, I'm hungry.

282
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,450
Buy it then.

283
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,820
I don't have any money. Buy it for me.

284
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,390
Let's go.

285
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,720
Someone is watching us.

286
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,590
These pastries are homemade.

287
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,700
An Jingzhao.

288
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,870
Wait. I feel dizzy.

289
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,040
Chuyue, I really accidentally kissed you

290
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,240
because I felt dizzy.

291
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,300
He did have hallucinations.

292
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,350
But why does it

293
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,110
seem like he's pretending?

294
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,270
Donghua. Come and support me.

295
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,980
Young Lord.

296
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,000
Lure that man away.

297
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
Understood.

298
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,410
Could it be that he's already healed from his injury,

299
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:33,810
and now he's deliberately teasing Chuyue?

300
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,700
Relax. Someone is watching.

301
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,500
He was indeed pretending.

302
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,570
Chuyue! Brother!

303
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,580
Are you both okay?

304
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,330
Just now, luckily, Brother reacted quickly

305
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,930
and avoided these lanterns.

306
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,150
An Jingzhao.

307
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,880
All that talk about being physically weak and feeling dizzy,

308
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,600
you were just pretending, right?

309
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,800
You didn't have hallucinations at all.

310
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,460
Chuyue, I really had hallucinations before.

311
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,750
It was a misunderstanding about Taoyun.

312
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,980
Don't be angry, okay?

313
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,000
Liar, I don't want to see you anymore.

314
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,740
Chuyue, I didn't lie to you. I...

315
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,340
Brother.

316
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,350
Chuyue is still upset.

317
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,550
I'll take care of her.

318
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,270
A bowl of tea, please.

319
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,290
You can refill it anytime.

320
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,460
This should be the place.

321
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,930
Mr. Ju.

322
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,110
Mr. Ju.

323
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,660
Mr. Ju Wutang.

324
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:54,090
Mr. Ju.

325
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,350
Mr. Ju Wutang.

326
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,750
Hello, I'm looking for Mr. Ju.

327
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
I'd like to consult with him about embroidery techniques.

328
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,420
Mr. Ju never meets strangers.

329
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,220
Please leave.

330
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,760
I really have an urgent matter to discuss with him.

331
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,420
Please, could you inform him?

332
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,700
Chuyue.

333
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:22,230
It seems that

334
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,290
Mr. Ju won't easily meet with us.

335
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,790
Let's find a place to rest.

336
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,390
Then let's figure out a plan.

337
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,140
He has the best embroidery skills.

338
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,560
I must find a way to see his skills.

339
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,900
Let's go and have a discussion.

340
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:47,780
Chuyue.

341
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,500
The inn I just found is right ahead.

342
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,230
You go first.

343
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,450
I'll go buy some food.

344
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Li Chuyue, stop thinking about him.

345
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,050
What he said about hallucinations is not credible.

346
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,750
Mr. Ju.

347
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,550
Who are you people?

348
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,590
Hand over your best embroidery,

349
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,220
and we'll spare your life.

350
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,700
How can I let people like you

351
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,620
defile my work? .

352
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,830
Give it to me.

353
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,000
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

354
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,510
Mr. Ju, are you okay?

355
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,410
Thank you for saving me.

356
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,570
Mr. Ju, do you know

357
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,990
who wants to harm you?

358
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,610
In this world,

359
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,670
many people want my embroidery.

360
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,500
Many have been refused by me.

361
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,410
As for who wants to harm me,

362
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,530
I don't know.

363
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,890
I have nothing here

364
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,810
except for embroidery.

365
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,960
If you like,

366
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,480
you can choose one at will.

367
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,450
In that case,

368
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,630
I have another matter

369
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,580
that I hope you can help me with.

370
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:33,370
This box was left to me by your grandfather,

371
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,120
and inside it, there's a map that can lead to the location of the Art of Starshift.

372
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,460
The Art of Starshift?

373
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,360
Wasn't it lost in the martial world long ago?

374
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,660
The Art of Starshift has always been

375
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,780
a divine technique of the Evil Sect.

376
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,360
Back then,

377
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,940
the first Evil Sect leader, Anyuan,

378
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:56,020
practiced it to the highest level in his pursuit

379
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:59,980
to become the strongest in the martial world.

380
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,600
However, he misused it,

381
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,620
leading to the deaths of many martial artists.

382
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,300
Elder Yueming under him

383
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,250
couldn't bear the harm the Art of Starshift brought to the martial world

384
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:16,000
and secretly hid the manual.

385
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,760
What happened after that?

386
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,530
Anyuan certainly didn't let him get away with it.

387
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,170
Of course.

388
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,830
Anyuan captured Yueming

389
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,220
and used cruel methods to force him to reveal the manual's location.

390
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,260
But Yueming didn't give in.

391
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,570
He knew the underground palace well.

392
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,250
So he soon found an opportunity to escape.

393
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,280
Anyuan sent people to hunt down Yueming.

394
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,280
By a stroke of luck,

395
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,510
Yueming was saved by my father.

396
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,750
From that point on, Yueming went into hiding.

397
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,140
He retained the pronunciation of his name but changed a character.

398
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,470
Since then, he has been living in our sect.

399
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,220
It wasn't until he disappeared

400
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,870
that he told my father the secret of the Art of Starshift

401
00:23:58,870 --> 00:23:59,990
and revealed

402
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,620
the location of the manual.

403
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,900
Where is it?

404
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,620
In the cave of the Evil Sect.

405
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,120
According to this map,

406
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,650
you can find where the manual is.

407
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,700
If you can learn the Art of Starshift,

408
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,690
you can quickly possess the supreme martial arts in the world.

409
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,300
After that, if you master the Profound Earth Sutra,

410
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,700
you can become the best martial artist in the world.

411
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,940
The position of the Lord

412
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,020
will be yours.

413
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,270
[Art of Starshift]

414
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,060
Hurry. There is an exit here.

415
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,530
Second Young Master, it's a trap.

416
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,590
They pretended to be the drug seller.

417
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,220
Since you could get close to An Jingzhao,

418
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:39,900
when I mentioned

419
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,460
An Jingzhao was going to meet the drug seller,

420
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,320
why didn't you think it was a trap?

421
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,120
What should we do now?

422
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,120
I'm afraid the drug seller had already exposed me.

423
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:50,820
I don't think they caught the drug seller.

424
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,520
Otherwise, why would they have devised this plan to bait you out?

425
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:00,930
Did you get caught this time?

426
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,840
Young Lord.

427
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,660
I didn’t do my job well.

428
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,620
I failed to catch the person who poisoned Lord Han.

429
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,730
I didn't expect him to be so skilled.

430
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,060
He used a hidden weapon.

431
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,820
It's not a fair and square trick.

432
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,950
Did you see his face?

433
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,240
He was wearing a mask.

434
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,700
It's hard to tell who he is.

435
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:31,520
Although he has been hiding it,

436
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,230
I can vaguely see

437
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:35,680
he was using Hanshui Sect’s martial arts.

438
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:36,860
By the way, Young Lord.

439
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,260
He has been marked with my tracking powder.

440
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,810
We didn't plan for nothing.

441
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:43,520
How is Lord Han?

442
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,760
He's fine now.

443
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,740
Okay.

444
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,330
Tell him

445
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,960
we will celebrate

446
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,360
in the courtyard of the inn tomorrow.

447
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,420
Tell him to ask everyone to be present.

448
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:54,770
Yes.

449
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,520
Anything else?

450
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,010
Young Lord.

451
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:03,700
The guards reported

452
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Young Madam and Second Young Master

453
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,510
found another inn to stay in.

454
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,840
You didn't get Young Madam back?

455
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,460
Also, send someone to the inn Chuyue lives

456
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,340
to spread the news

457
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,200
about our celebration tomorrow.

458
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,480
You must emphasize

459
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,840
that the prize this time

460
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,070
is the best embroidery from Mr. Ju.

461
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,140
I see. Place a long line to catch a big fish.

462
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,410
I’m leaving.

463
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,030
Second Young Master.

464
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,190
An Jingzhao appeared suddenly. We...

465
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,530
We didn't get the embroidery.

466
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,060
Useless!

467
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:47,890
Everyone,

468
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,840
we haven't found the person who poisoned me,

469
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,750
but I'm fine now.

470
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:55,770
And fortunately,

471
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,910
my sister Wanqing came back to me.

472
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,800
Besides, the Young Lord is here.

473
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,350
So today

474
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:05,090
we're having a celebration.

475
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,560
A pitching pot competition with pairwise matchups.

476
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
The winner can get one prize.

477
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,810
Everyone here can participate.

478
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,230
Donghua.

479
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,220
In the first round, men and women team up.

480
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,370
Two groups will compete against each other.

481
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,580
The team with the most hits

482
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,220
can get a first-class embroidery from Mr. Ju.

483
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,880
I want to join.

484
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,670
I’ll team up with him.

485
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,360
Young Lord.

486
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:50,140
Why don’t you team up with Wanqing?

487
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,620
Brother, I don't want to participate in this event.

488
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,010
It's okay, Miss Han.

489
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,010
You can team up with me.

490
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,220
I will explain it to Chuyue.

491
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,540
It's starting.

492
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,310
Great!

493
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,660
Great!

494
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,850
It's okay. Try again.

495
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:43,950
Amazing.

496
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:47,370
Great!

497
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:47,950
Great!

498
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,480
Eight to five.

499
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,430
Second Young Master and Miss Chuyue are ahead.

500
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,760
The Young Lord must be good at this.

501
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,090
Come on. Higher. Higher.

502
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,470
OK. One, two, three. Throw.

503
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,950
Being skilled in archery doesn't necessarily mean he can play pitching well.

504
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,030
If he wants to win,

505
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,330
all the remaining ones must hit accurately.

506
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,460
That's impossible.

507
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,600
He hit it.

508
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,230
Great!

509
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:42,440
Great!

510
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,150
Amazing!

511
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,160
Amazing!

512
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,270
Great!

513
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,910
The Young Lord and Miss Han win.

514
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,260
They win the prize,

515
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,160
which is Mr. Ju's best embroidery.

516
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,290
It's rare that it's so lively today.

517
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:09,320
Everyone can participate.

518
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:20,840
An Jingzhao,

519
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,790
did you do it on purpose?

520
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,470
Where did you get Master Ju's embroidery?

521
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:28,020
Donghua.

522
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:28,620
Yes.

523
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,900
It's a secret.

524
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,130
Give me a condition. I want that.

525
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,520
Before this event ends,

526
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,700
stay by my side.

527
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,540
Then I can give you this embroidery.

528
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:46,630
I can also help you find Mr. Ju to guide you.

529
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,040
That simple? You must keep your promise.

530
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,060
Of course.

531
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:54,510
Follow me.

532
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,620
Let's go.

533
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,170
You used too much strength.

534
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,220
Chuyue.

535
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,270
I must explain it to you.

536
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,400
I hallucinated because of the Profound Earth Sutra.

537
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,000
What is this?

538
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,330
The first sentence in the Profound Earth Sutra is,

539
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,930
"Those who cultivate the Profound Earth Sutra

540
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,090
must have a tranquil mind."

541
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:32,780
If one tries to cultivate it forcefully without sufficient internal strength,

542
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,720
even a slight misstep can lead to consequences.

543
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,380
The mild consequence may be hallucinations,

544
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:38,240
while the severe one can be death.

545
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,050
On that day, while I was practicing,

546
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,360
I accidentally transformed "Left Slash, Right Dragon"

547
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,180
into "Left Dragon, Right Slash,"

548
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,620
which caused my meridians to reverse

549
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,440
and led to hallucinations,

550
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,900
mistaking Taoyun for you.

551
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,230
So you really had hallucinations.

552
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,390
What martial arts manual is that?

553
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,930
It not only induced hallucinations

554
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,130
but also caused harm.

555
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,260
Stop practicing it.

556
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,670
Chuyue, Don't worry.

557
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm much better now.

558
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,110
A few more breaths of adjustment,

559
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,100
and I'll be fine.

560
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,200
Don't lie to me.

561
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,250
In the future, without my permission,

562
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,570
you are not allowed to get injured again

563
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,170
or to have any mishaps.

564
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,420
Are you forgiving me?

565
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:11,810
Don't worry.

566
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,380
I will be more careful in the future.

567
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,040
There won't be such a mistake.

568
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,580
Let's go back.

569
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,990
I have another gift for you.

570
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,220
Great!

571
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,970
Impressive.

572
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,500
Master Han,

573
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,840
have these two disciples of yours

574
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,300
participated in the game?

575
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,770
Ye Kong. Ye Ming.

576
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,860
You two go have a competition.

577
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,300
Yes.

578
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:06,810
Yes.

579
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,460
Bravo! Bravo!

580
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,050
Senior Ye Ming is amazing.

581
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,420
Senior Ye Ming wins!

582
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,179
Senior is awesome.

583
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,110
Great! Senior is awesome!

584
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:47,550
Wait.

585
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,380
Everyone,

586
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,370
I have something to say.

587
00:34:54,790 --> 00:34:58,340
A few days ago, Lord Han was poisoned by the Dissolving Bone Powder.

588
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,900
We found the place where the person who poisoned him

589
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,170
purchased the poison

590
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,450
and spread the news on purpose,

591
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,790
saying

592
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,750
that the seller has exposed

593
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,500
the mole of Hanshui Sect.

594
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:13,210
He took the bait and came to silence us.

595
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,030
I wanted to catch him on the spot.

596
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,940
Unfortunately, he ran away.

597
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,510
But he didn't know

598
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,430
that he had already been tainted

599
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,230
with the tracking powder that Donghua sprinkled.

600
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,610
Ye Ming.

601
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,860
Look around you.

602
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,140
Take him down!

603
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:58,790
Traitor!

604
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,170
I treated you well. Why did you do this to me?

605
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,990
You treated me well?

606
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,290
Do you still see me as your eldest disciple?

607
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You only pass the Hanshui Sect's Hanyin Palm to Ye Kong

608
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,950
and treat him as the new successor.

609
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,020
Ye Kong is smart.

610
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,730
You like him the most.

611
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm the only one who's been working hard every day.

612
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,650
But you never value me.

613
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,250
You only treat me

614
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:28,510
as a servant.

615
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,570
In terms of talent,

616
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:34,370
in terms of methods, where am I inferior to them?

617
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,600
Ye Kong can master the Hanyin Palm

618
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,250
because he has a strong internal force.

619
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,290
He can handle it.

620
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,920
Your internal force is weak.

621
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,190
I didn't tell you

622
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,150
because I didn't want you to be sad.

623
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,180
When your cultivation has deepened,

624
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,440
I will impart it to you.

625
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,910
How silly you are.

626
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,620
Let me ask you.

627
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,390
Is there a mastermind behind you?

628
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:00,250
Who is that?

629
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,060
The mastermind is...

630
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,050
Hongfei of the Evil Sect.

631
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,980
She mastered the Art of Starshift.

632
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,740
If I help her,

633
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,380
in the future,

634
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,230
she will help me become the sect leader.

635
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:18,990
Becoming the sect leader?

636
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,090
You bastard!

637
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,970
Lock him up in the wood room.

638
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,380
No one is allowed to visit him.

639
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:23,820
Yes.

640
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,600
Lord Han.

641
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,490
Since we have found the person who poisoned you,

642
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:34,330
I hope you can agree

643
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,550
to cancel my engagement with Miss Han.

644
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,040
Brother,

645
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,310
I don’t want to marry the Young Lord.

646
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,230
Just say yes.

647
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,210
Since you both said so,

648
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:53,310
I agree.

649
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,530
I’ll write a letter to the Lord

650
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,380
and tell him the situation.

651
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,370
Thank you, Lord Han.

652
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,580
So

653
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:08,130
you've been working hard for this.

654
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,260
I wronged you before.

655
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,420
I apologize.

656
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:15,940
I'm sorry.

657
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,940
I'll run away after I figure things out.

658
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:23,940
You won't have a chance to run away.

659
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,160
My Lord.

660
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,530
Someone in the martial world used the Art of Starshift.

661
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,060
That person tried to shift the blame onto you.

662
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,230
The Art of Starshift?

663
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:49,130
Chuyue, let me help you.

664
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,010
No need. I can do it by myself.

665
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,370
This...

666
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,060
Is it happening again?

667
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:55,030
I'm fine.

668
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,250
I just need some rest.

669
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,580
Are you feeling unwell?

670
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,340
-Young Lord, are you alright?
-Stop. Stop.

671
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:03,770
Stop.

672
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:05,740
He tends to mistake people when his hallucinations occur.

673
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,800
Stay away from him.

674
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,470
Will he recognize me as you?

675
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:09,850
Young Madam, are you too...

676
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,650
I don't want this to happen again.

677
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,850
I don't care who it is.

678
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,790
Are you feeling better?

679
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,810
Much better.

680
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,620
In that case, I better leave quickly,

681
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,620
so that Young Madam won't worry about you mistaking me for someone else.

682
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,500
I didn't expect

683
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,780
you to be even jealous of Donghua.

684
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,450
Look carefully, An Jingzhao.

685
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:34,770
I am Li Chuyue.

686
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,910
I won't allow you to mistake others for me.

687
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,380
I know, Honey.

688
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,560
This kind of thing

689
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,960
will never happen again.

690
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:26,410
Who are...

691
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,380
Who are you?

692
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,850
Don't you want me to help you

693
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
to be the leader of the Hanshui Sect?

694
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,640
Hongfei?

695
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,990
Who took the Art of Starshift?

696
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,180
I don't know.

697
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,070
I don't know.

698
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,200
Good.

699
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,380
You won't tell me?

700
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,800
Then, do you want to taste the feeling

701
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,660
of having your meridians broken?

702
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,660
I...

703
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,740
I'll tell you.

704
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,340
It's An...

705
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,180
Who are you?

706
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:11,980
Catch her!

707
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,260
Hongfei? Catch her!

708
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:33,750
Can you bunch of useless people catch me?

709
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,840
It’s Hongfei.

710
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,370
Why is she here?
