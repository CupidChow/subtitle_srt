but I have a girlfriend.

178
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,130
You want to ruin it with An Jingzhao, right?

179

Don't eat it.

180
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,810
There's lemon inside.

181
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,800
I need to use the bathroom.

182
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,950
There's lemon inside.

183

Here's the thing.

189
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,920
I had an appointment with a collector friend online

190
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,580
to see an antique vase at home.

191
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,340
But the vase was cheated away.

192
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,130
Well.

193
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,600
Chuyue's mother will be back soon.

194
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,820
If she finds that the vase is missing,

195
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,700
she will make a scene with me.

196
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:26,730
Can you go to the antique shop with me

197
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,250
and get the vase back?

198
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,260
Okay, I'll be right there.

199
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,370
Okay.

200
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,510
You guys eat first.

201
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,120
An Jingzhao.

202
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:37,820
I’m leaving.

203
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,640
Give me back my vase.

204
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:45,970
Uncle.

205
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:46,920
What are you talking about?

206
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,370
This is ours.

207
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,560
Yours?

208
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,870
You tricked me.

209
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:51,820
Well.

210
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,090
I'll call the police now.

211
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll arrest you.

212
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,300
This is my daughter's dowry.

213
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,350
You must return it to me.

214
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,020
You can't take it away.

215
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,790
Give it to me.

216
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,900
How dare you call the police?

217
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,490
I...

218
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,650
Uncle.

219
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,530
Are you okay?

220
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,530
I'm fine.

221
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,140
I'm fine.

222
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,010
Boss.

223
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,670
Boss.

224
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,290
Look at them.

225
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,830
Good boy.

226
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,880
Not bad.

227
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Let me fight with you.

228
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,420
Call for help!

229
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,600
Call for help!

230
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,230
Why is the sword of Shangyu here?

231
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:47,100
Has someone in our world been to this world?

232
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,510
Uncle, let's go.

233
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,250
Bastard!

234
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll kill you!

235
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,410
Are you okay, Boss?

236
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,820
Chuyue.

237
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,770
An antique fraudster

238
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,280
almost tricked away our family's heirloom vase today.

239
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,100
Thanks to An, I got it back.

240
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,020
I think An is a nice guy.

241
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,350
Be nice to him.

242
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,650
Li Chuyue.

243
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,680
You've found the right fabrics.

244
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,980
I will recommend you to take the second exam.

245
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:37,110
An Jingzhao.

246
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
I passed.

247
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,800
Ms. Qiao allowed me to take the second exam.

248
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,150
I'm one step closer to my dream as a designer.

249
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,320
Congratulations.

250
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,370
My dad told me.

251
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,180
Thank you.

252
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,170
Don't worry.

253
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,000
This time, I'll definitely help you go back.

254
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,410
I've touched Gu Qingfeng's ring.

255
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,590
Let's try again.

256
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,940
I've tried everything I could think of.

257
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,700
We can only try to recreate the same scene where we heard each other

258
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,570
the last time.

259
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,870
It's too late today.

260
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,130
Let's try it tomorrow.

261
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,190
Granny Yang's Dessert.

262
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,650
This is my favorite dessert shop.

263
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,780
It takes an hour to get there by car

264
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,960
and another hour to queue up.

265
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,440
Since I moved to the south of the city,

266
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,740
I have never had it.

267
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,810
Uncle's idea is really useful.

268
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,090
Do you want some?

269
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,010
I need to modify the design draft.

270
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,930
I'll get back to work.

271
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Why does it look weird?

272
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,030
What's wrong?

273
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,150
I've drawn so many drafts.

274
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,800
I used popular fabrics and stitches.

275
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,770
But they just feel awkward no matter how I look at them.

276
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,210
And I don't have my own style.

277
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,380
Why should I tell you this?

278
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:14,450
You don't know design.

279
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,950
Everything in the world is related.

280
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,830
I think the design and swordsmanship are connected.

281
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,270
You just said

282
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,610
you wanted to combine these pop elements.

283
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:26,980
In this way,

284
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,650
you can't highlight their characteristics.

285
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:31,980
They will lose their uniqueness.

286
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:33,770
Using swordsmanship as a comparison,

287
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,560
being extremely tough

288
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,790
and being as fast as possible

289
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,720
are both top-class martial arts concepts.

290
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,800
But if you combine them,

291
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,180
they will lose their characteristics.

292
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,310
So what you need to do now is to figure out

293
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,420
what you need.

294
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,970
Why do I keep thinking about this?

295
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,340
Li Chuyue.

296
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:22,530
Don't get the wrong idea.

297
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,530
But why is he so weird lately?

298
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,300
He helped me

299
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,980
and also picked on me.

300
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,460
So weird.

301
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,750
[Training Textbook for Car Driving]

302
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:03,920
Good night.

303
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,950
Why can't I get cute emojis?

304
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,310
What do you mean?

305
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,640
I want those you sent to Gu Qingfeng.

306
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:40,530
What's wrong with him?

307
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,710
Is he in a bad mood

308
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:46,570
because he can't go back soon?

309
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,980
Tomorrow is the company's new product launch.

310
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,720
These

311
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,020
are the hard work of the design department.

312
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,460
We need to check it carefully

313
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,380
before handing it over to colleagues at the new product press conference.

314
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,340
Don't make any mistakes.

315
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,860
Although there is a lot to be careful about,

316
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,350
I'll do my best.

317
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,930
Ms. Qiao is very strict.

318
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,840
I heard that you became Ms. Qiao's assistant

319
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,870
because you got Ms. Qiao's approval.

320
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,180
Not only your design is interesting,

321
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,790
but you've found the all fabric samples

322
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,570
on the material list Ms. Qiao gave you.

323
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,130
You are quite patient.

324
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,280
It's nothing.

325
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,180
A black dress seems to be missing.

326
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,770
I took the dress to get it altered.

327
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,800
I forgot to bring it back.

328
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:03,550
It's okay.

329
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,450
Go get it.

330
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,570
But there is so much work to do.

331
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,750
Can you do it alone?

332
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,350
Don't worry.

333
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,940
Leave it to me.

334
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,180
Thank you.

335
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,290
When will you get off work?

336
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,770
I'll pick you up.

337
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,510
Ten lamb skewers.

338
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:50,660
Hello?

339
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:53,220
Okay.

340
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,020
I'll be right there.

341
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,490
Chu...

342
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:17,540
You'll catch a cold if you sleep like this.

343
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,820
Why did I fall asleep?

344
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,350
I haven't finished organizing the clothes.

345
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,040
Since the clothes are organized, they can come and pick them up.

346
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:32,050
You must be hungry.

347
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,420
Let's go.

348
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:34,170
I'll treat you to dinner.

349
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,250
Thank you.

350
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:41,310
Let's go.

351
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,830
Thank you for today.

352
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,330
Wish us all the best.

353
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,530
By the way,

354
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,080
a client gave me a lot of seafood today.

355
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,520
I can't finish them all by myself.

356
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,960
How about

357
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:07,990
we dine together tomorrow?

358
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:09,770
Sure.

359
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,840
If you don't mind,

360
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,160
how about we dine at your house?

361
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:18,270
I'm curious

362
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,010
about what your house will be like,

363
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,490
since you're such a lovely girl.

364
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,630
I heard your parents also live in this city.

365
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,840
How about asking your family to join us?

366
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,640
The more people, the merrier.

367
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:33,330
What do you think?

368
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,460
No problem.

369
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:35,970
Cheers.

370
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:55,980
I was busy just now.

371
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,050
I didn't check my phone.

372
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,170
We might miss the time today.

373
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,010
I'll try to send you back tomorrow.

374
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,140
Where are you?

375
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,420
Do you know what happened just now?

376
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,750
My prince charming came to help me.

377
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,930
He even put a blanket on me when I was asleep.

378
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,850
My prince charming is so gentle.

379
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,190
How do I look?

380
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,560
Why are you dressed so formally?

381
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,830
What do you know?

382
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,160
I've asked Chuyue.

383
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,280
Gu Qingfeng

384
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,180
is outstanding in every aspect.

385
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,810
What if he becomes our son-in-law?

386
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,000
Besides,

387
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,460
this is his first time here.

388
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,490
I have to leave a good impression on him.

389
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,220
Right?

390
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,980
Dad, Mom, I'm back.

391
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:52,730
They're here.

392
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,510
You're here.

393
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,430
Hello, Uncle and Auntie.

394
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,580
Look at him.

395
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,970
Why did you bring anything here?

396
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,990
I'll put them here first.

397
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,910
Okay.

398
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,970
-Sit down.
-Come on.

399
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:04,500
Have a seat.

400
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,680
He looks quite energetic.

401
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,870
Auntie. You look so young.

402
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,720
Really?

403
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,050
You're so sweet.

404
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,260
You must be tired.

405
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,750
Are you hungry?

406
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,730
I'm fine.

407
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,700
Don't be polite.

408
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,780
Your uncle will cook for you later.

409
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:19,490
Thank you, Uncle.

410
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,050
Brother-in-law.

411
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,600
I think you've met a strong rival.

412
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:28,490
It's not okay.

413
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,160
We have to change our strategy.

414
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,350
Yang.

415
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,290
Why are you here?

416
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,470
The enemy outside is too strong.

417
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,590
I'm here to support An.

418
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,800
First, your gaze should be right.

419
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,950
Stop.

420
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,700
I was like this when I chased your mom.

421
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,370
Watch carefully.

422
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:08,990
Got it?

423
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,280
Let me show you again.

424
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,560
Come in.

425
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,290
My room is a bit messy.

426
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,760
Not at all.

427
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,490
It's so cozy.

428
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,090
Chuyue.

429
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,460
Can I take a look?

430
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,330
Of course.

431
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,420
I drew it casually.

432
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:48,420
I have nothing to say.

433
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,450
I can only smile when I see you.

434
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,330
Is Prince Charming flirting with me?

435
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,620
Why don't I feel anything?

436
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,820
Is it because I've been single for a long time

437
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,950
that I can't feel crushed?

438
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,850
Why did you come in?

439
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,670
Get out.

440
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,620
You...

441
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,620
What are you doing?

442
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,910
Nothing.

443
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,320
Then why did you come in?

444
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,720
You said you wanted to thank me.

445
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,760
I've figured out how you should thank me.

446
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,250
How?

447
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,290
Go to the supermarket.

448
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,220
Go with me.

449
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,900
Now.

450
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,620
Now?

451
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:37,980
Yes.

452
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,580
Now.

453
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,420
No way.

454
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,660
Can't you see I have a guest?

455
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,350
Get out.

456
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,770
Leave.

457
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:44,810
Leave.

458
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:45,810
Chuyue.

459
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,420
Can I try this on?

460
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,010
Sure.

461
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,730
Why does it fit so well?

462
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,940
Chuyue.

463
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,530
You designed it for me, right?

464
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,440
What's this strap for?

465
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,550
Is he really upset

466
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,010
because he can't go back soon?

467
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,460
Chuyue.

468
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,460
Help me with this.

469
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,400
Are you crazy, An Jingzhao?

470
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:19,980
Gu Qingfeng.

471
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,280
I heard about you from Chuyue.

472
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,250
You're her colleague.

473
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,860
You must be a designer too.

474
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,410
Can you help me with it?

475
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,380
The style and patterns are very unique.

476
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,330
Were you inspired

477
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,980
by the Yunwei Villa in your dream?

478
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,120
Yunwei Villa?

479
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,240
Did Chuyue mention Yunwei Villa to you?

480
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,530
Then you should know...

481
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,800
-Chuyue and I are...
-An Jingzhao.

482
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,660
Aren't you going to the supermarket?

483
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:51,330
I'll go with you.

484
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,090
Let's go.

485
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,730
Gu Qingfeng.

486
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,820
Wait for me.

487
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,770
I'll be right back.

488
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,730
Do you want to know?

489
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,090
I can tell you everything.

490
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,910
How about this?

491
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,880
Do we have it at home?

492
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,860
Let's buy it online.

493
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,550
Did you get bitten by a mosquito?

494
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:27,560
Yes.

495
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,900
Mosquitoes like to bite those who are unstable.

496
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,610
Mosquitoes love to bite fickle people.

497
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:35,530
You...

498
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,130
Welcome to try the oat milk.

499
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,380
Free taste of the new oat milk.

500
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,420
Handsome,

501
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,040
buy some milk for your girlfriend.

502
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,170
He isn't...

503
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,730
It's not only healthy and delicious but also good for beauty.

504
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,370
I want them all.

505
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,250
Okay.

506
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,690
You're so nice to your girlfriend.

507
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,420
Why did you buy so much milk?

508
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,770
To drink.

509
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,660
Why did you poke my mouth?

510
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,380
It hurt.

511
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:25,700
What did you say?

512
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:27,180
It hurt.

513
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,490
What are you doing?

514
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,140
An Jingzhao.

515
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,100
I wanted to give you a massage.

516
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,220
But you didn't let me get close.

517
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,530
You even wanted to take advantage of me.

518
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,140
Why is he so abnormal?

519
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,240
Is he sick?

520
00:29:59,030 --> 00:29:59,760
An Jingzhao.

521
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,370
I know we’ve tried many ways recently

522
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,720
but you didn't succeed in going back.

523
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,210
You must be upset.

524
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,340
But the action of you trying on clothes just now

525
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,790
was really strange.

526
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,620
Are you stimulated?

527
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,140
No.

528
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:12,140
I'm fine.

529
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,320
If you are sick,

530
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,670
let's go to the doctor.

531
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:15,820
I'm not sick.

532
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,370
Don't try to be tough.

533
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,690
Let's go see a doctor if you're sick.

534
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,980
I was just...

535
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,030
I was just doing something attractive.

536
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,320
Why did you do that?

537
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,250
If you keep laughing,

538
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,420
I can't guarantee what I'll do.

539
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,330
I'll stop laughing.

540
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:53,860
An Jingzhao.

541
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:56,500
Why do I keep saying you are unstable?

542
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,940
Because you've been nice to me sometimes recently,

543
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,670
but at other times, you've been picking on me.

544
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,840
Do you want to take revenge on me

545
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,310
because I kicked you out that day?

546
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,020
You think I wanted to take revenge on you?

547
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,700
It's because

548
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,900
I like you.

549
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,800
It's not April Fool's Day today.

550
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,420
Stop it.

551
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,520
When did I get bitten?

552
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,050
No need.

553
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,620
No need.

554
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:13,920
Don't move.

555
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,050
We're back.

556
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,490
Auntie. Let me help you.

557
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,300
Come on.

558
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:42,820
Chuyue, good timing.

559
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,570
The seafood is ready.

560
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:44,870
Look at you.

561
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:46,760
Qingfeng has been helping us.

562
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,010
Why don't you help?

563
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,420
-My pleasure.
-Get some rest.

564
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,110
Let her do it.

565
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:50,900
It's okay. Let me do it.

566
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:51,900
Let me help you.

567
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,060
The last dish is fried tofu.

568
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,220
Dad,

569
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:58,580
don't you think

570
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,290
the two of them have become a little subtle?

571
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,010
What do you mean?

572
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:06,190
Did my brother-in-law get rejected?

573
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,940
This is just my feeling.

574
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,610
Feeling.

575
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,940
All right, all the dishes are here.

576
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,810
Hurry up.

577
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:13,150
Chuyue.

578
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:13,540
Have a seat.

579
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:15,670
-Brother-in-law, here.
-Qingfeng, have a seat.

580
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:17,810
Thank you, Uncle.

581
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,620
Come on.

582
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,450
Come here.

583
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,000
Have a seat.

584
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,630
Brother-in-law, have a seat.

585
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:27,330
Gu.

586
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,490
I heard

587
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,810
you graduated from a foreign design school.

588
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,010
Aston Design College.

589
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,430
Right.

590
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,900
What about your parents?

591
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,180
They are also abroad.

592
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,460
My father works in an investment bank.

593
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,960
My mother runs a company.

594
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,360
That's great.

595
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:42,880
Are you single?

596
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,220
Again?

597
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:47,050
I'm single.

598
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,540
I'm unlucky. I haven't found that girl yet.

599
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,640
Single.

600
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,730
What kind of girl do you like?

601
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,180
I like gentle and kind girls.

602
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,290
What a coincidence.

603
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,260
Chuyue is very gentle and kind.

604
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:02,960
Isn't she?

605
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,750
My sister has nothing to do with being gentle.

606
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:08,940
She's a big fool.

607
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,179
Look if you don't believe me.

608
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,860
Li Chuyang, you've gone too far.

609
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:17,570
Actually, Chuyue

610
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:19,090
is very gentle.

611
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,420
Look.

612
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,010
Chuyue.

613
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,690
Go get the plate

614
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,050
I treasure.

615
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,659
Okay?

616
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,670
It's at the top of the cabinet.

617
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:32,030
Aren't the plates enough?

618
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:32,860
Why do you want to use that one?

619
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,480
I'm giving you a chance.

620
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,460
Go.

621
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,739
She's been too pretentious.

622
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,610
Is there anything more pretentious?

623
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,960
Gu.

624
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,340
Our cabinet is very high.

625
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,570
Chuyue has to step on a chair to get it.

626
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,190
Why don't you help her?

627
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:59,000
-I’m afraid she’ll fall.
-OK. I’ll help her.

628
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,010
Great.

629
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,680
Thank you.

630
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,300
Chuyue.

631
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:09,900
Let me do it.

632
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:10,740
No need.

633
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,280
I can get it.

634
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,270
Be careful.

635
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,330
Is it easy to find?

636
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:14,840
Sure.

637
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,210
Chuyue, be careful.

638
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,040
I need to take this call.

639
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,230
Hello?

640
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,420
Fortunately, the plate didn't break.

641
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,500
I hope my heart won't break.

642
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,340
Let's eat.

643
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,080
Let's eat first.

644
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,450
Gu Qingfeng.

645
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,690
I'm not feeling well.

646
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,650
I'm going back to my room.

647
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:03,780
Mom, Yang, Dad.

648
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,980
Help me serve the guest.

649
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,490
Well, Chuyue...

650
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,820
Gu.

651
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:10,550
It's okay.

652
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,720
She'll be out soon.

653
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:14,190
Auntie. Uncle.

654
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,770
Something came up at work.

655
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,530
I have to go.

656
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,050
You're leaving?

657
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,460
You...

658
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:22,680
Take care.

659
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:30,690
An.

660
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,750
-Sit down. Let’s eat.
-Sit, brother-in-law.

661
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,650
Come here.

662
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,280
Get some food for your brother-in-law.

663
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,260
Here.

664
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:57,490
Let's begin.

665
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,530
Xiaodu. Xiaodu.

666
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,250
Play a song.

667
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:03,930
Donghua.

668
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,260
Are you there?

669
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,150
Can you hear my voice?

670
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:16,050
There was nothing else special.

671
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,190
I was playing games

672
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,300
and singing that day.

673
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,860
Then we had a conversation.

674
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,230
You knew what happened since then.

675
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:25,490
Think carefully.

676
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,950
Did anything unusual happen

677
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,420
around the day we had the conversation?

678
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,480
The day before at the annual party,

679
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,450
I drew an ugly stone.

680
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,190
Where is it?

681
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,260
♫What strange temperament is it♫

682
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,460
♫And yet, I seem to care a lot♫

683
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,150
♫I care about you♫

684
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:51,880
Does it have anything to do with this ugly stone?

685
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:57,080
♫Just to meet again♫
