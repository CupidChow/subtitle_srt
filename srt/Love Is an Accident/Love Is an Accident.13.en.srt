[Episode 13]

4
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:42,660
Put me down.

5
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,270
Li Chuyang.

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
Who

7
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,259
broke into the forbidden Magic Flower Valley?

8
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,650
You're kids.

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:04,940
Tell me.

10
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,940
How'd you two get my door open?

11
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,490
We can't expose his color blindness.

12
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,820
If we provoke him, we'll suffer.

13
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,120
We just got lucky.

14
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,790
The trap that you, Valley Lord designed

15
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,720
is so ingenious.

16
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,690
Don't say useless things.

17
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,420
I know I'm smart.

18
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,840
Tell me.

19
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,380
Which sect are you from?

20
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,610
What are you doing here?

21
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,079
We're both from Handsome Sect.

22
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,980
We're from a faraway place.

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,880
My boyfriend is sick.

24
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,600
I'm looking for the Spirit Pearl Grass

25
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,540
so I came to ask you for some.

26
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,110
So you're here for the Spirit Pearl Grass.

27
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:49,850
Put them down.

28
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,100
Let one of them feed the flowers with their blood,

29
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,720
and chop the other into pieces and buries them in the soil.

30
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,760
Wait!

31
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,290
Although the belt doesn't match with his clothes,

32
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,490
it's obvious that he's put a lot of effort into it.

33
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,750
His hairstyle is weird

34
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,390
but also carefully styled.

35
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,970
It seems like the Valley Lord is a chic boy.

36
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,050
Go, go.

37
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,180
Valley Lord.

38
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,950
Valley Lord.

39
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:31,900
Actually,

40
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,130
we didn't come here for the Spirit Pearl Grass.

41
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,600
You have a great reputation.

42
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,450
We're here to see you in person.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,260
With your charm and style,

44
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,660
you'd definitely be considered

45
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,980
a superstar in our hometown.

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,820
If I tweak your

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,590
outfit just a little bit,

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
then you'll be the fairest

49
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,320
of all in the martial arts world.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,380
The top dog in the martial arts world.

51
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,910
I really admire you.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,530
You're so

53
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,740
edgy.

54
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,850
Edgy?

55
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,040
What's that?

56
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,270
Being edgy is even better than being a superstar.

57
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,410
I don't know

58
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,220
what a superstar is,

59
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,339
but

60
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,850
I kind of like you two.

61
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,140
What do you think?

62
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,770
Your sister is amazing, right?

63
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,630
How about this?

64
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,350
Just bury them.

65
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,460
Don't bleed them.

66
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,680
It's less dirty when you bury them too.

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,250
She looks unsightly.

68
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,770
Bury her first.

69
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,390
Go!

70
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,120
Chuyang.

71
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:43,030
There're ink stains on your hand.

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,159
Do you like reading?

73
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,050
Whatever.

74
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,310
I'll just give it a try.

75
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,390
Li Chuyang.

76
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,950
Valley Lord.

77
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,720
Actually,

78
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:54,950
I still have something to say to my sister.

79
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,480
Go ahead.

80
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,480
Sister.

81
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,390
Tang Sanzang and his four disciples embarked on a journey to the Western Heaven to retrieve the sacred scriptures.

82
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,170
They had to pass through the Fire Mountain.

83
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,700
The flames of Fire Mountain

84
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,970
were no ordinary fire.

85
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,530
Only the Banana Leaf Fan could extinguish them,

86
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,000
right?

87
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,020
Hurry.

88
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,770
The Banana Leaf Fan was in

89
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,590
the Bull Demon King and Princess Iron Fan's hands.

90
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,270
In the end, it was acquired by Sun Wukong,

91
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:17,990
right?

92
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,860
Yes.

93
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:19,760
But

94
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,330
how did he get it?

95
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,550
Chuyang, come on.

96
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,170
Let's talk on the way to hell.

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:29,640
Wait.

98
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:34,820
Move.

99
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,640
How did Sun Wukong get the Banana Leaf Fan?

100
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,790
Valley Lord.

101
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,080
If you want to hear the story,

102
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,000
we can tell you.

103
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,920
But you have to promise us,

104
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,870
after listening to the story,

105
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,330
you won't attack us again.

106
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,220
Why are you so slow?

107
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,190
I promise you.

108
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,909
Tell me.

109
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,470
How did Sun Wukong get the Banana Leaf Fan?

110
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,050
Zhao.

111
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,270
You are finally awake.

112
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,540
How is it?

113
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,300
How do you feel?

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,250
Where's Chuyue?

115
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,230
I haven't seen her for a day.

116
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,630
Is there anyone outside?

117
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,990
Madam.

118
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,820
Young Lord.

119
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,170
Young Madam is missing.

120
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,370
Mr. Li is missing too.

121
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,460
Were there any thunderstorms when I was asleep?

122
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,010
No.

123
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,260
Grandmother.

124
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,350
When was the last time you saw her?

125
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,220
I haven't seen her since

126
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,390
Donghua returned from the Magic Flower Valley.

127
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,450
Did she go to the Magic Flower Valley?

128
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,520
Zhao, you can't go.

129
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,780
Zhao.

130
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,260
Grandmother.

131
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,060
She is my wife.

132
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,290
I won't allow anything to happen to her.

133
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:51,800
Zhao.

134
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,640
Zhao.

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,070
Fourth Prince passed away.

136
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,020
Huanhuan slowly ascended the white jade steps, step by step.

137
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,430
Valley Lord.

138
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,870
I have many more stories.

139
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,490
Do you want to listen to them?

140
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,660
As long as you give me a blade of the Spirit Pearl Grass...

141
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,990
Stop thinking about it.

142
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:18,920
Spirit Pearl Grass is my treasure.

143
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,230
I won't give it to you.

144
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,240
What other stories are there?

145
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,240
Tell me one more.

146
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,480
Well...

147
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,050
The Substitute Wife of the Domineering CEO.

148
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,870
Domineering CEO?

149
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:48,030
What's that?

150
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,250
A domineering CEO is

151
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,630
a handsome, rich and overbearing man.

152
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,010
I'm in your story!

153
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,980
Come on, tell me.

154
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,620
This story is about

155
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,430
a bossy CEO and a normal girl who entered a contractual marriage.

156
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,150
The CEO ended up falling in love with the girl

157
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,040
and doted on her every day.

158
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,220
So sweet.

159
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,570
Valley Lord.

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,470
Isn’t this a comedy?

161
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,720
Why are you crying?

162
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,120
It's sweet.

163
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,910
So he looks like a wild man on the outside

164
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,850
but he’s actually a sweetheart?

165
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,770
Valley Lord.

166
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,169
I have many stories.

167
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,820
Do you want to listen to them?

168
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:38,820
Sure.

169
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,400
Hurry up.

170
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,130
One more.

171
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,280
Valley Lord.

172
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,740
My stories are quite valuable.

173
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,320
If you want to hear them,

174
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,780
give me a blade of Spirit Pearl Grass.

175
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,070
I promise I'll tell you.

176
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,260
They're so sweet that they'd kill you.

177
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,300
Stop dawdling.

178
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:51,640
I...

179
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,580
I can't give it to you.

180
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,790
That's my treasure.

181
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,110
We've told you so many stories.

182
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,150
It's time to go home.

183
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,290
Let's go.

184
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:02,710
Miss.

185
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:04,450
Just one.

186
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,450
Just one blade, okay?

187
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,060
Hurry up.

188
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,750
Hurry up.

189
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,960
In the past,

190
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,680
there was a mountain.

191
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,160
On the mountain, there was a temple.

192
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,880
In the temple, an old monk

193
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,110
was telling stories to the little monk.

194
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,460
Valley Lord.

195
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,430
Can you give me the Spirit Pearl Grass now?

196
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,080
Valley Lord.

197
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,580
Bad news.

198
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,550
Our stone gate

199
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,740
has been destroyed.

200
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,300
Chuyue.

201
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,440
Brother-in-law.

202
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,600
An Jingzhao?

203
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,270
Why are you here?

204
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,320
You're fine?

205
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,610
With you around,

206
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,870
how could I not be fine?

207
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,810
If you dare lay a finger on them,

208
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,340
you will be buried today.

209
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,700
Oh no.

210
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,410
They're going to fight.

211
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,250
This is the most classic part

212
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,990
of domineering CEO stories, right?

213
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,460
So sweet.

214
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,850
So touching.

215
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,890
Get me a blade of Spirit Pearl Grass.

216
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:27,180
Yes.

217
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:27,780
Hurry up.

218
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:32,740
Okay.

219
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,060
Good.

220
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:40,820
Okay.

221
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,610
[Yunwei Villa]

222
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,810
Is it bitter?

223
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:54,450
Lie down.

224
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,640
Come on.

225
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,360
Young Lord.

226
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,820
Let’s talk over there.

227
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,760
Young Lord.

228
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,480
Zhou Wei poisoned your tea

229
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,420
which led to your change in temperament

230
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,600
and deliberately an invitation to war

231
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,170
to induce a battle with the Zhuyin Pavilion.

232
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,430
What is he trying to do?

233
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,680
That day, Zhou Wei

234
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,630
planted his men in Zhuyin Pavilion

235
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,910
to steal Zhu Maoqing's book of martial arts secrets.

236
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,420
Steal the book of martial arts secrets?

237
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,300
He wanted to frame you for stealing the book

238
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,700
to ruin your reputation.

239
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,460
Then he'll be able to get the position of the Lord.

240
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,460
He’s up to no good.

241
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,600
Young Lord,

242
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,420
we can’t sit here and do nothing.

243
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,750
We must expose his plot.

244
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,410
Don't worry.

245
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,370
I have my own plan.

246
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,490
We must continue playing along.

247
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,460
Not only that,

248
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,650
but we have to make sure Zhou Wei is convinced.

249
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,270
Play along?

250
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,590
Tomorrow night,

251
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,650
Father must take the last dose of medicine.

252
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,320
Now I'm poisoned.

253
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,520
This is the best cover.

254
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,460
Even if you barge in,

255
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,250
Zhou Wei will think it’s caused by the poison.

256
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,410
He won't suspect anything else.

257
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,410
Brother-in-law.

258
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
Brother-in-law.

259
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,050
Brother-in-law.

260
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,180
You've finally recovered.

261
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,380
Are you still pretending to be sick?

262
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,440
Don't talk nonsense.

263
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,100
Don't tell anyone about this.

264
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,570
Especially your sister.

265
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,300
Understand?

266
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,910
I understand.

267
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,640
Don't worry.

268
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,910
Brother-in-law,

269
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,040
I wanted to tell you,

270
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,980
to repay you for saving my life,

271
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,340
I can share some classic lines and scenarios related to

272
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,380
sick and delicate characters with you.

273
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:01,840
No need.

274
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,340
I know them.

275
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,620
I’m going to put on a show now.

276
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,300
Yes, Young Lord.

277
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,960
I have valuable information.

278
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:18,910
Li Chuyang.

279
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,020
Dried goods.

280
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,590
You don’t even want to give Young Lord

281
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,680
fresh goods.

282
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,470
He treated you so well in vain.

283
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,890
I don't want to explain to you.

284
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,290
You...

285
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,670
An Jingzhao.

286
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,480
Why are you up?

287
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,460
Are you okay?

288
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,760
Is the poison gone?

289
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,720
I wasn't poisoned in the first place.

290
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,100
Why are you still like this?

291
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:04,790
Donghua!

292
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,880
Donghua, are you there?

293
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,210
Young Madam!

294
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,630
What's wrong, Young Madam?

295
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,130
Young Madam.

296
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,860
Is the Spirit Pearl Grass useless?

297
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,150
Why is he still like this?

298
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,410
Is the poison not gone?

299
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,820
Young Madam,

300
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,680
the toxin in Young Lord’s body is gone.

301
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,670
But it’ll take some time to fully recover.

302
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,770
So now,

303
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,930
his temperament will still be as such.

304
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,400
You were sleeping on the floor just now.

305
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,730
I carried you to the bed.

306
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,530
Why are you still like this?

307
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,800
What’s wrong?

308
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,080
Young Lord.

309
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,390
The Lord is resting.

310
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,660
I’ll only say it once.

311
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,450
Step aside.

312
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:13,790
I can't do that.

313
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,620
You may leave.

314
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,600
Yes.

315
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,040
Father.

316
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,120
Zhao.

317
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,200
Take the medicine.

318
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,900
Made a scene in the Magic Flower Valley.

319
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,730
It is said that the Spirit Pearl Grass in the Magic Flower Valley

320
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,460
is very effective for healing.

321
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,060
Everyone is fighting for it.

322
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,180
Has An Jingzhao's poisoning

323
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,800
has been cured?

324
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,980
And he's just been pretending?

325
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,460
Master.

326
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,180
This poison was specially developed by the Poison King of the West.

327
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,860
He said there is no cure for this poison.

328
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,020
How can a mere Spirit Pearl Grass

329
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,750
cure the Poison King's poison?

330
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,690
Then get people from Lingxiao Yard

331
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,820
to keep an eye on him.

332
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,720
Report to me immediately if there is any breach.

333
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:51,290
Yes.

334
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,230
Donghua.

335
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,770
After you finish your lines,

336
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,490
brother-in-law will take it out on you.

337
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,650
You have to fall down

338
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
and pretend to be in great pain.

339
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:04,460
Do you understand?

340
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,770
Of course I know.

341
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,330
I don't need you to teach me.

342
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,460
Go.

343
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,980
I’ll feed you in the future.

344
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:16,230
Young Lord.

345
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,010
Young Madam.

346
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,550
The leader of Lingjian Sect

347
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,900
invites you to participate in the annual martial arts competition.

348
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,700
I'm not going.

349
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,180
I can't leave my wife for even a day.

350
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,540
Hurry up.

351
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,660
Young Lord,

352
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
you must go.

353
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,030
You must go!

354
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,460
An Jingzhao!

355
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,700
My heart. I think it stopped.

356
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,130
Are you okay?

357
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:54,860
Donghua!

358
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,740
An Jingzhao, are you crazy?

359
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,060
How could you do this to Donghua?

360
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,540
Donghua, what's wrong?

361
00:18:59,260 --> 00:18:59,790
Donghua.

362
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,490
How can you find a wife

363
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,760
after sustaining such a serious injury?

364
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,600
Young Lord.

365
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,670
Young Madam.

366
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,040
I'll take my leave.

367
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,130
Donghua.

368
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,710
Let's go.

369
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,300
I love it when you get mad at me.

370
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,670
Why does this line and demeanor

371
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,420
smack of early sick and delicate character archetypes?

372
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:20,920
Do you know

373
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,660
how fake your acting was?

374
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:23,660
'Fake'?

375
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,480
Does it mean I did a good job?

376
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,900
Yes.

377
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,290
Very good.

378
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:31,430
Amazing.

379
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,270
An Jingzhao,

380
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,260
if you lose your temper again,

381
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,860
I'm going to leave you alone.

382
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,500
Come on.

383
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,980
Sit down.

384
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:54,200
What are you looking at?

385
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,950
If you dare

386
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,510
stare at Young Madam again,

387
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,730
you might lose your sight.

388
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,510
Yes, Young Lord.

389
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,020
[Yun]

390
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,120
Young Lord.

391
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,410
Young Madam

392
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,180
will come over to deliver the medicine to you later.

393
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:23,660
Also,

394
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,170
after she's done,

395
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,460
she's going to talk to Second Young Lord.

396
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,040
I've made arrangements for Zhou Wei's spy too.

397
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,810
I'll bring your tonic later.

398
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,310
Do you have anything else to say?

399
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,970
Young Lord,

400
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,240
do you need this rose

401
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,890
for acting?

402
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:53,980
Yes.

403
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,780
Do you need my cooperation?

404
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,020
Just stay outside.

405
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,700
I'll call you if I need anything.

406
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,050
Yes.

407
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,570
Can you drink it yourself?

408
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,460
Here.

409
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,020
Later,

410
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,460
after you take the medicine,

411
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,720
I'll go out for a while.

412
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,990
Where are you going?

413
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,420
I'm just walking around.

414
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:38,780
Here.

415
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,190
For how long?

416
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,980
Not long.

417
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,390
Jingling said he had something for me.

418
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,720
Here.

419
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,410
Chuyue.

420
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,920
I think I'm in a bad condition.

421
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:57,770
If you leave,

422
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,760
it's very possible

423
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,220
that I might die.

424
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,730
Why do I feel like

425
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,210
he's acting?

426
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,540
Come on.

427
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,500
One more sip.

428
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,820
Don't think too much.

429
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,130
You'll get better after taking the medicine.

430
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,790
I'm just going out for a while.

431
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:46,010
Chuyue.

432
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,030
You are mine.

433
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,900
From head to toe

434
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,810
to every strand of hair.

435
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,750
I won't allow you to go out with another man.

436
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,300
Jingzhao.

437
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,110
Miss Bai Zhi.

438
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,190
It's really inconvenient.

439
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,180
Jingzhao, are you there?

440
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,810
- Miss Bai Zhi.
- I made some medicine.

441
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,500
Although it can't cure the poison in your body,

442
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,900
it can relieve your pain.

443
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:10,830
Miss Bai Zhi.

444
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:11,640
Miss Bai Zhi.

445
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,510
It's really inconvenient.

446
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,970
Young Lord has gone to bed.

447
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:14,980
Step aside.

448
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,350
Li Chuyue!

449
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,920
Why are you hugging Jingzhao like that?

450
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,640
Get up.

451
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,310
Bai Zhi!

452
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,750
Are you okay?

453
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,610
Don't think I don't know

454
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:31,470
what you did at Lingxiu Mountain.

455
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,490
Young Lord,

456
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,680
I brought you some tonics.

457
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,980
Jingzhao.

458
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,160
- I didn't...
- I’m warning you one last time.

459
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,830
If you do anything to Chuyue again,

460
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,320
don't blame me for being rude.

461
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,350
An Jingzhao.

462
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,500
Are you okay?

463
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,240
Jingzhao.

464
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,060
I’m fine.

465
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:12,890
Young Lord!

466
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,140
Don’t do this.

467
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,320
The doctor said

468
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,480
if you continue to use your power,

469
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,610
you will die.

470
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,420
Don't listen to him.

471
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,490
I won't.

472
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,440
Are you really okay?

473
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,570
Do you need a doctor?

474
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:27,740
No need.

475
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,800
Give me the medicine.

476
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,610
You may leave.

477
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,520
How about I make you some soup?

478
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,380
Okay.

479
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:34,940
Okay.

480
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,050
Chuyue.

481
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,270
Don't worry.

482
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,580
I'm fine.

483
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,660
What's wrong?

484
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,710
Nothing.

485
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,530
Is red bean barley porridge okay?

486
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,560
She's gone.

487
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,220
Young Lord.

488
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:11,720
Young Lord.

489
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,220
Was my acting very 'fake'?

490
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,070
Yes.

491
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,610
How was my acting?

492
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,460
'Fake'.

493
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,050
Master,

494
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,720
according to the spy and Miss Bai Zhi,

495
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,980
An Jingzhao is indeed seriously poisoned.

496
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:34,890
He broke into the Lord’s room last night

497
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:35,960
and made a scene.

498
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,300
Good.

499
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,380
In this case,

500
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:42,810
An Jingzhao has gone crazy.

501
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,600
The more trouble he makes, the better.

502
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,230
It goes with our plan.

503
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:51,950
Get ready.

504
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes.

505
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,010
Young Madam.

506
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,810
Young Madam.

507
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,200
You told me to remind you

508
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,360
to go to see Second Young Master today.

509
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:15,790
I remember now.

510
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,300
Jingling helped me find Doctor Luo.

511
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,900
I'll repay him first.

512
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,980
It's okay.

513
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,770
Jingling.

514
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,140
Jingling.

515
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,280
Chuyue.

516
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,140
Chuyue, why are you here?

517
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,100
How is Jingzhao?

518
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,070
He's much better physically,

519
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,640
but he's still behaving weirdly.

520
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,480
I don't know.

521
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,530
Let's not talk about this.

522
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,320
I have a gift for you today.

523
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,590
A gift?

524
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,350
Turn around.

525
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,470
Okay.

526
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,020
Come on.

527
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,120
Turn right.

528
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,250
Walk forward.

529
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,880
Go down the steps.

530
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:14,980
Turn left.

531
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,360
Lift your feet.

532
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,200
Go forward.

533
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,350
Stop.

534
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:25,970
Turn right.

535
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,250
You can take it off now.

536
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,800
Today is your mother's birthday, right?

537
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,030
I'll make her one of

538
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,780
our birthday cakes,

539
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,360
okay?

540
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,260
Okay.

541
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,500
How is it?

542
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,220
I can't believe

543
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,370
there are pastries that look like art.

544
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
You're amazing, Chuyue.

545
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,640
You can do everything.

546
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,260
Jingzhao is the same.

547
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,450
I'm the only useless one.

548
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,020
I don't know martial arts

549
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,360
nor can I help my Jingzhao.

550
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,950
Oh my god.

551
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,460
Are all top students so modest?

552
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,890
You're so good at sculpting

553
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,900
and your painting is amazing.

554
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,260
How's that useless?

555
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:45,840
These are insignificant.

556
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,700
First of all,

557
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,090
no skill is better than another.

558
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:51,900
Have you heard of the saying,

559
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,750
there are 360 trades; in every trade, there will be masters.

560
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,350
Secondly,

561
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,620
if you're so good at sculpting and painting,

562
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,880
it means you're smart.

563
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,530
Although I don't know the details,

564
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,540
I can sense that

565
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,210
you’re not the Lord's favorite.

566
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,940
Grandmother doesn’t like you that much either.

567
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,960
They dote on An Jingzhao.

568
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,530
But it doesn't mean that you're not impressive enough

569
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:19,590
or not good enough.

570
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,390
Don't judge yourself based on others' opinions.

571
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,530
In this world,

572
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,700
there's only one you.

573
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,690
Come on.

574
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,660
Don't cry.

575
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,210
I can't bear to see a handsome boy cry.

576
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,410
Don't cry.

577
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,180
Don't cry.

578
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,800
I told you.

579
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,420
You can't keep your eyes

580
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,740
on any man but me,

581
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,060
right?

582
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,090
What are you doing?

583
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:01,730
An Jingzhao.

584
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:02,930
It’s broad daylight.

585
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:04,610
Ling,

586
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,430
after you get married,

587
00:30:07,150 --> 00:30:08,750
you'll understand this joy.

588
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,500
Put me down.

589
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,800
Hurry up.

590
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,780
I heard you drank?

591
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:25,690
Are you okay?

592
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,390
Are you caring about me?

593
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,050
I need to look for fabric.

594
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,780
When I looked for it yesterday,

595
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,220
I didn't ask about the fabric...

596
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,980
I'll go with you.

597
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:03,790
Mother,

598
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,500
are you very happy today?

599
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,160
Of course.

600
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,460
Yesterday was the death anniversary of that woman.

601
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,260
Today is my birthday.

602
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,980
Of course I'm happy.

603
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,450
Mother.

604
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,070
Why bring up the past?

605
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,230
Why not?

606
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:28,290
When An Chenghu married me,

607
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,300
he swore to me.

608
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,360
He said he would be good to me forever.

609
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,260
But

610
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,080
since I entered the villa,

611
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,250
he has neglected me.

612
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,060
He only cares about his first wife.

613
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,710
That's why I made that soup

614
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,140
to send her on her way.

615
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,630
Since she didn't let me live a good life,

616
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:52,690
she shouldn't expect to live either.

617
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,690
Mother.

618
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,850
Let's not talk about this.

619
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,310
Today is your birthday.

620
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,830
Look what I brought you.

621
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,960
A friend of mine made this.

622
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,030
Where they're from,

623
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,830
they eat this on their birthday.

624
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,920
It was made by the Young Madam of An Jingzhao?

625
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,930
How would Mother know?

626
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,370
I'm just grounded.

627
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,650
I'm not blind.

628
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,090
Ling,

629
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,270
do you like her?

630
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,220
Of course not.

631
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:34,410
Ling,

632
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:35,980
since young,

633
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,440
everything in this villa

634
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,860
belonged to An Jingzhao.

635
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:43,420
Why can't you have what he has?

636
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,220
From now on,

637
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,800
you must fight for

638
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,780
things that you like.

639
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,760
Ling,

640
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,770
I have something.

641
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,550
It can help you get what you want

642
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,380
and help you become the Lord.

643
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,300
Mother.

644
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:23,190
What nonsense are you talking about?

645
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:24,820
I won’t be the Lord.

646
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,590
I have something to do.

647
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:27,250
I have to go.

648
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,150
Ling.

649
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,750
I still haven't found a suitable embroidery technique.

650
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,990
I can't complete it.

651
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,880
Ms. Qiao certainly won't let me go to Fashion Week.

652
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,840
By the way,

653
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,910
why hasn't there been any thunderstorms lately?

654
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,380
When can I go back?

655
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,280
I don't want you to go back.

656
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,659
I hope I'm the only person in your world.

657
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,460
Chuyue.

658
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,420
You are mine.

659
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,340
From head to toe

660
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,889
to every hair strand.

661
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:34,880
I told you.

662
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,360
You can't keep your eyes

663
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,580
on any man but me,

664
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,179
right?

665
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,780
Isn't this a line from a novel?

666
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,380
An Jingzhao,

667
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,820
so you’ve been acting with me.

668
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,270
You're indeed my wife.

669
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,860
Even when you're angry, you're so refreshing and elegant.

670
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,550
What are you doing?

671
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,900
Are you addicted to acting?

672
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,920
You're really getting into it, aren't you?

673
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:09,190
My lady,

674
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,250
since you've already seen through it,

675
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,500
why don't you play along with me?

676
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,190
An Jingzhao.

677
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,170
What are you doing?

678
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:17,660
My lady.

679
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,900
There's a spy.

680
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,030
An Jingzhao.

681
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,260
An Jingzhao.

682
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,910
What's wrong, An Jingzhao?

683
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,540
Chuyue.

684
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,300
An Jingzhao.

685
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,980
I think I’m dying.

686
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,030
- Chuyue.
- An Jingzhao.

687
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,420
I don't think I can make it.

688
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,290
An Jingzhao.

689
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,290
Brother-in-law.

690
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
Brother-in-law.

691
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:40,980
Here.

692
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:41,700
Brother-in-law.

693
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,240
Are you okay?

694
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,040
Why are you two sneaking around?

695
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,050
Well...

696
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,700
When I said I wanted to knock,

697
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,920
Donghua didn't dare to knock.

698
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,940
We didn't want to disturb you

699
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,460
so we had to wait outside.

700
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,060
Stop talking.

701
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,270
Brother-in-law,

702
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,470
your acting skills are getting better.

703
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,020
I almost believed you.

704
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,180
If you continue working on it,

705
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,860
next time when we go back,

706
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,800
if you play the sickly domineering CEO,

707
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,100
you can definitely get an Oscar.

708
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,880
Right, Donghua?

709
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,320
Yes.

710
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:06,150
Young Lord, you can do it.

711
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,140
I see.

712
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,770
So you were the one who taught him

713
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,750
those amateurish and melodramatic plotlines.

714
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,700
No, I didn't.

715
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:15,980
I wanted to teach him,

716
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,340
but haven't you seen

717
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,900
that he's a natural?

718
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,050
There's no need to teach him.

719
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,110
Sister, my ears are going to fall off.

720
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,900
I'm here to tell you

721
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,130
that I want to go deer-hunting with Donghua.

722
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,260
Deer hunting in the middle of nowhere.

723
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,480
There's no GPS.

724
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,430
Where can I find you if you get lost?

725
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:35,980
It's already a miracle of the universe

726
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,860
that we can get here, alright?

727
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:38,620
Besides,

728
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,300
you're already dating

729
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,020
but you won't even let me go out.

730
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:42,620
Li Chuyue,

731
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,580
you have such double standards.

732
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,140
Chuyang.

733
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,900
Don't talk to your sister like that.

734
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,430
Donghua.

735
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,690
Take Chuyang to Yunwu Mountain.

736
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,460
That's where our villa trains.

737
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
It should be fine.

738
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,140
Brother-in-law is the best.

739
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:57,670
Donghua.

740
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,150
Let's...

741
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,350
Wait, what if you get lost?

742
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,770
I won't let him go

743
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,340
if we don't resolve this.

744
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,190
I'm prepared.

745
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,580
Besides,

746
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,260
I'm a modern human.

747
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:11,690
Nothing will happen.

748
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,720
Young Lord,

749
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,540
I think it’s okay.

750
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,890
Donghua, let's go.

751
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,120
Li Chuyang.

752
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,060
Young Lord. Li Chuyang.

753
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,780
Goodbye, Young Madam.

754
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,900
Let's go hunting.

755
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,180
Let's go hunting.

756
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,500
Li Chuyang, Li Chuyang.

757
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,540
Go hunting.

758
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
Let's go hunting.

759
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,500
I want some water.

760
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,500
I want water too.

761
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,630
Brother.

762
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,780
Chuyue.

763
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,500
Jingling.

764
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,460
Ling.

765
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,580
Why are you here?

766
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,980
The birthday cake you gave me last time

767
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,730
tasted great.

768
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,530
It was very creative.

769
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,280
To express my gratitude,

770
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,610
I went to Bingquan Villa

771
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:10,900
to get some flower cakes

772
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,660
for Chuyue.

773
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,210
You're so nice.

774
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,450
The cakes are beautiful.

775
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,700
It's sweet and greasy.

776
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,620
You'd better not eat it.

777
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,460
I don't mind.

778
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,710
They are all mine.

779
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,330
Thank you.

780
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,330
Thank you.

781
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:28,290
If you like it,

782
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,010
I'll go to Bingquan Villa to get more

783
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:30,940
when I'm free.

784
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,510
Where is

785
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,390
Bingquan Villa?

786
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:35,960
I want to go too.

787
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,480
Hanfeng Mountain is too far.

788
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,240
There're many mountain roads.

789
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,480
It takes a whole day to walk.

790
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,280
If you like it,

791
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,100
I'll go get it.

792
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:43,870
Gosh.

793
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,020
So touching.

794
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,070
You're so nice.

795
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,970
Tell me if you need anything next time.

796
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:48,810
I'll do it.

797
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,450
Don't trouble Second Young Master.

798
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:51,890
Got it.

799
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,890
Why are you so fierce?

800
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,930
I'm not.

801
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,660
Chuyue.

802
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,900
Did you embroider this embroidery pattern?

803
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,460
Yes.

804
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,330
What a beautiful embroidery design.

805
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:01,980
Jingling.

806
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,350
You came at the right time.

807
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,270
I'm looking for a design.

808
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,740
You can discuss it with me.

809
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,100
Okay.

810
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,220
What do you think of this?

811
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:10,800
My lady,

812
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,280
you've been looking at this embroidery pattern all day.

813
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,580
The sun is going down.

814
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,980
If you keep looking at it, your eyes will go bad.

815
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,240
Look at it another day.

816
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,530
Don't be too spoiled.

817
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,140
My lady.

818
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,710
Let me take you back to your room.

819
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:24,810
An Jingzhao.

820
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,380
It's getting late.

821
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,280
I should go back.

822
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,810
I'll visit you another day.

823
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,580
Jingling.

824
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:32,140
I'm going to the market to look for embroidery samples next time.

825
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,870
Come with me.

826
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,900
Anytime.

827
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,540
Goodbye, Jingzhao.

828
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,540
Jingling was kind enough to deliver food

829
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,860
but you sent him away.

830
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,340
How petty.

831
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:49,860
Listen.

832
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,570
I forbid you to go to the market with Ling.

833
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,780
I won’t listen to you.

834
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,800
You must.

835
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:07,780
My lady.

836
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,830
Try me.

837
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,950
Behave yourself when you go to the market.

838
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,120
Otherwise, I won't give you food.

839
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,170
Try it.

840
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,040
Look at you.

841
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,110
You still look like Young Lord.

842
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,390
If you go out,

843
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,660
we'll be exposed in no time.

844
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,470
You'd better not go.

845
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,940
No.

846
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:39,600
I have to go.

847
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,300
Chuyang said

848
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,110
I'm a strong contender

849
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,510
for the Oscar.

850
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,720
I won't be exposed.

851
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,080
Since Li Chuyang came,

852
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:47,830
your vocabulary for nonsensical things

853
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,140
has skyrocketed.

854
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,570
Young Lord,

855
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,670
Chu Feng is here.

856
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,250
Why is he here?

857
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,970
No, I need to get changed.

858
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,590
Dear,

859
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,460
just remember that you're a natural.

860
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,020
Come on.

861
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,900
Young Lord, what are you doing?

862
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,660
Young Lord is lonely.

863
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,940
We are playing cosplay.

864
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,060
Cosplay?

865
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,120
I’m Young Lord.

866
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,230
He is a servant.

867
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:26,510
An.

868
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,210
Isn’t it interesting?

869
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,260
She is Young Lord.

870
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,640
Young Lord.

871
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,160
What else can I do for you?

872
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,320
What brings you here?

873
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,010
Today is Second Lord's birthday.

874
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,260
Young Lord, please come to

875
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,850
to Black Eagle Hall with Young Madam.

876
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,530
An is so sick,

877
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,980
and you still want him to go and drink?

878
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,860
You're not allowed to go.

879
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,340
Madam.

880
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,080
No.

881
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,020
I shall take my leave then.
