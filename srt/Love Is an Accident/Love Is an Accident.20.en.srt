[Episode 20]

4
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,479
Young Lord,

5
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,650
this time I did a good job keeping it secret, right?

6
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,270
Why do you

7
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,760
sound like Li Chuyang now?

8
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,070
What? Why are you staring?

9
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,910
Dear, where are you going?

10
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,150
I'll go wherever you go.

11
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,930
I'm not going anywhere.

12
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,520
You must have known

13
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,810
that we are going to the Devil's Cave.

14
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,780
We've already angered Hongfei last time

15
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,340
when we went to get the letter from the Devil's Cave.

16
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,000
This time, there must be full of dangers.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,860
So you can't go.

18
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,260
Fine, it's the same old story again.

19
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,770
Then… I want a hug.

20
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,380
I didn't expect you to know such a technique.

21
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,120
Not only do I know this,

22
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,700
but I'm also skilled at it.

23
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,660
It hurts.

24
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,180
Do you think you can trap me with this rope?

25
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,060
It hurts.

26
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,260
The more you pull it, the tighter the knot gets.

27
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,080
You know kung fu, of course you won't be trapped by it.

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,660
But my wrist is going to break.

29
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:13,860
Don't you feel sympathetic towards me?

30
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:16,290
That's my soft spot.

31
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,420
Last time when you went to steal the letter from the Evil Sect,

32
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,550
without my cover,

33
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,960
could everything go that smoothly?

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,340
I'm doing this for the big picture.

35
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,030
-Dear.
-So,

36
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,970
I have to go.

37
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:24,579
Let's go.

38
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,630
Don't even think about escaping.

39
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,010
We've gone so far. Why would I run away?

40
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,870
But dear,

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:40,950
the rope

42
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,610
has already cut into the flesh of your wrist.

43
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:44,180
My heart aches. Untie it.

44
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,380
I'll untie it for you then.

45
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,270
That's amazing.

46
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
Do you know I'm talented now?

47
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,920
This is nothing.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,350
I can tie more than ten kinds of knots.

49
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,680
They are all different.

50
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,040
You learned it so quickly?

51
00:03:59,340 --> 00:03:59,890
How is it?

52
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,720
Do you know your husband is talented now?

53
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,730
I knew it long ago.

54
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:08,250
Do you think

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,010
Ling is different from before?

56
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,340
Maybe it's because of the stud farm incident.

57
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,400
My father did blame him too severely.

58
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,880
He does seem different.

59
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,910
He was a young boy who hadn't grown up yet.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,160
He was more cheerful and clingy.

61
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,980
He seems more mature now.

62
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:25,410
I guess

63
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,250
Lord has expectations too high for him.

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,230
Why do all parents expect their children

65
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,490
to become successful in every universe?

66
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,450
The evolution of the universe is mythical.

67
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:42,380
Ling,

68
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,120
find a place to hide.

69
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,300
when I distract Hongfei later,

70
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,909
you can find a chance to get the antidote

71
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:48,570
and destroy the Devil's Cave.

72
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,020
Okay.

73
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,440
Donghua.

74
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:50,830
Yes.

75
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,159
Go outside the cave as our backup.

76
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,630
We fooled her last time.

77
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,340
Well,

78
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,940
what should we say to make her believe us?

79
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,030
She came so fast.

80
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,080
Miss Hongfei, do you remember me?

81
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,560
Young Lord. Young Madam.

82
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,580
How have you been?

83
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,660
The Lord of the Evil Sect is indeed intimidating.

84
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
What should we do?

85
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,270
Lord, sorry to disturb you.

86
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,050
We are here

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,140
to get the antidote for the Nine Poisons Whip.

88
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,820
As long as you give us the antidote,

89
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,090
we'll go back immediately

90
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,390
and will never disturb you again.

91
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,980
Last time you broke into my cave and stole the letter.

92
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,380
I haven't settled that matter with you yet.

93
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,830
How dare you ask for the antidote?

94
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,130
Do you want to die?

95
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,570
When the poison of the Nine Poisons Whip takes effect, it's very powerful.

96
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,230
It makes people beg for death.

97
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,530
It's unbearable to see such misery.

98
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,180
Please show them some mercy.

99
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,400
They dominated the market and blustered so much.

100
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,760
They deserved to die.

101
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:57,920
An Jingzhao,

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,760
you're the one who killed our former Lord.

103
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,610
Let's settle

104
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,290
the three things together.

105
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,000
Lord, someone broke into the cave.

106
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,140
Go.

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,130
The so-called righteous sects

108
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,390
have been doing indecent things over and again.

109
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,430
Kill!

110
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,120
Lord! Lord!

111
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:55,790
Wait.

112
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,240
Lord,

113
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,800
let me finish my words.

114
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,480
What do you want to say?

115
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,280
Do you like the shower gel I gave you last time?

116
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,730
It'd be fine if you didn't mention it.

117
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,110
I got angry when you mentioned it.

118
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,690
If it weren't for your scheme,

119
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,760
how could my bathtub have been destroyed?

120
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,220
I don't know martial arts.

121
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,090
I can only think of a plan.

122
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,630
Otherwise, how can I

123
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,440
make friends with masters like you
in the martial arts world?

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,660
How can I get a handsome guy?

125
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,210
Right?

126
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,820
I hate glib talkers.

127
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,620
I know.

128
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,190
How about this?

129
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,870
Give me a chance,

130
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,700
and I'll give you a surprise.

131
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,750
I can tell the cloak in your room

132
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,049
is your favorite.

133
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,950
But due to long time of use,

134
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,280
the embroidery is worn out.

135
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,940
Give me some time.

136
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,710
I can help you recover the embroidery as before.

137
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:48,100
Don't think I'll let you off

138
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,520
with your little tricks.

139
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,730
If I break my promise,

140
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,370
you can cut me into pieces.

141
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,230
Someone.

142
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,790
Bring my cloak.

143
00:08:59,280 --> 00:08:59,750
Yes.

144
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,420
The stitches are indeed exquisite,

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,750
but it's not the kind of embroidery I want.

146
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,750
Hongfei.

147
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,020
Let them go.

148
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,580
How dare you destroy our stone gate!

149
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,220
Stop!

150
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,180
Don't move.

151
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,680
Don't affect my restoration of art.

152
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,130
If you fight beside me,

153
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,460
my hands will tremble,

154
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,220
and your cloak will be ruined.

155
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,960
Miss Hongfei, I'm done.

156
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,880
Take a look.

157
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,970
Are you satisfied?

158
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:12,660
The embroidery is really good.

159
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,640
Hurry.

160
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:22,900
Stop!

161
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,800
Chuyue! Ling!

162
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,700
Are you okay?

163
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,220
Yes.

164
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,240
There's a secret cave even I didn't know.

165
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,410
How did you know about it?

166
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,110
I didn't know, either.

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,090
I shouldn't have mercy on you.

168
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,320
You're bleeding.

169
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,840
I'm fine.

170
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,410
Hongfei,

171
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,410
you've gone too far.

172
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,100
If you do this, we'll all die here.

173
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,530
You'll die first anyway.

174
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:24,810
It's tied?

175
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,000
You can't untie it?

176
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,180
Stop struggling.

177
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,220
Let me remind you.

178
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,250
The more you struggle, the tighter the knot gets.

179
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,370
You will be poisoned to death

180
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,840
if it cuts into your flesh later.

181
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,480
Brat,

182
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:37,420
how dare you use this dirty trick on me?

183
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,820
You threatened us first.

184
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,660
If you promise to give us the antidote,

185
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,520
I'll untie you.

186
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,460
Are you threatening me?

187
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,170
Forget it.

188
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,530
I won't take you out even if I find the exit.

189
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
Brother, let's find a way out first.

190
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,680
I'll find the exit.

191
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,110
Hongfei,

192
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,040
if you don't give me the antidote,

193
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,740
I won't let you go.

194
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:25,820
Brother.

195
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:32,920
Brother!

196
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,520
Hurry! There's an exit here!

197
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,060
Oh no!

198
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,460
The cave is collapsing.

199
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,290
Forget the antidote. Let's go.

200
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:41,260
Chuyue.

201
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,080
Chuyue.

202
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,420
Hurry up.

203
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,100
Let's go.

204
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,720
Chuyue, are you okay?

205
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,430
She was poisoned to save you.

206
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,000
Give me the antidote!

207
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,220
Give me the antidote!

208
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,530
If anything happens to Chuyue,

209
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,770
I will take your life!

210
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,500
Don't force her.

211
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,570
She won't buy it.

212
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,730
Even if you don't give me the antidote,

213
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,190
I won't regret saving you.

214
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,260
If I didn't save you, I'd feel guilty.

215
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,500
Let's go.

216
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,590
Think about the moment

217
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,990
you were almost killed
by the falling stones in the cave.

218
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,590
Did you want to live on at that moment?

219
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,780
Think about it.

220
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,500
That is how I'm feeling now.

221
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,430
I'm going to die soon,

222
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,680
but I don't want to.

223
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,430
I'm not that carefree.

224
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,800
I gave you shower gel

225
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,150
and repaired the embroidery for you.

226
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,590
I also saved your life at the critical moment.

227
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,530
What did I do wrong?

228
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,300
Do you want me to die so much?

229
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:10,740
Chuyue.

230
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,070
Don't you just want revenge on me?

231
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,440
Give me the antidote,

232
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,700
and I'll be at your disposal.

233
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,380
As long as Chuyue can be saved,

234
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,040
I'll be at your disposal, too.

235
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,830
Stop talking.

236
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,890
She won't give it to us.

237
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,540
I knew you would give it to me.

238
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,490
I can tell a good person.

239
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,260
You're not a witch at all.

240
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,390
Get lost

241
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,030
before I change my mind.

242
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,760
You'd be more charming if you were gentler.

243
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,320
Lord,

244
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,110
I have to ask for more antidotes

245
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,490
for my pals in the martial arts world.

246
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,820
It's enough for you all.

247
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,900
Thank you.

248
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:57,330
We don't owe each other anything.

249
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,680
I like her more and more.

250
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,590
Chuyue.

251
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,780
Hurry up and take the antidote.

252
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:16,630
[Yunwei Villa]

253
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,760
We're here.

254
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,610
Who are you? What brings you here?

255
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,550
I'm looking for Li Chuyue.

256
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Your Young Madam.

257
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,500
Who are you?

258
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm the Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley.

259
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,540
The Magic Flower Valley?

260
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,650
We are righteous sects.

261
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,370
We don't welcome people from the Evil Sect.

262
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,900
What are you talking about?

263
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,710
Who are you accusing of being from the Evil Sect?

264
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,080
Ignore him.

265
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,050
Let's go inside.

266
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,980
Don't move!

267
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,780
Don't be unpolite!

268
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:43,850
Report!

269
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:46,700
This man from the Evil Sect is looking for Young Madam.

270
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,430
Valley Lord,

271
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,030
I didn't know you were coming.

272
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,810
Sorry for not welcoming you.

273
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,450
Excuse me.

274
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,500
Please come in.

275
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,030
Let's go.

276
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,490
This way, please.

277
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,180
See?

278
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,160
Am I your Young Madam's friend or not?

279
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,870
Yes.

280
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,720
You were talking about the Evil Sect…

281
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,680
I think you are from the Evil Cult!

282
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,270
You're nothing.

283
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,780
This way, please.

284
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,310
What kind of person is that?

285
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,860
Nice decoration.

286
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,630
Valley Lord!

287
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,820
Why are you here?

288
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,550
Come here.

289
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,350
Valley Lord!

290
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,220
I have a friend to visit.

291
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,950
I have friends in Shangyu now.

292
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:36,820
Do you miss me?

293
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,580
Yes.

294
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
Look how happy she is!

295
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,340
Listen.

296
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,170
You almost couldn't see me.

297
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,600
The guard at your villa

298
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,960
stopped me

299
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,820
and said I was from the Evil Cult.

300
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,660
I scolded him.

301
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,210
The parallel universes are all the same.

302
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,650
Discrimination between different sects or regions…

303
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,250
What a failure of evolution.

304
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,790
What do you mean?

305
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,660
Why don't I understand?

306
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,430
Valley Lord.

307
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,900
We didn't discipline them well.

308
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:05,950
I apologize.

309
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,740
It's okay.

310
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:08,740
Leave us.

311
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,839
Go! Go!

312
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,410
Valley Lord,

313
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,210
thanks to your Spirit Grass for detoxifying me that day.

314
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,369
I will never forget your kindness.

315
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,609
What are you talking about?

316
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,430
Aren't you one of us?

317
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,980
Why are you being so polite?

318
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,660
Come on.

319
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,910
It's good to have friends coming from afar.

320
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,020
Taoyun, serve the cakes.

321
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:33,500
Yes.

322
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:35,530
Good.

323
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,160
By the way,

324
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,540
I didn't come here empty-handed.

325
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,050
I brought something nice.

326
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,510
Come on.

327
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,300
Let me show you.

328
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,430
This is the fabric dyed with flowers in our valley.

329
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,850
Do you like it?

330
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,330
The color is amazing.

331
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,940
You call that amazing?

332
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,560
Not even close.

333
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:02,360
There is a flower called Ghost Lotus in our valley.

334
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,120
The fabric dyed with it

335
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,450
is really amazing.

336
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,300
Do I have the pleasure of having a look at it?

337
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,900
Not now.

338
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,700
The Ghost Lotus hasn't bloomed yet.

339
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,200
How about this?

340
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,660
Wait for half a month.

341
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,220
Half a month later, when the flowers blossom,

342
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,280
I'll send it to you.

343
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,600
Okay, no problem.

344
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,600
I need to find a suitable embroidery technique

345
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,120
to go with your Ghost Lotus fabric.

346
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,680
Then the clothes I make

347
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,980
will shine so brightly

348
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,900
that they're even blinding.

349
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,870
Okay.

350
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,070
It's a deal then.

351
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:38,700
Deal.

352
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,240
Come on.

353
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,930
Try the dessert of our villa.

354
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,570
Ling will like

355
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,010
such a beautiful thing.

356
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,990
Taoyun, go get Jingling.

357
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,670
Second Young Master has been staying indoors lately.

358
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,940
I don't want to go bother him.

359
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,200
What's wrong with him?

360
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,630
Eat more.

361
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,980
Could it be

362
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,510
Chuyue's birthday?

363
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,170
What is this place?

364
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,190
It must not be Shangyu.

365
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,940
How did they get there?

366
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,440
Young Master.

367
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:45,940
Young Master.

368
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,260
The men you sent to Hanshui Sect are back.

369
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,150
Tell me. Any clues?

370
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,580
Hanshui Sect said

371
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:54,160
Second Lady was last spotted in Qingluo Dock.

372
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,640
It is said that she was taken away

373
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,100
by a fat human trafficker.

374
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,500
She hasn't been seen again since then.

375
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,340
People of the Hanshui Sect

376
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,990
has been looking for this trafficker all these years,

377
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,390
but there has been no progress.

378
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,390
It's said that he quit doing this.

379
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,460
There are no other clues other than this.

380
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:15,090
Does the appearance of Han Wanqing have any features?

381
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,110
Yes, people from Hanshui Sect

382
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,420
said there was a peach-flower-shaped birthmark

383
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,710
on Han Wanqing's arm.

384
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,670
Do we know what the trafficker looked like?

385
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:26,070
Yes.

386
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,650
I've seen his information in Hanshui Sect's files.

387
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,110
Tell me.

388
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,430
He's a little fat.

389
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,450
There's a black mole above his right eyebrow.

390
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:35,980
A round nose.

391
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:37,840
Long and thin eyes.

392
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,120
Burn scars on the left arm.

393
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,310
Burn scars on the left arm…

394
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,930
Take this portrait and go to Qingluo Dock.

395
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,590
Pay closer attention to the taverns and restaurants

396
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,650
to see if any cook

397
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,250
looks like the person in the portrait.

398
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,390
Yes.

399
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,640
Young Master, why cook?

400
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,400
Cooks are the only ones

401
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,380
who most possibly get scalded and get scars on the arms.

402
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,980
If he isn't a trafficker now,

403
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,780
he might've gone back to do his old job.

404
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,440
You are so wise. I'll go now.

405
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,980
Only by finding the real Han Wanqing

406
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:56,510
can Li Chuyue's identity as the Young Madam be abolished.

407
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,400
I will...

408
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,200
I will definitely

409
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,000
hand in the clothes on time.

410
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,880
I can do it.

411
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,230
Young Madam.

412
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,450
Did you have a nightmare?

413
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,400
Oh no.

414
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,530
I've been delayed for days.

415
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,840
The deadline is almost up.

416
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,000
I need to find the embroidery craftsmen and make the clothes.

417
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,600
Taoyun.

418
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,810
Do you know

419
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,800
who can embroider like this?

420
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,230
Do you know

421
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,380
where to find a very good embroidery?

422
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,720
I didn't find any in the market last time.

423
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,320
There is no good embroidery

424
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,600
in the area near Yunwei Villa.

425
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:52,360
People here don't rear silkworms.

426
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,030
But

427
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,320
there may be some in the south.

428
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,800
Do you know the exact location?

429
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,790
Why don't you ask the people in the villa?

430
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,840
The housekeeper is in charge of the food and clothing of the villa.

431
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,320
She must know something.

432
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,380
The disciples and attendants

433
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,360
are from all over the country.

434
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,390
There might be some news from them.

435
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,770
How could I forget Yunwei Villa?

436
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,390
Taoyun, cutie pie, Mommy loves you!

437
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:25,730
Cutie pie!

438
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,640
Why did Chuyue call herself Mommy?

439
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,380
Second Young Master.

440
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,370
My brother is going to practice in seclusion.

441
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,370
So I made some soup

442
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,920
for him.

443
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,180
Thank you, Second Young Master.

444
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,130
Ling.

445
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,150
Brother.

446
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,010
The Profound Earth Sutra really deserves its reputation.

447
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,460
Your internal force has increased a lot.

448
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,090
Your swordsmanship is getting stronger.

449
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,940
The inner strength of the Profound Earth Sutra is powerful.

450
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,200
If one's internal force is weak, it will backfire greatly.

451
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,050
Brother, you're gifted.

452
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,980
You'll be able to master it in time.

453
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,150
Brother.

454
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,380
Is this the Profound Earth Sutra?

455
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,420
It's written on a bamboo scroll?

456
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,010
It has been passed down for a long time.

457
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,010
Naturally, they used bamboo slips.

458
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,000
But bamboo slips are not easy to carry.

459
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,900
Indeed.

460
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,660
Ling, your handwriting is excellent.

461
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,320
Could you make one copy for me?

462
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,900
If you don't mind,

463
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,060
I'm more than willing to.

464
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,920
Donghua, go get the brush and ink.

465
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,470
Yes.

466
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,220
Housekeeper!

467
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,590
Housekeeper!

468
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,460
Housekeeper!

469
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,090
Young Madam.

470
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,980
Housekeeper,

471
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,700
do you know

472
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,000
who can embroider with such stitches?

473
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:04,630
Young Madam.

474
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,200
I can't tell.

475
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,410
Why don't I show you

476
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,560
all the samples of embroidery in the warehouse?

477
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,170
Okay, thank you.

478
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,490
Okay, come with me.

479
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:14,920
Okay.

480
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,530
Young Madam.

481
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,510
These are all the embroidery samples

482
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,790
in our mansion.

483
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,060
Is there anything you want?

484
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,660
Shall I ask Hottie?

485
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,390
Maybe she knows.

486
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:59,460
Chuyue.

487
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,240
These are embroidered by excellent embroiderers.

488
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,790
See if there's any suitable one.

489
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,880
None of them is suitable?

490
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,700
Well then,

491
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,130
in a few days,

492
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,130
let Zhao accompany you to go to the south.

493
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:24,820
Young Master.

494
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,470
Young Master, we found the trafficker back then.

495
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:29,470
As you expected,

496
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:31,070
he is now a cook in a tavern.

497
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:33,940
He said he remembered the girl with a birthmark on her arm.

498
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,420
He said in the second year of Zongyuan,

499
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,940
she and about a dozen of other girls

500
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,310
went to several big sects.

501
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,040
They were registered as maids.

502
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,350
Ten years ago…

503
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,310
Several sects in the martial arts world…

504
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,700
Could Yunwei Villa have accepted such maids, too?

505
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,510
Go get the registration form for the maids of the villa.

506
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:52,890
Okay.

507
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,190
Let's go.

508
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,210
There really were maids registered back then.

509
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,460
Do we have to check them one by one?

510
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,730
The birthmark is private.

511
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,990
Of course they won't tell people easily.

512
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,100
Chuyue

513
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,390
has been inquiring about embroidery craftsmen in the villa recently.

514
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,210
Maybe that can help me.

515
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,780
Your embroidery is so beautiful.

516
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,260
Jingling,

517
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,920
thank you for reminding me

518
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,220
to keep everyone here.

519
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,320
That's why I came up with this idea.

520
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,280
Go ahead.

521
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,960
I wanted to go to Yunwei Villa

522
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,740
to participate in the selection of disciples.

523
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,700
But I lost in the swordsmanship.

524
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,620
I was so close to becoming a formal disciple.

525
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,160
I

526
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,430
wanted to learn fashion design

527
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,590
and took a fancy to my ideal school.

528
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,070
But I was one point short of getting in.

529
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,340
Then I went to work.

530
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,950
I wanted to apply for the Design Department.

531
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:11,430
But I was one point short again.

532
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,660
Am I more miserable than you?

533
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:15,440
Are you comforted?

534
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,160
So, do you have any good embroidery?

535
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,460
My grandmother embroidered this handkerchief.

536
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,140
The craftsmanship is exquisite.

537
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,430
If you like it,

538
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,430
I can ask my grandmother to embroider one for you.

539
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,860
No, thanks.

540
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,250
Young Master, what's wrong?

541
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,190
Come with me to draw a birthmark.

542
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
Use the red paint.

543
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,500
Yes.

544
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,480
Pei and I grew up together.

545
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,670
We came to Yunwei Villa together.

546
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,960
At first, we practiced swordplay together

547
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,580
and learned internal force together.

548
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,640
We were very close.

549
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,700
But later I was promoted to a before-seat disciple

550
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,740
because I was good at swordsmanship.

551
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,220
Pei has become cold to me

552
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,900
and picked on me since then.

553
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:12,990
He said I was chubbier

554
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,640
and not as delicate as before.

555
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,020
Young Madam, why does Pei act like that?

556
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:22,790
It's simple.

557
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,060
He is not as good as you in terms of kung fu.

558
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,560
He's not as good-looking as you.

559
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,430
So he deliberately suppress you and control you

560
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,840
in all aspects.

561
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,300
So it's not that you're not good enough.

562
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,250
You should break up with him as soon as possible.

563
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,780
Thank you, Young Madam.

564
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,430
I practice kung fu,

565
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,860
so I don't have any needlework.

566
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,550
But when I was traveling,

567
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,800
I heard there's an embroiderer named Ju Wutang.

568
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,730
It's said that he's very skilled.

569
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,430
He often works in the north.

570
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,540
Ju Wutang. Ju Wutang.

571
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,060
Okay, I'll keep that in mind.

572
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:01,950
Don't be sad.

573
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:04,650
Ju Wutang.

574
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,560
Ju Wutang.

575
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,860
Next.

576
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,110
Who? Come on.

577
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,670
Me.

578
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:11,360
Me.

579
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,060
Second Young Master.

580
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,850
Second Young Master.

581
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,050
Second Young Master.

582
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,930
I want to show you my birthmark.

583
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,700
Can you predict my marriage?

584
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:23,900
Jingling,

585
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,620
I'm doing something serious.

586
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,220
Don't make trouble here.

587
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,020
Go away!

588
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,350
I'm not making trouble.

589
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,440
I also have some news about embroidery.

590
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:35,680
Come on.

591
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,090
Your birthmark is heart-shaped.

592
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,920
It means you can find a girl like a fairy

593
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,250
as your girlfriend.

594
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,230
Your marriage will be pretty good.

595
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:57,670
I like lively and interesting girls.

596
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,030
Trust me.

597
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,100
You will find one.

598
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,980
I hope so.

599
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,140
So, what good embroidery do you have?

600
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,950
Qing.

601
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,360
I know you've been looking for good embroidery recently.

602
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,090
So I sent people to look for some.

603
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,490
I found these today.

604
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,870
Have a look to see if you like anything.

605
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,840
Awesome, Jingling.

606
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,420
As Miss Chuyue has praised me,

607
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:31,550
whether you're the disciple or attendants of the villa,

608
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,020
anyone with a birthmark

609
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,160
can receive a reward from me.

610
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,310
You can get it from Qing.

611
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,420
This way.

612
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,680
I have a birthmark too.

613
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,630
Do you have one?

614
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,680
-Let me see.
-Next.

615
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:48,730
Yours.

616
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,610
Do you have one?

617
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,660
No.

618
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,710
What a pity.

619
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,320
Look.

620
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,100
It's for real!

621
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:08,590
Sir,

622
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,940
I found the person with a birthmark on the arm.

623
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,470
Who is it?

624
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,560
Taoyun.

625
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,190
It's almost my turn.

626
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,380
Move forward.

627
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,770
Young Lord,

628
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,020
I have a question.

629
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,320
What does "Mommy" mean?

630
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,030
It means mother.

631
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,480
Young Madam once said,

632
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,570
"Mommy loves you."

633
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:58,510
I'm an adult now,

634
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,970
but she wants to be my mother.

635
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,100
It shows

636
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:03,950
how much she hopes

637
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,470
to have a child of her own.

638
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,780
Young Lord,

639
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,489
maybe when you have your own child,

640
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,900
Young Madam will feel much better.

641
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,989
Thank you, Taoyun.

642
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,610
We will work hard on that.

643
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,020
Why can't I find suitable needlework?

644
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:26,909
Young Madam.

645
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,580
Stop it if you can't find it.

646
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,420
Take a rest.

647
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,580
There's still no result.

648
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,620
I have good news for you.

649
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,480
You'll be happy to hear it.

650
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,250
I've decided

651
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:51,330
to let you be my wife

652
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,570
as Li Chuyue

653
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,659
instead of as Han Wanqing.

654
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,450
When Father gets better,

655
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,930
I'll tell him formally.

656
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:23,090
Father, are you feeling better?

657
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:24,760
Yes.

658
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:26,980
Ling

659
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,690
found some herb medicine for me.

660
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,980
By the way,

661
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:36,230
how's your practice of the Profound Earth Sutra?

662
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:39,580
I've practiced the first move.

663
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,780
And I've mastered it.

664
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:43,190
Good.

665
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,860
When I feel better,

666
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,820
I'll test you.

667
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,660
Please guide me, Father.

668
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,340
Father.

669
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,540
I have a request for you today.

670
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:00,560
Good.

671
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,160
I have something to discuss with you too.

672
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:07,560
They've found the real Han Wanqing.

673
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:13,250
I've already known

674
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:16,650
that Chuyue passed herself off as Han Wanqing.

675
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,180
This is a letter from Hanshui Sect.

676
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,140
According to the letter,

677
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,540
they have found the trafficker

678
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:34,660
who found Han Wanqing in Qingluo Dock.

679
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,150
They found the real Han Wanqing

680
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,520
following this clue.

681
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:45,290
And Han Wanqing is actually in our villa.

682
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,910
She is Taoyun.

683
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,410
Since we've found Han Wanqing,

684
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:59,870
your marriage with Chuyue doesn't count anymore.

685
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,850
You asked Chuyue to pretend to be Han Wanqing.

686
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,900
Chief Han, the big brother of Han Wanqing,

687
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,100
has known about this.

688
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:14,700
He's a little dissatisfied.

689
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,750
I've explained it to him.

690
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,690
I said we had no choice back then.

691
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:22,330
Fortunately,

692
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:26,260
Han Wanqing has been found now,

693
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,760
so Chief Han has forgiven us.

694
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,740
He is on his way here.

695
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:38,970
He'll come to Yunwei Villa in a few days.

696
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,880
After Chief Han and Taoyun meet each other,

697
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,690
I'll choose the date for your marriage.

698
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,570
Father,

699
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,660
Chuyue and I love each other.

700
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,350
I will only marry her in this life.

701
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,470
Please withdraw your order.

702
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,140
Han Wanqing's father, the late Chief Han,

703
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,860
helped us a lot.

704
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:03,350
Back then, the chiefs and I

705
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,510
fell into the trap of the Evil Sect.

706
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,970
It was the late Chief Han who risked his life to save us.

707
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,870
That's why I'm alive today.

708
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,720
That's how we could establish Yunwei Villa.

709
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,550
Now the old Chief is dead,

710
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,860
but I must keep my promise

711
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:25,110
and take care of his only daughter.

712
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:25,920
Father,

713
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,860
I can take care of Taoyun like a brother,

714
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,740
but I can't marry her.

715
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,100
Marriage is arranged

716
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,880
by parents and matchmakers.

717
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,630
-You must marry her.
-Father.

718
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,130
Marriage should not be decided by parents

719
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,210
or matchmakers.

720
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,630
One should decide his own marriage.

721
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,460
Only the ones who're in love should get married.

722
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,660
Nonsense!

723
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,340
Let me ask you one last time.

724
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,230
Will you marry her or not?

725
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,740
No.

726
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:57,770
You...

727
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:01,420
Father.

728
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,270
Father, are you okay?

729
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,720
I'll go get a doctor.

730
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,540
If you don't agree,

731
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:10,680
don't mind

732
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,680
my business anymore.

733
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,220
Guards!

734
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,820
-Call the doctor.
-Yes.

735
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,220
Hurry.

736
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:21,180
Calm down.

737
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,100
Young Master.

738
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,340
Young Master, why are your shoes wet?

739
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,980
I went to the south to collect herbs.

740
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,240
It kept raining there.

741
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,520
Did Father say anything about Han Wanqing?

742
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,040
Yes.

743
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,900
Taoyun has known about it.

744
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:43,490
Okay.

745
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
How did she react?

746
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,570
She cried out of joy because she found her parents and siblings.

747
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,960
But later when she was told she was to marry Young Lord,

748
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,220
she said she didn't want to be a mistress.

749
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,020
A mistress?

750
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,050
Yes.

751
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,260
I don't know what it means either.

752
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,820
But why doesn't she want

753
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,750
such a great opportunity to climb the social ladder?

754
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Taoyun and Chuyue are good friends.

755
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,990
I'm afraid she won't be willing.

756
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,460
If she doesn't agree to it,

757
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,260
their agreement of marriage will be meaningless.

758
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,340
I have to find a way to let Taoyun marry my brother.

759
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,700
Who does she usually get along with?

760
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,230
She seems to be close

761
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,390
with Pockface Wang.

762
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,970
Go get Pockface Wang

763
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,440
and prepare some money.

764
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,420
Yes.

765
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,050
How is Father?

766
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:35,360
He just called Young Lord over.

767
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,800
Go find Pockface Wang.

768
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,290
Yes.

769
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,600
It seems I need to meet with Chuyue.
