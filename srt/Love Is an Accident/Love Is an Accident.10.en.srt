4
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,580
Kid,

5
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,780
this is for you.

6
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,120
Thank you, Miss.

7
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,210
But this is from your boyfriend.

8
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:48,250
So I can't take it.

9
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,690
It's okay.

10
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,759
I can win another one for her.

11
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,100
It's okay.

12
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,270
I don't like it anyway.

13
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:56,910
Take it.

14
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,539
Take it. What should you say?

15
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,530
Say thank you.

16
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,880
Thank you, Miss.

17
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,540
Bye.

18
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,330
I'll win another one for you.

19
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:07,860
Boss.

20
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,630
You've already won the grand prize.

21
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,780
You can't play anymore.

22
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,380
Boss,

23
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:16,090
there's no such rule.

24
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,420
Why can't we play anymore?

25
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,320
You don't follow the rules yourself.

26
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,640
How can everyone play?

27
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,930
Right?

28
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,490
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You can play.

29
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,040
But if you want to play,

30
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,500
I need to increase the difficulty.

31
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,980
How?

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,420
Use a gun.

33
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,230
Can you do it?

34
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:32,860
Okay.

35
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:42,540
Chuyue,

36
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,540
do me a favor.

37
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,070
Be my wife.

38
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,130
Then you can stare at me like this all the time.

39
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,579
Thank you.

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,810
Let's go.

41
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,250
I dress the same with her. Look.

42
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,550
An Jingzhao,

43
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,880
the pirate ship is quite fun.

44
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,260
Let's go play on it too.

45
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,020
Sure.

46
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,430
An Jingzhao,

47
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,860
if you feel scared,

48
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,950
just shout.

49
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,300
It's not embarrassing.

50
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,780
What are you doing?

51
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,250
Aren't you scared?

52
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,010
Are you scared?

53
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,360
What do you think?

54
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,230
How can I not be?

55
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,790
So handsome.

56
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,600
Here.

57
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,740
He looks like a man of noble birth.

58
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,550
Shall we go ask for his number?

59
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,950
The girl next to him

60
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,500
seems to be his girlfriend.

61
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,020
No way.

62
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,240
They're not very close.

63
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,990
They don't look like a couple.

64
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,450
Maybe they're relatives.

65
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,210
Handsome guys are usually

66
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,700
into good-looking girls.

67
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,810
Look at that girl.

68
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,250
She looks so ordinary.

69
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,580
Yeah.

70
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm so scared.

71
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,240
Only a couple

72
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,390
can be so close.

73
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,560
Are we a couple?

74
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,000
I know.

75
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,320
That girl

76
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
should be pursuing that guy.

77
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,220
She hasn't succeeded yet.

78
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,130
After the movie,

79
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,100
let's go ask for his WeChat account.

80
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,700
Okay.

81
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,050
I'm the most beautiful and lovely fairy.

82
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,920
Even my leg hair is beautiful.

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,310
It's over. Let's go.

84
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,750
Let's go.

85
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,190
Wait for me outside.

86
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:02,860
Excuse me.

87
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,090
Handsome,

88
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,340
can I add you on WeChat?

89
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:16,950
I'm sorry.

90
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,200
That girl is the one I like.

91
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,290
I will love her forever.

92
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,230
Besides,

93
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,120
she is the cutest

94
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,030
and prettiest girl in the world.

95
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,300
She's beautiful even with her leg hair.

96
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,830
Let's go.

97
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,050
I need to use the toilet.

98
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:35,580
Let's go.

99
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,520
Men are always lying.

100
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,230
You say you like me,

101
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,270
but you still added them on WeChat.

102
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,140
No, I didn't.

103
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:13,980
An Jingzhao.

104
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,760
I've played with you all day.

105
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,360
My task is completed, right?

106
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,340
Let's continue tomorrow.

107
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,780
Why are you breaking your promise?

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I didn't say it'd be just for one day.

109
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,150
We have other activities tomorrow.

110
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:27,810
Rest early.

111
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,430
Are we there?

112
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,620
Yes, we're here.

113
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,240
Are we really going camping here?

114
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,290
If you don't want to,

115
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,460
we can go back now.

116
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,700
No need.

117
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,460
I can accompany you if you want.

118
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,610
Take the food.

119
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,780
There's food?

120
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,160
When did you buy it?

121
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,460
There's even wine?

122
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,110
There's mud on the way. Be careful.

123
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,300
How can you handle everything?

124
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,850
Not really.

125
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,300
There's a person that I can't handle.

126
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,850
Are you done roasting?

127
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:32,690
I'm hungry.

128
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,480
It's quite delicious.

129
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,160
An Jingzhao,

130
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,480
have you ever tried beer yet?

131
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,140
Have one?

132
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,040
Okay.

133
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:57,580
Here.

134
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,070
You're not the kind of person

135
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,100
who talks gibberish when you're drunk, are you?

136
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,060
I really don't like people

137
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,660
who talk drunken gibberish.

138
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,880
Are you talking about yourself?

139
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,330
I can drink a lot.

140
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,080
There's no way that I get drunk.

141
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,520
Let's play a game.

142
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,220
What?

143
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,240
Truth or Dare.

144
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,960
You even know that?

145
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,990
Li Chuyang taught you that, right?

146
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,340
Fine. I'm not afraid.

147
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,220
Come on.

148
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,360
Let me do it.

149
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,280
You...

150
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,480
When was your first kiss?

151
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:54,990
Last time with you.

152
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,300
Who was the first person you loved?

153
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,470
It's my turn to spin.

154
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,750
So what's your answer?

155
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,400
You've drunk it twice.

156
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,930
You can't drink it anymore.

157
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,120
I want to know your answer now.

158
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,860
Answer me.

159
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,230
I don't like you.

160
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,460
Come on.

161
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,050
Go in.

162
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:35,850
What are you doing?

163
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,740
Let me help you in. You're drunk.

164
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,540
No.

165
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,620
I want to stay here.

166
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,000
Be careful.

167
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,300
Be careful.

168
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:53,930
Have a rest.

169
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,560
I'll go tidy up.

170
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,950
Where are you going?

171
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,220
I haven't set up the tent yet.

172
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,230
Don't be like this.

173
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,960
I wanted to like you.

174
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,710
It's none of your business.

175
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:19,890
Add some makeup.

176
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,540
Thank you.

177
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,630
Don't rub your eyes.

178
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,090
Some foundation was rubbed off.

179
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,890
Do I need to add some on this side?

180
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,570
Okay.

181
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,240
Li Chuyue.

182
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,010
It's better to be painful for a shorter period of time.

183
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,870
He's leaving in a few days anyway.

184
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,660
All right.

185
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,170
Come on. We can start now.

186
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,750
Okay, look at the camera.

187
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:47,070
Okay, look ahead.

188
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,210
OK. Cool.

189
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,250
Great.

190
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,690
Good. Very good.

191
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,510
An Jingzhao.

192
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,360
Come and have a look.

193
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,870
An Jingzhao! He's so handsome!

194
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,800
It's really him.

195
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,310
OK. Very handsome.

196
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,220
Good.

197
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,020
Okay.

198
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,660
Neaten the clothes.

199
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,030
It's okay.

200
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,730
So handsome.

201
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,820
You look innocent,

202
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,680
but are actually a womanizer.

203
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,220
You already rejected me.

204
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,030
Why do you care so much?

205
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,790
Besides, when did I say I'm innocent?

206
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,510
When did I say I'm not interested in women?

207
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,630
Look at the two girls over there.

208
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,890
Which one is prettier?

209
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,770
He's so handsome.

210
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:50,730
Hold on.

211
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:51,390
Okay.

212
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,010
Li Chuyue.

213
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,700
You're being jealous, right?

214
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,770
No.

215
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,270
Is it so hard to admit that you like me?

216
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,580
An Jingzhao, don't flatter yourself.

217
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,540
Who likes you?

218
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,360
Looks like someone lost their memory after getting drunk.

219
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,870
Did I

220
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:26,290
do something out of line?

221
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:28,840
Let me help you recall.

222
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,920
Look at your fricking handsome face.

223
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,420
And your sexy collarbones.

224
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,900
Do you know how much they tempt me?

225
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:39,940
Li Chuyue.

226
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,360
Control yourself.

227
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,820
We agreed to control it,

228
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,720
but you still kissed him.

229
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,570
I'm just a woman.

230
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,450
If you meet such a great guy

231
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,780
and you can control your impulse,

232
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,910
it's just abnormal.

233
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:53,910
You're drunk.

234
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,450
Go to sleep.

235
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,480
Sleep?

236
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,030
It's lonely to sleep alone.

237
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,080
Let's sleep together.

238
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,690
Li Chuyue,

239
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,380
do you know I'm a normal man?

240
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,390
Where's your phone?

241
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,240
What are you doing?

242
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:12,550
What are you doing?

243
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:18,710
Li Chuyue.

244
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,490
Li Chuyue!

245
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,530
In this pocket.

246
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,910
Do you remember now?

247
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,770
You're making it up, aren't you?

248
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,210
I don't remember.

249
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,350
You took this photo.

250
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,590
Take a photo.

251
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,630
You said this is our wedding photo.

252
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,600
This is our wedding photo.

253
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,220
You also said you'd go to the Civil Affairs Bureau
to get the marriage certificate with me.

254
00:17:59,220 --> 00:17:59,820
Tomorrow,

255
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,560
we're going to the Civil Affairs Bureau
to get the marriage certificate.

256
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Why can't you admit that you like me?

257
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,490
What are your scruples?

258
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,120
An Jingzhao,

259
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm just an ordinary girl.

260
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,710
I want to find someone I love

261
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,040
and be with him forever.

262
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,740
We are from two different worlds.

263
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:27,280
How can I be with you?

264
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,840
The passage is open now.

265
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,540
We can go back and forth between the two worlds.

266
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,790
Why can't we be together?

267
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,850
What if the passage is closed one day?

268
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,630
What if we only have one chance to go through it?

269
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,500
Where are we going to live?

270
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,090
There will be a thunderstorm tomorrow.

271
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,880
If I can go back, deal with the crisis in the villa,

272
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,580
and cure my father,

273
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,510
I will come back.

274
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,890
Then I'll live here with you.

275
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,960
We will never be apart.

276
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,980
Wait for me for a minute.

277
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,750
If he goes back,

278
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,750
can he really come back?

279
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,760
What if he can't come back?

280
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,220
I'll be heartbroken before I'm even in a relationship.

281
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:24,770
No, no.

282
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,990
Li Chuyue, in front of a handsome guy,

283
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,720
you should learn to make a pause before it's too late.

284
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,150
Men are all bad luck.

285
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:37,170
How could men all be bad luck?

286
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,040
He might be good luck.

287
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,760
Why are you so serious?

288
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,830
If he really can't come back in the future,

289
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,960
just get things done in these two days.

290
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,260
I don't think it's a good idea.

291
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:52,600
Is there enough time?

292
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,930
The weather forecast said there will be a thunderstorm tomorrow.

293
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,190
You still have one day.

294
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,260
It should be enough.

295
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:03,660
There should be enough time.

296
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:05,380
It won't take a day.

297
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,670
Li Chuyue.

298
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,320
Li Chuyue.

299
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:08,960
How can you be so shameless?

300
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,020
But

301
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,070
I like it.

302
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:16,980
Chuyue.

303
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,610
I can only be brave verbally.

304
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,500
At the end of the day,
we're from two different worlds.

305
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,980
How could you abandon the villa and your family?

306
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,780
It's unrealistic.

307
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,110
Since I dare to say that,

308
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,670
I've made up my mind.

309
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,700
Long distance relationship is hard enough.

310
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,060
Besides, there's also a time gap between us.

311
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,320
Who can guarantee that you can come back?

312
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,240
It's getting late.

313
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,740
Go to bed early.

314
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,510
I need to borrow your room.

315
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,640
Come in then.

316
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm going to bed.

317
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,050
Master,

318
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,040
An Jingzhao hasn't shown up all this time.

319
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:22,360
According to Lingxiao Yard,

320
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
his typhoid fever still hasn't recovered.

321
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,040
It's been days.

322
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,220
Yet he still hasn't recovered?

323
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Anything unuaual in Lingxiao Yard?

324
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,610
Everything is as usual in Lingxiao Yard,

325
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,240
except that Donghua went out more frequently.

326
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,770
He said he went to look for
a prescription for An Jingzhao.

327
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,410
Then ask someone to keep an eye on Donghua.

328
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,170
And as for people around him,

329
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,830
find a way to make them tell.

330
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,320
Yes.

331
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:55,070
Did you bring him here?

332
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:56,600
Come in.

333
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,310
Go.

334
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:08,960
Lord.

335
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,180
I heard

336
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,500
you are one of the best
garment merchants in Shangyu.

337
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,330
You know everything about the cloth and the weave.

338
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,330
Really?

339
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,140
I have a favor to ask.

340
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:36,270
I hope you can find the source

341
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,260
of this piece of cloth within three days.

342
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,500
Lord, please rest assured.

343
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,430
I will find it.

344
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,530
Go.

345
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:48,620
Yes.

346
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,730
We've searched everywhere.

347
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,120
Where on earth

348
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,620
did Zhao and Chuyue go?

349
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,580
Madam.

350
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:15,370
Young Lord has some friends I'm familiar with

351
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,940
in the martial arts world.

352
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,150
There's no better way now.

353
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,270
I want to send more men

354
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,990
to look for them separately.

355
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:25,630
Okay.

356
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,830
Yes, Madam.

357
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:31,380
An Jingzhao is missing?

358
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:32,780
Yes.

359
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,690
Over the past few days,

360
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,380
Donghua has been sending people to look for him.

361
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,500
We caught one of Donghua's men,

362
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,560
and he confessed everything.

363
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,510
Was An Jingzhao really missing

364
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:49,260
or did he deliberately spread false news?

365
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,140
It’s true.

366
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,300
An Jingzhao is indeed missing.

367
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,060
Master,

368
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,460
the garment merchant sent a message

369
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,660
that he's found clues about the fabric.

370
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,450
God is on my side.

371
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:23,430
[Wait, move]

372
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,020
Say it.

373
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:32,730
The garment merchant said
the fabric is extremely rare.

374
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,130
He searched all the garment shops in Shangyu,

375
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,410
and found there was only one shop that had it.

376
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:38,270
And there was only one batch of it.

377
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,190
The boss said

378
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,410
a woman asked him to sell it for her.

379
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,970
We've found this woman.

380
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,080
She's waiting right outside.

381
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,420
Let her in.

382
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,780
Yes.

383
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,060
What can I do for you?

384
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,320
Please.

385
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,650
This...

386
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,230
This...

387
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,420
Second Lord.

388
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
I heard

389
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,360
that batch of cloth was yours.

390
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,050
Second Lord,

391
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,500
it was indeed mine.

392
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,270
Where did you get it?

393
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,770
A young lady gave it to me.

394
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,580
She came to the market every three or four days.

395
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,290
Every time,

396
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,020
she'd go to Li's Cake Shop

397
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,530
to buy Custard with Sugar.

398
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:35,300
She comes to my place to buy some tea sometimes.

399
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,140
Last time,

400
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,740
she came to buy a tea whisk.

401
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:38,960
I saw

402
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,780
the fabric of her clothes was good.

403
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,280
So I said a few more words.

404
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,140
She said

405
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,340
she wove it herself.

406
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,210
She said she could give me some next time.

407
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,140
I wanted

408
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,820
to invite her to my house,

409
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,040
but she declined.

410
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,180
She said it was a long way from home.

411
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,660
After three or four days,

412
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,460
she brought me a batch of fabric.

413
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,420
Someone in my family got sick.

414
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,660
I was short of money.

415
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,900
So I got it out

416
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,620
and asked the shop owner to sell it for me.

417
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,420
She wove it herself?

418
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,490
Yes.

419
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,300
Good.

420
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:08,990
Someone,

421
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,260
bring it here.

422
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:19,390
If you can help me find that lady,

423
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,850
these will all be all yours.

424
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:26,260
All mine?

425
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:29,970
Okay.

426
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,540
I'll help you find her.

427
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,340
I'll help you.

428
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:49,180
It is said that there will be a thunderstorm today.

429
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,480
Li Chuyue,

430
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,430
stop thinking about An Jingzhao.

431
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,230
Work hard.

432
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,840
Your dream is to become a designer

433
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,830
and climb to the peak of your life.

434
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,460
Ms. Qiao,

435
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,020
why don't I draw you?

436
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,970
[No news of Young Lord]

437
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,300
Qing.

438
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:12,680
What happened?

439
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:14,730
Is there anything I can help?

440
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,130
Nothing.

441
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,020
Huan.

442
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,580
I need to go out later.

443
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:19,780
I don't know

444
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,970
when I can come back.

445
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,220
Please take care of Mother.

446
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:24,500
Don't worry.

447
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,320
I will take good care of Mother.

448
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm going to the market

449
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,180
to buy her favorite Custard with Sugar.

450
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,620
Okay.

451
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,440
Qiao.

452
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:47,220
Come on, smile for me.

453
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,800
Ms. Qiao.

454
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,440
I was not talking about you.

455
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,630
You can go to Fashion Week with me.

456
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,660
But

457
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,180
we don't have much time until the Fashion Week.

458
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,040
I need to find

459
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,160
the retired patternmaker Gu Jun.

460
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,770
I'll send you the address later.

461
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,540
But he doesn't live there anymore.

462
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,200
A distant-related niece of his now lives there.

463
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,540
I asked someone to ask this girl about him,

464
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,870
but she refused to tell.

465
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,530
No matter what you do,

466
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,060
you must find Mr. Gu Jun's new address.

467
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,530
Okay, Ms. Qiao.

468
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,280
Leave it to me.

469
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,810
I will definitely find him.

470
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,700
Hurry up.

471
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,500
Wait for me.

472
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,120
It should be here.

473
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,740
[Where are you?]

474
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:54,260
Li Chuyue.

475
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,940
Stop thinking about him.

476
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,390
Work is more important.

477
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,220
An Jingzhao.

478
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,440
Are you scared?

479
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,920
How can I not be?

480
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,740
Hello, Miss.

481
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,080
Do you know where Mr. Gu Jun lives?

482
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,080
I don't know.

483
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,780
You guys are so annoying.

484
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,980
I've told you so many times.

485
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,020
Yet you keep coming and asking me.

486
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,980
Wait, Miss.

487
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,710
I am looking for him because I have something urgent.

488
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:12,060
Please tell me.

489
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:12,780
No.

490
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,659
Miss, I'm looking for him

491
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:19,070
for something very important.

492
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,199
Please do me a favor.

493
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:30,760
This is the only clue.

494
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,730
What should I do?

495
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:33,719
Miss.

496
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,610
Miss.

497
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,710
Are you going out?

498
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:54,580
Miss.

499
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:56,860
Miss.

500
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,580
Are you sure she will come today?

501
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,110
She comes every three days.

502
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,370
Every time she came at this hour.

503
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:11,290
She will come.

504
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,250
She will.

505
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,800
It's her.

506
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,000
Why is there another one?

507
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:37,860
Which one is it?

508
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,220
The first one.

509
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,060
Go follow her.

510
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:46,660
Go.

511
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,320
Keep following her.

512
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:05,980
She said

513
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,240
she wove it herself.

514
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,690
I wanted to invite her to my house,

515
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,260
but she declined.

516
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,360
She said

517
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,850
it was a long way from home.

518
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,760
Super pretty girl.

519
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,180
Miss...

520
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,160
I told you I don't know.

521
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,620
Can you stop bothering me?

522
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,230
Isn't this Li Shengyi from our class?

523
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:40,460
Really?

524
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,100
I thought it was some guy who was malnourished.

525
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:43,990
I just realized

526
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,250
there are people like you in this world.

527
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,740
Androgynous!

528
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,020
Exactly.

529
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,030
Look at her.

530
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:51,890
Yes.

531
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,080
Hey, kids,

532
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,420
I just

533
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,100
recorded your conversation.

534
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,070
Apologize,

535
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,370
or I'll send this video

536
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,240
to your school

537
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,600
and let everyone see your bad behavior.

538
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,460
You must be responsible for your words and actions.

539
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,820
Missus,

540
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,330
you're so nosy.

541
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,320
Is it because no one wants you?

542
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,570
First,

543
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,860
having a boyfriend is not something worth bragging about.

544
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,780
Find one if you want.

545
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,240
If you don't want to, then don't.

546
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:20,700
Second,

547
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:22,930
I have a boyfriend.

548
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,840
His name is An Jingzhao.

549
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:26,050
He is fair and beautiful.

550
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:26,960
And he has long legs.

551
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,580
He's also an excellent kisser.

552
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,220
We live a shameless life every day.

553
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:34,220
He's waiting for me to dote on him at home.

554
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,780
Missus,

555
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,020
you must be bragging.

556
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,780
Yeah, you're just bragging.

557
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,370
Brag away.

558
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,630
I'm telling the truth.

559
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,610
Are you jealous?

560
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,900
Am I an excellent kisser?

561
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:07,150
What are you doing?

562
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,590
As you said,

563
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,670
I'm living a shameless life with you.

564
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,470
Let's go.

565
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,470
Apologize.

566
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,040
Li Shengyi, sorry.

567
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,790
Let's go.

568
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,180
Don't think too much.

569
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,120
It's a special situation.

570
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,720
So I just borrowed your name.

571
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,350
What you borrowed

572
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,880
was more than just my name, wasn't it?

573
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,230
You think too much.

574
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,600
Pretty girl.

575
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,940
My uncle

576
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,680
doesn't accept any visitors.

577
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,550
But at three o'clock every day,

578
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,410
he goes to a place to drink coffee.

579
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,790
This is the address.

580
00:38:58,850 --> 00:38:59,450
Thank you.

581
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,240
You're welcome.

582
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,040
This is the least I can do for you.

583
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:05,290
I wish you good luck in doting on him.

584
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,370
How did you find this place?

585
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,560
You sent a picture.

586
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,020
Isn't there a landmark building in the picture?

587
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,280
Of course I can find it.

588
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,280
There's a thunderstorm today.

589
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,340
You should go back.

590
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,000
Is there anything else

591
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,630
you want to say?

592
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,490
We can be counted as friends.

593
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,760
I hope you can defeat the villain soon.

594
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,690
I have work to do.

595
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,450
Take care.

596
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:32,180
I'm leaving.

597
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,070
Chuyue.

598
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,020
Hello.

599
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,120
Are you Mr. Gu Jun?

600
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:08,290
Yes.

601
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,100
Please take a seat.

602
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,810
I'm Ms. Qiao's assistant at Tangsong Fashion.

603
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,560
For our products of the new season,

604
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,270
we'd like to invite you to be our patternmaker.

605
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,370
Please take a look at this proposal.
