You should explain to them clearly in public.

It's my fault.

Please forgive me this time.

11

I've come up with a way.

That's impossible.

106

An Jingzhao didn't do it.

113
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,460
It was this unfilial son who practiced the Art of Starshift.

114
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,710
He has been secretly practicing

115
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,530
the Art of Starshift and the Profound Earth Sutra.

116
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,590
He killed Master Xuanfeng

117
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,340

118
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,600
I, An Chenghu,

119
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,980
am willing to swear with the reputation of Yunwei Villa that

120
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,880
I'm telling the truth.

121
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,430

122
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,230
You've always been partial to my brother.

123
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,220
Now he has killed several members of the martial arts world.

124

In order to protect him,

125
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,360

An Jingling!

127
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,170
Although I'm a member of the Yunwei Villa,

128
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,240
I have to be on the side of justice.

129

Follow me to search An Jingzhao's room.

134
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:35,919

I’m going to kill the evil man for the martial arts world now!

139
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,770
Please calm down, Lord.

140
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,170
Just wait till Master Zhu investigates it,

141

156
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,280
I didn't expect that you would even frame me.

157
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,000
You unfilial son!

158
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,340
He is your brother.

159
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,510
You even framed him!

160

Take my father back to the villa.

166

I'll handle the things here.

167

-Come on.
-Unfilial son!

174
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,670
When did you become

175
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,860
so inhumane?

176
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,980
Tell the truth.

177

Otherwise, don't blame me for hurting you with my sword!

Put down your sword.

it’s clear that

An Jingzhao is the murderer.

188
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,920
He'll be whipped at noon.

189
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,510

He can never leave there all his life.

191
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,360
If you believe him,

192
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,320
you will all be killed by him.

193
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:24,780
Guards!

194
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,040
Take him away.

195
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,770
-Yes! -Yes!

196
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,830
An Jingling, you bastard!

197
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,530
Bastard!

198
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,720
An Jingling!

199
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,340
Go!

200
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
Bastard!

201
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:35,960
Go.

202
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,320
An Jingzhao,

203
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,230
do you admit your crime?

204
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,730
I've told you

205
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:53,710
I didn't kill Master Xuanfeng.

206
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,360
You're still denying it?

207
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
We have both the witness and the evidence.

208
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,590
You practised evil skills,

209
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,170
and made Chief Han lose all his martial arts skills.

210
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,080
Both Taoist Shanyue

211
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,280
and Master Xuanfeng were killed by you.

212
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,660
You've committed a heinous crime.

213
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,720
You deserve the punishment today.

214
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:28,630
The Shenyuan Whip is the most important treasure of my Zhuyin Pavilion.

215
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:32,050
Now all of you have transferred your internal power to this whip.

216
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,420
I will carry out this penalty today.

217
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,220
Zhu Maoqing!

218
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,770
Jingzhao is not the murderer.

219
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,440
If you whip him,

220
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:46,640
Jingzhao's primordial energy will be exhausted.

221
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,180
Jingzhao.

222
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,620
I'll take you away now.

223
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,260
Bai Zhi.

224
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,080
If I leave now,

225
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,950
it will mean I admit that I'm the murderer, right?

226
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,520
These people who can't tell right from wrong

227
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,880
won't let Yunwei Villa off.

228
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,780
Now that Chuyue has left,

229
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,390
I have no worries

230
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,060
in my heart.

231
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,510
But the truth will come out eventually!

232
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,950
Just do it.

233
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,030
Jingzhao.

234
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,360
Miss Bai Zhi,

235
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
you can't do whatever you want here.

236
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,510
Stop!

237
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:41,590
Chuyue.

238
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,340
Chuyue, why are you here?

239
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,600
Leave at once!

240
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,460
Go!

241
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,710
Young Madam.

242
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:55,830
Please leave here.

243
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,190
No.

244
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,180
I want to be with him.

245
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,580
You...

246
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,340
Then don't blame me for being rude.

247
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,300
Chuyue!

248
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,130
Don't come over!

249
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,770
Go!

250
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,310
An Jingzhao!

251
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,070
An Jingzhao.

252
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,390
How are you?

253
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,180
How are you?

254
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:03,540
Young Madam.

255
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,340
Take the young lord away at once!

256
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:05,920
Let's go!

257
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,460
Help!

258
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,780
Don't let him escape.

259
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,750
Let's go!

260
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,260
-Chase them! -Let's chase them!

261
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,730
Be careful.

262
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,100
An Jingzhao.

263
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,140
Wake up, An Jingzhao.

264
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,880
An Jingzhao!

265
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,190
An Jingzhao!

266
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:13,750
Young Lord.

267
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,640
How about this?

268
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,290
Let's take the young lord to his room for a rest first.

269
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:17,750
Come on.

270
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,810
Give me a hand.

271
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:30,440
How is he?

272
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,940
Everyone injected their internal force into the Shenyuan Whip,

273
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:36,280
and the Shenyuan Whip can double the inner power.

274
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:40,000
Jingzhao's primordial energy has almost been exhausted.

275
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,330
The Spirit Pearl Grass.

276
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:49,450
Last time, An Jingzhao was saved with the help of the Spirit Pearl Grass.

277
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,930
I'm going to the Magic Flower Valley now.

278
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,730
It's useless.

279
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,560
If his primordial energy has been exhausted,

280
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,700
the Spirit Pearl Grass won't be useful at all.

281
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,770
What should we do?

282
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,380
Elder Yueming.

283
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,369
Li Chuyang met him before.

284
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:07,869
Since he could hide the Art of Starshift,

285
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,440
it means he has a way to restrain this martial arts skill.

286
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,260
Who is Elder Yueming?

287
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,300
A senior.

288
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:18,770
Maybe only he can cure An Jingzhao's injury.

289
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:20,680
Okay.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,930
As long as there's hope, it'll be fine.

291
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,490
How about this?

292
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,910
I'll go prepare some food at once

293
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,839
in case the young lord should eat something after he wakes up suddenly.

294
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,400
You love Jingzhao so much.

295
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,790
Why did you say that you didn't love him?

296
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,320
Why did you break his heart?

297
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,310
I...

298
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,070
No need to explain.

299
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,220
Since you can sacrifice your life to protect Jingzhao,

300
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,480
it's impossible that you don't love him.

301
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,740
Don't tell me that you have your reasons.

302
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:50,420
If two people love each other, no matter what difficulty they meet,

303
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,850
they should be honest with each other,

304
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,050
and face it together.

305
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,920
I always thought that

306
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,000
my conditions were so good that

307
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,690
I could definitely defeat you.

308
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,890
But after these days,

309
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,520
I've found that Jingzhao and you

310
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,610
truly love each other.

311
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,990
He only loves you.

312
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,320
So no matter how hard I try, it'll be useless.

313
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,620
Love can't be forced.

314
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,790
Just as Li Chuyang said,

315
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,780
love is only meaningful when two people love each other.

316
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,380
So I've decided to give up my love for Jingzhao.

317
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,260
In the future, I'll also find a husband

318
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,390
whom I love and who loves me.

319
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,980
Thank you.

320
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,720
Bai Zhi.

321
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,820
Li Chuyue!

322
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,910
Have you forgotten your brother?

323
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,540
Chuyang.

324
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,570
Are you okay?

325
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,700
Are you hurt?

326
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:52,790
I'm fine.

327
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,040
Thanks to this valiant gentleman, Li Qing,

328
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,470
I was brought back by him.

329
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,400
Thank you.

330
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,180
Young Madam, you're welcome.

331
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,260
This is my duty.

332
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,140
How is my brother-in-law?

333
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,090
Father, I've heard that you're not willing to take the medicine.

334
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,510
I'll feed you myself.

335
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,250
Get out!

336
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,300
It's okay for you to be angry with me.

337
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,460
But my elder brother is gone.

338
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,960
If we don't get along,

339
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm afraid the villa will be in chaos.

340
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,300
It's all your fault.

341
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:13,590
You framed your brother in order to take up the post of Young Lord.

342
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,460
Unfilial son!

343
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,210
I advise you not to worry about other things.

344
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,890
If you want to seize the power,

345
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,140
you should announce that I'll be the young lord as soon as possible

346
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,190
so that every Chief of Hall can show allegiance to me.

347
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,340
No way!

348
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:34,140
Father, you're a man of foresight.

349
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,630
You must know that

350
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:37,690
now,

351
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,060
you have no choice but to

352
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,380
announce that I'll be the heir.

353
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,220
I used to think you were weak and useless.

354
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,430
I was so blind.

355
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,790
It's all thanks to your education.

356
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,080
So you've agreed?

357
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,830
Father, please take your medicine on time,

358
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,030
and take good care of yourself.

359
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,990
I'll invite you to the next meeting personally.

360
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,520
An Jingzhao.

361
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,800
How are you feeling?

362
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,120
Why did you come back?

363
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,610
Of course I had to come back.

364
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,820
What I said previously was fake.

365
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,640
I said that

366
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:45,660
because we're from two different worlds.

367
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,940
If you stay with me,

368
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,860
you'll experience a counter effect.

369
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,120
That's why your health is getting worse,

370
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,510
and you get hurt easily.

371
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,240
Who told you that?

372
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,180
When you were injured,

373
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,080
I went to the temple to pray for you.

374
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,680
A Buddhist priest said that.

375
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,440
Although what he said was profound and mysterious,

376
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,700
we are from two different worlds indeed.

377
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,330
If you keep travelling between these two worlds,

378
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,390
your health will get worse and worse.

379
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,290
Who are you?

380
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,320
Brat.

381
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,950
-Hand over the Yueming Sword to me now!
-Sir.

382
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,710
Who are you?

383
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:19,910
Why are you here?

384
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,900
Don’t break into the young lord’s room.

385
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,420
Sir.

386
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,370
Why are you here?

387
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,520
How come I'm here?

388
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,590
It took me a while to find you.

389
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
So you've been following me.

390
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,800
He's the old man

391
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,250
who kept pestering me at the door of our house.

392
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,780
He kept saying that the sword belonged to him.

393
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:38,030
Hand over the Yueming Sword to me now!

394
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,220
Are you Elder Yueming?

395
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:41,350
Yes, I am.

396
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,740
Don't call me Elder.

397
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,780
It sounds like I'm quite old.

398
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,830
Call me Yueming.

399
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,590
Cut the crap!

400
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,240
Hand over the Yueming Sword to me now!

401
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,320
The Yueming Sword belongs to you after all.

402
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,130
I'll definitely return it to you.

403
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:57,640
Sir,

404
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,080
he got hurt because of the Art of Starshift.

405
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,410
Please cure his injury.

406
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,020
He's dying.

407
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,300
I can't cure him.

408
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,260
Sir.

409
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,350
-Sir.
-Please save him.

410
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,470
I'll do anything.

411
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,040
You'll do anything.

412
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,180
Now,

413
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,010
only the orchids from the Luofu Mountain

414
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:27,140
can cure him.

415
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,850
How about this?

416
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,860
You guys should go to a place with me.

417
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:32,780
Let's go.

418
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,100
I have another question for you.

419
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,660
Li Qing.

420
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,210
You should go back first.

421
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:47,250
Protect my father and grandmother secretly.

422
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,660
Make sure that they are safe.

423
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,280
Yes.

424
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,060
Chuyue and Donghua are here.

425
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,860
I'll be fine.

426
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,930
Young Lord, take care.

427
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,220
Donghua.

428
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,230
Where's Bai Zhi?

429
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,210
She asked me to tell you both that

430
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,730
she went back to the Fengnuan Pavilion first

431
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,790
in order to study the prescription that can cure the young lord's injury.

432
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:16,980
How about this?

433
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,640
Young Lord.

434
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,430
Young Madam.

435
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:20,300
Let's pack up and leave at once.

436
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,450
Let's go if you feel better.

437
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,000
Come on.

438
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,020
Be careful.

439
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:30,880
Be careful.

440
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,790
Be careful, Young Lord.

441
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,880
Be careful.

442
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:37,830
Come on.

443
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:42,990
Be careful.

444
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:51,130
[Zhuyin Pavilion]

445
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:08,780
After we searched so many places,

446
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,640
there was no trace of An Jingzhao.

447
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,540
Young Master.

448
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,380
An Jingling has sent someone to look for him.

449
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,380
He's the one who knows An Jingzhao the best.

450
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,980
He should be able to find him.

451
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,070
Let's wait for the news patiently.

452
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,410
That's the only way.

453
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,490
Where are the others?

454
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,110
All the members of the martial arts world have left.

455
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:26,090
Master Xuanfeng's corpse will be escorted by his disciples.

456
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,290
They're leaving now.

457
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:28,960
Send more men

458
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,760
to escort Master Xuanfeng back with them.

459
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,690
Don't slack off.

460
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,380
Yes!

461
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,940
Sir.

462
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,340
Sir.

463
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,400
How was it?

464
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,860
I've collected the orchid.

465
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,390
But it grew at the peak of the mountain.

466
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,170
It's cold in nature.

467
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,620
It can't be used directly.

468
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,830
We need to reduce its coldness.

469
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,660
How about boiling it with water?

470
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,220
No.

471
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,610
If the fire is too strong,

472
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,210
it will completely remove the orchid's medicinal properties.

473
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,210
You once said that

474
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,340
you would do anything

475
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,010
in order to save him.

476
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,320
The only way now

477
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,380
is to expel the coldness with body temperature.

478
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,640
For those who have internal force,

479
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,850
without many years of practice to control it,

480
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,230
during the process of expelling the coldness,

481
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,170
if the power of fire is too strong,

482
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,480
it'll damage the orchid.

483
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,250
That's why Donghua can't do it.

484
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,810
Only you can do it.

485
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:30,040
But you don't have any internal force.

486
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,090
Once the coldness infiltrates into your body,

487
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,890
you can still live for 20 years if it's not serious,

488
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,990
but if it's serious, you can't live for over a year.

489
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,450
Have you made up your mind?

490
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,200
In order to save me, Jingzhao almost lost his life.

491
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,820
So what even if my life would be several dozens years shorter?

492
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,700
Even if...

493
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:01,770
♫When the pointer of destiny♫

494
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,750
Even if I can't survive this year,

495
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,700
as long as I'm with him,

496
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,180
♫Stopped at the time when we met♫

497
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,110

498

♫When you turned around, I was so worried that I didn't know what to do♫

499
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,000
Besides,

500
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,470
my man is so powerful

501
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,040
♫I felt frustrated uncontrollably♫

502
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,990
He'll definitely have a way to save me.

503
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,410
♫When the revolving door of space-time♫

504
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,850
♫Turned to the person I was destined to meet♫

Chuyue.

511
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,340
I'll marry you.

512
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:48,000
♫My regret has not subsided♫

♫With the distance that is beyond my reach♫

520
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,130
An Jingzhao!

521

I wanted to give you a massage,

522
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,550
but you didn't let me get close to you.

523
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:21,020
You even wanted to take advantage of me?

524
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,190
We are not a real married couple anyway.

525
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,940
♫My regret has not subsided♫

526
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,890
I'm not the real Han Wanqing, either.

We can't be together

528
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,880
♫But I've hidden into my memories♫

529
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,100
Yes.

You are not the real Han Wanqing indeed.

531
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,060
♫I'm feeling your breath♫

532
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,100

Chuyue.

534
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,000

♫I'll wait for you at the border of space-time♫

536

00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,660
I'll go back with you

538
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,740
to live in your world?

539
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,140
Elder Yueming.

540
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,500
Chuyue.

541
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:05,830
Sir.

542
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,750
The medicine is ready.

543
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,010
-Feed it to him.
-Okay.

544
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:22,560
The primordial energy inside his body

545
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,100
is temporarily stable.

546
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:27,650
He will wake up soon.

547
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,450
Thank you, sir.

548
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,020
That's great.

549
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,940
I have to go.

550
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,140
My sister and brother-in-law are so deeply in love.

551
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,220
The young lord loves the young madam very much.

552
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,510
He always cares about her.

553
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,970
But the young madam hurt the young lord's feelings repeatedly.

554
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,550
Hasn't my sister explained that

555
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,710
as the energy of these two worlds is different,

556
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:06,090
and she was worried that it would hurt my brother-in-law,

557
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:08,290
she had no choice but to say those words?

558
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,630
But will traveling between these two worlds

559
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,760
have any influence?

560
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,540
I took a photo of the meteorite.

561
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,200
Let's see if there's any clue.

562
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,380
Sister!

563
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,260
Sister.

564
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:28,770
Look.

565
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,110
Come on.

566
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:33,990
Look.

567
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,940
There's a crack on both stones.

568
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,370
This is the photo I took

569
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,730
in order to show off to my classmates.

570
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,970
This is the photo of the Huaxi Stone on my brother-in-law's bed,

571
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,940
and I took this photo after I came back this time.

572
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,370
Look.

573
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,130
There's a crack on both stones.

574
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,440
Really?

575
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:50,920
When I saw the meteorite for the first time,

576
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,250
there was no crack on it.

577
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,620
Sister.

578
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,270
Look.

579
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,420
There is a crack both on the Huaxi Stone and on your meteorite.

580
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,930
But it seems that the crack on the Huaxi Stone is new,

581
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,330
and it has become bigger.

582
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,780
In other words,

583
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,860
every time we travel,

584
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,700
there will be a crack on the meteorite.

585
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,180
The more times we travel,

586
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:13,110
the bigger the crack will be.

587
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:13,790
Yes.

588
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,190
So travelling between these two worlds

589
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,990
won't cause any counter effect.

590
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:18,850
Look.

591
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,060
Both of us are fine.

592
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,890
My brother-in-law was injured just because of objective reasons,

593
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,550
not due to the reason that you two were together.

594
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,510
So, maybe there's a limit to the number of times for traveling between these two worlds,

595
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:32,010
but there won't be any counter effect, right?

596
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,400
Yes.

597
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,790
An Jingzhao!

598
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,610
An Jingzhao!

599
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,410
You’re awake.

600
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,070
Young Lord!

601
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,930
I heard what you said.

602
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,200
An Jingzhao.

603
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:48,190
We will never have to be apart this time.

604
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,190
But you said something so hurtful to me before.

605
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:57,130
I'm angry.

606
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,260
And my anger won't be quelled for a period of time.

607
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,440
Young Master.

608
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,280
Let's go inside to take a look.

609
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,610
Young Master.

610
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,810
This jade pendant...

611
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,420
It's my elder brother's jade pendant.

612
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,680
Search the surroundings immediately.

613
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,090
Yes.

614
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,530
Sir.

615
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,139
Why did you come out?

616
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,219
An Jingzhao is asleep.

617
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,830
I don't want to disturb him.

618
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,900
Sir.

619
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,449
Where is this place?

620
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,860
Why are there so many things?

621
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,600
You used to live here?

622
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,480
As Yunyun was injured by the Art of Starshift,

623
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,960
I came to collect orchids

624
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,400
to cure her injury.

625
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,920
Yunyun?

626
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,190
Yunyun was my wife.

627
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,490
Back then,

628
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,480
the head of our sect killed innocent people with the Art of Starshift unscrupulously.

629
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,870
As the Left Custodian, my wife

630
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,650
tried to persuade the head of our sect.

631
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:17,130
I didn’t expect that the head of our sect would

632
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:20,430
hurt Yunyun with the Art of Starshift because of anger.

633
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,810
There was no way to cure the injury caused by the Art of Starshift.

634
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:27,660
Therefore,

635
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:31,970
I took Yunyun to search for medicine everywhere.

636
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,090
After many twists and turns,

637
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:37,970
I learnt that the orchids on the Luofu Mountain

638
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,350
had the effect of curing this injury.

639
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:42,870
We only used several courses of treatment.

640
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,190
Yunyun’s internal injury

641
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,140
was healing.

642
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,220
Unfortunately, the treatment was delayed for too long.

643
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,150
Yunyun didn't survive in the end.

644
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm sorry.

645
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,620
It doesn’t matter.

646
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,100
Yunyun wouldn't mind my talking about these things.

647
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,770
She was a cheerful woman.

648
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,260
Even when she was sick,

649
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,970
she still smiled every day.

650
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,940
We traveled around the world,

651
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,720
tasted all the delicious food in the world,

652
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,630
and lived a wonderful life.

653
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,440
That’s why you hid the Art of Starshift later.

654
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:34,420
I wouldn't allow this evil martial arts skill

655
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:36,830
to appear in the martial arts world again.

656
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,290
How did you get to our place?

657
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,530
After I left the evil sect,

658
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,030
I was saved by Chief Shen.

659
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,420
Chief Shen was

660
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,970
the father of Yunwei Villa's Madam Shen.

661
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,550
One day,

662
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,320
I went to deliver something to Madam Shen on behalf of Chief Shen.

663
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,960
Coincidentally,

664
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,960
there was a stone which had fallen to the Yunwei Villa.

665
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,710
Everyone in the villa said that it was an auspicious sign.

666
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,180
I also wanted to see it out of curiosity.

667
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,750
It was late at night.

668
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,250
That stone was on the altar of the Lingxiao Yard.

669
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,670
It was raining, and there was thunder and lightning.

670
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,070
So no one was guarding it.

671
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,050
I only took a look.

672
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:28,450
Then I felt dizzy.

673
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,210
I was no longer in the villa,

674
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:34,420
and went to another world.

675
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:40,830
So the passageway between these two worlds was opened a long time ago.

676
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,770
I had been looking for a way to come back home

677
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,100
for more than 20 years.

678
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,650
Do you still want to go back to our place now?

679
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,930
Although there was food and drinks,

680
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,000
as well as novel things there,

681
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,860
I still wanted to come back to accompany Yunyun.

682
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,140
Sir.

683
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,050
Are these

684
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,870
the drugs you developed for your wife?

685
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:28,500
What?

686
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,950
You want to give them to your boyfriend?

687
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,030
No.

688
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:42,970
Sir.

689
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,730
I want to make the spicy hot pot.

690
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,990
Do you want to taste it?

691
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,870
You want to bribe me?

692
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,270
Sir.

693
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,760
I think you miss the food in our world, right?

694
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:12,870
It smells good.

695
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,470
This bottle of pills has the best effect.

696
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:30,780
Here you are.

697
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,780
Thank you, sir!

698
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,060
Come on, Young Lord.

699
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,990
Stand up slowly.

700
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,670
Young Lord.

701
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,610
Are you worried about His Lordship?

702
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,610
His Lordship is a highly respected man.

703
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:57,520
They won't do anything to him for the time being.

704
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,780
The old madam is smart.

705
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,310
She can definitely act according to the circumstances.

706
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,240
Besides, Li Qing

707
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,700
will surely protect His Lordship and the old madam well.

708
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,020
Now the most important thing

709
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,870
is that you should recover soon.

710
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Donghua is right.

711
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,780
The most important thing for you now is to recover.

712
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,980
Don't think too much.

713
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,680
It will affect your recovery.

714
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,760
I've asked Elder Yueming for some pills.

715
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,220
They can stabilize your primordial energy.

716
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:21,870
Young Lord.

717
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,500
I have something to say.

718
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,520
Although the young madam has her reasons,

719
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,120
she was so ruthless a few days ago

720
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,820
and hurt your feelings so much.

721
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,340
This time, you can't forgive her just because of

722
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,870
a few nice words said by her.

723
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:36,140
I know.

724
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,330
You must control yourself.

725
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,240
Who told you to look at me like that?

726
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:04,920
Honey,

727
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,970
don't be angry.

728
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,600
Li Chuyue.

729
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:11,100
I've told you

730
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
my anger won't be quelled so easily.

731
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Stop being angry.

732
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,900
No way.

733
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:30,380
Look at who's in front of me.

734
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,090
It's a stylish man with a handsome face,

735
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,370
a muscular waist,

736
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,420
and a good body shape.

737
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,310
As long as I

738
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,930
take a look at this stylish man, I'll fall in love with him at once.

739
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,530
Who wants to be so close to you?

740
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,130
An Jingzhao.

741
00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:59,500
You're still holding a grudge.

742
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:04,760
Remember to take the medicine.
