00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,759
Zhao.

00:01:44,289 --> 00:01:44,850
Chuyue.

6
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,460
Come over here quickly.

7
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,380
Sit down.

8
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,539
Hottie,

9
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,830
where should I sit?

10
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,660
You...

11
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,680
Look what we've got today.

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,470
Chongyue Pavilion is under renovation,

13
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,730
and only this bench is available for now.

14
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,300
How about you sit with Zhao?

15
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,540
Come on.

16
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,300
Here.

17
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,130
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,820
No worries.

19
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,079
Let me help you with it.

20
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:30,880
Thank you.

21
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,400
I was too careless.

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,980
Never mind.

23
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,900
Here, take it.

24
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,760
Greetings, Madam.

25
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:02,980
Jingzhao.

26
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:04,810
Chuyue.

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,490
Bai Zhi.

28
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,040
Today, we're having a family feast to savour springtime and pray for blessings.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,660
It's inconvenient for an outsider to join us.

30
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,280
Madam.

31
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,350
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

32
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,570
It's just that I was so willful back then

33
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:23,130
that I took the liberty of fighting a duel with Chuyue

34
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,260
and frightened her.

35
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,650
I feel guilty about it.

36
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,250
So I came here today

37
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,390
to apologize to Chuyue.

38
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,870
Chuyue,

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,110
it was my fault that day.

40
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,450
I shouldn't have fought with you

41
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,450
and startled you.

42
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,530
I'll now make a toast to you as a token of apology.

43
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,690
Here.

44
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,500
Come with me.

45
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,980
Miss,

46
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,850
do you take a liking to An Jingzhao?

47
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,770
Don't deny it.

48
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,060
Girls feel girls.

49
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,310
To be honest,

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,250
I don't like An Jingzhao at all.

51
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,440
Soon,

52
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,700
I will leave here.

53
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,910
So you don't have to pick on me.

54
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,630
I can even set you up.

55
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:19,959
Really?

56
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,950
Yes.

57
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,740
I, Li Chuyue, am a man of my word.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,860
With me being here,

59
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,310
An Jingzhao will fall in love with you soon.

60
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,300
Then you will get married shortly.

61
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,620
And you will soon become Young Madam.

62
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,330
How about this?

63
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,720
You take a sip of the wine,

64
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,820
and I'll make a toast to An Jingzhao later.

65
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:42,490
In this way, you'll be kissing indirectly.

66
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,530
Wait here.

67
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,440
Young Lord,

68
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,090
thank you for helping me draw the Talisman of Cure today.

69
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:00,950
Here's to you.

70
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,900
I don't drink from the same cup as her.

71
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:30,930
Oh no.

72
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,090
Jingzhao drank the wrong cup.

73
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:32,760
Jingzhao,

74
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,330
may I have a word with you?

75
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,930
There's no outsiders here.

76
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,110
Just talk here.

77
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:47,990
Zhao.

78
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,200
Follow me.

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:49,990
Zhao.

80
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,880
Zhao.

[Black Eagle Hall]

82
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,250
Master.

83
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,240
We can't wait any longer.

84
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,440
In a few days,

85
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,620
the wedding will be held.

86
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,950
It's the finest hour for us to take action.

87
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,410
What's your plan?

88
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:22,340
Master,

89
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,850
how about this?

90
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,740
In a few days, the wedding will be held.

91
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,570
Many people will attend, and the scene will be chaotic.

92
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,030
We can send some assassins

93
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,350
to disguise as people from the Beiming Sect

94
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,930
to assassinate An Jingzhao.

95
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:35,470
Firstly,

96
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,640
it's easier for us to take cover in a crowd.

97
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,240
Secondly,

98
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:41,120
An Jingzhao will surely be defenceless.

99
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,030
By then,

100
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,920
we can get rid of him

101
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,060
and that woman.

102
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,220
Assassins?

103
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,510
They can't defeat An Jingzhao.

104
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,130
To deal with him,

105
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,890
we have to take him unawares

106
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,290
and strike a deadly blow.

107
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,200
Oh no.

108
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,350
The two cups of wine were swapped by mistake.

109
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,140
I am the one who got poisoned.

110
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,960
I have to go back immediately and take the antidote.

111
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,390
Jingzhao,

112
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:16,940
I'm not feeling well.

113
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,270
Let's talk another day.

114
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:27,990
Dongyue.

115
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,480
They are having a private conversation.

116
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,630
Yet Hottie asked me to join in.

117
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:51,930
An Jingzhao.

118
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,730
Li Chuyue, what are you doing here?

119
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,340
Get out.

120
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,430
What's wrong with you?

121
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,360
Where's Bai Zhi?

122
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:03,700
What's going on?

123
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,460
Stand right there.

124
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,390
Don't come over.

125
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,350
Don't come near me.

127
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,170
An Jingzhao.

128
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,260
An Jingzhao, what's wrong?

129
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,280
Based on my experience in watching dramas...

130
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
You took something, didn't you?

131
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,120
Did you take the wrong medicine?

132
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,429
Stop talking nonsense.

133
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,460
I said get out!

134
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,799
Leave now!

135
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,950
You're getting hot under the collar.

136
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,850
Don't tell me you took that one!

137
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,140
Stay away from me. Don't come nearer.

138
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,870
An Jingzhao.

139
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,650
An Jingzhao.

140
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,750
An Jingzhao.

141
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,590
I told you to get out.

142
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,680
Go!

143
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,510
Fine...

144
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,460
Based on my experience in watching dramas,

145
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,260
you did take the wrong medicine.

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,620
Why is the door locked?

147
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,660
Is anyone outside?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,930
What's going on?

149
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,770
I can't.

150
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,530
Bro!

151
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:34,130
Put me down!

152
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,060
Bro!

153
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:51,260
Master.

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,630
Bingqin is back.

155
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:54,870
Master.

156
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,340
Bingqin has cultivated the 10th-level inner power of the Tianxuan Heart Sutra.

157
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,270
With her around,

158
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:03,730
An Jingzhao will surely be killed with one fatal move.

159
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,210
No.

160
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:10,140
An Jingzhao made a diversion

161
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,070
to fool me.

162
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,300
I will also

163
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,640
give him a taste of his own medicine.

164
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,580
Master is wise.

165
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,460
Dying in the bridal chamber

166
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,980
will be a big gift

167
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,420
I prepare for An Jingzhao.

168
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,810
Master,

169
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,030
I have something that came to my mind.

170
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,960
An Jingzhao's bridal chamber is not in Lingxiao Yard

171
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:48,420
but

172
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,670
where his mother prepared for him,

173
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,010
Hese Pavilion.

174
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,490
Hese Pavilion?

175
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,330
[Yunwei Villa]

176
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,020
On such an auspicious occasion,

177
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:09,710
the wind is mild and the sun is bright.

178
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,020
The happily married couple

179
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,030
is a perfect match.

180
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,430
May happiness be with you today and always,

181
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,430
like lovebirds in the sky.

182
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,930
On the wedding night,

183
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,770
pleasure permeates the entire household.

184
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,320
Okay.

185
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,370
How could the prestigious Yunwei Villa

186
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,300
take such a rude woman as the bride?

187
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,410
It's my fault.

188
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,110
I was negligent in my daily life

189
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,910
and failed to teach her manners.

190
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
You are a little mean

191
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:27,460
but full of masculine charms.

192
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,930
If a girl marries you in the future, that's not bad.

193
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,590
What's your standard for choosing a partner?

194
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,620
In other words,

195
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,370
what kind of wife do you want to marry?

196
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,770
She should be a short one,

197
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,150
right up to my shoulder.

198
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,830
In terms of appearance,

199
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,780
she's not even close to being beautiful.

200
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,870
They're married now.

201
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,090
She's not a gentlewoman.

202
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,890
And she has no manners.

203
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,860
Your criteria for choosing a partner is so odd.

204
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,620
Are you blind?

205
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,100
Yes.

206
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,650
I'm blind.

207
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:54,060
The red decorations cast a glow in the hall,

208
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,550
and we send our best wishes through the wedding song.

209
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,680
The auspicious time has come.

210
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,010
-Could you please behave yourself?
-Bow.

211
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,650
First, bow to heaven and earth.

212
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:10,940
Come here.

213
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:20,820
Second, bow to your parents.

214
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,050
Bow.

215
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,880
The bride and groom bow to each other.

216
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,020
Can you be serious?

217
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:40,980
It's just a show.

218
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,650
What are you so serious about?

219
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,240
Protect Young Lord.

220
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,270
Don't be afraid.

221
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,830
Just a few small potatoes.

222
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,060
Everyone,

223
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,090
don't panic.

224
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,680
It's just a few remnants from Beiming.

225
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,010
The wedding continues.

226
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,630
Please return to your seats.

227
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,770
How could you lift it up

228
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,830
before you're in the bridal chamber?

229
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,300
I'm sure I can go back this time.

230
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,760
I surely can make it to registration in time.

231
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,690
Go back.

232
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:04,780
Oh no.

233
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,890
It's all over this time.

234
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,470
Li Chuyue.

235
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,350
Keep your chin up.

236
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,740
There must be a way to go back.

237
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,710
Don't be so discouraged.

238
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,220
Thank you.

239
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,760
Enjoy yourselves.

240
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,130
I wish you live happily ever after

241
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,260
and have a baby soon.

242
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,830
Ling.

243
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:47,300
Chiefs.

244
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:50,830
Here.

245
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,250
Thank you.

246
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,000
[Hese Pavilion]

247
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:35,430
You...

248
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:28,710
Father.

249
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:29,850
Grandmother.

250
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,970
Today is my wedding day.

251
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,940
Let me propose a toast to you.

252
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,570
Sure.

253
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,730
Pour me more.

254
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,430
Young Lord.

255
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,410
Congratulations on your marriage, Young Lord.

256
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,500
Although

257
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,990
it's Thousand Cups from Fengnuan Pavilion,

258
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,780
I think there's also

259
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:01,490
Cold Lake from Yunwei Villa in the wine pot.

260
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,040
No amount of masking

261
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,740
can hide the rich aroma of Cold Lake.

262
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:12,580
Am I right?

263
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,310
Second Lord.

264
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,090
Young Lord.

265
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:22,410
Whether it's Thousand Cups or Cold Lake,

266
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,260
they're both great wines.

267
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,500
A fine wine should be toasted to a perfect match.

268
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,610
Right?

269
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,530
Yes.

270
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,730
Yes.

271
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,050
Everyone, please have a seat

272
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:34,740
and continue drinking.

273
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,290
Sure.

274
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:38,720
Sit.

275
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,660
Everyone, please continue drinking.

276
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,530
Sure.

277
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:49,580
Here.

278
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,270
There is also Bamboo-leaf Green in the wine.

279
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,070
I'm afraid you'll only taste it after a while.

280
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,020
Why are you here?

281
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,250
The guards have besieged here.

282
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,280
You can hardly escape now.

283
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,610
If you reveal the conspiracy to the Lord,

284
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,770
the Young Lord will surely spare your life.

285
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,720
Tianxuan Heart Sutra?

286
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:54,200
How do you know how to use it?

287
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:42,930
Do... Do you want to get to bed early?

288
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,640
Young Lord.

289
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,300
Young Lord.

290
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,100
You are hurt?

291
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,170
Young Lord.

292
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,700
Bingqin...

293
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,650
has cultivated the Tianxuan Heart Sutra.

294
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,300
It seems that when we wiped out the evil sect,

295
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,760
Yuan Shu had already copied the Heart Sutra.

296
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,190
We must find out

297
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,140
what else Yuan Shu has done.

298
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,050
Yes.

299
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:40,260
I can't believe she cultivated the 10th level directly.

300
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,620
That's reckless.

301
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:45,730
It seems that Zhou Wei has taken another action.

302
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:47,950
Do you still remember the mantra I taught you?

303
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,350
Go back and cultivate it.

304
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,110
It can help with your recovery.

305
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,190
I remember.

306
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,660
Don't worry, Young Lord.

307
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,660
I'll heal myself.

308
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,580
I wonder how Li Qing is doing.

309
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,390
I've taken care of it.

310
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,720
I sprinkled enough powder on my body.

311
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,500
The assassins' feet

312
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,210
must have got a lot of it on them.

313
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,760
According to the traces of the powder,

314
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,020
Li Qing should be able to find their base.

315
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,430
Young Lord's plan

316
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,620
will surely catch Zhou Wei off guard.

317
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:06,730
Master.

318
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:10,290
All the men we sent are dead.

319
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,870
No one survived.

320
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:18,090
I knew it. You're just a bunch of losers.

321
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,020
Search carefully

322
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,540
and see if they have any clues on them.

323
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:45,980
Yes.

324
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,510
How is it?

325
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,320
It's neat,

326
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,590
leaving no traces.

327
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,230
Let's go.

328
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,740
A wound caused by a sword?

329
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,170
The swordsmanship is amazing.

330
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
Only Li Qing in the Yuwei Hall

331
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,150
can do this.

332
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,790
Find out the source of this fabric.

333
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,230
Don't let any clues go.

334
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,150
Yes.

335
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,330
How are you?

336
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,270
Are you okay?

337
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:51,970
I-I think we haven't had...

338
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,340
the Hejin wine?

339
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,030
What other customs do you have?

340
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,230
I want to try them all.

341
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:57,940
When I go back,

342
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,910
I can brag to my parents and Yang.

343
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,580
Fine.

344
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,860
Since you want to experience everything,

345
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,460
I'll let you try everything.

346
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,700
The consummation is also included.

347
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,190
No way.

348
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,190
You can't do this.

349
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,320
We're having a fake marriage.

350
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:48,950
Besides,

351
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,300
I'm into my Prince Charming, Gu Qingfeng.

352
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,150
I can't let my Prince Charming down.

353
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:53,650
Right?

354
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,340
What's so good about him?

355
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,650
He is the Prince Charming of our Design Department.

356
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,410
He's well-built

357
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:01,970
and handsome.

358
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:04,630
Above all, he is talented at designing clothes.

359
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,440
Don't you want to drink the Hejin wine?

360
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,850
I'm back.

361
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,880
I'm finally back.

362
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,860
I told you

363
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,740
I'm from another world.

364
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,620
I'm not an assassin.

365
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,150
Now you know that it's true.

366
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,960
Where are we?

367
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,330
This is my hometown.

368
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,490
So I can hear the sound coming from here.

369
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,080
Things from your bedroom

370
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,190
fall into mine.

371
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,570
So I actually heard you talk.

372
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,500
It was not from the game at all.

373
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,860
Could it be...

374
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,360
we can talk to each other in different rooms?

375
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,460
In that case,

376
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,600
I don't know why

377
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,290
there's a passage

378
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,100
between your bedroom

379
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,090
and mine.

380
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,180
Moreover, the bed

381
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,010
may be the passage.

382
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,770
Then why is there a passage?

383
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,160
Why would it connect the two worlds?

384
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,160
What's the mechanism?

385
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,960
How could I have forgotten the computer?

386
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,520
Wormhole?

387
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,110
Is it really because of the wormhole?

388
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,490
Multiverse?

389
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,910
Multiverse usually refers to the idea

390
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,700
that beyond the observable universe,

391
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,830
other universes that are similar to it

392
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,230
may exist as well.

393
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,150
Perhaps it's the wormhole

394
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,570
that opens the passageway between the two worlds.

395
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,350
I can't clarify it

396
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,980
with my flimsy scientific theory.

397
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,140
But

398
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,900
when we kissed,

399
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,190
we travelled from your bedroom to mine.

400
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,200
Don't tell me kissing can open

401
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,400
the passageway between the two worlds.

402
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:42,090
That's not right.

403
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,430
The first time I went there,

404
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,110
I was sleeping well alone.

405
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:48,930
Oh yeah.

406
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,310
The registration.

407
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,820
Sign-up...

408
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,460
[Emerging Fashion Design Competition]

409
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,460
[Sorry, the registration is over]

410
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,300
It's been seven days in Shangyu.

411
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,720
Seven days have passed here as well.

412
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,300
So the two worlds have the same time.

413
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,710
We can only think of another way.

414
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:16,670
Dad.

415
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,170
Mum.

416
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,300
Go and cook.

417
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm hungry.

418
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,260
Yang.

419
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,370
What are you doing? Sit down.

420
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,630
-Sit properly.
-What are you doing?

421
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,490
Don't come out.

422
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,610
Cover yourself.

423
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:29,730
Li Chuyue, did you purposely...

424
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,110
-W-What happened to you?
-Yang!

425
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,080
I miss you so much, Yang.

426
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:37,910
Yang,

427
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,050
I thought I would never see you again.

428
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,480
What's wrong with you?

429
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,620
You always say you get annoyed when you see me.

430
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,310
We haven't seen each other for a few days.

431
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,740
Yet you are cuddling me now.

432
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,740
Let go of me first.

433
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,240
Let go.

434
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:53,140
But I can also ask for money for the cuddle.

435
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,440
No problem.

436
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:55,890
By the way,

437
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:58,020
why did you send me a message on WeChat?

438
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,740
I just want some pocket money from you.

439
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:01,730
No problem.

440
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,260
Here.

441
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:09,570
Take it.

442
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:18,570
Y-You're dressed like this too?

443
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,790
Don't tell me you two...

444
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:21,310
Him?

445
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,989
He's an extra for a commercial

446
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:24,020
for our company.

447
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,429
Advertise.

448
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,780
An extra?

449
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,820
Dad!

450
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,469
Mum!

451
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,320
My sister brought a man home.

452
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:34,170
Dad and Mum are here too?

453
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,070
A love rat?

454
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,060
What? What love rat?

455
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,659
A love rat?

456
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,929
Where is the love rat?

457
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,880
Love rat! Move!

458
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,800
Dad, Mum.

459
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,739
-You brat.
-I miss you so much.

460
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:41,940
What are you wearing?

461
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:43,750
Wait.

462
00:34:43,770 --> 00:34:44,440
Wait.

463
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:45,679
The love rat.

464
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:46,420
The...

465
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:47,780
Young man,

466
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,020
what's your name?

467
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,199
Where are you from?

468
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,120
What do you do?

469
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:54,130
I am...

470
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,690
Shut up.

471
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,610
Him?

472
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,720
We were discussing work.

473
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,540
He is a model hired by our company

474
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,540
for a commercial.

475
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,110
Don't listen to Chuyang's nonsense.

476
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,510
Model?

477
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,120
Dad, Mum.

478
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,160
Why are you here?

479
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,790
Are you going back today?

480
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,300
We haven't seen her for days.

481
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,890
Is she in a relationship?

482
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,100
We have to size him up.

483
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:19,740
No.

484
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,580
We'll stay for the night.

485
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,800
Okay.

486
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,780
This model,

487
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,860
I'm in the middle of cooking.

488
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,860
Tell me what you'd like to eat.

489
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,550
Yes.

490
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,540
Whether it's Sichuan, Hunan, Shandong or Cantonese cuisine, choose whatever you like.

491
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,300
Dad, Mum.

492
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,020
He's a guest. Don't scare him away.

493
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,150
Let's talk outside.

494
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:35,810
Come on.

495
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,360
You're right.

496
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,660
Let's cook first.

497
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,570
Help yourselves.

498
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:40,260
Hurry up.

499
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,590
Let's go.

500
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,300
Go. Hold on.

501
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:42,830
Hurry up.

502
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,340
Are you going to leave him here just like that?

503
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,180
What love rat?

504
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,190
Hurry up. Let's go.

505
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:46,790
A love rat.

506
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,120
I don't have any nice clothes for you.

507
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,650
Where's my phone?

508
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,700
Where is it?

509
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,580
What kind of sleeping gas is this?

510
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,300
Oh no.

511
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,690
If Zhou Meizi knew I was absent,

512
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,690
she would kill me.

513
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,560
Answer me.

514
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,090
Yes.

515
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:55,970
It's sleeping gas.

516
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,740
But I

517
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,630
took the antidote in advance.

518
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,370
It's very effective.

519
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:03,710
The inhaler will lose his consciousness immediately.

520
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,180
Why are you doing this to me?

521
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,150
What do you want?

522
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:08,420
What else could it be?

523
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,690
You're so young and good-looking.

524
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:12,450
So I want to do something bad.

525
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,410
Just kidding.

526
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,670
You took it seriously?

527
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,350
That's called a humidifier.

528
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:19,380
If you put water inside,

529
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,020
water will become steam

530
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,980
and make the air less dry.

531
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,590
How should I put it?

532
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,190
Our technology

533
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,280
is more advanced.

534
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,440
Many things don't involve manual labour anymore.

535
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,170
For example, music doesn't need live accompaniments.

536
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,970
You can play it after recording.

537
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,460
Xiaodu.

538
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:38,960
Play "Baby" by Justin Bieber.

539
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,340
Do you hear it?

540
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,690
This is the song I sang that day.

541
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,030
Xiaodu.

542
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,880
Play "The Ordinary Road."

543
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,800
This is my Prince Charming's favourite song.

544
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:57,050
Play another one.

545
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:06,420
This song is not bad.

546
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,770
It does suit your temperament.

547
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,290
Then what is this?

548
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,130
This

549
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,920
is called a computer.

550
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:27,270
It connects to the Internet to look up information.

551
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:28,840
You can browse websites

552
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,040
and read information around the world.

553
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,750
It's the same as spreading the news

554
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,960
about what happened to the sects

555
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,410
immediately to the others in your world.

556
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,060
You can also watch movies and dramas.

557
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,700
Look.

558
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,160
Be careful.

559
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:56,990
That's fake.

560
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,270
Don't worry.

561
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,790
That's the screen.

562
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,850
Time to eat.

563
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,390
Go on.

564
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,320
Li Chuyang.

565
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,450
Hurry up and get changed.

566
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,090
I won't change into

567
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,340
these fancy clothes.

568
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,570
You are the Young Lord.

569
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,430
It's your call.

570
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,550
Remember to tie your hair.

571
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,020
It's a drama.
