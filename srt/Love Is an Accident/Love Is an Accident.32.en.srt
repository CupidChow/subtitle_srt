00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,380
want to earn this place every year.

193
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,440
We really have tried our best to help you keep the place.

194
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,850
Sorry for the trouble.

195
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,030
Brand establishment of independent designers

196
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,090
is indeed not easy.

197
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,060
More importantly, the collaboration with Paris

198
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,470
is a rare opportunity.

199
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,470
But

200
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,080
if you keep delaying it like this,

201
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,280
I'm afraid your reputation gained in the past year

202
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,320
will be ruined.

203
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,870
By that time, I'm afraid...

204
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,060
Miss Li?

205
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,340
I'm sorry. I have something urgent to do. I have to go now.

206
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,990
Sorry.

207
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,130
Sir,

208
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,370
please drive fast.

209
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:13,980
Okay.

210
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,990
It's been a year.

211
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,810
I've never missed out on the moment when it started to thunder.

212
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,590
Why haven't I heard from you yet?

213
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,460
I know you're still there.

214
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,210
Chuyue.

215
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,860
An illusion again.

216
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,510
I can only see you

217
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,380
when I'm drunk.

218
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,950
An illusion again.

219
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:32,350
An illusion again.

220
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:44,700
Hello?

221
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:45,750
Miss Li,

222
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,740
through careful consideration,

223
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,400
we're very sorry to inform you

224
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,180
that we can't cooperate with you this time.

225
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,980
We look forward to cooperating with you next time.

226
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,110
That's good.

227
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,190
I shouldn't waste their time.

228
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:01,990
Right.

229
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,880
I almost forgot what Mom said.

230
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,740
Mom said

231
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,680
I have to take you out for a walk.

232
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,100
If I can't complete the mission,

233
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,350
she'll deduct my living expenses.

234
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,360
Then let's go camping in the suburbs.

235
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,470
Okay.

236
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,100
Sister, give me a hand.

237
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,610
Help me pull that side.

238
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,859
An Jingzhao.

239
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,660
Is this really you?

240
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,390
An Jingzhao.

241
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:38,440
An Jingzhao.

242
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,390
-An Jingzhao.
-Sister.

243
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,230
-An Jingzhao.
-Sister.

244
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,240
-Sister, what's wrong?
-An Jingzhao.

245
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,360
Sister.

246
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,880
Sister, what's wrong?

247
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,080
Sister.

248
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,230
Sister, are you okay?

249
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,410
She's fine.

250
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,790
She's just too tired.

251
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,790
She'll get better if she has a good rest

252
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,320
and gets enough nutrition.

253
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,860
She has been in poor condition recently.

254
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,570
She has been acting strange.

255
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,290
I'm worried that she'll fall apart

256
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,050
if this continues.

257
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,740
Judging from the current situation,

258
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,670
she doesn't have a mental problem.

259
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,530
You should persuade and accompany her more.

260
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,990
If she's still like this,

261
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,620
she should go see a psychiatrist.

262
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,420
I don't think it's a big problem.

263
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,550
Dad,

264
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,250
go back with Mom to rest.

265
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,260
The doctor said

266
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,920
she's okay.

267
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,920
I'll stay here to take care of her.

268
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:49,530
Okay.

269
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:51,970
Let's go.

270
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,250
Sister, you're awake.

271
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,140
Come on.

272
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,160
I saw your brother-in-law.

273
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:28,860
It's true.

274
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,140
Why don't you get more rest?

275
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,810
It's true.

276
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm clear-headed.

277
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,520
Actually, I saw someone for a moment.

278
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,240
But I was not sure it was him.

279
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,420
I thought

280
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,290
it was someone who looks like my brother-in-law.

281
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:47,310
After all,

282
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,470
he has already...

283
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,300
I'm 100% sure

284
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,570
that was him.

285
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,220
Have you

286
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,220
seen my brother-in-law anywhere else recently?

287
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,480
Except in your dreams.

288
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,950
At home that day.

289
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,370
But I drank wine.

290
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,850
I can't remember clearly.

291
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,060
Did you talk?

292
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,940
He never spoke.

293
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,870
Every time I touched him, he became air.

294
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,560
Just like when he disappeared that day.

295
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,920
He's transparent.

296
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,660
I know.

297
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,600
But you'd better not tell Mom and Dad this.

298
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,340
I don't think they can accept it.

299
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,380
You saw my brother-in-law

300
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,070
at home

301
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,930
and in the amusement park.

302
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,550
These places...

303
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,240
They are the places where we went together.

304
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,310
That means...

305
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,810
He'll appear at the places we've been to.

306
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:42,860
Sister.

307
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:43,910
Sister.

308
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,840
-You can't.
-Go away.

309
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
You're bleeding.

310
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:48,620
You...

311
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,410
Sister.

312
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,330
Why hasn't he appeared yet?

313
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,960
Yes. Brother-in-law.

314
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,230
The meat I grilled smells so good.

315
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:11,890
You won't be able to eat it if you don't come back.

316
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,420
I really saw him.

317
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,120
Is there something wrong with my mind?

318
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,180
Was it an illusion?

319
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,460
No.

320
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,510
I also believe my brother-in-law will come back.

321
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,240
Who is the first person you fell in love with?

322
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,950
You've drunk twice.

323
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,350
You can't drink anymore.

324
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:51,550
I want to know your answer now.

325
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,450
Of course I like you.

326
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,590
Li Chuyue was foolish enough

327
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,230
to make him sad.

328
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,150
Sister.

329
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,060
It's late.

330
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:16,220
Maybe he won't come today.

331
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,830
Let's go home first.

332
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:32,780
Sister, let's go.

333
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,260
If the brother-in-law we saw is real,

334
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,270
it could be a phenomenon

335
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,950
similar to refraction.

336
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,000
Refraction?

337
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,390
We live in a three-dimensional space.

338
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,460
The timeline can't be moved forward or backward.

339
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,220
But it's different in a space

340
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,460
above the three-dimensional space.

341
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,120
In that kind of space, time is like a progress bar.

342
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,180
You can choose time nodes as you like.

343
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,220
The brother-in-law we saw

344
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,220
should be in another space.

345
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,510
That's why we could only see him

346
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,570
but couldn't touch him or talk to him.

347
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,580
Does that mean

348
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,900
he's still alive,

349
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,670
but he's not in this space?

350
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,700
It's highly possible.

351
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,340
Although the theoretical knowledge

352
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,540
hasn't been verified yet,

353
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,860
it's science-based.

354
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,380
Is there any pattern

355
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,010
of when and where he appears?

356
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,380
Currently, the only explanation is

357
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,950
it depends on his choice.

358
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,110
Maybe he's also looking for a way to come back.

359
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,220
Judging from the current situation,

360
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,080
the space-time segments he chose

361
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,080
are the places you two have been to.

362
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,060
So he's still alive,

363
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,560
and he will come back one day, right?

364
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,190
I just remembered a lecture I went to before.

365
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,180
The professor said

366
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:00,090
if the space-time channel has been opened,

367
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,350
there must be other ways to open it again.

368
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,690
Thank you.

369
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,660
I finally see hope again.

370
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:14,990
Sister,

371
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,190
I think I should

372
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,150
tell you something.

373
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,150
Not long ago,

374
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,940
I received this letter.

375
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,380
You weren't in a good state that day.

376
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,900
I was afraid you would lose control after reading the letter.

377
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,910
So I didn't give you the letter.

378
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,190
I'm sorry.

[Jingzhao]

382
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,770
Let's write a letter to each other.

383
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:48,510
We can't tell each other

384
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,650
about the delivery date and the content of the letter.

385
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,650
What do you think?

386
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:51,850
Okay.

387
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,550
It sounds interesting.

388
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,660
We will deliver the letter to you

389
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,150
on the designated date.

390
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:04,390
Chuyue,

391
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,980
happy first anniversary.

392
00:25:08,430 --> 00:25:10,970
We must still be happy right now.

393
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,480
You must have held a brand exhibition as you wished.

394
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,170
Maybe we already have a child.

395
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,670
But these are not important.

396
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:22,230
My only wish and expectation

397
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,060
is to be with you forever.

398
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,890
I want to have every meal with you

399
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,230
and make you happy.

400
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,990
I wish my dream comes true.

401
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,060
Sister, don't be sad.

402
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,280
I believe

403
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,230
my brother-in-law will come back.

404
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,180
You're right.

405
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,980
I must take good care of myself

406
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,070
and put everything in order

407
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:01,070
to wait for An Jingzhao to come back.

408
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,070
Congratulations.

409
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,870
Congratulations.

410
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,180
Qing.

411
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:27,390
Sir.

412
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
It's lively outside. What's going on?

413
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,900
Donghua

414
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,050
is having a wedding ceremony.

415
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,670
Everyone went for the wedding cake

416
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,870
to get some good luck.

417
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,120
Well,

418
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,420
it's nothing new.

419
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:42,700
It's a wedding.

420
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,150
The three same old things.

421
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,130
I heard that the bride is average-looking.

422
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,160
It's boring.

423
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,950
Do you think

424
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,690
I will get married one day?

425
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,000
Actually, as long as you want,

426
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,380
there are many good girls.

427
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,040
Anytime...

428
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,680
They all think I'm a sinner

429
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,170
and don't want to marry me.

430
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,470
But I don't like those ordinary girls either.

431
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,740
You are right.

432
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,710
I was wrong.

433
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,470
But it's been a year.

434
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,820
It's time for Zhou Wei and Miss Chuyue to come back.

435
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,230
Why are you back?

436
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:04,980

439
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,390
Sir.

440
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,660
Sir, what happened?

441
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,860
Why are you sweating?

442
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,420
I saw An Jingzhao.

443
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,030
Young...

444
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,990
An Jingzhao is back?

445
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:19,470
It was a ghost.

446
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,980
It was a ghost.

447
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,270
Sir, did you have a dream?

448
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:23,970
No.

449
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,790
I saw him clearly.

450
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:30,690
That means An Jingzhao is dead.

451
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,460
Dead?

452
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,740
It's fine.

453
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,390
Zhou Wei finally succeeded?

454
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,110
Zhou Wei is about to bring Chuyue back.

455
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,730
Where is my meteorite?

456
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,890
Who stole my meteorite?

457
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,070
Hurry.

458
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,910
Go find the meteorite for me.

459
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,560
Hurry!

460
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:05,990
Okay.

461
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,220
I'm going to send someone to look for it.

462
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,700

463
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,000
An Jingzhao.

464
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,580
Is this really you?

465
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,840
You're back.

466
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,880
Take your time.

467
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,280
Take your time.

468
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,160
I'll be waiting for you.

469
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,280
Today in the studio,

470
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,870
I heard your brother-in-law talking to me.

471
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,030
He only called my name,

472
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,940
but

473
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm very happy.

474
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:21,660

475
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,470
This is a huge breakthrough.

476
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:25,680
He must have collected a lot of energy.

477
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,800
I didn't expect

478
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,180
that the survival in the universe is a game.

479
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,900
We need to collect energy continuously

480
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,700
in exchange for something else.

481
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,790
He should be back soon.

482
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,430
Sister, can you do me a favor?

483
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,610

485
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,940
You failed in English again.

486
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:53,710
But I got full marks in Physics.

487
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:55,970
I will talk to the universe in the future.

488
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:58,400
English is not worth mentioning.

489
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:01,150
I covered for you when you skipped a class last time.

490
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,580
What I did is bad for you.

491
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,290
It was a rare lecture.

492
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,950
I can't delay exploring the universe

493
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,409
because of a class, right?

494
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,409
I want to serve my country as soon as possible.

495
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,350
I just want my brother-in-law to come back soon.

496
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,949
I also want to visit Donghua.

497
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,770

I promise I will study hard.

507
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,580
I won't let you down.

508
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,469
That's more like it.

509
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:42,050
Looks like you won't come tonight, right?

510
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,280
I'm a little sleepy.

511
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,230
I've been busy with the new product exhibition lately.

512
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,290
I'm a little tired.

513
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,889
The exhibition will start next weekend.

514
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,560
You must come to the exhibition to see me unveil the new product.

515
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:02,380
You will come, right?

516
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,350
Did you hear what I said?

517
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,390
Good night.

518
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,140
Honey.

519
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,710
The color match is very comfortable.

520
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:27,860
Very comfortable.

521
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,830
I like this style.

522
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:29,190
Yes.

523
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,500
What do you think?

524
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,740
Let's take a look over there.

525
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,390
Okay.

526
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,320
There are more clothes over there.

527
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,100
It's like this. Look.

528
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,590
Hello.

529
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,300
Hello.

530
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,220
There should be a men's dress on this empty clothes hanger, right?

531
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,350
It matches this one.

532
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:49,860
Yes.

533
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,800
Is there any symbolic meaning by doing this?

534
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,500
Are you showing your support for girls?

535
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,630
No.

536
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,610
Then the meaning is...

537
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,950
That dress is a unique item.

538
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,070
Someone took it.

539
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,740
That's why it's gone.

540
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,540
That's it.

541
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:07,900
Okay.

542
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,510
Thank you.

543
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:10,570
Ms. Qiao.

544
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:11,500
Chuyue,

545
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,310
congratulations on having your own brand.

546
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:17,340
I'm sorry for that accident.

547
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,260
It's okay.

548
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,470
It's all in the past.

549
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:26,620
This dress is so beautiful.

550
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,380
It should have stolen the spotlight a year ago.

551
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,190
Now there is finally a chance

552
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,850
to display it to everyone.

553
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:37,980
Ms. Qiao,

554
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,060
thank you for always helping me.

555
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,550
I've used what you taught me

556
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,470
in my design.

557
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,670
I'm flattered.

558
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,100
I look forward to cooperating with you.

559
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,030
Miss Li,

560
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,020
are you ready?

561
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:54,000
Go ahead.

562
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,310
Are you ready?

563
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,680
The guests and reporters

564
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,130
can't wait to see you

565
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,550
unveil the new product behind the curtain.

566
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Wait a little longer.

567
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,990
A very important person hasn't arrived yet.

568
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,940
But it's long past due.

569
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,330
I don't think they can wait longer.

570
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,020
Wait a little longer.

571
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,050
Okay.

572
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,860
Sister, don't be sad.

573
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:51,120
We can never tell about time and space.

574
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,520
When we went to Shangyu,

575
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,470
we had to wait for a thunderstorm, right?

576
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,160
My brother-in-law

577
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,020
must be delayed by some accident.

578
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,270
Don't worry.

579
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,310
Okay.

580
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,110
I know.

581
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,470
Go back first.

582
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,670
I want to be alone.

583
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,390
Be careful.

584
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:06,320
Leave.

585
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,980
According to the astronomy forecast,

586
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,140
an Orionid meteor shower

587
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,020
will come to the Earth tonight.

588
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:09,110
The Orionid meteor shower will rain down

589
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:10,110
many meteors at a high speed.

590
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,580
And this year will be the peak

591
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,100
of the Orionid meteor shower.

592
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,990
The peak will last for a long time.

593
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,620
It's a good time to enjoy it.

594
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,350
You are suggested to enjoy it

595
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:20,380
in open areas away from light sources such as the streetlights.

596
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,940
Next, let's see news in brief.

597
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:22,820
Open areas?

598
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,780
Chuyue.

599
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,110
Don't.

600
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,040
Don't come near me.

601
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,470
You disappeared every time I touched you.

602
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,500
This time,

603
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,190
just stand there,

604
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,310
and let me see you for a little longer.

605
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,830
Okay?

606
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,710
♫Fate is at your fingertips♫

607
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,670
Chuyue.

608
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:28,250
♫Your smile outshines the jade flute and spring breeze♫

609
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,880
I'm back.

610
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,060
I'm back.

611
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:34,660
♫You are free and makes me fascinated♫

612
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,250
♫Suddenly we meet in the bustling world♫

613
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:46,720
♫Enjoying wonderful natural scenery♫

614
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:52,050
♫My dream makes me think too much♫

615
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,670
Is this really you?

616
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:58,650
♫Much love is shown through your eyes♫

617
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,400
Yes.

618
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,210
I'm really back.

619
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:04,380
♫We're together in this life, and I don't care which year it is♫

620
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:00,520
I told you

621
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,860
I will be with you forever.

622
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,890
♫Your eyes are tender♫

623
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:13,770
♫Making me miss you everyday♫

624
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,670
How come you haven't changed at all?

625
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,870
Where were you in the past year?

626
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,920
♫Time goes by♫

627
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,180
I think...

628
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,620
I think I was stuck

629
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,910
♫I'm not jealous♫

630
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,950
in a dream with you in it.

631
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,770
♫Waiting for my love♫

632
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,680
I could see all our memories.

633
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:31,350
♫I just want to travel around the world with you in this life♫

634
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,150
And I could see your life.

635
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,150
It was all about you.

636
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:35,810
So the person I saw was real, right?

637
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,970
Yes.

638
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,870
It was real.

639
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,980
I could see you sometimes.

640
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,540
Sometimes...

641
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,730
Sometimes, I could even touch you.

642
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,260
Chuyue.

643
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:58,830
♫Things weigh on my mind♫

644
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,900
Chuyue.

645
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,190
♫You looked back as if time stood still♫

646
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:10,590
♫You quietly show up by my side♫

647
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:16,430
♫I'm not afraid as long as I can be with you♫

648
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,560
♫Your eyes are tender♫

649
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,300
Later,

650
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,700
♫Making me miss you everyday♫

651
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,790
An Jingling went crazy.

652
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,330
I got the meteorite back from An Jingling.

653
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,060
♫Time goes by♫

654
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,100
Plus the part

655
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,320
you've saved for me,

656
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,020
♫I'm not jealous♫

657
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,850
I finally opened the channel.

658
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,260
I firmly believed

659
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,380
♫Waiting for my love♫

660
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,940
you would come back.

661
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:43,090
♫I just want to travel around the world with you in this life♫

662
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,530
Because we have strong mutual attraction.

663
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:42,060
That's why we're together.

664
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,810
♫I want to be in your heart♫

665
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,420
♫Forever♫

666
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:58,930
♫I just want to travel around the world with you in this life♫
