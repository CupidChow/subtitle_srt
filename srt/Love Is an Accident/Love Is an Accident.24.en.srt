[Episode 24]

4
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:42,490
There's another person who practices the same kind of martial arts.

5
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,259
Who?

6
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,300
The Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley.

7
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,110
How could I have forgotten him?

8
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,170
Although he is not from a righteous sect,

9
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,630
he is very powerful.

10
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,620
Madam.

11
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:00,980
Young Master.

12
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,060
Young Lord went out just now.

13
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,890
I heard that

14
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,970
he found someone who made the letter.

15
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,979
Someone who made the letter?

16
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,720
Could An Jingzhao have found Fang Yue?

17
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,700
How did he make it?

18
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,220
Mother.

19
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,860
Who is Fang Yue?

20
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,190
Over 20 years ago,

21
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,100
Madam and I participated in

22
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,850
the poetry club of Fang Yue House.

23
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:26,300
Back then, we recited poems together

24
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,920
and exchanged the poems with each other.

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,550
Fang Yue made this letter herself.

26
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,410
Although I'm not acquainted with Fang Yue,

27
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,740
she has the list of the poetry club members.

28
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,270
If An Jingzhao took it,

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,370
he would find out what I have done sooner or later.

30
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,260
Ling,

31
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,860
find a way to stop An Jingzhao as soon as possible.

32
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,660
Even if we leave now, we won't be able to catch up with them.

33
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,790
We can only stop them on their way back.

34
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,800
Mother, don't worry.

35
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,260
I will get the list.

36
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,430
Young Lord.

37
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,460
Who are you?

38
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,470
Young Lord.

39
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,980
Lord.

40
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:20,990
How is he?

41
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,540
Is An Jingzhao alright?

42
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,560
Zhao had internal damage,

43
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,210
and the Art of Starshift had absorbed half his inner force.

44
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,660
That's why he's in such a severe condition.

45
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,400
I've fed him with my inner force.

46
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,659
As for what will happen to him,

47
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,340
it's up to Zhao himself.

48
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,420
[Yunwei Villa]

49
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,950
An Jingzhao.

50
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,840
Please wake up.

51
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,600
Don't forget that you have to marry me.

52
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,530
You also wanted to witness me becoming a designer.

53
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,150
Anyhow, we still have a lot of things to do.

54
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,900
Please wake up.

55
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:24,980
Chuyue.

56
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,530
Temperatures drop significantly at night.

57
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,660
Also, you haven't eaten anything for a day.

58
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:31,860
Have some porridge to warm yourself up.

59
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,440
I'm not hungry.

60
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,120
Chuyue.

61
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,520
Jingzhao is blessed.

62
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,050
He will be fine.

63
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,670
Young Madam.

64
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,180
The Miaoyin Temple in the northern part of the city is said to be very spiritual.

65
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,909
I'll go there to pray for the Young Lord tomorrow.

66
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,900
Miaoyin Temple?

67
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,580
Buddha,

68
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,410
this is the first petition I've ever made in my life.

69
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,820
Please keep An Jingzhao safe and sound.

70
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,660
I'm willing to get hurt on behalf of him

71
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,520
for him to regain consciousness.

72
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,900
I'm willing to pay any price.

73
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,530
There have been many infatuated women

74
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,340
making wishes here,

75
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,730
but how many of them are sincere?

76
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:34,340
I... I am sincere.

77
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,909
The qi from your energy centre is completely different.

78
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,450
You're not from this world.

79
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,110
He knew I came from another world at first sight.

80
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,430
Is he really a prophet?

81
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,660
With all due respect,

82
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,550
the qi from your energy centre is unusual.

83
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,070
Perhaps your beloved is unconscious because of it.

84
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,080
I did come from another world.

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,840
But what does it have to do with my beloved?

86
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,850
If you trust me,

87
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,840
can you tell me where you came from?

88
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,770
So I can figure it out.

89
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,300
Since he can tell

90
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,760
I came from another world,

91
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,610
maybe he can help me.

92
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,950
I'm from another peaceful world.

93
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,830
There's a passageway here that connects to my hometown.

94
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,700
My beloved one and I

95
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,580
went to my hometown before.

96
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,860
This is it.

97
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,610
You came from another world.

98
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,740
But your beloved is from Shangyu.

99
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:48,100
You two have different qi in your energy centres.

100
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,820
It will surely backfire on you if you are together.

101
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,430
Besides,

102
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,000
you used Transformation

103
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,600
to travel between two different worlds.

104
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
However, everything in the universe has its own laws.

105
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,920
The Transformation

106
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,080
will backfire on you

107
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,590
and cause your vitality to be gradually damaged.

108
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,420
Are you okay?

109
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,350
I'm fine.

110
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,710
Just a minor injury.

111
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,440
During training that day,

112
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,600
I messed up with the "left slash and right dragon."

113
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,100
That's why qi in my meridians went in reverse

114
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,860
and caused hallucinations,

115
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,390
so I mistook Taoyun for you.

116
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:42,410
Lord.

117
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,450
How is he?

118
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,130
Is An Jingzhao alright?

119
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,230
Zhao had internal damage,

120
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,860
and the Art of Starshift had absorbed half his inner force.

121
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,350
That's why he's in such a severe condition.

122
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,560
It's true that he has been injured much lately.

123
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,500
But maybe

124
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,720
something went wrong with his training

125
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,300
or he got hurt by others.

126
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,030
It's because his vitality got damaged.

127
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,830
That's why he got hurt so easily.

128
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,870
It also takes time for him to recover.

129
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,590
What will happen in the end?

130
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,100
He might eventually die from

131
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,410
energy depletion.

132
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,930
But I also travelled between the two worlds.

133
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,180
Why didn't my body react?

134
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,710
I guess

135
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:32,130
maybe your beloved has more qi and blood

136
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,690
and is full of energy,

137
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,480
so it would only backfire on him.

138
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,890
There are innumerable mysteries

139
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:42,010
in the world.

140
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,830
I can only have a guess.

141
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,790
It's not a mystery.

142
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,620
An Jingzhao and I

143
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,540
belong to two different worlds.

144
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,700
Maybe we have different energies,

145
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,900
so when we're together, he's affected.

146
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,090
Thank you, Master.

147
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,720
Amitabha.

148
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,260
Would she buy it?

149
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,370
You do look like

150
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,100
Master Shiyun in this outfit.

151
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:39,670
It's all thanks to you having a good taste

152
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,330
for choosing me to be the monk.

153
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,310
Well done.

154
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,580
Come with me.

155
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,880
I shall give you a big reward.

156
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,340
Thank you, Second Young Master.

157
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,180
An Jingzhao.

158
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,700
Please wake up.

159
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,010
Everyone is worried about you.

160
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,220
An Jingzhao.

161
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,810
An Jingzhao, you're finally awake.

162
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:11,440
Lord.

163
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,210
Hottie.

164
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,330
-Mother.
-Hurry!

165
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,060
Hurry!

166
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,100
You freaked me out.

167
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,930
Let me see.

168
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,170
Zhao.

169
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:20,180
Zhao.

170
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,580
Zhao.

171
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,210
-Father.
-Lie down.

172
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,200
Grandmother.

173
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:24,970
Don't get up.

174
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,590
Your pulse is stable.

175
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,400
You have passed the most crucial period.

176
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,740
You can recover

177
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,710
after some rest.

178
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:42,780
Thank goodness.

179
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,280
Thank goodness.

180
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,620
[Yun]

181
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:23,860
Chuyue.

182
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Once everything is settled in the martial arts world,

183
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,880
let's leave here

184
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,400
and travel around.

185
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,170
Save it.

186
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,700
An Jingzhao.

187
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:35,450
Let's break up.

188
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,150
I don't want to be with someone

189
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,700
who is fighting, killing,

190
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,810
and getting hurt

191
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,360
every day.

192
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,110
Are you mad?

193
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,780
I promise you.

194
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,950
I will protect myself well in the future.

195
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,810
I won't let anything happen to me.

196
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,700
I'm not joking.

197
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,390
I don't want to live like this anymore.

198
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,550
We're from two different worlds.

199
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,860
You have your mission,

200
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,060
while I have my dream.

201
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,500
Let's just break up.

202
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,530
Chuyue.

203
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,820
I promised you before

204
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,340
that I'll go back

205
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,760
and live with you in your world

206
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,720
once I settle the things here.

207
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,040
I don't want your promise.

208
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,340
I want to go home.

209
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,000
I don't believe what you just said.

210
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,560
Chuyue.

211
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,740
Did something happen?

212
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,750
You can tell me.

213
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,980
Nothing happened.

214
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:33,680
I'm telling the truth.

215
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,660
I don't believe what you just said.

216
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,520
Look into my eyes and say it again.

217
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,060
An Jingzhao,

218
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,350
you are too naive.

219
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,320
It's just that the fact you came from another world

220
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,720
sounds interesting to me.

221
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
I've been toying with you all along.

222
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,610
Don't take it seriously.

223
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,770
Do... Do you think I really like you?

224
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm sick of you.

225
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
That's it.

226
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,180
You hurt me.

227
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,560
Zhao,

228
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,740
you've been standing outside for so long

229
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,540
that you caught a cold.

230
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,569
Have some ginger tea to warm yourself up.

231
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,410
Here.

232
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,880
I don't want it.

233
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:14,470
Be patient.

234
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,460
Chuyue must have her reasons.

235
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,720
I've sent someone to look for her.

236
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,270
Once I find her,

237
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,700
I will figure it out for you.

238
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,040
Here.

239
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,340
I wonder how An Jingzhao is.

240
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,020
You must get well soon.

241
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,530
You two have different qi in your energy centres.

242
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,450
It will surely backfire on you if you are together.

243
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,390
What will happen in the end?

244
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
He might eventually die from

245
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,240
energy depletion.

246
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,670
I don't want to live like this anymore.

247
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,880
We're from two different worlds.

248
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,270
You have your mission,

249
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,530
while I have my dream.

250
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,900
Let's just break up.

251
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:46,980
Chuyue.

252
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,980
I promised you before

253
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,790
that I'll go back

254
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,180
and live with you in your world

255
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,070
once I settle the things here.

256
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,440
Jingling.

257
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,300
Go back.

258
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,170
I don't want anyone to persuade me for now.

259
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,330
I'm not here to persuade you.

260
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,220
I just want to check on you.

261
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,660
You might feel better if you pour out your heart.

262
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,600
I have nothing troubling me.

263
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,960
I feel so relaxed now.

264
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,600
Maybe you can go out for a walk.

265
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,410
You reminded me.

266
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,590
The Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley said

267
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,970
the Ghost Lotus would bloom in half a month.

268
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,850
It's about time now.

269
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,240
If I stay here,

270
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,170
I can't help visiting An Jingzhao.

271
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,900
I'd better go to the Valley Lord to check the pigment.

272
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,560
When An Jingzhao gets better,

273
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:00,330
I'll go home.

274
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,790
I'll go to the Valley Lord tomorrow.

275
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,610
I do know a place with a great view.

276
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,850
You can meet the Valley Lord there.

277
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,260
Not only can you enjoy the scenery

278
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,390
but also have a talk.

279
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,340
Thank you, Jingling.

280
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:33,960
Young Lord.

281
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,150
Young Madam is going to the Whitehorse Peach Grove.

282
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:38,620
She has an appointment with the Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley.

283
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,220
Send someone to protect her.

284
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,300
Yes.

285
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,370
Chuyue.

286
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,170
I don't believe you don't love me anymore.

287
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,300
There must be something else going on.

288
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,450
I must figure it out.

289
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,720
[Mountains are hazy during the spring]

290
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,320
Chuyue?

291
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,180
Who are you?

292
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,010
Art of Starshift?

293
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:04,980
No.

294
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:06,890
I can't leave.

295
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,660
If I leave now,

296
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,360
Chuyue will be in danger once she arrives.

297
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,180
To forget my worries,

298
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:46,020
I'll drink with the Valley Lord till we drop today.

299
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,910
Valley Lord.

300
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,290
What are you doing?

301
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:54,760
Valley Lord?

302
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,380
Leader.

303
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,110
Valley Lord.

304
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:15,950
Valley Lord.

305
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,080
Valley Lord, wake up!

306
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,500
Is anyone there?

307
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,330
Valley Lord.

308
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,420
Valley Lord.

309
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,190
Don't worry.

310
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,550
I will avenge you.

311
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,640
Young Lord.

312
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,400
Young Lord.

313
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,300
Was the Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley

314
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,080
really killed by the Art of Starshift?

315
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,460
Yes.

316
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,220
His disciples have sent him back to the Magic Flower Valley.

317
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,340
Where is Young Madam?

318
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,470
Young Madam is fine.

319
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,830
But, she's very sad.

320
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:21,860
I heard that Zhuyin Pavilion is holding a meeting

321
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,560
to discuss the Art of Starshift.

322
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,900
I think she's heading to the Zhuyin Pavilion.

323
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,430
One more thing, Young Lord.

324
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,060
I found this on the stairs of the peach grove.

325
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:33,400
It was stained with some unusual red soil.

326
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,660
It should have been left by the murderer.

327
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:38,670
Let's go to the Zhuyin Pavilion.

328
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:54,390
[Zhuyin Pavilion]

329
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:49,640
I think you all know why

330
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,510
we gathered in the Zhuyin pavilion today.

331
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,720
The Art of Starshift reappeared in the world.

332
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,860
Chief Han got assaulted

333
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,860
and lost all his martial arts skills.

334
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,590
Taoist Shanyue, who had been isolating himself,

335
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,820
was also killed by the Art of Starshift.

336
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,120
Yesterday, the Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley

337
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,380
died because of the Art of Starshift too.

338
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,490
Up to now,

339
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,870
we don't know who has practised the witchcraft.

340
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:18,210
Today, we will find out who he is

341
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,700
and root out the evil.

342
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,150
My useless disciple had confessed

343
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,940
that the witch, Hongfei, did it.

344
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,090
Also, the witch killed him.

345
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,600
So there's no need to verify it.

346
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,660
The witch must be the murderer.

347
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,660
I agree with Chief Han.

348
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,580
The Zhuyin Pavilion is willing to take down Hongfei

349
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,460
and arrest her.

350
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,800
Defeat the witch!

351
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,160
Root out the evil in the world!

352
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,420
Defeat the witch!

353
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,900
Root out the evil in the world!

354
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,300
Defeat the witch!

355
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,090
Root out the evil in the world!

356
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,450
It's not Hongfei who has practised the Art of Starshift.

357
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,380
The Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley was my close friend.

358
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,700
He fought the murderer

359
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:07,620
and got injured by his palms.

360
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,900
The murderer is obviously not Hongfei.

361
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,660
She often uses the Nine Poisons Whip.

362
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,820
But with this alone,

363
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,550
you can't prove that it's not Hongfei.

364
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,640
I can also prove that the murderer is not Hongfei.

365
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,850
I have fought with both Hongfei and the murderer.

366
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,720
Their inner force is completely different.

367
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,620
Also, the murderer is a man.

368
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,380
Besides,

369
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,450
when I checked Madam's body,

370
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,040
I found no signs of fighting at the scene.

371
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,350
The murderer could be someone she knew.

372
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:40,690
He caught her off guard

373
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,800
and attacked her with a sharp weapon.

374
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
After that, he used the Art of Starshift

375
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:46,830
to absorb all her power.

376
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,620
Young Lord, it's just your one-sided statement.

377
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,780
I heard your wife is close to the witch.

378
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,440
Don't tell us you're exculpating the witch

379
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,230
because you're colluding with her.

380
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,970
Are these the so-called righteous sects?

381
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,630
Hongfei.

382
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:15,520
Hongfei.

383
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,420
I wanted to see

384
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,580
who had stolen my sect's secret manual.

385
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,810
But I didn't expect you to be so good at

386
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,410
turning things upside down.

387
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:36,660
How could you be the master of the pavilion

388
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,540
with that brain?

389
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,380
How dare you!

390
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,180
Arrest her!

391
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,420
Hongfei.

392
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,310
Don't hurt the innocents.

393
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,780
Cut the crap.

394
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,940
Amitabha.

395
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,460
Master.

396
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,710
Are you alright?

397
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,060
I'm fine.

398
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,770
Let's kill the witch

399
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,610
to root out the evil in the world.

400
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,170
Wait!

401
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,130
I told you, Hongfei is not the murderer.

402
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,260
Why would you do that?

403
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,130
Even if she's not the murderer,

404
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,530
she's from the Evil Sect.

405
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,730
We must get rid of her.

406
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,380
Although Hongfei is from the Evil Sect,

407
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,080
she has been practising martial arts outside

408
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,060
and never participated in the killing of the Evil Sect.

409
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,360
Since she's from the Evil Sect,

410
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,760
we shouldn't spare her life

411
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,420
because they are all demonic.

412
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,960
I agree with the Young Master.

413
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,270
We shouldn't keep the witch alive.

414
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,350
I agree, too.

415
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,750
Now we can't prove that Hongfei is the murderer.

416
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,840
So we shouldn't kill her hastily.

417
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,770
We're now indecisive about the matter.

418
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,460
Why don't we investigate it first

419
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,120
before making a decision?

420
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:44,540
Fine.

421
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,500
So the three of us agree,

422
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:48,210
but the two of you object.

423
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,980
Of course we have to listen to the majority.

424
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,380
The witch must be killed.

425
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,770
I'm on Jingzhao's side.

426
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,550
The Fengnuan Pavilion is also prestigious

427
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,740
in the martial arts world.

428
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,470
I don't agree with you treating Hongfei this way.

429
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:12,530
Jingzhao.

430
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,720
Great.

431
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,860
You're still alive.

432
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,530
I've been practising outside lately.

433
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,930
I came here

434
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,320
as soon as I heard your news a few days ago.

435
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,460
In that case,

436
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,920
we'll lock her up for now.

437
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:26,830
Young Lord.

438
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,930
Since you insist that Hongfei is not the murderer,

439
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,190
if you find the murderer within two days,

440
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:34,420
we will release Hongfei.

441
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,780
How can he make it in two days?

442
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,060
Okay.

443
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:43,810
Okay.

444
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,030
In that case,

445
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,000
we'll do as Madam Lengmei said.

446
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:47,740
Guards!

447
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,900
Take the witch to the dungeon.

448
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,380
Yes.

449
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,630
Let's go.

450
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,620
Hongfei,

451
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,260
I will prove your innocence.

452
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,120
Everyone,

453
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,930
I have prepared some guest rooms for you.

454
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:07,120
Please take a rest.

455
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:07,840
Please.

456
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,980
Thank you, Master.

457
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,580
Thank you.

458
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,940
I have something to ask you.

459
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,800
I have nothing to say to you.

460
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,360
Jingzhao.

461
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,610
Did you two fight?

462
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,530
Jingzhao.

463
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,100
Why did you fight?

464
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:00,270
Did Li Chuyue piss you off again?

465
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:29,980
No.

466
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,700
I need to check out

467
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,820
if they are together.

468
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:39,180
Li Chuyue, what are you doing?

469
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,520
You can't go near An Jingzhao.

470
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,560
I heard that the Young Master kept Hongfei

471
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,880
in a special dungeon.

472
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,420
What special dungeon?

473
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,550
Does he want to kill her straight away?

474
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:00,540
Keep your voice down.

475
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,400
Okay, let's go.

476
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:04,820
Kill her?

477
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,690
Zhu Maoqing is going to kill Hongfei?

478
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:10,820
No way.

479
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,820
I have to save her.

480
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,280
But I don't know martial arts.

481
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,600
How can I save her?

482
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,240
At this moment, I can only go to An Jingzhao.

483
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,710
Saving lives is a matter of overriding priority.

484
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,340
An Jingzhao.

485
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,210
An Jingzhao.

486
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,420
Zhu Maoqing wants to kill Hongfei.

487
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,680
Please go and save her.

488
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,460
Donghua.

489
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:05,980
Go find out

490
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,710
where Zhu Maoqing is keeping Hongfei

491
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,540
and whether he wants to kill her.

492
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,020
Yes.

493
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,410
Chuyue, don't go first.

494
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,110
Are you here just for Hongfei?

495
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:28,540
Yes.

496
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,220
Chuyue.

497
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,740
I know you were trying to hide something

498
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,180
with what you said the other day.

499
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,260
You can tell me about it.

500
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:36,660
Let's face it together.

501
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,340
There's nothing I was trying to hide from you.

502
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,670
I was telling the truth.

503
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,980
Don't ask me anymore.

504
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm going to check on Donghua.

505
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,670
What are you doing, An Jingzhao?

506
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,600
We've broken up.

507
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,550
When did I agree with the breakup?

508
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:49,740
Fine.

509
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:52,460
You want to break up?

510
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,950
Do whatever I say

511
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,380
in the following seven days.

512
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,420
If you can do it,

513
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,900
I'll agree with the breakup.

514
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,140
I'll let you go.

515
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,800
Why should I?

516
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,450
You want to go back.

517
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,230
The meteorite is with me.

518
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,780
I must go home.

519
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,670
Otherwise, I can't help getting close to An Jingzhao.

520
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,050
Fine.

521
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,120
Young Lord.

522
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,140
I heard that

523
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,820
Zhu Maoqing locked Hongfei in the dungeon.

524
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,000
The dungeon has a special mechanism.

525
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,260
But I haven't worked out the details yet.

526
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,020
Got it.

527
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,180
You may leave first.

528
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,660
Yes.

529
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,280
An Jingzhao.

530
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,860
Hongfei is really in danger.

531
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,130
Please go and save her.

532
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,940
Didn't you say there's nothing

533
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,880
between us anymore?

534
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,080
Why should I help you?

535
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,590
What will it take for you to help me?

536
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,530
Beg me.

537
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,130
An Jingzhao.

538
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,790
Please.

539
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,520
Help me.

540
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,680
Go and save Hongfei.

541
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,390
If you act cute in front of me,

542
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,700
I can consider taking you with me.

543
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,180
I'm so cute.

544
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,680
Please help me.

545
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:09,630
You call that acting cute?

546
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,980
You adore me the most.

547
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,360
Please help me.

548
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,830
Are you happy with it?

549
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,510
Don't you want to save Hongfei?

550
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,220
Don't you want to go home?

551
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,570
Hold me.

552
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,460
Okay.

553
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,460
I promise you.

554
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,560
Why are there no guards here?

555
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:08,290
This place is already covered with the Zhuyin Pavilion's hidden weapons.

556
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,290
If you make a sound

557
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,230
when you walk,

558
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,370
those hidden weapons will kill you.

559
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,980
What should we do?

560
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,090
Just come with me.

561
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,020
I will never

562
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,300
leave you two alone in the future.
