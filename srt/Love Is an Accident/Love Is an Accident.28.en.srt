[Episode 28]

4
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,020
This...

5
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,660
Isn't this my phone?

6
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:52,300
He not only stole my phone

7
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,660
but also entered the password correctly.

8
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,979
That's terrifying.

9
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,820
Pervert!

10
00:01:59,190 --> 00:01:59,759
Chuyue.

11
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,360
What are you doing?

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,520
Why do you have this?

13
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,010
Since you know it,

14
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,590
I have a question for you.

15
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,380
This kind of thing doesn't belong to Shangyu.

16
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,329
As to where your hometown is,

17
00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:22,660
you never clearly told me.

18
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,190
Where exactly are you from?

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,920
Looks like he doesn't know about the meteorite yet.

20
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,050
I told you before.

21
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,079
There's nothing I can do if you don't believe me.

22
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,510
If you don't want to tell me,

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,540
it's okay.

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,480
But the thing I want to figure out

25
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,660
will become clear sooner or later.

26
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,320
Young Lord.

27
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,579
According to the spy,

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,040
Young Madam is critically endangered

29
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,500
by the invading coldness.

30
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,720
An Jingling has hidden her in the secret room of the villa.

31
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,420
Young Lord.

32
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,120
I didn’t expect it to be so serious.

33
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,240
Now only someone with profound martial skills

34
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,510
can extract the coldness

35
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:12,110
to save Miss Chuyue.

36
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,320
We can't wait any longer.

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,880
No.

38
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,220
The primordial energy in your body hasn't been harmonized.

39
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,150
If you get invaded by the coldness,

40
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,420
I'm afraid...

41
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,670
Well. I'll give it a try.

42
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,260
No.

43
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,260
I must save Chuyue myself.

44
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,500
Young Lord.

45
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,460
You were harmed by the Shenyuan Whip, yet you're still alive.

46
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,720
Brother. You're indeed extraordinary.

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,590
The secret room is extremely cold.

48
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,230
How can you lock Chuyue here?

49
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,380
Brother, I didn't expect that not only has your body recovered,

50
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,980
but your spies are still as formidable as ever.

51
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,680
Since you're here to save Chuyue,

52
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,380
I won't stop you.

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,930
But I have to remind you

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,700
that the pharmacist said the coldness was extraordinary.

55
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
It will deplete your lifelong martial skills.

56
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,140
You may even die on the spot.

57
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,510
You've been valiant all your life.

58
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:22,220
Will it be a pity

59
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,320
if you become a useless person?

60
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,400
Father is still lying on his sickbed, hoping for your return

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,730
and that you inherit the position of lord.

62
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,960
It’s not too late to regret.

63
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,220
Chuyue.

64
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,180
If I become a useless man,

65
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,830
An Jingling will kill me.

66
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,320
I promised to be with you forever,

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,580
but I will fail.

68
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Chuyue. I'm sorry

69
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,340
I let you down.

70
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,220
An Jingzhao.

71
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,260
You are a hypocrite.

72
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,710
Compared to Chuyue,

73
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,810
the position of lord and extraordinary martial arts

74
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,960
are more important.

75
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,320
Chuyue!

76
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,020
Brother.

77
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:22,980
Farewell.

78
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:31,860
Chuyue!

79
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,460
Chuyue!

80
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:42,770
Chuyue!

81
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,260
Chuyue!

82
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:46,900
Chuyue!

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,290
An Jingzhao.

84
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,940
Chuyue.

85
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,220
Why did you come in from outside?

86
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,010
An Jingzhao.

87
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,580
You knew it was a trap.

88
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,180
Why did you come in?

89
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,120
No matter where you are,

90
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,200
I will find you.

91
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,790
I won't leave you anymore.

92
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,730
And I won't allow you to leave me.

93
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,320
It's cold here.

94
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,380
Let's go out first.

95
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:12,120
An Jingling has destroyed the mechanism.

96
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,600
Chuyue.

97
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:17,390
Poison gas!

98
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,250
Hurry, cover your nose and mouth.

99
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,510
Don't worry.

100
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,400
There is a secret door in this secret room.

101
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
An Jingling doesn't know.

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,490
Come with me.

103
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,040
You actually chose to die with him without hesitation.

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Hang in there.

105
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,220
Trust me.

106
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,440
We'll be safe if we open this door.

107
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:11,920
Chuyue.

108
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:12,900
Chuyue.

109
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,830
Chuyue, what's wrong?

110
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,100
Chuyue, hang in there.

111
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,710
An Jingzhao.

112
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,310
An Jingzhao, are you alright?

113
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,280
Don’t scare me.

114
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,440
I'm fine.

115
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,340
Let's get out of here.

116
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,350
Look at you now.

117
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,280
Do you still want to take Chuyue away?

118
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,570
Just give up.

119
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,100
An Jingzhao.

120
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,550
An Jingling!

121
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,900
You despicable man!

122
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,870
Thank you for the compliment.

123
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
Let go of her.

124
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,980
Your primordial energy is discordant.

125
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,820
And now you're infiltrated by poisonous gas.

126
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,020
How can a dying person

127
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,820
take care of Chuyue?

128
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,100
Chuyue.

129
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,220
An Jingzhao.

130
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:39,940
Chuyue!

131
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,230
Be careful

132
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,560
of the Art of Starshift.

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,740
Young Master.

134
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,380
Young Master.

135
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,700
An Jingzhao.

136
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,430
An Jingzhao.

137
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,320
Go!

138
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,200
Young Master.

139
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,860
Chuyue.

140
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,420
Chuyue.

141
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,140
Don't worry about me.

142
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,460
I'll be fine.

143
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,270
Elder Yueming.

144
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:47,480
Young Lord.

145
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,420
-Young Madam.
-Mr. Yueming.

146
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,820
Please take a look at him.

147
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,470
Let me check.

148
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,610
I told you not to use your internal force.

149
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,870
But you didn't listen.

150
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,860
Now your primordial energy is not harmonious.

151
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,460
If you don't listen to me again,

152
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,590
you'll be in danger.

153
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,180
Young Madam.

154
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,870
You must supervise him.

155
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,440
Mr. Yueming.

156
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,740
When I fought him,

157
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,220
there was a moment

158
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,920
when I seemed to have blocked the Art of Starshift.

159
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,260
No wonder the two streams of primordial energy in your body

160
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,740
are battling so fiercely.

161
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:44,980
Did you feel two streams of primordial energy converging in your heart,

162
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,440
causing you excruciating pain at that time?

163
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:47,980
Yes.

164
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,340
I knew it.

165
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,750
What do you mean?

166
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,500
More than ten years ago,

167
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,360
I found that using both the righteous and the evil

168
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,960
streams of primordial energy simultaneously

169
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,180
seems to be able to suppress and neutralize the Art of Starshift.

170
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,390
For that, I made the Yueming Sword

171
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,920
and tried to let it bear those two streams of primordial energy

172
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,390
to relieve the pain of harnessing the martial arts.

173
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,390
I see.

174
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,050
Later, my beloved passed away.

175
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,730
I lost all aspirations,

176
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,820
so I gave up halfway.

177
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,060
I will train harder

178
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,910
and find the secret to the primordial energy as soon as possible.

179
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:26,240
I can’t let the Art of Starshift harm the martial world anymore.

180
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
But as you recover,

181
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,180
the inner force of the Profound Earth Sutra will gradually become stronger.

182
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,580
And the power of the orchid will weaken.

183
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,010
It's too hard to balance the two streams of primordial energy.

184
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,340
What's so hard about it?

185
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,410
I'll just raise another orchid.

186
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,410
No.

187
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,130
The orchid

188
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,980
isn't able to resist the Profound Earth Sutra.

189
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,470
I have an idea.

190
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
I inherited the internal force of Beiming since I was a child.

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,330
I have the same power as the orchid.

192
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,730
I can transfer you all my internal force.

193
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,350
Mr. Yueming.

194
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,040
You've helped me a lot.

195
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,990
I can't let you make such a sacrifice anymore.

196
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,620
There will be sacrifices if we want to fight.

197
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,620
As long as we can defeat An Jingling,

198
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,460
what I'm about to do is not worth mentioning.

199
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,300
However,

200
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,430
my internal force will fight against

201
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,320
the Profound Earth Sutra.

202
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,860
It will be much more painful than now.

203
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,590
I'm afraid you can't bear it.

204
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,610
That pain is not worth mentioning.

205
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,260
Okay, that's good.

206
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,690
Hurry up.

207
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,760
Young Lord.

208
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,570
Get up slowly.

209
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:36,680
Come on.

210
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,230
He just survived the attack of the Shenyuan Whip,

211
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,830
and now he has to suffer this.

212
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,900
I really want to take him home

213
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,220
and never let him come back.

214
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,860
Yes.

215
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,680
God!

216
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,340
Open your eyes.

217
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,020
Can you be nicer to the Young Lord?

218
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:17,660
An Jingling should be the one to suffer.

219
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,970
Why do you make the Young Lord  suffer?

220
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:24,980
An Jingzhao.

221
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,640
Young Lord.

222
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,980
Elder Yueming.

223
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,580
I'm fine.

224
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:30,600
Here.

225
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,170
You...

226
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,800
Go quickly

227
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,260
to buy the herbs on this prescription.

228
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,550
They can relieve the Young Lord's pain.

229
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,100
Yes.

230
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,980
I'll go now.

231
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,020
Master Bai. It's you.

232
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,980
I'm here to deliver the medicine to Jingzhao.

233
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,430
When I went to Elder Yueming's place,

234
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,230
I found that the house was empty.

235
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,170
I've been looking for you for a long time, but I couldn't find you.

236
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,430
Where is Jingzhao now?

237
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,510
How’s his injury?

238
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,310
The Young Lord is fine now.

239
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,620
Master Bai. Please come with me.

240
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,830
Young Madam.

241
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,180
Master Bai was looking for us everywhere.

242
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,100
I met her on the way,

243
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,300
so I brought her here.

244
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,180
Jingzhao, you've suffered.

245
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,950
I wanted to find the antidote for the Shenyuan Whip for you,

246
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,010
but I haven't found it for a long time.

247
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,440
One of the most experienced masters of Fengnuan Pavilion said

248
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,060
there was no antidote for the Shenyuan Whip.

249
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,790
But she gave me a secret recipe.

250
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Although it can't cure the wound of the Shenyuan Whip,

251
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,820
it's very effective in replenishing qi and refreshing your core.

252
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,220
I collected herbs and made this elixir according to the prescription.

253
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,940
Jingzhao, you deserve it.

254
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:18,940
Okay.

255
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,250
Thank you, Bai Zhi.

256
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,440
How do you feel?

257
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:33,860
I feel better.

258
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,850
Then, will you marry me?

259
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,730
Look how nervous you are.

260
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,790
I was just kidding.

261
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,640
Jingzhao.

262
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,300
You're already in the past.

263
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,100
The plot twist happened too quickly.

264
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,220
I’m not used to it.

265
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,560
I’d better go help Elder Yueming prepare the medicine.

266
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:55,920
See...

267
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:56,820
See you.

268
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,560
I study hard every day

269
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,420
and am walking towards the peak of my life.

270
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,420
Li Chuyang is truly a master at instilling views in people.

271
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,580
By the way,

272
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,660
I just passed by Yunwei Villa

273
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,430
and found out

274
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:13,260
An Jingling was sending more men

275
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,350
to search for you.

276
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,290
You must be careful.

277
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:19,650
I didn't expect An Jingling

278
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,210
to be so crazy

279
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,680
and make you like this.

280
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,210
I'll teach him a lesson.

281
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,070
You can't go.

282
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,980
An Jingling is a devil now.

283
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,270
It's too dangerous.

284
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,390
Chuyue is right.

285
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,940
To deal with him,

286
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,030
we must use wisdom.

287
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,020
It's not the time yet.

288
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,300
Then,

289
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,730
what can I do for you?

290
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,550
To inquire about news and run errands?

291
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:42,500
Or

292
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,880
I'll give him a warning?

293
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:45,560
Bai Zhi.

294
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,180
Thank you for your kindness.

295
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,460
You should go back first.

296
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,900
If I need anything,

297
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,700
I'll tell you.

298
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,640
Okay, then.

299
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,220
Since you said so,

300
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,790
I'll go back first.

301
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,820
Call me if you need anything.

302
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,090
I’ll see her off.

303
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,190
He could actually suppress and neutralize my Art of Starshift.

304
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,400
What martial arts skills does he have?

305
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,500
Ling.

306
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,520
Mother.

307
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,890
Here, try these new clothes.

308
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,460
I don't lack clothes.

309
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,880
Mother, don’t bother.

310
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,560
You’ll be the Lord in a few days.

311
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,370
You should get more clothes.

312
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:19,620
My son is indeed the most handsome person in the world.

313
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,690
It's not in vain for me to endure half a lifetime of humiliation

314
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:23,750
when I see you can hold your head high.

315
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,460
Mother. I won't let you down.

316
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,560
I prayed for you in the temple and got this.

317
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,390
It can keep you safe forever

318
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,350
and make all your wishes come true.

319
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,470
To make all my wishes come true?

320
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,320
Are you still not over Li Chuyue?

321
00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:55,470
I advise you not to be infatuated

322
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
and ruin your future.

323
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,140
Mother, don't worry.

324
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,630
I know what to do.

325
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,010
I will get the position of lord

326
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:04,610
and Chuyue.

327
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,300
As long as I want it,

328
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,900
I will get it.

329
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,220
Mother.

330
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:14,280
Did Elder Yueming of the Evil Sect

331
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,060
mention the way to suppress and neutralize the Art of Starshift?

332
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,460
Why do you ask?

333
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,050
Could it be...

334
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,660
As far as I know,

335
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,100
when Elder Yueming was fighting inside the Evil Sect,

336
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,690
he tried to find a way

337
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,130
to suppress and neutralize the Art of Starshift,

338
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,460
but he couldn’t find it.

339
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,810
That’s why he sealed it up

340
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,320
and disappeared from the martial world.

341
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,390
Unless...

342
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,780
Impossible.

343
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,640
This is absolutely impossible.

344
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,280
Mother, don't worry.

345
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,280
An Jingzhao's moves

346
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,060
have the signs of suppressing and neutralizing the Art of Starshift,

347
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,260
but his power is weak.

348
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,540
As long as I get to the top level as soon as possible,

349
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,500
and get rid of An Jingzhao,

350
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,570
everything will be fine.

351
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:05,290
But you've consumed a lot of your internal force

352
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,900
for Li Chuyue.

353
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,700
You need to replenish it as soon as possible.

354
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,950
Greetings. Second Young Master of Yunwei Villa.

355
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,310
What can I do for you?

356
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,050
I'd like to borrow your internal force.

357
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,180
So it was you.

358
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,700
Young Lord.

359
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,730
An Jingling did it again.

360
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,220
If he keeps sucking others' internal force like this,

361
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,950
he'll get to the top level of the Art of Starshift,

362
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,820
then we won't be able to stop him.

363
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,430
When I fought him,

364
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,420
I found that his meridians were unstable.

365
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,050
Maybe we can find the flaw

366
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,890
and use it.

367
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,820
His meridians are unstable?

368
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,880
The Kungfu of our Beiming Sect

369
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,660
is characterized by slyness and ingenuity.

370
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:55,260
It's not required to stabilize the meridians.

371
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,570
Maybe it's because he has practiced the Profound Earth Sutra.

372
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,200
I'm just guessing.

373
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,360
But my Profound Earth Sutra

374
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,060
hasn't reached the highest level.

375
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,590
I can't give you the answer.

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,700
I need to go back and ask Father for proof.

377
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,460
Young Lord.

378
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,740
It’s a critical time for you to practice and recover.

379
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,340
It's not proper for you to go.

380
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:14,980
How about I go?

381
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,580
This can be a disguise.

382
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,660
I'll write to Grandmother now.

383
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,020
The guards sent a message

384
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,380
that Madam had taken someone to visit the Lord.

385
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,310
Who did she take?

386
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,900
All we know is that he's her old friend.

387
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:37,980
The guards said they'd never met that man

388
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,780
and that man looked unfamiliar.

389
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,180
At this time,

390
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,450
she must be up to something

391
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,700
to visit An Chenghu.

392
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:48,420
No way.

393
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,300
I have to meet them myself.

394
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:52,660
Go.

395
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,170
Prepare some desserts for me.

396
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:54,590
Yes.

397
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,500
Zhao is right.

398
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,450
The internal force of the rebellious son isn't from his childhood.

399
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:14,730
His meridians and internal force are both unstable.

400
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,290
He was still ensnared by the shortcut of absorbing others' internal forces,

401
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,130
relentlessly cultivating the Profound Heart Sutra.

402
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,070
There will be a hidden danger if the foundation is unstable.

403
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,620
This flaw can be used.

404
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,270
Can it help the Young Lord to suppress and neutralize the Art of Starshift?

405
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,560
Of course, it can.

406
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,180
I have some formulas.

407
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:46,780
Mother,

408
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,440
later, you must remember

409
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,520
to let that unfilial son

410
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,600
think the formulas are fragments of the Profound Earth Sutra.

411
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,420
Then, it will increase the danger

412
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,280
when he practices

413
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,380
and block his meridians.

414
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,060
My Lord. Don’t worry.

415
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,020
I will also teach the Young Lord the Yueming Sword Technique

416
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,740
to help him clear his name

417
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,900
and eliminate evil for the people.

418
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,480
Good.

419
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,510
The Yueming Sword?

420
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,380
Impossible!

421
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,540
Impossible!

422
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,600
Yueming.

423
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,620
It's really you.

424
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,020
I didn't expect you to be alive.

425
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:17,030
You...

426
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,190
How dare you work together to harm my Ling!

427
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:21,980
Ling.

428
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,060
Ling.

429
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,380
Ling.

430
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,820
Ling.

431
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,040
Elder Yueming.

432
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,790
Go through the secret passage.

433
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,740
Hurry!

434
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,200
-Hurry up and go.
-See you.

435
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:32,580
Guards!

436
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,220
Yes.

437
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,940
Ling.

438
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:38,500
Go.

439
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,160
My Lord.

440
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:40,690
Bring Madam Shen back.

441
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,580
Kill her!

442
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,140
Don't let her meet that unfilial son.

443
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,220
Make her shut up.

444
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,260
Yes.

445
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:53,740
Ling.

446
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,220
Ling.

447
00:25:59,420 --> 00:25:59,980
Ling.

448
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,090
Ling.

449
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:10,860
Ling.

450
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:11,660
Ling.

451
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,660
Ling.

452
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,260
Mother.

453
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,740
Mother!

454
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,320
Mother!

455
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,700
Leave them alive.

456
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,060
Mother.

457
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:39,990
It's okay.

458
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,000
I'll find the pharmacist for you.

459
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,220
I'll find the pharmacist.

460
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,700
No.

461
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,940
Ling...

462
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,300
Be careful of

463
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,500
Yue...

464
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,020
Yue...

465
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,300
Yue...

466
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,500
Mother.

467
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,300
Mother!

468
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,460
Mother!

469
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,010
Mother!

470
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,130
Mother!

471
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,380
Mother.

472
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,200
[Yun]

473
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,540
[Yunwei Villa]

474
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,060
Whom did the Madam take with her?

475
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,360
Have you found out?

476
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,500
Not yet.

477
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,790
Ling...

478
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,180
Be careful of

479
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,320
Yue...

480
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,180
Yue...

481
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,300
Yue...

482
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,980
Yue?

483
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:07,260
Chuyue?

484
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,940
Why did you treat me like this?

485
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,500
Young Master.

486
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,330
The assassin sneaked into the Lord's mansion

487
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:26,490
and disappeared.

488
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:29,770
Father?

489
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,010
Good.

490
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:37,570
He killed my mother while I was gone!

491
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,150
Don't blame me for being rude.

492
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:56,900
Tell me.

493
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,210
Who came to see you today?

494
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:01,220
What are you up to?

495
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,070
You won't tell me?

496
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,060
If you don't, die!

497
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:12,980
Unfilial son!

498
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,380
Fine.

499
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:18,240
I'll show you what an unfilial son is like.

500
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,210
Tell me.

501
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,250
Who came to see you today?

502
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,660
Why did you kill my mother?

503
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:31,150
You still won't tell?

504
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:47,920
You...

505
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,460
That's right.

506
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,570
What I fed you

507
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,260
was poison.

508
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,080
Do you think you'll be fine if you spit it out?

509
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,460
You drink

510
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
this poison every day.

511
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,540
It's just that the amount was so small that you didn't notice.

512
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,950
This is the nourishing prescription I got for my father.

513
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:19,750
Please make it and feed it to my father every day.

514
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,040
Father is getting weaker.

515
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,710
Starting today,

516
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,660
double the amount of the nourishing medicine.

517
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,140
Yes.

518
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,300
Guards!

519
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,380
Guards!

520
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,700
Guards?

521
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,640
Your guards have already become dead.

522
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:58,980
You'll be with them soon.

523
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,060
Vicious wife!

524
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,500
Vicious son!

525
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,350
Every time I wanted to kill you,

526
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,740
I couldn't bear to do it.

527
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,980
How could you say that?

528
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:17,480
The situation we are in today

529
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,210
is all your doing.

530
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,020
Mother loved you so much,

531
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,140
but you abandoned her,

532
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,940
quickly casting her aside.

533
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,860
We became the vicious wife

534
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,600
and the vicious son

535
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,740
all because you forced us to.

536
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,780
You probably forgot.

537
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,210
That winter,

538
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,940
on the family reunion day,

539
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,640
Mother was making clothes

540
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,660
and preparing snacks

541
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,780
for you.

542
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,980
But you made us

543
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,180
stand in the snow until midnight.

544
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,110
It was so cold that day.

545
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,140
My hands

546
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,220
and feet

547
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
lost consciousness.

548
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,320
But in my ears,

549
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:10,730
I could hear

550
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,350
your laughter, as well as An Jingzhao and his mother's laughter.

551
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,180
From that day on,

552
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,910
I realized

553
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:25,490
no matter how gentle my mother was,

554
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,220
and how hard I tried,

555
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,630
as long as with An Jingzhao and his mother,

556
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:32,900
you would never value us.

557
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:37,450
At that time, I was wondering

558
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,460
whether you would cherish my mother

559
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,590
and treat both me and An Jingzhao equally

560
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:50,260
if An Jingzhao's mother were no longer here.

561
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,420
Mother must think the same.

562
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,660
That's why she made the soup

563
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,660
and asked me to deliver it to First Madam.

564
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:08,380
I was only eight years old that year.

565
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,070
What have you done?

566
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,230
My mother did the right thing.

567
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:29,000
First Madam must die.

568
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,750
All of this is the evil consequence you sowed.

569
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:38,400
Compared to you,

570
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:42,460
we're not that cruel.

571
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,220
Seeing you like this,

572
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,700
I feel quite joyful.

573
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,140
Don't worry.

574
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:59,940
I'll take good care of Yunwei Villa for you.

575
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
I will send your beloved An Jingzhao

576
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,740
to see you.

577
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,290
Your family of three

578
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,690
can continue to have fun in the Netherworld.

579
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,420
Don't thank me for helping you.

580
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,800
You...

581
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,250
You...

582
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,310
You...

583
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:23,719
You...

584
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:41,320
You...

585
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,739
You...

586
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,240
Looks like you still can't rest in peace.

587
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,100
That's great.

588
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,180
Guards!

589
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,820
Guards!

590
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,960
I heard that some chiefs have been seeking justice for An Jingzhao

591
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,180
and frequently meet the Lord in private.

592
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,850
Who is the leader?

593
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,440
The chief of Qingyun Hall.

594
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,980
Ask him to come.

595
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,710
Tell him that the Lord wants to see him.

596
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:43,100
Yes.

597
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,980
Father, did you see that?

598
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,320
In terms of martial arts and strategies,

599
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,460
An Jingzhao is not as good as me.

600
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,230
This...

601
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,830
Why did so many people die?

602
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,100
So miserable.

603
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:42,900
How could this happen?

604
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,560
Chief Zhou.

605
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,160
Who did this?

606
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:49,180
What's going on?

607
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,120
Second Young Master.

608
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,520
Why did you do so?

609
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,550
Last night, the Chief of Qingyun Hall, under the pretext of discussing a meeting,

610
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:01,130
led his subordinates to rebel in the middle of the night,

611
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:02,790
forced my father to abdicate,

612
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,820
and attempted to seize the throne.

613
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,150
My father wouldn't obey

614
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,180
and was persecuted by that old villain.

615
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,560
When I arrived after I got the news,

616
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,260
my father was already...

617
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,120
My father's last words

618
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,140
were to eliminate the treacherous party

619
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,400
and restore the villa.

620
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,120
This is the list of conspirators I found in the chief's mansion

621
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,690
according to my father's order.

622
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,390
Of course, I know

623
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,060
many people on the list

624
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:41,160
were deceived by the old chief.

625
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,000
If you are willing to continue to support the villa,

626
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,520
I won't hold you accountable.

627
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,430
But...

628
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,620
This is not the time to act on impulse.

629
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,390
Young Master.

630
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,540
The monk who's going to perform the ritual for Her Ladyship has arrived.

631
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,200
Accommodate the chiefs here.

632
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,890
The villa's funeral will take three days.

633
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:09,660
We'll discuss other matters after the funeral.

634
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:28,430
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do this time.

635
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,230
Father,

636
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,940
I acted rashly

637
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,480
and caused your death.

638
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,940
I failed to protect the villa.

639
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,430
I failed to protect you.

640
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,900
It was all my fault.

641
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,120
The Lord’s death has nothing to do with you, Young Lord.

642
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:31,710
I saw that the Lord's eyes were yellowish,

643
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,270
and his breath was weak.

644
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:36,210
After I checked his pulse, I knew he had been poisoned for a long time.

645
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,350
He was dying.

646
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,620
But hasn't the poison in my father's body

647
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,080
been detoxified long ago?

648
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,060
Judging from his condition,

649
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,260
he had taken drugs for months.

650
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,290
It seems that An Jingling and his mother had planned to rebel.

651
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,480
I didn't expect him to be so scheming.

652
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,740
It's horrible.

653
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,460
Father.

654
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,820
I will avenge you

655
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,900
and get rid of the evil in the martial world.

656
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:13,760
Elder Yueming.

657
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,660
Recently,

658
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,860
my cultivation hasn't improved at all.

659
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,540
The two streams of primordial energy in my body

660
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,940
are still incompatible.

661
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,180
If this continues,

662
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,640
how can I avenge my father?

663
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:25,520
There is an elixir in my sect

664
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,730
called Power Dissipating Elixir.

665
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,820
This elixir can dissolve unharmonious internal forces.

666
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,820
But this elixir is rare.

667
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,540
It has always been owned by the Lord of our sect.

668
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,260
I see.

669
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,880
I'll go to Hongfei.

670
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,460
Chuyue.

671
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,650
Don't worry about me.

672
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,390
Hang in there.

673
00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:42,400
I'll be right back.

674
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:42,950
Donghua.

675
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:43,940
Come with me.

676
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,300
Okay.

677
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,050
Mr. Yueming.

678
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,780
Please take care of An Jingzhao.

679
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,510
Don't worry.

680
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,590
What is the reason behind this?

681
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:39,780
I have something important to report.

682
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:43,660
Go ahead.
