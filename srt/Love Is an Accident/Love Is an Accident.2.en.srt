[Yunwei Villa]

5
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,980
What is the principle behind this?

6
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,440
I only know that water flows from high to low.

7
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,970
How can it go up?

8
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,130
This is

9
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,890
a basic science in my place.

10
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,220
The principle is the expansion of hot air and contraction of cold air in the atmosphere.

11
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,530
When the candles are burning,

12
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,520
some air expands due to heating

13
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,800
and runs out of the cup.

14
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,410
Then the flame will extinguish due to lack of oxygen,

15
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,340
and the air in the cup will cool down quickly

16
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,340
and reduce the pressure.

17
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,010
So the normal air pressure outside

18
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,670
will squeeze the water in the plate into the cup.

19
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,650
Send someone capable

20
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,290
to tell Second Young Master about this.

21
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,730
Yes.

22
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,830
You're smart.

23
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,930
She actually knows how to make the water flow in reverse.

24
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:13,980
Do you think she works for Zhou Wei?

25
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,360
Young Lord,

26
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,990
I don’t know.

27
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,520
Do you remember

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,780
the medicine we got in Beiming?

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,820
It is said that after taking the medicine,

30
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,170
people would become unconscious

31
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,150
and defenseless.

32
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,780
They would only tell the truth.

33
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,510
Give it to me.

34
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes.

35
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,260
Young Lord,

36
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,410
you should believe

37
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,940
I'm not an assassin, right?

38
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,850
We have many high technologies.

39
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,810
If you need anything,

40
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:42,570
just tell me.

41
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,290
Young Lord.

42
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:53,530
You must be thirsty.

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,460
Have some tea.

44
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,960
Is the tea poisonous?

45
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,160
Young Lord,

46
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,830
you promised not to kill me.

47
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,490
You have to keep your promise.

48
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,920
I won't break my promise.

49
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,270
This is just a cup of ordinary tea.

50
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,000
Young Lord,

51
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,070
you are so handsome.

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,580
You're mature like a middle-aged man,

53
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,810
but you also have tender skin and a beautiful appearance like a young man.

54
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,040
You have a beauty buff

55
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,070
and countless buffs.

56
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,470
You have a powerful aura.

57
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,930
Even your bodyguard

58
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,600
has a strong aura.

59
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,690
Not only are you handsome,

60
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,820
but also very smart.

61
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,400
You should have known

62
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,250
I'm not an assassin.

63
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,620
I won’t drink the tea.

64
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:01,930
Young Lord,

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,130
the medicine has taken effect.

66
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,000
Tell me.

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,420
Who are you?

68
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,330
My name is Li Chuyue.

69
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,850
I'm a delicate piggy girl.

70
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,250
I am poor.

71
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,600
Young Lord.

72
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,970
Is she stupid

73
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,180
to commet on herself like that?

74
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,770
Do you know martial arts?

75
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,360
Yes.

76
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,740
Of course.

77
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,210
I know a tactic called seduction.

78
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,090
I may not be pretty,

79
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,930
but I'm quite elegant.

80
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,760
Look.

81
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,720
My long legs.

82
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,480
My perfect swan neck.

83
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,770
Are you working for Zhou Wei?

84
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,700
Why are you here?

85
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,140
Let me say it again.

86
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,780
I'm from another world.

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,250
I'm not an assassin.

88
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,550
I don't know Zhou Wei.

89
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,520
I slept well

90
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,870
and suddenly fell here.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,830
But I have my own purposes.

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,490
My first purpose

93
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,870
is to become a fashion designer.

94
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,900
The second purpose is a bit evil.

95
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,950
I want to pursue a man.

96
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,310
Young Lord.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,050
Are you unwell?

98
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,850
Why are you blushing?

99
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,070
No.

100
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,590
You've never been like this.

101
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:46,610
You must be sick.

102
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,860
I'll get the doctor.

103
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,730
I said no.

104
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,460
No need to go.

105
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:53,140
I don't think she works for Zhou Wei.

106
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,590
But her identity is still suspicious.

107
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,190
Before we find out the truth,

108
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,020
lock her in the guest room.

109
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,700
She can't go anywhere.

110
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,680
Yes.

111
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,270
Take care of yourself, Young Lord.

112
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:06,590
Guards.

113
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,260
Stand up.

114
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,730
Let's go.

115
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,450
Brother,

116
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:19,690
your method is really effective.

117
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,920
Doctor Luo agreed to see us at Xu River tomorrow.

118
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,900
But he guessed

119
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,820
that I’m not the Young Lord of Yunwei Villa.

120
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,150
You need to go in person.

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,600
But who

122
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,980
came up with this idea?

123
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,670
I didn't expect you to have such an expert.

124
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,890
She's just an orphan I took in from outside.

125
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,560
She knows some tricks.

126
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,800
She happened to know the method.

127
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,890
Ling, are you going

128
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,550
to visit Auntie today, right?

129
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,510
I have some cakes here.

130
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,240
Take them to her when you leave.

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,530
Thank you for your concern.

132
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,060
But Lingxiao Yard is now surrounded by Zhou Wei's spies.

133
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,590
How can we escape from them?

134
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,520
I have my own way.

135
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,060
It's getting late.

136
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,160
Auntie must be waiting.

137
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:05,700
Go now.

138
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,900
See you.

139
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,860
No way.

140
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,940
I have to find a way out.

141
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,190
If I stay like this,

142
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,420
I don't know how that evil Young Lord

143
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,340
would treat me.

144
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,340
I might die.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,780
Anyone there?

146
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,490
Let me out!

147
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,039
Young Lord ordered

148
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,520
that you can't leave here.

149
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,700
Sir,

150
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,080
I need to go to the toilet.

151
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,820
Let me out.

152
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,350
You can solve it in the room.

153
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:46,810
You...

154
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,960
This Young Lord is really cruel,

155
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,980
ruthless.

156
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,940
and inhumane.

157
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,880
Don’t slander Young Lord.

158
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,280
Our Young Lord is handsome

159
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,120
and benevolent.

160
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,180
He cares about the servants the most.

161
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
Good-looking men

162
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:02,060
are indeed bad.

163
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,080
Even his servants worship him because of his looks.

164
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,770
My stomach hurts.

165
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,000
It hurts so much.

166
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,390
It hurts so much.

167
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,870
I'm dying.

168
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,740
You...

169
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,460
Don't lie to me.

170
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,810
Listen,

171
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,590
Your Young Lord told you to lock me up.

172
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,250
But he didn’t say he wanted me dead.

173
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,390
If anything happens to me,

174
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,130
your Young Lord will blame you

175
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:30,520
and kick you out.

176
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,890
Not to mention promotion and salary raises,

177
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,920
you can’t even see

178
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,480
your beautiful Young Lord.

179
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,520
Wait.

180
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,280
Since you are serving in the inner courtyard,

181
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,940
why haven't I seen you before?

182
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,400
I'm new here.

183
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,880
So I don't look familiar.

184
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,420
I have something to do.

185
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,370
I have to go.

186
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,740
Yunwei Villa

187
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:27,530
only replaces servants on the second day of every month.

188
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:28,590
How did you come in?

189
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,250
Tell me.

190
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,960
Who are you?

191
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,060
Actually,

192
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,870
I want to be the Young Lord's servant.

193
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,460
As expected of the man I like,

194
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,980
you're good in all aspects.

195
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,530
Ling.

196
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:16,610
Take it to Auntie.

197
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,430
Thank you, Brother.

198
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,570
Brother.

199
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,130
If others treat you like this,

200
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,150
you would be angry.

201
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,930
You want to be my servant?

202
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,200
It seems he didn’t recognize me.

203
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,700
He looks like a straight man.

204
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,090
I just need to find a way

205
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,250
to make him despise me.

206
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,590
Then he will kick me out.

207
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,250
Yes.

208
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,060
Young Lord.

209
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:04,530
I’ve loved you for a long time.

210
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,400
You look handsome

211
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,780
and make me fascinated.

212
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,480
That's great.

213
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,360
Looks like your seduction ability

214
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,540
is just so-so.

215
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,530
So you recognized me long ago.

216
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,130
And you played me on purpose.

217
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,410
Young Lord,

218
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
please let me go.

219
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,860
I'm not an assassin.

220
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,360
No.

221
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,060
I won't let you go

222
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,980
before I find out about your identity.

223
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,820
But I can give you a chance.

224
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,670
I want you to make a deal with me.

225
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,270
Didn't you say

226
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,590
you came from another world

227
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,920
and you wanted to find a way home?

228
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,210
If you complete this deal with me,

229
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,260
I can lend you my bedroom.

230
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
You put a knife on my shoulder,

231
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,840
then gave me tea

232
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,810
which I don't know what was in.

233
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,520
How can I trust you?

234
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,010
I have to get out of here.

235
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,550
It's more important to survive first.

236
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,610
I'll worry about other things later.

237
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:18,550
What deal?

238
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,620
We're going on a picnic tomorrow.

239
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,520
Act with me,

240
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,230
pretending to be lovey-dovey,

241
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,760
A picnic?

242
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,110
Then I'll have a chance to escape.

243
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,050
Deal.

244
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,340
Donghua.

245
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,010
Young Lord.

246
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,020
Get someone

247
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,140
to take her to the guest room.

248
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,470
Yes.

249
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,240
Come here.

250
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,980
Take her back to the guest room.

251
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,790
Young Lord.

252
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,300
Do you really want to use this girl?

253
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,970
Her background is unknown.

254
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,570
If anything goes wrong,

255
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,150
our operation may fail.

256
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,220
She may be a smooth talker,

257
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,920
but she's actually very timid.

258
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,050
In order to survive,

259
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,350
she will cooperate.

260
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,000
Besides, this girl is quite interesting.

261
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,580
I'd like to see

262
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,710
what she's up to next.

263
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:19,780
Yes.

264
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:20,940
Understood.

265
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,020
Tomorrow,

266
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,750
prepare a boat at the back door of the bamboo forest house.

267
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,600
You must be careful.

268
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,660
Don’t let Zhou Wei’s people find out.

269
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,470
Don’t worry.

270
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,540
Besides,

271
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,220
take my token

272
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,370
to Mr. Si Xing, the Chief Judicial Inspector.

273
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,370
I helped him once.

274
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,040
Ask him about the Jiayu case.

275
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:41,250
Yes.

276
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,220
I'll do it.

277
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,100
[Black Eagle Hall]

278
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,250
Godfather.

279
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,520
Godfather.

280
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,150
Zhi.

281
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,730
Godfather.

282
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
Do you know that Jingzhao

283
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,820
favored an unknown woman

284
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,650
and he wants to take her on a picnic?

285
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,180
I wanted to solve it myself,

286
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,930
but he wouldn't let me enter Lingxiao Yard.

287
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,940
Godfather, you promised

288
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,740
you would let me marry Jingzhao.

289
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,580
You have to find a way to get rid of that girl.

290
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,000
Zhi.

291
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:16,130
A person who wants to achieve great things needs to calm down.

292
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,140
An Jingzhao will only be fond of

293
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,160
that girl for a few days.

294
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:21,570
Don't mind it.

295
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,500
The position of Young Madam of Yunwei Villa

296
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,190
can't be someone else's.

297
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,660
Godfather, you taught me

298
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,230
that whoever gets in the way

299
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,230
should be killed.

300
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,610
Now Li Chuyue is in my way.

301
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,340
Why do you want me to calm down?

302
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,070
I don't care.

303
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:37,180
You must kill her.

304
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,580
Don't worry.

305
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,800
I will give you an explanation.

306
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,450
But it's not the time yet.

307
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,930
All right.

308
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:48,980
I'm tired.

309
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,440
Go back.

310
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,770
Find some good fighters.

311
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,430
Once that woman is alone tomorrow,

312
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,690
kill her immediately.

313
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,370
My Lady, maybe the Second Lord is right

314
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,610
that the Young Lord will only be fond of that girl for a few days.

315
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,420
That girl is very uninhibited.

316
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,690
I'm afraid Jingzhao wouldn't be able to refuse her

317
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,420
since he knew nothing about love.

318
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,510
I can’t keep this girl.

319
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,260
Is Young Lord still a virgin?

320
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:22,720
Then he wouldn't be able to refuse her.

321
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,960
I'll do it right away.

323
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,060
Is there anything better?

324
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,030
Young Lord,

325
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
these are

326
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,260
made of good fabric.

327
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,160
Bring me the one my mother made.

for the future Young Madam.

331
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:52,910
It doesn't matter.

332
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,370
She will only wear it once.

333
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,160
Ask Yuan Shu to bring that dress.

334
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,220
Yes.

335

Young Lord.

336
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,050
The dress is here.

337
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,160
Okay.

Tell the cleaner

not to move the books on the table.

341
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,530
There's a confidential document inside.

I’ve checked it.

347
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,140
I’m foolish.

348

What's going on?

349
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,140
A few days ago,

350
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,010
I smelled a fragrance

351
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,420
on Yuan Shu.

352
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,140
It was very light.

353
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,980
I was not sure.

354
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,300
I smelled it again just now.

355
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,570
This time, I'm sure.

356
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,380
His fragrance

357
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,540
is the same as that of the incense Zhou Wei burned.

358
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,990
The Yuan Shu who has been working for me for over ten years

359
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,940
has become Zhou Wei's spy.

360
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,210
Miss.

361
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,080

Can you clock the time for me?

365
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,350
What?

366
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,670
What time is it?

The material is exquisite.

00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,450
The color is full.

379
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,490
The patterns on it

380
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,020
are created by weaving thousands of threads.

381
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,100
From combing the warp and weft threads

382
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,310
to the final weaving,

383
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,380
this is even more complex than computer programming.

384
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,130
Amazing.

385
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,800
Is it beautiful?

386
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,280
Yes.

387
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:31,070
[Yunwei Villa]

388
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:31,890
Be careful.

389
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,190
It’s fast.

390
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,900
Young Lord.

391
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,290
Miss Chuyue is here.

392
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,260
This dress is pretty,

393
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,080
but it's inconvenient to put on.

394
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,380
From now on,

395
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,940
you must act well.

396
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,410
Don't make any mistakes.

397
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,690
I'll please this despicable man first

398
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,690
and act well

399
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:41,490
to make him careless.

400
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,550
Then I'll find a chance to escape.

401
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,800
Young Lord. Don’t worry.

402
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,470
I’ll do my best.

403
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,040
Young Lord.

404
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,300
Why did you hurt me?

405
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,660
What did I do to you?

406
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,020
My heart hurts because of my love for you.

407
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,960
Take the shortcut.

408
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,110
Go wait for Young Lord and Young Madam.

409
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,770
Yes.

410
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,250
Are you really 22 years old?

411
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,540
Yes.

412
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,570
I just graduated from university this year.

413
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:31,810
If you are 22,

414
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,280
you must have a child.

415
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,490
No, I'm still a baby.

416
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,640
Your child is still young?

417
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,040
No.

418
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,220
I don't have a child.

419
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,290
In my hometown,

420
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,380
people of my age

421
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,090
can call themselves babies.

422
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,940
People from your hometown are so shameless.

423
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,250
You're good at speaking sweet words.

424
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,430
You must be married.

425
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,490
No.

426
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,900
Everyone in my hometown

427
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,290
can say such things.

428
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,460
It's very common.

429
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,670
People from your hometown

430
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,380
are not only shameless

431
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,490
but also speak so casually about these things.

432
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,550
It's disgraceful.

433
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,410
What do you know?

434
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:26,930
Slow down.

435
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,250
Stop!

436
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,130
Mother.

437
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:32,330
Slow down.

438
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:48,980
All right.

439
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:52,530
Be careful.

440
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,240
Give me this.

441
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,750
Watch your head.

442
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,810
Young Lord.

443
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:09,420
Go make tea.

444
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,130
Yes.

445
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,160
Be careful!

446
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,850
Kid.

447
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,140
Here.

448
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,710
Try it.

449
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,150
Isn't it delicious?

450
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,440
Even your emperor doesn't have this.

451
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,270
Do me a favor.

452
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:42,760
What is it?

453
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,110
Come.

454
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,350
Go play over there.

455
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:54,560
Slow down.

456
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,330
Slow down.

457
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:10,690
All right.

458
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,590
If you do this well,

459
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,490
I'll give you all the candies.

460
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,020
OK?

461
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,280
Go.

462
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:22,190
Slow down.

463
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,330
Young Lord.

464
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:33,540
It’s a great spring.

465
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,410
Why don't we play hide and seek?

466
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,220
I’ll play it with you if you want.

467
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,320
But you have great martial arts skills.

468
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,050
You can find me wherever I hide.

469
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,200
It'll be boring.

470
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,770
How do you want to play it?

471
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,560
Cover your eyes

472
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,960
until you find me.

473
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,270
Sure.

474
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,820
But since it's a game,

475
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,620
we need to decide on who's the winner

476
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,820
and bet on something.

477
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,900
If you can't find me,

478
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,300
give me gold and jewelry.

479
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,660
If you find me,

480
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,630
you can hit my head with your finger.

481
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,650
Like this, right?

482
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:17,940
Alright.

483
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,420
Young Lord.

484
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,750
You can only move when you count to 20.

485
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,150
Start.

486
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,610
One.

487
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,120
Two.

488
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,020
Three.

489
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,580
Four.

490
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:31,890
Five.

491
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,320
Six.

492
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,130
Seven.

493
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:36,700
Eight.

494
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,760
Nine.

495
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,330
Ten.

496
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:41,980
Eleven.

497
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,460
Twelve.

498
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,270
-Go.
-Thirteen.

499
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:47,050
Fourteen.

500
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,570
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen.

501
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,230
Eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

502
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,710
I finally escaped.

503
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:04,460
There's no human aura.

504
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:08,390
It seems like a cunning fox.

505
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,640
Not a fox?

506
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,500
I won.

507
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,620
Since you lost,

508
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,930
shouldn't you admit defeat?

509
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,020
It will hurt.

510
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:42,700
It will hurt.

511
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,830
Afraid of pain?

512
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,960
If you are afraid of pain, there are different punishments.

513
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,020
Will you accept it?

514
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:51,390
Come on.

515
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,550
Close your eyes.

516
00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:14,450
What're you doing?

517
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,430
Punishing you.

518
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:17,780
Does it hurt?

519
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,250
Why are you so reluctant if it doesn't hurt?

520
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,100
The tea is almost ready.

521
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,170
Let's go.

522
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,530
Move it over there.

523
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,080
Let me do it.

524
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,720
Young Lord.

525
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,380
Young Lord.

526
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,970
He seems to have no heartbeat.

527
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,070
I might die myself.

528
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,440
Why should I care about him?

529
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,570
I'll run away first.

530
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,310
His heart really stopped beating.

531
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:03,070
What are you doing?

532
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,510
Your heart stopped beating just now.

533
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,930
I'm doing CPR for you.

534
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,850
CPR?

535
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,490
It's a way to save people in my hometown.

536
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,370
Why didn't you have a heartbeat?

537
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I was practicing my internal force.

538
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:23,800
The breath and heartbeat naturally became weaker.

539
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,380
I should have run away earlier.

540
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,670
What did you say?

541
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,170
Nothing.

542
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:37,730
If I get this despicable man drunk,

543
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,440
I can escape.

544
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,250
Young Lord.

545
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,830
It’s such a beautiful day.

546
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:46,480
Why don't we have a drink?

547
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
What do you think?

548
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,310
Sure.

549
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,000
Since it's such a beautiful day,

550
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,900
how can I drink alone?

551
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,400
Why don't you drink with me?

552
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,800
I'm allergic to alcohol.

553
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,290
I'll have rashes all over my body after drinking.

554
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,050
How about tea instead of wine?

555
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,880
Alright.

556
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:12,610
Serve the tea.

557
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,870
What the hell?

558
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,680
Why is the tea so bitter?

559
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:08,280
Young Lord.

560
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,489
Young Lord.

561
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,580
Does the tea you just drank

562
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,110
taste bitter?

563
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,230
Yes.

564
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,179
The tea has poison in it.

565
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:36,070
If I'm right,

566
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,860
it should be the Seven-Step Soul-Breaking Powder.

567
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:39,929
You will die in half an hour.

568
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,170
Do you feel hot in your chest

569
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,500
but your limbs are cold?

570
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:45,850
Yes.

571
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,150
Young Lord.

572
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,100
I’m only 22.

573
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,860
I don’t want to die.

574
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:51,489
Young Lord,

575
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,090
you must have a way to save me.

576
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,380
I've been poisoned by this toxin before.

577
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,170
But at that time,

578
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,980
I took hundreds of rare herbs

579
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,090
to save my life.

580
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:00,880
Now,

581
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,460
there is only one way.

582
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:05,450
I have an antidote

583
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:07,260
within my body for this kind of poison.

584
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,170
You need to have direct physical contact with my limbs to detoxify.

585
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,170
Is it that simple?

586
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,390
Are you lying to me?

587
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,620
Why would I lie to you?

588
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,390
If you don't believe me, you can do whatever you want.

589
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,560
Is that okay?

590
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,610
If you only hold my hand,

591
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:26,810
before the poison has been detoxified, you will...

592
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,010
Fortunately, the poison was detoxified.

593
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,200
I survived.

594
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,110
Don't drink it.

595
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:00,630
The tea is poisonous.

596
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,000
Throw it up.

597
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,010
Throw it up.

598
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,570
I'm not lying.

599
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,170
Do you feel

600
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:08,520
your stomach feels hot after drinking it?

601
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,340
Miss.

602
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,520
It's not poisonous.

603
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,210
It’s bitter because

604
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,470
Young Lord asked me to add some selfheal.

605
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,960
You despicable man.

606
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,690
You lied to me again and again.

607
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,170
No.

608
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,640
I have to find a way to leave.

609
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:33,370
If I don't leave now, I'll be fooled to death by this despicable man.

610
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,140
Come on.

611
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,460
The horse ran away!

612
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,890
Chase the horse!

613
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,430
Hurry!

614
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,940
Split up to look for it!

615
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,900
Hurry up!

616
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,630
What's going on? Hurry!

617
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,400
Help!

618
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:15,460
Hurry!

619
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,400
Go after it!

620
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:15,050
Young Lord.

621
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,550
I won’t run away, OK?

622
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,420
Do you have to kill me?

623
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,820
Since I asked you to act with me,

624
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,620
why would I kill you?

625
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:44,070
Young Lord,

626
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,010
you’re so skilled.

627
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:45,860
We will be fine.

628
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:46,340
Right?

629
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,740
Of course, I'll be fine.

630
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,610
I don’t know about you.

631
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:49,210
Young Lord,

632
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:50,120
if you save me,

633
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,230
I'll listen to you.

634
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,970
I promise I won't run away again.

635
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:53,900
If I lie again,

636
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,840
I can never be a designer.

637
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,400
Crescent Arrow.

638
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,910
It's only available in Fengnuan Pavilion.

639
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:17,550
Bai Zhi,

640
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,560
you're too cruel.

641
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,910
Did they leave?

642
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,210
No.

643
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:34,950
They're aiming at you.

644
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,140
Don't move.

645
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:37,950
Who are they?

646
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,090
Why did they kill me?

647
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,010
Ask yourself.

648
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,410
Who did you offend?

649
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:42,620
How could I

650
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,250
offend people in this world?

651
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,260
You'd better hold me tight

652
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,530
so that I can protect you.
