00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,680
Second Lord.

5
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,060
An Jingzhao was shot by an arrow and fell off the cliff.

6
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,060
Where is the body?

7
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,340
What did I tell you?

8
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,070
If he's dead, I need to see his body.

9
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,410
Don't worry, Second Lord.

10
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,130
My poisonous arrow hit
right in An Jingzhao's chest.

11
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:04,560
The arrow was smeared with Soul-seizing Powder.

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,760
Even superficial wounds can be lethal.

13
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,229
There's no way An Jingzhao could survive.

14
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,750
Alright.

15
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,770
You may leave now.

16
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,240
You're allowed to unite
with your family tomorrow.

17
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,870
Thank you, Second Lord.

18
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,700
From now on,

19
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,710
I'm at your command.

20
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,490
Chief Li, are you changing your mind?

21
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,910
I broke my promise and killed my old master.

22
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,990
There's no way
that Yuwei Hall will still accept me.

23
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm willing to serve you

24
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,680
to protect our family.

25
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:39,930
Okay.

26
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:41,800
You may leave.

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,470
Yes.

28
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,490
Li Qing was telling the truth.

29
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,240
My men saw it clearly.

30
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,590
But I will always feel uneasy

31
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,670
as long as An Jingzhao's body is missing.

32
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,470
If An Jingzhao is still alive,

33
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:07,210
I have a way to lure him out.

34
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,160
Shoot.

35
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,750
Exactly the same.

36
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,860
There must be a connection.

37
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,100
It's thundering.

38
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
We can go home now.

39
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
Brother-in-law.

40
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,060
Cool.

41
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,420
It's really cool.

42
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,490
Did something happen in the villa?

43
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,370
Ling is in trouble.

44
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,940
I need to go back to the villa.

45

46
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:52,350
Yes.

47
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,610
Send them back first.

48
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,200
No.

49
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,450
I want to go with you.

50
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:55,900
No.

51
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,280
It must be dangerous this time.

52
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,210
You must go back.

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,230
Your Fashion Week is about to start, isn't it?

54
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,180
Don't worry.

55
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:06,590
I will come back safely.

00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,190
No way.

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,470

Good.

70
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,960
If An Jingzhao is still alive,

71
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,580
with his personality,

72
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,310
he will definitely come back to rescue him.

73

How have you been?

77
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:35,820
Who are you?

78
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,680
Who sent you here?

79
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,540
It's me.

81
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:47,530
I sent him here.

Zhao fell into the water.

83
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,020
We don't even know if he's still alive.

84
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,680
Now you want to kill Ling, too.

85
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,710
Are you really that desperate?

86
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,310
I...

87
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:58,530
Why are your men here?

88
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,990
If my men hadn't arrived in time,

89
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,110
Ling…

90
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,400
might have been dead by now.

91
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,340
Madam, you wronged me.

92
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,690
I sent them to protect Second Young Master.

93
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,030
We are on the same side.

94
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,830
It's a misunderstanding.

95
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,770
Get lost.

96
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,390
Madam.

97
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,910
I'm also very sad

99
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,110
I've sent my men to search for him
to the best of my abilities.

Please don't worry.

101
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,980
I dare not accept your kindness.

102
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:42,179
As long as you don't kill us all.

103
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,000
Go ahead.

104
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,340
Goodbye.

105
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,040

[Yunwei Villa]

109
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,740
Grandmother.

110
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:08,550
I'm poisoned by Cold Ice Toxin.

111
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,260
I'm afraid I can't hold on.

112
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:12,860
Zhao,

113
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,620
there is no antidote for the Cold Ice Toxin,

114
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,940
but there is a spell to cure it.

115
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,470
Let me tell you the formula.

116
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,430
As long as you cultivate it every day,

117
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,730
you'll be able to transform your energy and spirit,

118
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,190
and replace Yin with Yang.

119
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,750
The toxin will be removed within 100 days.

120
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,230
Try it.

121
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,050
How do you feel?

122
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:52,200
Much better.

123
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,180
The Profound Earth Sutra is indeed amazing.

124
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,910
That's good.

125
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,150
As long as you're not attacked by the coldness,

126
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,180
you will definitely recover.

127
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,620
By the way, Grandmother,

128
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,460
how did you see through Zhou Wei's plot?

129
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,550
Every man has a fool in his sleeve.

130
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,100
I know Zhou Wei well.

131
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,410
If he really wanted to hurt Ling,

132
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,560
he must have concealed his plans well.

133
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,040
He made such a big fuss

134
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,260
and cut a splash

135
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,030
just to force you to show yourself.

136
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,900
Grandmother, you're so perceptive.

137
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,830
Unfortunately,

138
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,670
when I saw through it,

139
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,530
your men had sent the message to you.

140
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,010
So, I had no choice but to confuse him.

141
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,270
Zhou Wei is not that easy to be fooled.

142
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,270
You can't stay here for long.

143
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,460
When there is a thunderstorm,

144
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,190
you should leave immediately.

145
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
Grandmother.

146
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,060
After I leave,

147
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,430
please keep this stone safe.

148
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:55,740
Okay.

149
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,760
Don't worry.

150
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,910
I'll be back soon.

151
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,240
Okay.

152
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,780
By the way, Grandmother,

153
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,170
I have another question for you.

154
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,690
Do you recognize this?

155
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,130
Where did you get it?

156
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,100
This is

157
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,100
the totem on the chain that Zhou Wei used

158
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,580
to lock my father.

159
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,300
I wondered why it was so familiar.

160
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,630
It turns out Zhou Wei is…

161
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,600
a member of the evil sect.

162
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,190
There are few people

163
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:45,480
who can recognize this pattern.

164
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,440
It is the symbol of the legitimate disciples of the evil sect.

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,810
Several decades ago,

166
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,050
the evil sect stopped using it after their unrest.

167
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,840
After Yueming passed away,

168
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:58,590
people all believe that

169
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,750
the legitimate disciples of the evil sect
have been completely eliminated.

170
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,930
I didn't expect that there was still him.

171
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,630
Zhou Wei is the legitimate disciple of the evil sect.

172
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:08,690
It must be the case.

173
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,110
The chain you just mentioned
is not something ordinary.

174
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,020
It's called Iron Rope King Kong.

175
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,340
Ordinary swords can't break it.

176
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,340
Only the sacred object of a legitimate disciple of the evil sect can remove it.

177
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,360
What is the sacred object?

178
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,920
All disciples of the evil sect have their own sacred objects,

179
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:31,170
such as knives, swords, and the sort.

180
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,030
Their internal strength can be channeled to their weapons
when practicing martial arts.

181
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,550
So they can cause much greater damage than ordinary swords.

182
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:42,690
And they can also break
the formation and barrier of energy of the evil sect.

183
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:44,230
You just said

184
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,130
the elder was called Yueming?

185
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:47,870
Yueming.

186
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:50,900
He's passed away?

187
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,080
As long as I find the sacred object, my father can be saved.

188
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,610
But the legitimate disciples of the evil sect have disappeared.

189
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,210
It's hard to find the object.

190
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:06,740
No.

191
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,230
I saw a sword in the world of Chuyue.

192
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:11,350
There's a character "Ming" engraved on that sword.

193
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,350
Could that sword be the sacred object of the evil sect?

194
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,980
Could it be...

195
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,970
I don't know

196
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,630
why the sword appeared there.

197
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,540
Is it possible that

198
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,100

199

200
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:29,450

201
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,510
if I leave this time,

202
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,980
Zhou Wei will be more unruly.

203
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,660
I'm not in the villa.

204

I'm worried about your safety.

205

206

212

213

With him being here,

225

so that he won't find me.

Young Madam, don't worry.

231
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,110
Young Lord will be fine.

232

It's useless to say anything now.

233

She will forgive you

234
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,780
only if my brother-in-law comes back safely.

251
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,060

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,090
You have good taste.

380
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,310
During the following period,

381
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,440
you can stay here

382
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,380
and help me prepare for the Fashion Week.

383
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:26,980
Really?

384
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,450
Thank you.

385
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,060
Ms. Qiao,

386
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,920
I have a question.

387
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,710
Is my partner Gu Qingfeng?

388
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,360
He was caught for plagiarism

389
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,440
and was fired.

390
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,400
You don't know about it?

391
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,030
I see.

392
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,840
Well, Ms. Qiao,

393
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,550
I'll leave you to it.

394
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:50,270
I'm off now.

395
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:02,810
Is that the thing at the door of the antique store?

396
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,750
What's the purpose of taking a photo of this jade pendant?

397
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,030
Leave the bait first

398
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,590
and then wait for the fish to bite it.

399
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,850
You'll find out later.

400
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,220
[You've posted it successfully]

401
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,360
On the 16th,

402
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,620
there will be strong convective weather in our city.

403
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,320
There will be a thunderstorm and strong wind.

404
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,780
And there will be hails in some areas.

405
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,800
Please protect yourselves.

406
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,360
So it means

407
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,180
there will be a thunderstorm in five days.

408
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,330
I wonder how the villa is doing.

409
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,940
I hope God will help us.

410
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,470
To be honest,

411
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:59,750
after staying here for so long,

412
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,050
I miss Yunwei Villa.

413
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,640
Young Lord,

414
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,510
do you think Young Madam

415
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,670
will live in the villa with us?

416
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,500
When this matter is settled,

417
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,910
I'll live with Chuyue

418
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,320
wherever she wants.

419
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,930
That won't do.

420
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,830
You are the young lord of Yunwei Villa.

421
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:19,860
You'll become the lord one day.

422
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,680
If you give up your career for a woman,

423
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,250
Madam and Lord won't agree to it.

424
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:28,940
There's still Ling.

425
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,460
He's totally qualified to be the Lord.

426
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:33,920
He can't.

427
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,900
Lord never liked him.

428
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,510
I don't think he's qualified, either.

429
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,800
Don't say such things again.

430
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,550
Chuyue, I have something to tell you.

431
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,610
It's from Shangyu.

432
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,290
Someone has bought the jade pendant.

433
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:45,550
The fish took the bait.

434
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:08,850
Everyone,

435
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,070
Yunwei Villa is so unlucky.

436
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,970
As you can see,

437
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,050
the positions of Lord and Chief Lord are both empty.

438
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,030
There are so many things to do in the villa.

439
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:24,530
I summoned you here today

440
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,540
to restore the group discussion.

441
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:30,450
I heard that several chiefs

442
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,780
had different opinions with you, Second Lord,

443
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,330
and they were asked to leave Yunwei Villa
just because of that.

444
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:38,490
Is it appropriate for you

445
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,020
to make such decisions without group discussion?

446
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,880
Young Lord died, unfortunately.

447
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,990
But some chiefs

448
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,620
are eager to make a move.

449
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:50,820
Do we need to discuss to invite these people out?

450
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,120
If it's urgent,

451
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,690
of course, we don't need to discuss it here.

452
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,640
But there's still Madam and Second Young Master

453
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,990
here in Yunwei Villa.

454
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,880
Don't you need to inform them?

455
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:07,350
I'm afraid whoever is eager to make a move is right here.

456
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,960
What do you mean by that?

457
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:12,690
Sit.

458
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,480
As we all know,

459
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,640
Madam and Second Young Master

460
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,960
never asked about the affairs of the villa.

461
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,830
There used to be Lord and Young Lord.

462
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,360
Naturally, now it should be

463
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:26,230
Second Young Master to take charge of everything.

464
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,380
I'm seriously ill.

465
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:31,870
I'm afraid I can't...

466
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,260
You'd better

467
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,700
listen to the Second Lord.

468
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,660
Thank you for your trust.

469
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,020
But

470
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,550
-Second Young Master is after all...
-Chief of the Hall.

471
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,150
Just now, Second Young Master

472
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,550
entrusted me with the affairs in the villa.

473
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,590
You didn't let him recuperate

474
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,420
but insisted on him taking charge.

475
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,020
Do you want to take advantage
of Second Young Master

476
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,260
for your own benefit?

477
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,260
You...

478
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:03,300
You're confusing right and wrong.

479
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,190
The villa is unlucky.

480
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,690
But we can't live a day without a leader.

481
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,380
Second Lord used to take care of everything.

482
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,360
Please take the responsibility, Second Lord.

483
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,700
The chief of Ziyun Hall is right.

484
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:22,390
Please take the responsibility, Second Lord.

485
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:25,360
Please take the responsibility, Second Lord.

486
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Chief,

487
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:29,380
did you hear that?

488
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,890
Justice is in the heart of people.

489
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,190
Nonsense!

490
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,840
My sister agreed to the dinner.

491
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,430
We won't make it in time.

492
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,460
Donghua.

493
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,060
Is it good?

494
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,610
Is it good?

495
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,620
Yes.

496
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,190
There are bubbles.

497
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:35,820
Let's make the deal now.

498
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,180
Appear in half an hour,

499
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,900
or the deal will be canceled.

500
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,900
Hello, Brother-in-law.

501
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,900
Donghua, it's for you.

502
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:05,300
Me?

503
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,700
It's my brother-in-law.

504
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,310
Young Lord.

505
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,500
Yes.

506
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,830
Yes. Don't worry.

507
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,199
Well, bro,

508
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,969
can I ask you for a favor?

509
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
Call a taxi for me.

510
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,360
Where are you going?

511
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,590
Young Lord doesn't allow me to tell you.

512
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,070
Say it.

513
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:32,690
Young Lord said

514
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,150
he was going to trade with an antique dealer.

515
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,340
No, you can't go.

516
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,460
He said you couldn't be in danger.

517
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,590
That wording again.

518
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,900
Who else can go if I don't?

519
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,620
You?

520
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,340
Or you?

521
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,469
Can you intimidate those swindlers?

522
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,000
Let's go.

523
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,489
I think I can.

524
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,670
Wait for me.

525
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,530
After fresh rain in mountains bare.

526
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,460
Autumn permeates the evening air.

527
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:14,830
Where's the thing?

528
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
The thing is with the boss.

529
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,180
He said he wanted to check the goods first.

530
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:17,670
If the goods are good,

531
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,590
he will show up.

532
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,010
According to the rules,

533
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,180
you pay the money and get the goods at the same time.

534
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,520
I think you're trying to cheat.

535
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,260
I'm not selling it.

536
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,020
Let's go.

537
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,330
Fine.

538
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,340
You claim yourself an expert?

539
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,170
I guess you're just selling some petty goods.

540
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,880
Which expert doesn't want to buy our stuff

541
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,210
when they see it?

542
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,710
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You look like a liar from the look.

543
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,740
Who are you calling a liar?

544
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,260
You.

545
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,580
We made an appointment at night.

546
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,710
Why change the time?

547
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,650
Our boss owns an antique shop.

548
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,650
It's good enough he agrees to meet you.

549
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,250
And you even change the time?

550
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,530
We didn't even make the last deal.

551
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,280
It's much more valuable than yours.

552
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,120
Little girl.

553
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,220
Stop bragging.

554
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,660
What antique shop?

555
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,440
I have been in the industry for so many years.

556
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,910
There's no antique shop that I don't know.

557
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,250
There are way too many things you don't know.

558
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:05,760
Can you tell me

559
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:07,650
which dynasty your sword is from?

560
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,650
You can't tell, right?

561
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,590
Can you tell me why it's valuable?

562
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,020
I don't think so.

563
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,140
In which antique shop did you see

564
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,620
a jade pendant similar to the one of our boss?

565
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:18,750
You didn't, did you?

566
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,190
Our boss is rich and able to authenticate the antiques.

567
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,390
Of course I can't tell you

568
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,980
which antique shop he works in.

569
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,240
Otherwise, he would be targeted
by someone with bad intentions.

570
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,100
That'll be bad.

571
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,630
An Jingzhao, come quickly.

572
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,560
I'll be exposed if I keep bragging.

573
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,130
You look familiar.

574
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,420
Have we met before?

575
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,670
I have an ordinary face.

576
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,820
Okay.

577
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,640
To prevent you from cheating…

578
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:52,550
Go.

579
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,420
Take those two men away.

580
00:36:58,830 --> 00:36:59,190
Go!

581
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,900
At least you are sincere.

582
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:11,920
Come on.

583
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,260
What are you doing?

584
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,970
Don't you dare touch her!

585
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,480
It's you.

586
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,720
I brought the stuff.

587
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,380
Let them go.

588
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,530
Make the deal first.

589
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,140
Then I'll let them go.

590
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,250
Have you brought what I want?

591
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,980
Let me show you.

592
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,880
[Ming]

593
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,250
Let them go first, then make the deal.

594
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,960
Give it to me first,

595
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:55,940
then I'll release them.

596
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,380
Hello?

597
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,120
Dad?

598
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,380
Where are you?

599
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,460
The antique swindler from last time

600
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,920
-They're blocking us in the park.
-Let's go.

601
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,000
I know you know kung fu.

602
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,550
I'm not stupid.

603
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,000
When I get to a safe place,

604
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,440
I'll release them.

605
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,310
Sister, let's go.

606
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Chuyue. Chuyang.

607
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:35,690
It's okay.

608
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:36,450
Let's go.

609
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:37,990
Watch out!

610
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:38,540
Let's go.

611
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,140
I'm scared to death.

612
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,420
Were you scared just now?

613
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,150
I'm okay.

614
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,710
An Jingzhao.

615
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,350
-Young Lord!
-Brother-in-law. What’s wrong?

616
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:00,910
I'm fine.

617
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,590
Are you okay?

618
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,530
I just need some rest.

619
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:03,500
What's wrong with him?

620
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,900
Young Lord was hit by the Cold Ice Palm.

621
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,360
-He should use…
-Donghua!

622
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,200
An Jingzhao.

623
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,360
You are poisoned again?

624
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,140
And you kept it from me again?

625
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,300
Donghua.

626
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,220
Take care of your master.

627
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,060
Let's go home.

628
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,970
-No, Sister.
-Chuyue.

629
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:18,980
My brother-in-law...

630
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,040
-Chuyue.
-Big bro.

631
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,830
Listen to me.

632
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,120
I didn't want you to worry.

633
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,060
That's why I kept it from you.

634
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:27,460
An Jingzhao,

635
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,220
from now on,

636
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,500
whether you're sick has nothing to do with me.

637
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,230
I won't care about you anymore.

638
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:35,700
Chuyue.

639
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,410
Young Lord.

640
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,150
Are you alright?

641
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,480
How are you?

642
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,010
Don't worry.

643
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,650
I'm fine.

644
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,020
I still have a lot to do with you.

645
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:48,680
I won't die.

646
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,020
Young Lord was hit by Cold Ice Palm,

647
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:52,040
so he is afraid of coldness the most.

648
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,070
He can't stay in the cold wind for too long.

649
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:54,780
Help me up.

650
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:55,200
Here.

651
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:00,110
[Unknown Number]

652
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,380
Get some rest and I'll be better.

653
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,580
Don't worry about me.

654
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,590
Let's go.

655
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:14,670
Let's go.

656
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,540
Be careful.

657
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,690
[A sum of money, so I urgently sell my ancestor's…]

658
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:29,690
