He often has a headache and is sleeplike.

128
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,770
It must have something to do with the herbal soup

129
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,230
that Zhou Wei delivers to the Lord every day.

130
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,370
No wonder my father refused to see me due to his illness

after I returned victorious from my battle against the Evil Sect of Beiming.

In less than a day,

00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,270
Come on.

379
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:09,930
Be a designer.

380
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,140
Work hard

381
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,030
and make progress every day.

382
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,850
Good.

383
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,200
You finally showed up.

384
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,040
Tell me.

385
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,390
Who are you?

386
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:20,380
What's going on?

387
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,700
Wasn't I sleeping?

388
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:26,180
Don't play dumb with me.

389
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,730
Who are you?

390
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:30,890
Is this a dream?

391
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,020
Yes.

392
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,510
It must be a dream.

393
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,180
You scared me.

394
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,250
It wasn't just a dream,

395
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,210
but also a wonderful dream.

396
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,930
My good boy.

397
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,660
You're the most handsome boy

398
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,560
who has ever appeared in my dream.

399
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,290
Li Chuyue.

400
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:52,420
Why are you so shameless

401
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,610
to have such a weird dream?

402
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,240
Tell me the truth.

403
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,700
Did Zhou Wei send you here?

404
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,600
Why did you appear out of nowhere?

405
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,590
What tricks did you use?

406
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,030
Tell me the truth.

407
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,180
What is your conspiracy?

408
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,810
Who's the mastermind?

409
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,760
Then I can spare your life.

410
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,930
Why don't assign me

411
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:12,940
a gentle boy in my dreams?

412
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,590
Not romantic at all.

413
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:15,650
Come on.

414
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,900
-Smile for me.
-How dare you!

415
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,320
I'll give you one last chance.

416
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,700
If you don't tell me,

417
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:24,810
don't blame me for being rude to you.

418
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,190
Be rude to me.

419
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,190
Come on.

420
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,350
Young Lord.

421
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,160
My boy.

422
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,590
Stop it.

423
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:52,130
Ouch!

424
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:56,870
What's going on?

425
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,520
Isn't this a dream?

426
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,490
Why are you looking around?

427
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,670
I'll give you one last chance.

428
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,310
Tell me the truth

429
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,850
so that I can spare your life.

430
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,120
What truth?

431
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,570
I don't understand what you're talking about.

432
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,340
Tell us.

433
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:53,910
What is this place?

434
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,170
In ancient times?

435
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:00,100
I don't belong here.

436
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,840
This is a misunderstanding.

437
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,300
It's a misunderstanding.

438
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,900
Guys.

439
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,810
Guys.

440
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,310
I'm telling the truth.

441
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,750
I thought I was dreaming.

442
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:10,810
I didn't expect

443
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,680
it to be true.

444
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,520
I slept well in the middle of the night.

445
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,380
All of a sudden,

446
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,420
I fell there.

447
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,480
All of a sudden,

448
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:20,690
you brought me here.

449
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,210
I swear I'm telling the truth.

450
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,940
You can't wrong a good person.

451
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,180
In that case,

452
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,950
you have to answer

453
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,050
all the questions I'll ask you next.

454
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,610
Baddie!

455
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,620
Baddie! Baddie! Baddie!

456
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:44,530
Did you sing this song?

457
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,330
Yes.

458
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,840
I was humming it last night.

459
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,680
I was singing in my room.

460
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,300
How did he hear it?

461
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,370
Young Lord,

462
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,710
this person is indeed the witch

463
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,340
who insulted you that day.

464
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,240
No, no, no.

465
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,910
It's not baddie, but baby.

466
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,520
It means "honey".

467
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,890
In my hometown,

468
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,640
that's what men call their beloved women.

469
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,030
Stop quibbling.

470
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,990
You spoke rudely that day.

471
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,920
You provoked Young Lord by saying that he was not as powerful as you.

472
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,780
You even mentioned your partner.

473
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,140
You must have set a trap

474
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,380
to hurt Young Lord.

475
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,150
Young Lord.

476
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,510
I don’t know

477
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:28,220
why you can hear me.

478
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,380
But you all got it wrong.

479
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,710
"I can't beat you"

480
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,700
is a pop song in my hometown.

481
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,080
As for a partner,

482
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,610
it's not an associate,

483
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,880
but a husband.

484
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,280
Nonsense!

485
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,080
Donghua.

486
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:43,810
Yes.

487
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,760
Take that thing out.

488
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:47,460
Yes.

489
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:53,330
Behave yourself.

490
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,010
Young Lord.

491
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,980
Here’s the hidden weapon.

492
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,030
Why is my vest here?

493
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Now you admit it's yours.

494
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,560
What is this?

495
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,720
A girl's vest.

496
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,180
I'm not an assassin.

497
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,950
Look.

498
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,600
Do I look like a martial artist

499
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,180
with such a slim figure?

500
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,190
I'm just an ordinary employee.

501
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,470
I slept well in the middle of the night.

502
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,870
But I suddenly fell here.

503
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,190
You thought I was an assassin

504
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,390
and wanted to kill me.

505
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,490
I'm only 22 years old.

506
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,840
I've never been in a relationship before.

507
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,220
You pretend to be crazy.

508
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,610
Take her to the guest room.

509
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,910
Let her think about

510
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,760
what she hasn't told us.

511
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:36,860
But...

512
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,680
Take her away.

513
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,570
Yes.

514
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,980
I'm telling the truth.

515
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,700
Why don't you believe me?

516
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,040
Slow down. The lollipop fell.

517
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:48,900
Young Lord,

518
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,460
Her identity is suspicious.

519
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,500
If she escapes...

520
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,980
I want her to escape.

521
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,770
Only if she escapes

522
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,080
she can lead us to the mastermind.

523
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,900
Or she might come back

524
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,050
to complete her plot.

525
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,310
I just want to see

526
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,550
what they're up to.

527
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,040
What is this place?

528
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,510
Is there any connection between my room

529
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,360
and his room?

530
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,350
No.

531
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,110
I have to find a way to go back.

532
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:31,110
I can't die here.

533
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,220
There's a fire in Lingxiao Yard.

534
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,490
Young Lord is trapped.

535
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,630
Put out the fire!

536
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,800
-Help!
-Let’s go.

537
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,750
Help!

538
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,570
Even God is helping me.

539
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:48,760
Young Lord may not be in his room.

540
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,510
I can go there now

541
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,640
and find a way to travel back.

542
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,420
Nothing strange.

543
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,470
This young lord is really a scumbag.

544
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,310
What a pity.

545
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,240
These ladies were kept in the dark.

546
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,640
I'd better find a way back first.

547
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,460
God.

548
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,080
Are you trying to kill me?

549
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,080
Mom.

550
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:08,060
I can't eat your braised pork anymore.

551
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:08,990
Yang.

552
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:10,460
I can no longer

553
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,140
play games with you anymore.

554
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:13,220
Dad.

555
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,810
No one will send me an umbrella on a rainy day.

556
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:20,380
I can't sing with you anymore.

557
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:22,610
Sing?

558
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,540
Sing?

559
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,560
Maybe the sound of one of these two rooms

560
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:33,600
can be heard by the other one.

561
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,470
Dad.

562
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,510
Mom.

563
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,350
Yang.

564
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,820
I'm Chuyue.

565
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,570
Can you hear me?

566
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,230
Li Jianmin.

567
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,520
Can you hear me?

568
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,140
Dad.

569
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,180
I'm doomed.

570
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,980
I can't go back.

571
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,470
I slept well.

572
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,870
I somehow fell into a martial arts world

573
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,320
with swords and spears.

574
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,950
They even thought of me as an assassin

575
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,230
and wanted to kill me.

576
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:05,930
Dad.

577
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,270
I'm scared.

578
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,430
Dad, please help me.

579
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,220
Dad, help me!

580
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,320
Dad!

581
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,900
Dad!

582
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,620
Dad! Help! Dad!

583
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,840
I can't go back.

584
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,900
Dad, help me!

585
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,210
Dad! Dad!

586
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,020
She's having a nightmare again.

587
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,550
Don't worry.

588
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:43,820
Wait for me to get the gold-ringed blade

589
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,540
and enter your dream

590
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:52,730
to kill all the evil people.

591
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Dad! Dad!

592
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,380
Dad! Dad!

593
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,640
Dad!

594
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,190
Dad! I'm here. Dad!

595
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,840
I'm doomed.

596
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,940
Not only can I not go back,

597
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:20,880
but I also met an evil man.

598
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,900
He has tender skin.

599
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,810
He is the kind of guy

600
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,679
who should be aware of his safety when going out.

601
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,400
But he's black-hearted

602
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,489
and a pervert.

603
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,250
He wanted to kill me for no reason.

604
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,190
Pervert!

605
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,630
Young Lord.

606
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:41,150
Young Lord.

607
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,980
I’m not an assassin.

608
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
Maybe your room

609
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,580
has something to do with my room.

610
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,159
Otherwise, you wouldn't have heard me sing.

611
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:48,659
Right?

612
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,940
What did the person behind you

613
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:53,850
give you? Productive land and real estate,

614
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,489
ten thousand taels of gold,

615
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,100
or a perfect match?

616
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,900
As long as you tell them,

617
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,100
and testify against them,

618
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,190
I'll give you

619
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:05,100
twice as much as they gave you.

620
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:05,900
Young Lord,

621
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,150
if I were an assassin,

622
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,350
I will tell you everything.

623
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,060
Who wouldn't want a house, wealth, and a handsome partner?

624
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,870
But I'm not.

625
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,910
I don't belong here.

626
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,610
If you don't tell me the truth,

627
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,500
I can kill you

628
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,230
without moving my fingers.

629
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,580
I'm really not an assassin.

630
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,710
Kill me if you want.

631
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,830
Dad, Mom, Yang.

632
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:39,510
I can never see you again.

633
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,020
Jingzhao.

634
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,040
Jingzhao. Are you there?

635
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,920
You've been traveling to Beiming

636
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,180
for more than a month.

637
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,180
I miss you so much.

638
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,350
I have something for you.

639
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,810
Bai Zhi.

640
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,790
I'm already resting.

641
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,670
It's inconvenient for you to come in now.

642
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,240
Go back.

643
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:03,290
I don't want it.

644
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,020
Jingzhao,

645
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,680
I embroidered a pouch for you.

646
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,880
Didn't I ask you to...

647
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,160
Who are you?

648
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,080
Why are you in Jingzhao's room?

649
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,030
Girl.

650
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,830
I was kidnapped by your Young Lord.

651
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,420
He wanted to molest me.

652
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,740
He's not a good man.

653
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,900
This scumbag

654
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,020
doesn't deserve your sincerity.

655
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,030
Jingzhao.

656
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,310
What are you doing?

657
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,180
Bai Zhi.

658
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,450
I want to sleep with my beloved one.

659
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,490
Are you going to watch?

660
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,550
Your beloved one?

661
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,870
Jingzhao.

662
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,330
She said something strange.

663
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,080
I think she came to you

664
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,540
with evil intentions.

665
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,450
How dare you!

666
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,010
This is Lingxiao Yard,

667
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,560
not your Fengnuan Pavilion.

668
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,210
Leave now.

669
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,870
Young Lord.

670
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,190
Do you want to

671
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,270
solve the problem on the note?

672
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:56,350
I know the answer.

673
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,990
I know how to make water flow in reverse.

674
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,750
If I solve this problem,

675
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,110
you need to swear

676
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,150
not to kill me.
