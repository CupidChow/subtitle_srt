[Episode 7]

4
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:43,690
How is it? Is it there?

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,350
I think it's here.

6
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,740
Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,930
It was an accident.

8
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,930
Not everyone can be my assistant.

9
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,200
You need to help me with all my work,

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,300
do market research

11
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,850
and collect all information on styles and trends.

12
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,710
You need to know everything I ask.

13
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,980
You need to collect color charts,

14
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,160
contact fabric dealers,

15
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,610
liaise with patternmakers

16
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,470
and follow up on the production of sample garments.

17
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,100
Besides,

18
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:37,000
I have high requirements for

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,250
the texture and color of fabrics.

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,540
Even if it's rare in the market,

21
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,940
you have to find it for me.

22
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,020
Can you bear this?

23
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:42,720
Ms. Qiao,

24
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,730
as long as I can learn from you,

25
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm not afraid of hardship or fatigue.

26
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,890
Your draft designs.

27
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,810
It's not novel at all.

28
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,610
It's no different from inferior things

29
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,490
in the market.

30
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,050
Leave.

31
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,290
I don't accept mediocrity here.

32
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:04,850
Ms. Qiao,

33
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,210
if you give me another chance,

34
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,400
I promise I can design something that you like.

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,790
If you don't leave, I'll call security.

36
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,400
Ms. Qiao,

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,210
I really admire your design concepts.

38
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,890
Minimal but not simple.

39
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,800
Effortless sophistication.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,420
And you always take inspiration from nature

41
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,410
and play with colors and lines innovatively

42
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,490
to communicate with the world with fashion.

43
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:26,220
I really want to learn from you.

44
00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:28,960
I also saw your latest designs.

45
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,190
The Four Seasons series.

46
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,480
It's amazing.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,829
There's a dress under the Winter theme.

48
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,710
Would it be better to change the belt

49
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,660
to green?

50
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,670
To symbolize the end of winter and the start of spring.

51
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,930
Everything is reborn.

52
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,360
It ties in with the theme of spring and comes full circle.

53
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,420
You have one week.

54
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,200
Thank you, Ms. Qiao.

55
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,510
I'll finish it on time.

56
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,040
It's getting late.

57
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,180
Can we start now?

58
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,690
Are you going back on your word?

59
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:23,380
I keep my promises.

60
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,000
How could I go back on my word?

61
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,480
I'm just thinking about how to apply for leave.

62
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,840
I can get back if I can get there.

63
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,890
It won't affect my draft.

64
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,840
Looks like this won't work.

65
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:18,320
Don't worry.

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,450
I won't stick to you.

67
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,050
I'll think of something.

68
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,500
I've always been loyal.

69
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:26,580
I promised to help you

70
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,910
so I'll keep my promise.

71
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,340
This time,

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,180
I'll do it.

73
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,909
What's the use of being so tall?

74
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,140
Don't worry.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
There must be a way to go back.

76
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,190
Don't worry.

77
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,740
I won't kick you out.

78
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,090
I'm nice enough to let you stay in my house

79
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,190
until the day you get back.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,600
How can it be innovative?

81
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,060
How can it be novel?

82
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,170
Yunwei Villa.

83
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,290
Yunwei Villa.

84
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,300
This is top-notch fashion design.

85
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,220
I never thought I'd see

86
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,310
such wonderful oriental design

87
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,280
in a parallel dimension.

88
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,370
Young Madam.

89
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,510
Young Lord treats you so well.

90
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,170
This wedding dress is the best in Shangyu.

91
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,810
Young Madam.

92
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,580
Tomorrow is the wedding day.

93
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,380
Try on the dress to see if it fits.

94
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,370
If it doesn't fit, we can modify it.

95
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,570
It looks perfect.

96
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,230
Nowadays, floral dresses

97
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,000
all use foreign prints.

98
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,420
It's all the same.

99
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,810
There are no oriental characteristics.

100
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,650
What if

101
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,640
I add Shangyu's traditional patterns

102
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,130
to trendy contemporary lines?

103
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,050
That's innovation.

104
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,600
How do we open the parallel world?

105
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,290
What's the secret between the two beds?

106
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,890
Since I disappeared like this,

107
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:07,490
Grandmother and Donghua must be very worried.

108
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,730
You two, leave.

109
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,660
Don't come in without my order.

110
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:32,809
What's going on?

111
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:33,309
Madam.

112
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,350
I have searched the whole villa

113
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,370
but there's no trace of Young Lord and Li Chuyue.

114
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,350
Zhao has always been cautious.

115
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,980
He won't leave without any notice.

116
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,700
What could have happened?

117
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,680
Donghua.

118
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,130
Yes.

119
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,160
Send someone to search again.

120
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,310
Don't miss any places that Zhao has been to.

121
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:53,940
Yes Madam.

122
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,610
Also,

123
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:55,960
to the others,

124
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,430
tell them that Young Lord and Young Madam

125
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,640
caught a cold.

126
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,340
It's not convenient for them to see visitors these days.

127
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,860
Yes.

128
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,270
I'll go search now.

129
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:05,650
I'll take my leave.

130
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,510
An Jingzhao.

131
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,740
I forgot how to draw the traditional pattern of Shangyu.

132
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,100
Help me draw it.

133
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,890
Here.

134
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,610
What?

135
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,080
Didn't you ask me how to draw the pattern of Shangyu?

136
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,540
You were standing there the whole time.

137
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,690
Are you really homesick?

138
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,070
To be honest,

139
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,850
I miss them too.

140
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,250
But don't worry.

141
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,720
Since you could come here,

142
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,200
we can definitely go back.

143
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,040
Or are you

144
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,060
afraid that Old Zhou

145
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,390
will do something when you're not around?

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,420
Grandmother will help me hide it from Zhou Wei.

147
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,820
Luckily, Zhou Wei is suspicious by nature.

148
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,300
He won't take any action for the time being.

149
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,280
Caught a cold?

150
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,890
Does An Jingzhao think I'm stupid?

151
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,880
He wants to set me up again.

152
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,140
Master,

153
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,330
what should we do next?

154
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,460
Wait.

155
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,970
Wait for An Jingzhao to give himself away.

156
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,840
Did anything unusual happen

157
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,260
on the day that you went to Shangyu?

158
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,220
No.

159
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:46,150
I still have no money.

160
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:46,860
No kids.

161
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,890
Nothing special.

162
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,770
If I recreate what happened the day you went to Shangyu,

163
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,730
we might be able to find a way back.

164
00:10:58,730 --> 00:10:59,410
No.

165
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,950
If I try it,

166
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,840
what if I go back

167
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,940
and you don't?

168
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:05,380
An Jingzhao,

169
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,880
I’ve done what I promised you.

170
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,740
We don't owe each other anything.

171
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,220
Okay.

172
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:11,900
Fine.

173
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,420
I'll figure something out for you.

174
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,000
Leave now.

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,200
I need to do my drafts.

176
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,060
Go, go, go.

177
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,820
Go, go, go.

178
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,250
I trust

179
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,830
your recommendation.

180
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,260
Has he sent me his draft designs?

181
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:38,140
Okay.

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,100
I'll reply you after I look at it.

183
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,440
Bye.

[Falling petals and flowing water pattern]

186
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,530
I've seen it.

187
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,780
The flower print is unique.

188
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,340
He does seem to have some ideas of his own.

189
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,320
What?

190
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,130

No need.

196
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,350
There were so many candidates and you didn't like any of them.

197
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,610
I wonder what kind of design

198
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,810
can impress Ms. Qiao.

199
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,350
It's just passable.

200
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:00,250

Please let my brother gain 10 more kilograms.

If you fail,

209
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,620
it means they have no taste.

What should I do?

213
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,420
I guess my teachers and classmates

214
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,580
also look like that when they receive my messages.

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,130
It means the most manly

381
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,330
and masculine.

382
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,120
Oh, I know that.

383
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,090
Chuyang told me.

384
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,280
How's that?

385
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,550
Isn't that very hot?

386
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,700
Isn't that very sex?

387
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,570
An Jingzhao.

388
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,880
Stop it.

389
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
Was I wrong again?

390
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,090
Take this.

391
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,250
I'm going to the bathroom.

392
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,730
Stay right there.

393
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,270
Where are you going?

394
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:47,930
Stand here.

395
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,110
Where are you going?

396
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,680
Where is the money?

397
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,300
You said that

398
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,500
this is the last time.

399
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,820
Cut the crap.

400
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
I changed my mind.

401
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,560
If you give me more,

402
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,420
I'll let you go.

403
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
This is all I have.

404
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,830
It's not enough.

405
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,090
It's not enough?

406
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,860
A gentleman prefers death to humiliation.

407
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,770
I don't have any more cash.

408
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,170
I won't give you any more.

409
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,430
But I can transfer the money.

410
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,160
Come on.

411
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,170
- Here.
- Transfer the money.

412
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,390
Here, scan mine.

413
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,590
[Sister]

414
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,060
Sister, save me!

415
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,090
I'm not your sister!

416
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:51,800
I am your brother-in-law.

417
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,860
What’s wrong, Chuyang?

418
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:55,080
Brother-in-law, I got caught by some hooligans.

419
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,010
Come save me!

420
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:56,940
What did you say?

421
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,660
I've been beaten up.

422
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,460
Where are you?

423
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,630
I'll send you the location.

424
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,610
Come and save me.

425
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:07,790
Chuyang!

426
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,290
Stop!

427
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,270
Help!

428
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:23,970
Stop!

429
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,960
Stop! Stop!

430
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,970
Stop!

431
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,650
Where are you going?

432
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:32,580
Brat.

433
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,750
How dare you fool me?

434
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,600
Get him!

435
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:43,620
It hurts!

436
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,450
Brother.

437
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,110
This is my younger brother.

438
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,010
If anyone dares to bully me again,

439
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,540
he won't let you off easily.

440
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,340
Do you hear me?

441
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,820
Yes.

442
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,490
Don't ever rob people again.

443
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,140
Got it?

444
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,100
If my brother sees you again,

445
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,000
he'll beat you

446
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,880
every time.

447
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,090
Got it.

448
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,490
I won't do it again.

449
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,020
Let's go.

450
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:05,990
Let's go.

451
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,660
You're not an ordinary actor, are you?

452
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,900
You really know martial arts?

453
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,830
Can you teach me?

454
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,180
Also,

455
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,180
what's your relationship with my sister?

456
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,780
You said you are not friends.

457
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,690
Then what's your relationship?

458
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,950
Your sister is my wife.

459
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,670
The Young Madam of Yunwei Villa.

460
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,700
Wife?

461
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,380
Don't worry about it.

462
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,170
I love stories.

463
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:31,980
Tell me.

464
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:35,930
I got it.

465
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,070
So,

466
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,700
there is a place called Yunwei Villa

467
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,390
in a parallel dimension.

468
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,480
You’re the Young Lord there?

469
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,650
Not only did my sister go to your place,

470
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:45,850
but also married you.

471
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,080
It's normal if you don't believe me.

472
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,510
I do.

473
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:53,250
The universe is so big

474
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,180
and mysterious.

475
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,010
There must be parallel dimensions

476
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,270
and different worlds.

477
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,460
Is your villa famous in the martial arts world?

478
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,190
How big is it?

479
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,380
Yunwei Villa

480
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,960
is the top sect in the martial arts world.

481
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,680
As for how big it is,

482
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,540
there's more than 100 rooms.

483
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,260
More than 100 rooms?

484
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,720
Then I suddenly became

485
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,810
the brother-in-law of a rich family?

486
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:20,830
But my sister

487
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,750
seems to have a crush on someone from her company.

488
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,620
I know.

489
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,180
Gu Qingfeng.

490
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,720
Right?

491
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,770
I need your help.

492
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:33,860
Go ahead.

493
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,140
In the world of martial arts,

494
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,070
it's all about helping each other.

495
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,750
In your world,

496
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:43,390
what does your sister like?

497
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,380
She likes to eat fried tripe

498
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,490
stinky tofu

499
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,230
and rap.

500
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,990
What does your mother like?

501
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,700
My mother?

502
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,730
Her favourite thing

503
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,930
has got to be money.

504
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,430
Since the renovation,

505
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,730
the business of the butcher shop has improved.

506
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:57,240
She said she's tired every day.

507
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,700
But she's happy as long as she can make money.

508
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,880
Why do you ask about my mom?

509
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,010
You have to catch the leader to get his followers.

510
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,670
Your mother

511
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,400
is the king of your family.

512
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,990
I can help you

513
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,350
if you want to get on her good side.

514
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,460
I know them well.

515
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,160
Believe me.

516
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:15,980
Although you are the Young Lord

517
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,660
and smart,

518
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,770
but you don't know

519
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,050
how to get on the good side of people in my world.

520
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,050
Compared to Gu Qingfeng,

521
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,580
you're definitely losing.

522
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,410
Let's get to the current situation first.

523
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,210
Do you know much about my sister?

524
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:29,850
It's okay.

525
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,880
Take your time.

526
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,370
You need to win my sister's favor

527
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,670
and find a perfect opportunity

528
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,180
to get closer to her.

529
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,090
For the specific strategy, I need to think further.

530
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,340
One more thing.

531
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,660
I want this.

532
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,140
Where can I get it?

533
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,770
This...

534
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:49,660
It's easy.

535
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,810
But do you have money?

536
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,570
This should be worth a lot of money.

537
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:03,490
Then let's go.

538
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,010
Okay.

539
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,180
But you need to change your outfit.

540
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,460
You need a more fashionable one.

541
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,060
What does fashionable mean?

542
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,020
This is it.

543
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,380
Hello.

544
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
Brother-in-law.

545
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,090
This...

546
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,380
It's elegant and luxurious.

547
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,770
It smells like banknotes.

548
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:29,860
Sir,

549
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,700
this is the most classic couple model in our shop.

550
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:34,850
This one then.

551
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,460
Okay.

552
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,460
This way please.

553
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,330
Brother-in-law.

554
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,940
The clothes I picked for you at the mall

555
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,900
all suit you so well.

556
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,700
You're so versatile.

557
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,580
When you change into these clothes,

558
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,910
my sister will fall in love at first sight.

559
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:06,490
Now,

560
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,410
we've got everything.

561
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,540
What?

562
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,170
These are necessities for modern life.

563
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,590
A phone, key, wallet.

564
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,900
I just took you to buy a phone.

565
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,260
Oh yes, you still need an ID card.

566
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,330
I'll take you there when my dad is free.

567
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,330
You have to know

568
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,550
you can't live without an ID card here.

569
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,140
Now we have everything.

570
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,480
An Jingzhao.

571
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,730
Where have you been?

572
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,460
Do you know how long I've been looking for you?

573
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,320
I thought you were lost because you were unfamiliar with the place.

574
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,650
Are you caring about me?

575
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,660
Who cares about you?

576
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,580
I'm a grown man.

577
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,710
How could I get lost.

578
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,230
What if you were abducted by some girl

579
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,230
who molested you?

580
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,840
After all, you are delicate.

581
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,220
I did it out of loyalty.

582
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,290
If you keep running around,

583
00:28:58,290 --> 00:28:59,820
I won't take you in anymore.

584
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:00,420
Sister,

585
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,770
you misunderstood him.

586
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,230
I was targeted by some thugs who asked for money.

587
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:04,980
I called you.

588
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,750
He answered the phone and came to save me.

589
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,060
He didn't run around.

590
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,730
Thugs?

591
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,180
What?

592
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,580
Did those bastards hit you?

593
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,140
Let me see.

594
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,570
It's okay.

595
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,540
With my handsome, martial arts master

596
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,540
brother-in-law around, I was unscathed.

597
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,010
Brother-in-law?

598
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,850
Who is your brother-in-law?

599
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,190
You went to the parallel world

600
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,680
and married Young Lord in Yunwei Villa.

601
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,980
I know all of that.

602
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,010
Sister,

603
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,730
if my brother-in-law hadn't come to save me today,

604
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:48,180
your only brother wouldn't be here anymore.

605
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,730
You should thank him

606
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,450
and treat him to a movie.

607
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,280
Li Chuyang,

608
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,230
I'm telling you.

609
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,680
If anything happens in the future,

610
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,340
you must tell me immediately.

611
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,640
I'm the only one who can bully my brother.

612
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:04,300
I know.

613
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,120
I know.

614
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,960
You should thank him now.

615
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,730
I'm busy too.

616
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,350
I have to go to school

617
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,220
and do homework,

618
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,950
and come here to accompany you.

619
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,700
Sister,

620
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:16,900
it's up to you.

621
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,630
I'm leaving.

622
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,250
How can I thank you?

623
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,310
This is my phone.

624
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,230
Set the password for me.

625
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,370
987595.

626
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,250
Aren't you curious about the meaning of this password?

627
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,090
What meaning?

628
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,780
Those are my measurements.

629
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,250
98.

630
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,090
75.

631
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:57,860
95.

632
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,800
Are you comparing yourself to my Prince Charming

633
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,800
and showing me how good your body is?

634
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:09,650
After setting the password,

635
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:12,010
teach me how to use my phone. I don't know how.

636
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:12,610
Come here.

637
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:23,140
Okay.

638
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,050
Press this to make a call.

639
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,440
I've already saved Li Chuyang's number

640
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,370
and mine.

641
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,800
This is for texting.

642
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,900
If you don't know how hanyu pinyin, you can write it by hand.

643
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,640
If you press this,

644
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,070
you can also make a video call.

645
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,900
Save your parents' numbers too.

646
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,620
Is that necessary?

647
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,350
Just in case.

648
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,170
This is for information.

649
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:46,810
Yes.

650
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,580
Uncle.

651
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,970
This is An.

652
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,450
You don't have to come to the company tomorrow.

653
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,310
Go directly to purchase fabrics.

654
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,140
So many fabrics?

655
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,120
This is my number.

656
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,560
Please contact me for anything.

657
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:28,770
Chuyue.

658
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,310
I'm sure Ms. Qiao must have arranged

659
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,440
a lot of work for you.

660
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:34,460
If you need any help, I can help you.

661
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,340
Is my Prince Charming

662
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,800
caring about me?

663
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,440
Can you really help me?

664
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,010
Ms. Qiao asked me to buy fabrics.

665
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,730
Okay, it's time.

666
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,870
Let's start.

667
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:20,380
I'm a sweetheart.

668
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,530
No.

669
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,700
It's like this.

670
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,330
Follow me.

671
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,570
I'm a sweetheart.

672
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,180
I'm a sweetheart.

673
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,070
I'm a sweetheart.

674
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,820
You need to be cuter.

675
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,180
Like this.

676
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,490
I'm a sweetheart.

677
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:41,900
Do it.

678
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,190
How can a man like me

679
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,630
make such a pose?

680
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,820
How inappropriate!

681
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,530
I'm a sweetheart.

682
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,770
I'm a sweetheart.

683
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,380
Go on.

684
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,660
I'm a sweetheart.

685
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,330
I'm a sweetheart.

686
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,680
I'm a sweetheart.

687
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,570
I'm a sweetheart.

688
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,650
I...

689
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,469
You lied to me.

690
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:09,860
I...

691
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,400
If you don't tell me the truth,

692
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,650
I won't leave.

693
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,380
No.

694
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:22,710
It was actually 11.30.

695
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,810
And I said.

696
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,290
Become a designer. Come on.

697
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,770
Work hard

698
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,540
and make progress every day.

699
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,000
I'm telling the truth.

700
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,179
The time is coming.

701
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,460
Come on.

702
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:50,340
Become a designer.

703
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,790
Work hard

704
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,810
and make progress every day.

705
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,210
Have you forgotten anything

706
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,020
or kept anything from me?

707
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,610
No.

708
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:10,890
I just go to work every day

709
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,050
and live as a corporate slave,

710
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,510
there's nothing special.

711
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,780
I'm telling the truth.

712
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,920
I don't want to be threatened by you anymore.

713
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,610
I think I touched Prince Charming's ring that day.

714
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,480
He said that ring was made

715
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,500
of some kind of chemical substance.

716
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,700
Could it be related to that?

717
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:30,870
No.

718
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,630
Impossible.

719
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,820
That's too weird.

720
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,370
Seriously, nothing special happened.

721
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,620
I have to meet my Prince Charming tomorrow.

722
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,420
Ms. Qiao said,

723
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,960
as long as I get all the fabrics,

724
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,090
she'll recommend me for the second round of the competition.

725
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,150
I'm going to sleep.

726
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,130
Get out.

727
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,050
Go, go, go.

728
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,740
Go.

729
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:50,590
Go.

730
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:56,400
The Gu Qingfeng your sister mentioned...

731
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,290
Compared to him,

732
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,110
am I very inferior?

733
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,190
Don't be afraid.

734
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,300
You're Wu Song fighting the tiger.

735
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,810
You're wise and powerful.

736
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,380
Not only are you tough,

737
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:18,170
but you're also a gentleman.

738
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,090
So,

739
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,860
try to act cute.

740
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:24,130
Like when I'm with my mom.

741
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,800
This counts as being coquettish.

742
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,780
Mom, I'm tired.

743
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,100
Chuyang,

744
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,010
I really can't do this.

745
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,340
If you can't,

746
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,980
you can't achieve your goal.

747
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,070
What are you doing?

748
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,930
We're practicing acting.

749
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:42,800
Yes.

750
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,150
You still need to practice acting?

751
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,590
You're already a great actor.

752
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,720
You're always pretending to be sick to get out of things.

753
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,250
You guys talk. I'll leave first.

754
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:52,890
Wait.

755
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,250
Are you guys making trouble?

756
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,990
Make it clear before you leave.

757
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,900
Zhang.

758
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:22,260
Hello Qingfeng.

759
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,550
Do you have any new fabrics?

760
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,450
You came at the right time.

761
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,510
We have a new batch.

762
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,050
Boss,

763
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,560
do you have thinner fabric?

764
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,190
Yes.

765
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:31,750
How about this one?

766
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,140
This is the thinnest.

767
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:36,310
And these are all thin.

768
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,240
I want both of these.

769
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,420
Okay.

770
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,850
Qingfeng.

771
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,000
I've never seen you bring a girl here.

772
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,310
Is she your girlfriend?

773
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,570
Her?

774
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,270
- She is…
- Of course not.

775
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,750
Why are you here?

776
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,380
To buy fabrics, obviously.

777
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,380
Would I come here for a date?

778
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,210
Don't mess things up.

779
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,400
I'm your landlord after all.

780
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,540
I'm here to buy fabrics.

781
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,520
Ignore him.

782
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,200
Let's continue.

783
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:09,530
Okay.

784
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,190
Mr. Qingfeng.

785
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:10,900
What do you think of this?

786
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:11,520
Let me see.

787
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,290
Boss,

788
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,410
I want this fabric.

789
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,060
Qingfeng.

790
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,740
Aren't you together?

791
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,100
This is...

792
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
- Cool guy.
- He is…

793
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:22,520
An Jingzhao.

794
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,980
Don't mess things up.

795
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,820
Can't you see I'm with my Prince Charming?

796
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:28,130
Isn't your Prince Charming standing right in front of you?

797
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,010
Okay, Zhang, we're good here.

798
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:29,340
Okay.

799
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,820
Take a look. Tell me if you need anything.

800
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,170
Okay.

801
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,610
How is it?

802
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,610
Did you get hit?

803
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,200
You have to try acting cute.

804
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,250
Just like when I'm with my mom.

805
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,300
Does it hurt?

806
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:57,340
Yes.

807
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,640
It hurts.

808
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,170
Are you really okay?

809
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,780
Chuyue.

810
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:06,820
Are you okay?

811
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,480
It hurts.

812
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,490
Zhang.

813
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,210
Come and help me.

814
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:10,780
What's going on?

815
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,650
Did you hurt yourself?

816
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,300
I'm fine.

817
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,460
I accidentally bumped into it.

818
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,210
That's good.

819
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,080
This color looks good.

820
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,180
Chuyue.

821
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:20,840
I'll make you some clothes.

822
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,010
Really?

823
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,420
No, no, no.

824
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,210
This color doesn't match Chuyue at all.

825
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,650
Green.

826
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,390
Green is more suitable for Chuyue.

827
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:32,980
An Jingzhao.

828
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,820
Don’t make trouble.

829
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,760
I need to answer a call.

830
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,270
Mr. Qingfeng, I need to take this call.

831
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:36,870
Go ahead.

832
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,110
Mr. Gu,

833
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,820
how about

834
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,880
we have a match?
