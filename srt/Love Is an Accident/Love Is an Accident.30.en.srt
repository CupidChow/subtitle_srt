My wife has an outstanding temperament.

He wants to discuss something with you.

11
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,980
Can you accompany me tonight?

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,780
You'll have more time

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,310
to deal with the villa's affairs in the future.

14
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,060
Of course.

Well,

24
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,430
I'm so obedient.

25
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,890
Shouldn't you reward me?

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:40,860
Let's go.

27
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,980
Let's go to bed.

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,060
I want you to promise me one thing.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,310
You've really picked the right timing.

30
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,200
You know at such a critical moment,

31
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,430
I will promise you whatever you say.

32
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,300
Tell me.

33
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,540

I'm gone,

35

37
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:11,830
If you meet a good girl, don't refuse her.

38
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,140
What nonsense are you talking about?

39
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,880
I won't promise you that.

40
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,360
You have to.

41
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,670
No.

42
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,860
Chuyue, have you forgotten?

43
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,900
Back then, you asked me

44
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,150
not to fall in love with anyone else in this life.

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,430
I also swore.

46
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,350
How can I break my promise?

47
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,240
You can.

48
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,130
What counts is your promise now.

49
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,660
Don't think too much.

50
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,380
We will grow old together.

51
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,820
So don't think about that.

52
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,530
No, you have to swear.

53
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,390
What if an accident happens?

54
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,770
Chuyue, what's wrong with you?

55
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,870
Don't think too much.

57

several times. Several times.

58
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,580
So this is what you shouldn't say.

59
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,050
So stop saying it

60
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,130
and stop thinking about it.

61
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,100

62
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,780

00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,220
I thought the energy of the meteorite

169
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,180

She walked too fast and didn't pay attention to the road.

191
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,160
What's the big deal?

192
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:21,890
It's just a small operation.

193
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,060
I'll recover in several days.

194
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,860
Does it hurt a lot?

195
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,830
I feel nothing thanks to the anesthesia.

196
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,210
Can you stop

197
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,070
being in such a hurry in the future?

198
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,800
Don't you know your mother?

199
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,700
Why are you still with him?

200
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,220
Didn't you say you were on a business trip?

201
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,580
He doesn't even have a proper job.

202
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,980
He heard that something happened to my family.

203
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,340
He was worried that it would be dangerous for me to come back alone.

204
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,740
So he kindly sent me back.

205
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,820
Don't worry.

206
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,070
I'll listen to you about the boyfriend thing.

207
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,850
An,

208
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,880
thank you.

209
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,880
Auntie, I'm glad you're fine.

210
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,090
Have a good rest.

211
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,050
I'm leaving.

212
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,660
Goodbye.

213
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,520
Mom, my brother-in-law...

214
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,340
I mean An Jingzhao is outstanding in all aspects.

215
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,740
He is handsome,

216
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,290
smart, and talented.

217
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,320
Most importantly, he's good to my sister.

218
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,870
Why don't you think about

219
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,070
letting him be your son-in-law?

220
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,040
He doesn't even have a proper job.

221
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,650
What's the use of just being good-looking?

222
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,590
Mom,

223
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,100
he has great potential.

224
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,460
In terms of this, I...

225
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,470
am on Chuyang's side.

226
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Fine. I know.

227
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,190
You three are teaming up to piss me off.

228
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:47,870
Can you feed me properly?

229
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,730
Your finger was in my mouth.

230
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,480
[Medical Technology Building]
[Outpatient]

231
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,090
Chuyue,

232
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,220
go ahead if you have something to do.

233
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,580
Leave her to me.

234
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,720
There are two men here. Don't worry.

235
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,170
Go.

236
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,690
Okay.

237
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,150
Li Chuyang,

238
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,400
take good care of Dad and Mom.

239
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,260
Okay.

240
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:21,920
Dad, I'm leaving.

241
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,860
Okay.

242
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,300
Why are you still here?

243
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,100
I've been waiting for you.

244
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,820
How can I let you go back alone?

245
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:53,940
Luckily, my mom is fine.

246
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:55,090
I was really worried.

247
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,050
Don't worry.

248
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,600
She'll be fine soon.

249
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,040
What's wrong?

250
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,370
We're in a relationship.

251
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,349
Why...

252
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,319
I planned to tell my mom,

253
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,220
but she is injured.

254
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,560
So I had to care about her feelings.

255
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,740
I promise you.

256
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,140
I'll tell her as soon as she recovers.

257
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,890
Don't be angry.

258
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,319
You are the only one I love in this life.

259
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,130
Looks like I have to become successful

260
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,520
in this world,

261
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,060
and then your mom will allow me to be with you.

262
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,640
What do you want to do?

263
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,040
I don't know.

264
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,300
Help me think about it.

265
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,920
You can run a restaurant,

266
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,040
so that I can have endless delicious food.

267
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,980
Remember

268
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,540
what has been chosen before.

269
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,530
Okay.

270
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,060
Take a look. This is...

271
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,380
Li Chuyue,

272
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,760
your brother has submitted your letter of resignation for you.

273
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,720
Why did you come here again?

274
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,510
Ms. Qiao, I'm sorry.

275
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,770
I resigned because of something trivial.

276
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,100
I'm really regretful now.

277
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,800
Considering I'm innocent,

278
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,270
why don't you give me another chance?

279
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,450
I thought

280
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,030
you didn't even care about the competition's result.

281
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,410
What's the result?

282
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:18,930
The result has been announced.

283
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,350
Your work didn't win an award.

284
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,900
But you don't need to be discouraged.

285
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,890
I've seen your design.

286
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,910
You have your own design style.

287
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:28,910
But it's not unique enough.

288
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,090
It's hard to catch people's eyes immediately.

289
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,620
I'll keep working hard.

290
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:38,010
Can you let me stay now?

291
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,260
I haven't agreed yet. Let's have a 1-month probation period.

292
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:45,350
Okay. I promise I'll do a good job.

293
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,460
Maybe later.

294
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,260
Soon.

295
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,020
Yes.

296
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,740
Okay.

297
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,260
Yes.

298
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:01,420
[Good afternoon. Don't just focus on work. I miss you.]

299
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,780
Good afternoon.

300
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,460
Don't just focus on work.

301
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,700
I miss you.

302
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,660
Please give me a glass of water.

303
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,960
Li Chuyue, come and help me.

304
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:46,460
Ms. Qiao.

305
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,570
Come and help me.

306
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,600
Ms. Qiao,

307
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
I can participate in your design project?

308
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm not gonna say it again.

309
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,200
Okay.

310
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,660
Yes.

311
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,700
Smells good.

312
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,660
What are you doing?

313
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,350
I'm making soup.

314
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,450
It's good for your mother's health.

315
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,790
You've been working hard these days.

316
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,740
Drink more later.

317
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:30,170
My husband is really capable.

318
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,380
I can do more than this.

319
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,280
Sister,

320
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,170
I came here to see you with Mom and Dad.

321
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,700
Hide.

322
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,530
Don't come out.

323
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,270
My mom is hot-tempered. If she sees you, it's gonna be a disaster.

324
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,700
Please. Please. Please.

325
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:52,190
Welcome back.

326
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,520
Come on.

327
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,150
W-What are you doing?

328
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,400
What's that smell?

329
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,540
Mom. Dad.

330
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,190
You are supposed to get discharged tomorrow, right?

331
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,180
Why did you come back in advance?

332
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,310
It's fine.

333
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:05,940
I'm strong.

334
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,390
The doctor said it's nothing serious.

335
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,460
So I came back in advance.

336
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:10,980
What's that smell?

337
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,420
I'm making soup.

338
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,810
You're making soup?

339
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,660
You know how to make soup?

340
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,900
That's rare.

341
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,300
Mom, be careful.

342
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:22,780
Mom.

343
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,260
Be careful.

344
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,780
Mom.

345
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,420
My daughter knows how to make soup.

346
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
Mom, be careful.

347
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,120
The kitchen's window is open.

348
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,180
You'll catch a cold if you go in.

349
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,970
It's fine.

350
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,880
Why don't you go back and rest?

351
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,220
Yes.

352
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,780
She's making soup for you.

353
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,460
Just let her finish her work.

354
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,460
It's for your good.

355
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,900
Go back to your room and rest, okay?

356
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,740
Good girl.

357
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,540
I have to tell you this.

358
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:47,980
Don't get too close to An Jingzhao.

359
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Can he make you happy?

360
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,180
What's the use of having a pretty face?

361
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,980
Yes, you're right.

362
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:53,980
I'm not interested

363
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,460
in a pretty face like his at all.

364
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,540
That's right.

365
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,740
You are always right.

366
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,310
Go back to the room. Go back to the room.

367
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,060
Okay, let's go.

368
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,700
Hurry.

369
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,260
Let's go.

370
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,700
I'm waiting for your soup.

371
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,510
Okay.

372
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:05,830
Be careful.

373
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,300
An Jingzhao, hurry up.

374
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,660
What was that about?

375
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:19,740
Don't be angry.

376
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,300
My mom is angry and doesn't want us to be together.

377
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,730
I'll tell her when she calms down.

378
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,110
I'd better leave now.

379
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,740
[Experience Hall]

380
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,640
[Experience Hall]

381
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,300
Chuyue.

382
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,660
Why are you here?

383
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,020
What's wrong?

384
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,060
You look very weak.

385
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,840
You have a fever.

386
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,610
Let me take you to the hospital.

387
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,950
I don't want to go to the hospital.

388
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,620
Just stay with me. I'll be fine after taking some medicine.

389
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,460
Listen to me. Let's go.

390
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,950
I'll take some medicine.

391
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,260
Stay with me, okay?

392
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,130
Okay, take some medicine.

393
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:01,780
Here.

394
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,370
Take the medicine first.

395
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,900
Go have a rest in your bed.

396
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,800
What is this?

397
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,230
After you have a good rest,

398
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,390
I'll tell you, okay?

399
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:24,880
No.

400
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,300
I want to see it now.

401
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,530
I know you've been working hard lately.

402
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,260
I bought a small gift for you.

403
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,620
Sounds good.

404
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,020
I like it.

405
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,380
All right.

406
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,110
I'm glad you like it.

407
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,560
Can you go take a rest now?

408
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,460
I'll hang it up.

409
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:47,780
Be good.

410
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,380
Come on.

411
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,310
One, two, three. Come on.

412
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,100
Lie down.

413
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,030
Have a good rest.

414
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,420
Get some sleep.

415
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,940
I think someone is here.

416
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:27,820
I'm going to take a look.

417
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,740
No. Stay with me.

418
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:34,280
Li Chuyue.

419
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,180
Li Chu...

420
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,940
Chuyue.

421
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,220
Auntie,

422
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,160
Chuyue has a fever. I...

423
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,230
I just gave her some medicine.

424
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,900
Come out with me.

425
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,390
An, I told you

426
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,310
I don't allow you to be together.

427
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,160
Auntie,

428
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,170
I truly love Chuyue.

429
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,530
I don't want to marry anyone else in this life.

430
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,220
I hope you can

431
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,000
allow us to be together.

432
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:23,320
I know you're sincere.

433
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,420
But can sincerity support your life?

434
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,090
Can you give her a stable life?

435
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,140
I only have one daughter.

436
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:32,530
I don't want her to suffer with you.

437
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,120
Auntie,

438
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,280
I know what you mean.

439
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,060
That's why I'm starting a business now.

440
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:39,560
Starting a business is not that simple, kid.

441
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,840
All right, you can leave.

442
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:43,940
I'll take care of her.

443
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,980
An Jingzhao, don't worry.

444
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,180
From now on, you are my husband.

445
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,060
I will only dote on you.

446
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,980
Li Chuyue, aren't you ashamed?

447
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,610
Why should I be ashamed?

448
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,830
I just like beautiful people.

449
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,160
Like you.

450
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,650
Do you really like him that much?

451
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,420
I like him very much.

452
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,040
I don't want to be separated from him even for just one second.

453
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,290
He has been protecting me.

454
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,650
I also want to keep him company forever.

455
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,420
Silly girl.

456
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,500
All right, get some sleep.

457
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,200
The fever is finally gone.

458
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,900
An?

459
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,060
You haven't left?

460
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,290
Auntie,

461
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,140
how is Chuyue?

462
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,270
The fever is gone.

463
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,250
She should be fine after resting for a day.

464
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,710
That's good.

465
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:01,730
Let me do it.

466
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,210
The place where I'm standing now

467
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,220
is a new

468
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,540
ancient life experience hall in our city.

469
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,700
It's very creative.

470
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,090
You can experience

471
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,760
the ancient daily life here.

472
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,910
Dad,

473
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,700
my brother-in-law is really amazing.

474
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,880
He has sharp business acumen.

475
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,610
I believe

476
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:30,610
this experience hall will be popular in the future.

477
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,180
Archery and practicing archery.

478
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,080
This is

479
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,920
the founder of Shangyu Life Hall,

480
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,610
Mr. An.

481
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,260
He is really young and handsome.

482
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,160
-Of course.
-He's handsome and intelligent.

483
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,840
Come on, have some fruits.

484
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,370
Here. Son.

485
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,180
Mom,

486
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,590
there is a new ancient life experience hall

487
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:05,690
in Baile Mall.

488
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,170
It's very creative.

489
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,150
Look.

490
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,150
The place where I'm standing now

491
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,010
is a new

492
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,700
ancient life experience hall in our city.

493
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,660
It's very creative.

494
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,460
You can experience

495
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,990
the ancient daily life here,

496
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,620
including the wedding, customs,

497
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,730
and delicate ancient dishes.

498
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,060
Dear,

499
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:29,220
this Sunday will be our 30th wedding anniversary.

500
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,620
Why don't we go celebrate?

501
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,220
I won't go.

502
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:35,910
That place looks very expensive.

503
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,340
Besides,

504
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,350
this kind of celebration is young people's thing.

505
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm old.

506
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,520
I won't join the fun.

507
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,180
I disagree.

508
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,860
In my heart, you are always young.

509
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,230
You are always beautiful like flowers.

510
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,900
Come on.

511
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,770
They have a wedding experience.

512
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,700
We have never had it for 30 years.

513
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:58,420
Why don't we try?

514
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:02,050
Then... let's try?

515
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,540
Is this appropriate?

516
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:06,420
Everyone is showing affection in front of me.

517
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,310
I asked you to eat fruits.

518
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,540
What are you murmuring?

519
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,460
-Nothing. Nothing.
-Eat.

520
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,860
What's up?

521
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,170
Sir,

522
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,670
the informant outside said

523
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,610
An Jingzhao and Chuyue are no longer in the villa.

524
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:48,210
It's said that they went to travel around the world.

525
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,590
Travel around the world?

526
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,920
An Jingzhao is the villa's lord.

527
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,260
Why would he go travel around the world?

528
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,420
They must have gone back to Chuyue's world.

529
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,460
I must find a way to enter Lingxiao Yard.

530
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,990
I don't believe I can't find the channel.

531
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,700
Sir,

532
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,430
now we are being imprisoned here.

533
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,780
There are guards outside taking turns to keep an eye on us.

534
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,160
How can we get out?

535
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,380
No offense,

536
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:16,780
but even if you are sick,

537
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,620
maybe no one would come to check on you.

538
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,060
Sick?

539
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,460
Have you memorized the plan?

540
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:34,450
Sir, don't worry.

541
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,810
Nothing will go wrong.

542
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,900
Guards.

543
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:42,740
Mr. Jingling...

544
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,700
He has smallpox.

545
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,510
I'm also infected.

546
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,700
Go get a doctor now.

547
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,680
What are you waiting for?

548
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,180
Get me a doctor!

549
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,780
I don't want to die.

550
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,740
I don't want to die.

551
00:32:58,940 --> 00:32:59,970
I don't want to die.

552
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,510
Doctor!

553
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,740
Doctor!

554
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,140
How did they open the channel?

555
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,060
I checked the bed last time.

556
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,260
I didn't find anything abnormal.

557
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,380
Did I miss anything?

558
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,980
Why did the Huaxi Stone break in two?

559
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,340
There was only a crack last time.

560
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:35,340
Is it related to this?

561
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,139
The Huaxi Stone

562
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:44,340
is a rare stone that fell from the sky.

563
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,730
It came from somewhere else.

564
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,340
The channel is very likely to be related to it.

565
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:53,340
Chuyang suddenly disappeared

566
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,020
after he lay on the bed that day.

567
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,300
Maybe if I get close to this,

568
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,290
I can go to Chuyue's world.

569
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,980
I'm close enough.

570
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,860
Why isn't it reacting at all?

571
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,820
When Qing was lying on the bed that day,

572
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,310
there was nothing unusual either.

573
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,550
Why?

574
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,420
I see.

575
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,980
A thunderstorm

576
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,980
is the way to open the channel.

577
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,150
It's a good day today.

578
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,760
It's sunny and warm.

579
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,070
A man and a woman will become a happily married couple.

580
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,580
They are a perfect match.

581
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,530
They will live happily ever after

582
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,700
and be with each other forever.

583
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:56,510
On the wedding day,

584
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,560
your presence graces this place.

585
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,400
Now let's welcome the new couple.

586
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,500
Good.

587
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,100
Good.

588
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,790
So beautiful.

589
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:17,580
So beautiful. So handsome.

590
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,450
I want a wedding like this too.

591
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,520
Am I beautiful?

592
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,220
It's very interesting.

593
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:55,540
Good. Good.

594
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,780
Put your hand here and look ahead.

595
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,730
And

596
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,210
along the ear root.

597
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,000
That's right.

598
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,750
This place is really nice.

599
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,180
The boss has sharp business acumen.

600
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,880
Nowadays, people

601
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,930
have a rapid pace of life

602
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,620
and face huge pressure.

603
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,780
All daily necessities are industrial products.

604
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,220
So they all want to come to a place like this to relax

605
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:20,820
and experience a different culture.

606
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,100
Daughter, I think this place will be popular.

607
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:26,380
I also heard that the boss is a young man.

608
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,460
Amazing.

609
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:31,980
Why is it so lively over there?

610
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:33,110
Let's go and have a look.

611
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,780
Let's go.

612
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,060
This one doesn't have fur.

613
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,980
I want one with fur.

614
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,090
Ladies and gentlemen,

615
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,780
it's been two weeks since our experience hall opened.

616
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:44,040
The number of customers is increasing steadily.

617
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,890
To thank you for your support,

618
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:50,550
the boss has decided to pick a lucky customer

619
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,370
to have a peach dance

620
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:55,870
with him.

621
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,710
There will also be a secret gift for the lucky customer.

622
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:04,270
Let's welcome the boss to the stage.

623
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,820
Welcome.

624
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,940
He's coming.

625
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,140
This is the boss.

626
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,350
He's so handsome.

627
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:22,400
He has broad shoulders and long legs.

628
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,620
I heard he is handsome.

629
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,340
Really?

630
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,140
Then I have to have a dance with him.

631
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,020
Maybe I can get a handsome boyfriend.

632
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,340
Come on.

633
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:31,990
Daughter,

634
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,420
the boss is an outstanding man.

635
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,010
Be high-spirited today

636
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:36,340
and strive to have a dance with him.

637
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,420
Are you sure you want him to be my boyfriend?

638
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,620
Of course.

639
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,880
It's not easy to meet such an outstanding guy.

640
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,120
So you have to do your best.

641
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,860
Fighting.

642
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,300
Hello, everyone.

643
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:52,060
First of all, thank you for coming.

644
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,000
I'm very happy

645
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,360
to see so many people here.

646
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,490
As you can see,

647
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,160
I have a bunch of flowers in my hand.

648
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,180
Next,

649
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,460
I will throw it out.

650
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,460
Whoever receives it

651
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,710
will be the lucky one tonight.

652
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,770
Go for it!

653
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,430
Come on.

654
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Throw it here.

655
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,980
-Here.
-Throw it far.

656
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,100
You got it!

657
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,000
-You got it!
-Congratulations.

658
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,800
Congratulations to this girl

659
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,300
on becoming the lucky one tonight.

660
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,660
Great!

661
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,340
Next,

662
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,060
please come to the stage.

663
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:45,140
Congratulations.

664
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:46,080
-Go.
-Congratulations.

665
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,300
She's so lucky.

666
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,590
An Jingzhao,

667
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:02,980
you have so many female fans.

668
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,110
It seems that An Jingzhao is very charming.

669
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,620
He wants to tell her

670
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:12,020
he already has a girl in his heart.

671
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:12,940
Her name is Li Chuyue.

672
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,820
He will never have anyone else in his heart in this life.

673
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,380
Great!

674
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,500
They danced so well.

675
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,580
Great.

676
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,260
You danced so well.

677
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,260
He's really good.

678
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:45,540
You must seize the chance.

679
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,320
He is capable.

680
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:58,260
I want to invite you two to have some tea.

681
00:40:59,340 --> 00:40:59,980
Have some tea?

682
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:00,860
Sure.

683
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,210
Have some tea.

684
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,540
-Let's go.
-Come with me.

685
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,420
An Jingzhao,

686
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,490
I bet you've never expected

687
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,460
that I would go to you one day

688
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,350
and kill you.

689
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:21,660
By that time,

690
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,500
Li Chuyue will be mine.

691
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,420
I'm a useless man now.

692
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,780
Even if I go to that world, what can I do?

693
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,450
An Jingzhao is skilled in martial arts.

694
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,900
It's impossible for me to kill him.

695
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,780
Right.

696
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,260
I can ask someone to go there on behalf of me.

697
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,050
Who?

698
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,450
How could I forget Zhou Wei?

699
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,200
Apart from me, he is the one

700
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,230
who hates An Jingzhao the most in this world.
