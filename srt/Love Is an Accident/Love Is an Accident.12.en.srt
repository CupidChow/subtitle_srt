Are you okay?

00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:56,910
I'm fine.

9
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,390
Got mildly poisoned,

10
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,450
but I can handle it.

do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?

An Jingzhao was poisoned with an incurable toxin.

30

Even the doctor can't determine the nature of the poison.

31
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,720
An Jingzhao is cunning.

32
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,510

Well.

He woke up yesterday.

45
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,940
But why hasn't he woken up

46
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,910
after sleeping for so long?

47
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,710
Although Young Lord has awakened,

the poison in his body has not been completely removed,

so he tends to sleep.

Moreover, he occasionally experiences bouts of unconsciousness.

52
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,710
The poison in Young Lord's body has not been completely removed,

53
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,440
so he must take the medicine on time.

Your Fengnuan Pavilion

132
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,420

After you've achieved such a great feat,

136
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920

on your behalf,

138

and he'll surely agree.

139
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,670
In case his poison can't be detoxified soon,

140
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,980
he needs to strengthen his constitution

141
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,310
and boost his immunity.

142
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,169

Is there anything else that can boost immunity?

Other than eating well and sleeping well,

149
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,700
it's maintaining a good mood

150
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,160
and getting enough sleep.

First,

161

leave Yunwei Villa immediately.

162

you tried to kill Chuyue again and again.

165
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,830
If it happens again,

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,300
I'll kill you.

167
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,250
Third,

168
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,560

Except for Chuyue,

170
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,950
other women can't touch me.

171
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,430
Is it necessary to be so straightforward?

172
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:26,830
But I'm happy to hear that.

173
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,180
Li Chuyue, enough.

174
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,270
Control yourself.

175
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,840

176
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,180
You can hate me.

177
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,390
But I'm here today to treat you.

The poison and detoxification techniques of my Fengnuan Pavilion

179
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,780
are among the best in the martial world.

180
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,240
You should know that best.

181
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,180
It concerns your health.

182
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,870
How can you treat it so lightly?

183
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,750
I said

184
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:47,870
I'm not sick.

185
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,520
I don't need treatment.

186
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,220
Besides,

187
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,030
even if I'm poisoned,

188
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,750
no one in the martial world can beat me.

189
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,510
You indeed seem like a different person.

190
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,600
Why haven't you left yet?

191
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,380
An Jingzhao.

192
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,160
Bai Zhi is right.

193
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,220
What if she can detoxify you?

194
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,100
Why don't you let her take a look?

195
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,030
I'll only let her treat me

196
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,300
if you agree.

197
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,400
I agree.

198
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:36,570
Jingzhao.

199
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,030
How did you get poisoned?

200
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,980
This poison is extremely dangerous.

201
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,350
If not treated promptly,

202
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,010
it will be life-threatening.

203
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:45,830
Miss Bai Zhi,

204
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,020
do you have any way to detoxify him?

205
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,130
I don't know.

206
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,820
Jingzhao,

207
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,920
I will try my best to treat you.

208
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,330
Don't bother.

209
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,230
I said

210
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,750
this poison is nothing to me.

211
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,190
Chuyue.

212
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,180
Do you want me to be cured?

213
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,460
Of course.

214
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,490
What were the methods you mentioned earlier

215
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,150
to boost the immune system?

216
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,010
Besides eating and drinking well,

217
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,350
you have to stay in a good mood

218
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,720
and sleep well.

219
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,010
What are you doing?

220
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,550
I'm doing as you said

221
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,030
to improve my immunity.

222
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,460
Then why did you pull me?

223
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:27,250
Only when you're by my side

224
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,090
can I be happy

225
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,050
and have enough sleep.

226
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:33,150
I set myself up again.

227
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,050
I will marry him.

228
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,950
Master.

229
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,350
Miss Bai Zhi sent a message,

230
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,020
saying that An Jingzhao is indeed quite seriously poisoned.

231
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,510
What about the gift I asked you to prepare?

232
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,830
Master of Zhuyin Pavilion

233
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:01,660
will bring martial arts manuals

234
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,580
to Mount Lingxiu tomorrow.

235
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,710
Second Lord.

236
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,800
The replica is ready.

237
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,900
Not bad.

238
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,040
Go get the money from the steward.

239
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,660
Thank you, Second Lord.

240
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,200
Please.

241
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,690
It's exactly like Zhu Maoqing's handwriting.

242
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,430
Master.

243
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:37,360
Now that An Jingzhao's temperament has changed drastically,

244
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,690
provoking him like this will surely

245
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,090
lead to a confrontation.

246
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,630
I've arranged our people in the Zhuyin Pavilion.

247
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,180
We will seize the right opportunity

248
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,120
to steal the martial arts manuals.

249
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,910
By that time, everyone

250
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,690
will believe that An Jingzhao stole the martial arts manuals.

251
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,440
Master, when you ascend to the position of the Lord,

252
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,440
it will be to rid the martial world of this threat.

253
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,350
Taoyun.

254
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,340
Taoyun.

255
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:49,910
Come here.

256
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,670
What time is it?

257
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,040
It's almost lunchtime.

258
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,130
Where is Li Chuyang?

259
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,770
I haven't seen him for a day.

260
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,460
The disciples in the backyard seem to surround him.

261
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,500
He seems to be selling something.

262
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:03,990
I've been hearing

263
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,610
Mr. Li say

264
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,090
"Oh Maigao, buy it."

265
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,580
This disciple called Oh Maigao

266
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,950
is really rich.

267
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,060
I envy him.

268
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,430
Li Chuyang is fooling around.

269
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,710
I'll deal with him later.

270
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:21,310
By the way,

271
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,070
the Second Young Master came just now.

272
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:24,730
He said he had news to tell you.

273
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,830
But since you were all resting,

274
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,230
he said he'll come later.

275
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,970
He must have news about Doctor Luo.

276
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,030
I'll go to him then.

277
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,050
I didn't expect the handsome guy's courtyard to be so unique.

278
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,450
Compared to here, my house is like a pigsty.

279
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,680
This is the home of an artistic young man.

280
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,270
Handsome.

281
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,060
Chuyue.

282
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,840
Have you found Doctor Luo?

283
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:23,970
The servant said that Doctor Luo went to the mountain to collect herbs.

284
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,410
He doesn't know when he'll come back.

285
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,620
But I'll send someone

286
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,090
to keep in touch with the servant.

287
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,260
Once Doctor Luo comes back,

288
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,790
I'll ask him to treat my brother immediately.

289
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,270
I've been reading medical books these days.

290
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,680
I hope I can find a way.

291
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,170
Young Master,

292
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,560
the kitchen made some lychee syrup today.

293
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,020
It happens only once a year in our Yin Garden.

294
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Mother loves lychee syrup the most.

295
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,710
It's a pity that she can't eat it today.

296
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,700
Why not?

297
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,050
Just send it to her.

298
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,130
You may leave.

299
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,970
Ten years ago, my mother angered my father.

300
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,710
So she has been grounded in the Western Courtyard.

301
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,510
I can only visit her once a month.

302
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,950
So I can only visit her the day after tomorrow.

303
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,250
The lychee syrup will have gone bad the day after tomorrow.

304
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:25,510
This lord previously tried to force a marriage on An Jingzhao.

305
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,710
He’s used to being a lord of his own will.

306
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,790
He even detained others.

307
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,970
Where is your mom?

308
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,630
We'll find a way to get her out.

309
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:34,810
Thank you.

310
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,350
For all these years,

311
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,400
you are the first person who, upon learning about my mother's confinement,

312
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,360
didn't pity me

313
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,630
or look down on me

314
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,910
but reacted like this.

315
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,670
Why would I look down on you?

316
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:50,020
Every person has their own unique experiences

317
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,930
and destinies.

318
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,700
All that matters is living your own life earnestly.

319
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,830
As for those who gossip and criticize,

320
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,940
you don't need to care.

321
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,680
The most important rule in life

322
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,220
is not to care too much about what others think.

323
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,680
Not to care too much about what others think?

324
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,580
Moreover,

325
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:06,810
there will definitely be a way to get your mother out

326
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:08,390
Where there's a will, there's a way,

327
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,020
and when you're hungry, there will be meat.

328
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,080
There will be a way.

329
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,470
Here.

330
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:17,380
This is the meat from my hometown.

331
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,030
Try it.

332
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,110
Why are you looking at me?

333
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,960
Last time, when I was feeling down,

334
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,980
you comforted me in the style of your hometown.

335
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,510
I wanted to express my gratitude,

336
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:50,300
so I carved this.

337
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,240
I wonder if you like it.

338
00:18:58,790 --> 00:18:59,670
This is me?

339
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,140
This is like a me with beauty filters, isn't it?

340
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,930
And the filters are overused.

341
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,220
Do you like it?

342
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,460
Yes.

343
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,300
Of course.

344
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,480
I'm not that good-looking.

345
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,470
I've only captured one-tenth of your beauty.

346
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,710
Li Chuyue.

347
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,070
Li Chuyue, this is you after excessive photo editing.

348
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:26,100
Why did you come here?

349
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,990
It's one thing that you're causing trouble at Lingxiao Yard.

350
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,250
Of course, I came for a sightseeing tour.

351
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,560
I didn't expect that my brother-in-law's younger brother

352
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,710
would also be so good-looking.

353
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,180
Hello.

354
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,460
I'm Li Chuyue's younger brother,

355
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,060
in charge of our family's diplomatic affairs.

356
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,490
By the way,

357
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:45,950
handsome gentleman.

358
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,990
This is a limited edition ballpoint pen

359
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,220
that I've been reluctant to part with.

360
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,040
With it,

361
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,660
you'll definitely write like a genius.

362
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,430
Buy it. Buy it.

363
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,900
Li Chuyang, keep it.

364
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,080
I've never seen a pen like this.

365
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,560
Of course, I want to buy it.

366
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,330
No need.

367
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,320
This is worthless.

368
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,020
We'll give it to you.

369
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,150
Why is it worthless?

370
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:10,430
I brought it here through interstellar shopping.

371
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,420
Or we could use this to exchange.

372
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:18,150
Choose whichever one you like.

373
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,570
The craftsmanship is quite good.

374
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,980
It should be worth a good amount if sold, right?

375
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,550
Enough.

376
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,310
Look.

377
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,580
You're awake.

378
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,770
How do you feel?

379
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,480
Don't worry.

380
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,780
I'm fine.

381
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,860
I knew you were worried about me.

382
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:41,840
Chuyang,

383
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,900
put down everything in your hands.

384
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,830
If you like them,

385
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,990
I'll find the best sculpture in Shangyu

386
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,990
and give it to you.

387
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,130
Can I buy more?

388
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,130
I'll give you as many as you want.

389
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,610
How about giving me the Cold Moon Knife as well?

390
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,870
Of course. You can have it.

391
00:20:58,870 --> 00:20:59,330
Come on.

392
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:03,310
Great!

393
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,760
Chuyang.

394
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,360
What did they two say just now?

395
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,710
Jingling gave my sister a sculpture.

396
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:14,420
Is it nice?

397
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,960
Look.

398
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,540
Ling,

399
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:20,900
it seems that I've never received one before.

400
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,390
If you like it,

401
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,440
I'll make one and give it to you.

402
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:26,520
An Jingzhao.

403
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,740
Don’t make any trouble.

404
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,400
-Let’s go back.
-I can go back.

405
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,930
But I have a condition.

406
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,630
Go ahead.

407
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,730
Don't call me An Jingzhao.

408
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,280
What should I call you?

409
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,310
Call me Hubby.

410
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,000
Impossible.

411
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,940
Sister.

412
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,430
My brother-in-law is sick.

413
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,430
Just do as he says.

414
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,250
Hubby.

415
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,340
Louder!

416
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:55,980
Hubby.

417
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,430
Be gentle.

418
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,460
Hubby.

419
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,460
This pen is for you.

420
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,310
[Yun]

421
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,070
Mr. Donghua.

422
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,600
Young...

423
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,730
Young Madam's brother

424
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,290
was abducted by a group of ruffians.

425
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,150
What happened?

426
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,990
The ruffians bullied a father and daughter who sang together.

427
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,460
The young madam's brother intervened to help

428
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,300
and was captured by them.

429
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,600
Later, the young madam went to find her brother

430
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,270
and was also captured.

431
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:56,780
Where?

432
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,870
Opera Street.

433
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,600
Young Lord.

434
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:03,040
Who dares to harm my wife and younger brother-in-law?

435
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,560
Young Lord,

436
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,890
you are not feeling well.

437
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,780
I'll go by myself.

438
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,440
I will bring them back safely.

439
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,050
Young...

440
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,890
Come on, let's see.

441
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,480
Mine.

442
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,970
Let them go

443
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,980
and I'll spare your life.

444
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,830
Release them?

445
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,220
Don't you want to know who I am?

446
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,020
Don’t be rude.

447
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,060
This is the Young Lord of our Yunwei Villa.

448
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:35,880
Boss.

449
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,230
What he said is true.

450
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:40,160
He really is from Yunwei Villa.

451
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,960
Let's release those two people.

452
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:49,070
So you are the Young Lord of the top sect.

453
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,210
But you're just a sick man.

454
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,430
It's okay if you want to rescue them.

455
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,980
But you'll have to defeat me first,

456
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,440
and then you can take them.

457
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,870
Do we need the Young Lord to deal with you?

458
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:01,460
Let me.

459
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,780
I'm going to spar with

460
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,190
the renowned Young Lord.

461
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,880
If it were with someone else,

462
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,700
I wouldn't be able to guarantee

463
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,700
the safety of that young lady and the child.

464
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:13,880
-You...
-Okay.

465
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,580
If you can remain standing within three moves,

466
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,520
you win.

467
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,720
Young Lord,

468
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,710
there is still remaining poison in your body.

469
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,310
You shouldn't use martial arts at this moment.

470
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,340
Everyone step aside.

471
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,220
Take this!

472
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,220
Boss! Boss!

473
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:55,750
Release them!

474
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,350
Release them!

475
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:00,880
Yes.

476
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,100
Hurry!

477
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,980
Are you okay?

478
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,280
How are you?

479
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,500
They didn't harm you, did they?

480
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,780
You didn't use your inner strength, did you?

481
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm so happy.

482
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,550
Somebody was worried about me.

483
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,900
It's because you're sick and can't use your inner strength.

484
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,700
Don’t worry.

485
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,920
As the Young Lord of Yunwei Villa,

486
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,280
I don't need to use my internal strength to deal with them.

487
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,610
Let's go.

488
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,860
Let's go back.

489
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,390
Chuyang.

490
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

491
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,750
Young Lord.

492
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,650
When you weren't here,

493
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,050
someone delivered this.

494
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:05,990
Young Lord.

495
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,790
[To An Jingzhao. I have heard of the unparalleled martial prowess of the Young Lord of Yunwei Villa. I am Zhu Maoqing, the Master of Zhuyin Pavilion.]

496
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,790
[And I humbly propose a duel with the Young Lord on Mount Lingxiu in two days. Yours respectfully, Zhu Maoqing]

497
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,460
Where's Chuyue?

498
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,150
She is currently reprimanding Li Chuyang.

499
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:25,570
Young Lord,

500
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,290
you are not feeling well.

501
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,740
You must absolutely refrain from using your energy forcefully.

502
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,280
I will decline on your behalf to the Zhuyin Pavilion.

503
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,340
No need to decline.

504
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,420
Since they dare to provoke me,

505
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,420
I'll let them see and learn.

506
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,610
But I suspect

507
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,060
that this is most likely a scheme by Zhou Wei.

508
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,720
Say no more.

509
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:47,880
Young Lord.

510
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,430
Doctor.

511
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,590
What is the current condition of the Young Lord?

512
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,180
Why hasn't he awakened yet?

513
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,280
Wasn't it said before that this medicine

514
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,870
could cure the poison?

515
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:23,730
Perhaps the poison is too potent,

516
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,350
and these medicines are unable to control it.

517
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,080
If it's not cleared in time,

518
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,140
the Young Lord

519
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,860
may be in mortal danger.

520
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,810
What should we do then?

521
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,090
I have limited abilities

522
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,990
and no better solution.

523
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,020
Sorry.

524
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Let me see him off.

525
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,870
Second Young Master.

526
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,070
What should we do now?

527
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,700
Doctor Luo is still collecting herbs in the mountains,

528
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,250
and we can't wait any longer.

529
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,810
I'll enter the mountains and trace his tracks to find him.

530
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,150
OK.

531
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,220
All right, then I'll go with you.

532
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,530
My brother may wake up soon.

533
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,770
If he insists on having a martial arts duel with the Zhuyin Pavilion,

534
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,830
you must stop him. So you should stay.

535
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,190
I have a way.

536
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
You can rest assured and go find Doctor Luo.

537
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,190
I have a way to prevent An Jingzhao from going.

538
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,180
Isn't this simple enough?

539
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,780
Let him sleep for a few hours,

540
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,120
and he'll miss the duel.

541
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:00,950
You're awake.

542
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:01,810
Here.

543
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,430
Time for medicine.

544
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,050
It's hot. Here.

545
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,810
[Yunwei Villa]

546
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,230
Taoyun.

547
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,000
Young Madam.

548
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,500
Where is An Jingzhao?

549
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,760
Young Lord went out early in the morning.

550
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,240
An Jingzhao, how dare you?

551
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,660
You actually

552
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,060
used a kiss

553
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,270
to make me ingest a sleeping drug.

554
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,750
Is he going to that so-called Mount Lingxiu?

555
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:31,220
No.

556
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,220
I have to stop him.

557
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,550
Young Madam.

558
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,200
Young Lord left you a message.

559
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,270
What?

560
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,390
He said

561
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,710
"Honey,

562
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:42,460
wait for my return."

563
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,140
Young Madam,

564
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:49,210
I have something I'd like to ask you.

565
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,190
Go ahead.

566
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,760
I can't resist a cute girl.

567
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,470
Is "Honey" your nickname?

568
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,580
Can I call you that too?

569
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,430
Sure, go ahead.

570
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,420
Honey.

571
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,510
Has Jingzhao gone to the appointment?

572
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,190
I have to hurry and stop him.

573
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:13,520
I hope it's not too late.

574
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,000
Wait.

575
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,840
If you're going to Mount Lingxiu,

576
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,150
you need to dress as a man.

577
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,150
Women are not allowed to go in there.

578
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,120
What kind of ridiculous rule is that?

579
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,980
I've already prepared it for you.

580
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,630
Thank you.

581
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,870
Miss Bai Zhi.

582
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,220
Is there a solution

583
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,130
for An Jingzhao's poison now?

584
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,600
This poison is very rare,

585
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,110
and I haven't found a way to cure it yet.

586
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,040
A mere Zhuyin Pavilion dares to challenge me,

587
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,750
quite courageously.

588
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:27,560
My Zhuyin Pavilion has no prior connections with your sect.

589
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,750
What do you mean by these words, Young Lord?

590
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,210
You issued the challenge,

591
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,350
and now you're backing down.

592
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,680
Are you scared?

593
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,080
You...

594
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:39,860
Even if your Yunwei Villa is the top martial sect in the martial world,

595
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,320
my Zhuyin Pavilion won't tolerate such humiliation from you.

596
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,210
Master.

597
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:47,930
No need.

598
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,310
Master.

599
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,490
Master.

600
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm fine.

601
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,420
An Jingzhao.

602
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,880
You actually injured someone with a hidden weapon?

603
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,740
I was eliminating the spy for you.

604
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,830
You despicable person.

605
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,400
Today, I'll let you experience

606
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,930
the ultimate techniques of Zhuyin Pavilion.

607
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,720
An Jingzhao.

608
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,060
Stop him now.

609
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,920
Otherwise,

610
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:53,870
he won't be able to establish himself in the martial world like this.

611
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,480
Go.

612
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,580
Go.

613
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,110
An Jingzhao.

614
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:12,870
Calm down.

615
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,300
An Jingzhao.

616
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,330
An Jingzhao!

617
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,469
-An Jingzhao.
-Master.

618
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:32,989
Master.

619
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:33,790
An Jingzhao.

620
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,630
An Jingzhao.

621
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,790
An Jingzhao.

622
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,380
An Jingzhao.

623
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,460
Wake up! An Jingzhao!

624
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,280
An Jingzhao!

625
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,060
An Jingzhao.

626
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,110
Are you going to perform artificial respiration next?

627
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,250
You scared me.

628
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:55,980
Really?

629
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,470
Please.

630
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,140
Hottie.

631
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,500
Grandmother.

632
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,300
I've invited Doctor Luo here.

633
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,100
Please.

634
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,170
Jingling,

635
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,080
you're great.

636
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,110
Afterward, I'll repay you well.

637
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,760
How is it?

638
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,780
Although most of the poison in the Young Lord has been forced out,

639
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,840
this poison is extremely dangerous.

640
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,390
The remaining toxins

641
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,950
have already begun to spread within the body.

642
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:46,150
Now, only the Spirit Pearl Grass can save the Young Lord.

643
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,980
But the Spirit Pearl Grass is extremely rare,

644
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,780
and it can only be found in the Magic Flower Valley.

645
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,060
I'll take my leave.

646
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,790
Thank you.

647
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,320
Doctor Luo, please.

648
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:05,250
So, does this mean there's hope to save An Jingzhao?

649
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,540
Why do you all have such worried expressions?

650
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,620
We just need to obtain the Spirit Pearl Grass.

651
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,710
You may not know,

652
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,380
but the Valley Lord of the Magic Flower Valley is extremely cruel.

653
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,030
For many years,

654
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:21,460
countless people have tried to break into the valley

655
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,320
to obtain the Spirit Pearl Grass,

656
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,900
but no one has succeeded.

657
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,520
The Valley Lord set up mechanisms outside the stone gate

658
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,210
and even shared the decryption method with the world.

659
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,140
Strangely,

660
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,610
this method never worked.

661
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,000
If

662
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:38,980
the gate cannot be opened within half an hour,

663
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,780
poisonous gas will be released,

664
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,530
leading to certain death.

665
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,010
It's indeed challenging.

666
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,310
Madam.

667
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,170
I'd like to request permission to go.

668
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:53,270
I will bring a few disciples from the villa with me

669
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,310
and ensure we obtain the Spirit Pearl Grass.

670
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,430
Be very cautious on this mission.

671
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,110
If you encounter obstacles,

672
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,480
do not act recklessly.

673
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,650
In that case, come back and discuss with us first.

674
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:04,850
Rest assured, Madam.

675
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,240
I'll take my leave.

676
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,600
I wonder how my bro is doing.

677
00:37:29,170 --> 00:37:29,900
Young Madam.

678
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,260
Donghua has returned.

679
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,470
He couldn't open the stone gate

680
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,470
and was poisoned.

681
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,010
Is the Magic Flower Valley really that formidable?

682
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,060
I'll go.

683
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,530
I refuse to believe we can't obtain it.

684
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,880
Li Chuyue.

685
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,420
This is not a joke.

686
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,480
We came to Shangyu to have fun,

687
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,010
not to risk our lives.

688
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:52,990
Moreover,

689
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,410
if something happens to you,

690
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,460
how am I supposed to explain it to our parents?

691
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,120
Li Chuyang,

692
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,980
did you bring a travel backpack?

693
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,710
Give it to me.

694
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,270
No.

695
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,110
I object.

696
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,050
You can't go.

697
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,550
Objection overruled.

698
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,610
I'll get it myself.

699
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,460
Li Chuyue.

700
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,790
It's dangerous.

701
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,340
Li Chuyue.

702
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,200
Li Chuyang.

703
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:48,660
Why are you here?

704
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,050
I'm here to protect you.

705
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,500
Donghua mentioned earlier

706
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,510
that the password for this mechanism is red-green-yellow-green-green.

707
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,060
However, the Valley Lord has already shared the password with everyone,

708
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,510
so why can't anyone open this gate?

709
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,460
Let's not think about it for now.

710
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,860
Why don't we try it first?

711
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,520
Okay.

712
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,320
Pay attention to the time.

713
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,510
I don't want to get poisoned.

714
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:14,870
Go.

715
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,500
Red.

716
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,010
Green.

717
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,010
Over there.

718
00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:36,890
Yellow.

719
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,300
According to the legend,

720
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,630
the most worn-out should be the green lion.

721
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,220
But look,

722
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,510
this red lion

723
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,700
is clearly more worn out.

724
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,070
Sister.

725
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:32,320
Could it be that the Valley Lord is colorblind

726
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:34,660
so he mistook the red lion for a green lion

727
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,160
and the green lion for a red lion?

728
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,360
In that case, the password would be green-red-yellow-red-red.

729
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:43,990
Try it.

730
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:44,870
Come on, try it.

731
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,410
Green.

732
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,220
Red.

733
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,100
Yellow.

734
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,500
Come on.

735
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,410
Yes!

736
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,470
Let's go.

737
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,980
Wait for me!

738
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,320
Let's go.

739
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,580
Be careful.

740
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:15,490
Let's go.

741
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:18,610
Sister.

742
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,710
Doesn't this place look a bit like Xishuangbanna?

743
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,240
A little.

744
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,510
Be careful.

745
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,820
Put me down!

746
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,960
Let me out!

747
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,740
-Let me out!
-Let me down!

748
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:40,850
Li Chuyang.

749
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,520
Who are you to intrude

750
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,650
into the forbidden ground of my Magic Flower Valley?
