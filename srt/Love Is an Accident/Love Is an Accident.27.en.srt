[Episode 27]

4
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:48,479
[I'm sorry. I'm standing here as punishment.]

5
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,650
[I've really realized my mistake. I'll never say anything like breaking up again.]

6
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,020
[In this life and the next next life, you are the only one I love.]

[The person involved]

8
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,660
Please forgive me.

9
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,450
If you don't,

10
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,500
I'll be greedy.

11
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,220
Why?

12
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,380
I'll be greedy

13
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
because I can't have you

14
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,670
even though you are right in front of me.

15
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,640
Li Chuyue,

16
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,100
is this how you apologize?

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:02,620
So

18
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,340
have you forgiven me?

19
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,220
Your attitude

20
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,320
is fairly sincere.

21
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,500
But I'm still angry.

22
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,340
I need to rest.

23
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,950
Go back to your room.

24
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,220
Li Chuyue.

25
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:30,860
Li Chuyue.

26
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,950
Is my brother-in-law still angry?

27
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,620
I've tried to please him

28
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,550
and apologized.

29
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,090
Why didn't it work?

30
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,740
You didn't do this?

31
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,750
Right?

32
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,410
Jingzhao,

33
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,600
I asked Mr. Yueming for some restoratives.

34
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,670
Let me do it.

35
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:06,280
No need.

36
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,810
I need to talk to Jingzhao alone.

37
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,399
Dear,

38
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:20,970
let me feed you.

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,770
Wait.

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,640
Why do I feel a little hot?

41
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,340
The medicine must be bitter, right?

42
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,710
Do you want some sugar?

43
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,340
Where...

44
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,020
is sugar?

45
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,270
Stop being angry.

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,230
I'm tired.

47
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,310
I need to rest.

48
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,150
An Jingzhao.

49
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,220
What are you doing?

50
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,220
Stop being angry.

51
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,450
Do as I say right now.

52
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,860
You're sick.

53
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,080
You are weak.

54
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,560
You are no match for me now.

55
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,920
The best way to please your wife when she is angry

56
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,140
is to kiss her, right?

57
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,820
Don't be angry anymore.

58
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,830
Why would I listen to you?

59
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,100
An Jingzhao,

60
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,700
that's enough.

61
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
What's wrong?

62
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,030
Did you catch a cold?

63
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:17,890
Li Chuyue,

64
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,030
don't think your...

65
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,780
your trick works.

66
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,190
It works.

67
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,020
Young Lord,

68
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,000
did you fail to control yourself?

69
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:41,700
No.

70
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,170
I controlled myself very well.

71
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,810
Go stand there.

72
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,890
Who can stand this?

73
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,990
Li Chuyue, what are you doing?

74
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,780
I'm cold.

75
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,390
I'm here to warm myself.

76
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,460
Don't be angry anymore, okay?

77
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,260
I promise

78
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,770
I won't say anything like that again.

79
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,980
I'll discuss with you first no matter what.

80
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,140
I want to be with you

81
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,240
in this life, the next life, and the next next life.

82
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,820
But didn't you say

83
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,510
you are with me

84
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,860
just because of a whim?

85
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,790
There are so many handsome men in the world.

86
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,480
You can't guarantee you won't fall for them.

87
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,050
Yes, it was a whim.

88
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,550
Because when I'm with you,

89
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,450
you're fresh every day.

90
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,220
You rascal.

91
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,060
Chuyue,

92
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,510
why is there coldness in your body?

93
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,710
There isn't.

94
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,830
It's cold here.

95
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,049
I just caught a cold.

96
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,250
Don't talk nonsense.

97
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
It's definitely not just a cold.

98
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,580
What did you do to save me?

99
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,220
Didn't we agree

100
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,460
to be honest with each other?

101
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,860
I...

102
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,100
I used my body temperature to drive away the coldness of the orchid.

103
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,740
This...

104
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,050
This coldness is extremely dangerous for our bodies.

105
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:05,420
You...

106
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:05,820
It's okay.

107
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,460
It's okay.

108
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,460
You're powerful.

109
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,360
You must have a way to save me.

110
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,820
Come on.

111
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:29,820
Eat.

112
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,280
Roast chicken.

113
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,590
Eat.

114
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,900
Roast chicken. Come on.

115
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,480
Is it going to rain today?

116
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,920
Young Lord.

117
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,040
There will be thunder and lightning within 6 hours.

118
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,400
Li Chuyang,

119
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,100
go back after you finish eating.

120
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,700
Go back?

121
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,630
No.

122
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,010
The vacation isn't over yet.

123
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,350
I want to travel in the martial arts world.

124
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,340
It's too dangerous here.

125
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,400
You have to go back.

126
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,550
Brother-in-law.

127
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Chuyang, be good.

128
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,540
The martial arts world is in turmoil now.

129
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,140
This place is no longer safe.

130
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,290
You should go back as soon as possible.

131
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,340
Donghua.

132
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,740
Chuyang,

133
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:07,960
I have to protect Young Lord and Young Madam.

134
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,580
I really can't take care of you.

135
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,110
Donghua,

136
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,770
take Chuyang out of here.

137
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,550
Be careful.

138
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,260
Zhu Maoqing and An Jingling must have started searching.

139
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,700
Okay.

140
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,290
Young Lord, Young Madam, don't worry.

141
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,730
Keep an eye on them.

142
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,800
Follow them from afar.

143
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,890
Don't alert them.

144
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,490
Okay.

145
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,420
Follow them.

146
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,220
Okay.

147
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,300
Wait.

148
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,680
Donghua is highly skilled in martial arts.

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,410
He will definitely notice you.

150
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,520
Take out the tracking powder.

151
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,410
Find a chance to dust them with it.

152
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,800
And carefully search the place where Donghua appeared.

153
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,780
You have to find An Jingzhao.

154
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,460
Okay.

155
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,290
Chuyang, be careful.

156
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,980
Okay.

157
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,860
What's wrong?

158
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,950
Nothing.

159
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,420
I'm going to get some water.

160
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,550
Wait for me in front.

161
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,060
But be careful.

162
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:41,940
Let's go.

163
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,340
Sir,

164
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,110
they're in the bedroom.

165
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,620
I'm going to ask some men to surround the bedroom.

166
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,180
No need.

167
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,290
Donghua escorted Chuyang back.

168
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Looks like he's going back to his hometown.

169
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,810
I'd like to see

170
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,360
how they will do it.

171
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,500
Hurry. Lie down.

172
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,220
It's time.

173
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,510
Donghua,

174
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,940
I'm leaving.

175
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:33,040
See you if there's a chance.

176
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:33,820
Come on.

177
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,530
Is it some sort of through-the-wall technique?

178
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,130
The bed is the channel.

179
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,470
See if there is a mechanism on the bed.

180
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:30,990
Okay.

181
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,100
Sir,

182
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,340
there's no mechanism.

183
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,670
And nothing is unusual.

184
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,250
You go lie on the bed.

185
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,810
If the bed is the channel,

186
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,880
how did they open it?

187
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,130
Chuyue,

188
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,390
your hands are so cold.

189
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,980
The coldness is starting to erode your body.

190
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,700
I'm fine.

191
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:24,340
I'm fine.

192
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,300
Young Lord.

193
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,540
Young Madam. Don't worry.

194
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,270
I've sent Chuyang back safely.

195
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,220
Was there anyone following you?

196
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:38,700
Yes.

197
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:39,690
I've noticed him.

198
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:40,950
I've gotten rid of him.

199
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:43,980
Chuyue,

200
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:44,410
Donghua,

201
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,210
pack our things. It's time to go.

202
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,500
We should stay here until you get better.

203
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,820
The primordial energy in my body has stabilized.

204
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,280
We can't delay any longer.

205
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:54,340
An Jingzhao.

206
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,700
Young Lord.

207
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,340
Mr. Yueming.

208
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,000
Young Lord.

209
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:00,760
Mr. Yueming.

210
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,550
The primordial energy in his body

211
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,420
hasn't merged with my Bingyou Skill.

212
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,700
It has started to reject it.

213
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,420
Soon,

214
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,630
he'll lose all his primordial energy.

215
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,470
If so,

216
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,300
there's nothing we can do.

217
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,980
Mr. Yueming,

218
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,980
what should we do?

219
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,780
There is only one way,

220
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,070
but it's extremely dangerous.

221
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,980
What is it?

222
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,060
Transfer all his primordial energy

223
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,980
into the orchid.

224
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,580
Cultivate his primordial energy with the power of the orchid.

225
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,770
Besides, he should never be disturbed

226
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,060
within 3 days.

227
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,540
Once it is interrupted,

228
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,760
his primordial energy will be scattered,

229
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,420
and his life will be in danger.

230
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,190
Mr. Yueming,

231
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,930
use this method.

232
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,300
I'll bear the consequences myself.

233
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,300
Follow me.

234
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,920
Come on.

235
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,000
Young Lord.

236
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:43,840
Be careful.

237
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,190
-Slowly.
-Let's go.

238
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,750
Go in.

239
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:54,440
Be careful.

240
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:05,869
Be careful.

241
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,730
Slowly.

242
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,220
Come on.

243
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,630
Help him up.

244
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:12,980
Come on.

245
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,300
Donghua,

246
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,730
take care of An Jingzhao.

247
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:55,860
I'll distract them.

248
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:56,270
But...

249
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,020
Don't worry.

250
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,220
Chuyue.

251
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,860
Search outside.

252
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,260
Okay.

253
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,140
You go over there.

254
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,700
Okay.

255
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,220
You follow me.

256
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:32,550
Okay.

257
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,940
Chuyue, are you feeling unwell?

258
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,140
Why do you look so...

259
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't touch me.

260
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,860
Why did you kill the valley lord?

261
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,500
Why did you slander An Jingzhao?

262
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:58,700
Chuyue,

263
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
my brother did that.

264
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,150
Everyone in the martial arts world knows

265
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,060
I've never practiced any martial arts.

266
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:07,260
Stop pretending.

267
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,190
You're such a good actor.

268
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,910
I'm really impressed.

269
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,300
Chuyue,

270
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:16,590
where is my brother?

271
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,810
He'll be a threat if he stays here.

272
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,840
I have to find a way to lure him out.

273
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,140
Just give up.

274
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,740
I will never tell you.

275
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,100
An Jingzhao!

276
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,260
-An Jingzhao! Don't come back!
-Chuyue.

277
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,360
An Jingzhao, don't come back!

278
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,780
Chuyue.

279
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,780
Don't come back!

280
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:43,950
Let go of me!

281
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,790
An Jingling.

282
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,750
An Jingzhao has received my signal.

283
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,920
He won't come back.

284
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:50,740
Let go of me!

285
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,980
Let go of me!

286
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,380
Search the area now.

287
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,560
Find An Jingzhao.

288
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,220
Okay.

289
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,300
Follow me.

290
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,900
Chuyue.

291
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,260
-Chuyue.
-Let go of me!

292
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,020
You are sick.

293
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:05,150
Come back to the villa with me.

294
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,100
Why should I go back with you?

295
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,700
It's dangerous outside.

296
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
Come back with me.

297
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,900
I can protect you.

298
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,780
That's funny.

299
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,970
I think you are dangerous.

300
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:15,970
Let go of me!

301
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,210
Let go of me!

302
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,500
-An Jingling!
-Chuyue.

303
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,610
-I'm useless to you.
-Listen to me.

304
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:20,870
Why won't you let me go?

305
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,680
Because I like you.

306
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,300
I've liked you for a long time.

307
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,660
I want to see you at every moment.

308
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,820
I want to be with you forever.

309
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:41,710
An Jingling, I've always treated you as my little brother.

310
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,460
Now you are my enemy.

311
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,260
I don't care what you think of me.

312
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,220
You just need to be by my side.

313
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:57,300
An Jingling.

314
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,290
An Jingling!

315
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,090
Let go of me!

316
00:20:59,250 --> 00:20:59,980
Come with me.

317
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,450
An Jingling, let go of me!

318
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,100
Let go of me, An Jingling!

319
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,210
[Yunwei Villa]

320
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,220
Chuyue,

321
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,500
are you still mad at me?

322
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,000
This is for you.

323
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,000
Did Li Chuyang teach him that?

324
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,220
Don't you like it?

325
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,140
You can't forget my brother for the time being.

326
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,380
I don't blame you.

327
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,500
One day, you will understand

328
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,140
my love for you

329
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,980
is much more than his.

330
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,780
You're wrong.

331
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,170
If you really love me,

332
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,060
you would care about my feelings.

333
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,140
You wouldn't have imprisoned me here.

334
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,400
I just want to do my best to make you happy.

335
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,430
I don't need you to do your best.

336
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,700
I just want you to let me go.

337
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,980
You are my love.

338
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,760
I want to keep you by my side

339
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,480
and protect you

340
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,010
and love you for the rest of my life.

341
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,960
Am I wrong?

342
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,330
But I don't want to.

343
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:05,730
Chuyue,

344
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,020
why are your hands so cold?

345
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,510
I'm just worried about you.

346
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,720
I'm going to find a doctor for you.

347
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:24,900
Lord,

348
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,210
where are you going?

349
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,630
You're still very weak.

350
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:40,840
You?

351
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,060
Lord,

352
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,360
we haven't seen each other for years.

353
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,460
Do you think I've changed?

354
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,220
Who released you?

355
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,530
Go back!

356
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,660
Of course Ling released me.

357
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,060
I've been imprisoned by you for over 10 years

358
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,120
and suffered a lot.

359
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:00,770
Now I'm back to Yin Garden again

360
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,330
to manage the villa's domestic affairs

361
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,990
and live an extravagant life.

362
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,890
I'm really not used to it.

363
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,120
You evil woman!

364
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,620
Guards!

365
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,460
Lock up this evil woman.

366
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,860
Guards!

367
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,380
An Chenghu,

368
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,780
Ling is in charge of the villa now.

369
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,000
No one will listen to you anymore.

370
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,940
And your Zhao

371
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,580
was hit by the Shenyuan Whip.

372
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,870
I'm afraid he's already dead.

373
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
You evil woman.

374
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,860
Zhao must be fine.

375
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,120
Zhao must be fine.

376
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:50,330
Ling is good at both literature and martial arts.

377
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,390
He's outstanding.

378
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,220
He can replace you

379
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,820
and share your burden.

380
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,300
No way.

381
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:00,940
Zhao.

382
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,560
Let him rest.

383
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,060
I'll take care of his meals from now on.

384
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,460
Okay.

385
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,100
Leave.

386
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,300
I'll take care of her.

387
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:29,930
Okay.

388
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,620
Chuyue,

389
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,910
what should I do to keep you by my side?

390
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:12,660
Chuyue.

391
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,050
Someone.

392
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,380
Someone!

393
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,510
Go get a doctor!

394
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,260
Chuyue,

395
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,780
it's okay. I'm here.

396
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,370
An Jingzhao.

397
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:31,750
Don't leave me.

398
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,380
An Jingzhao.

399
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,650
Why are you torturing me like this?

400
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,880
What happened to Miss Chuyue?

401
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,100
Sir,

402
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,540
this coldness is evil.

403
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,640
It has invaded her internal organs.

404
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,300
I'm afraid it's not good.

405
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,460
What?

406
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,150
What do you mean?

407
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,550
I'm ashamed.

408
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,740
I was blinded by the superficial symptoms a few days ago.

409
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,600
I didn't find out the true reason.

410
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,860
This coldness is nothing ordinary.

411
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,480
It may come from some evil internal force.

412
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:15,450
She is very weak internally.

413
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,620
I'm afraid she won't make it.

414
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,940
Nonsense!

415
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,490
How can there be no way to save her?

416
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,250
It's just coldness, right?

417
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,380
No.

418
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,430
You're a doctor.

419
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,720
You must have a way, right?

420
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,780
Right?

421
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,230
There is a way we can try.

422
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:34,980
But...

423
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,780
But what?

424
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,860
Tell me now.

425
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,420
She has never practiced martial arts,

426
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,860
so she has no internal force

427
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,860
and can't resist the invasion of the coldness.

428
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
That's why she's very sick.

429
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,540
If someone can extract the coldness from her

430
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,940
with the internal force,

431
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:50,030
maybe she can be saved.

432
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,900
That's easy.

433
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,380
I can just transfer my internal force to her.

434
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,390
Wait.

435
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,840
The coldness in her body will harm you.

436
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,850
It will make you lose much internal force.

437
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,250
And the coldness will invade your body too.

438
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,650
As long as Miss Chuyue is safe,

439
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,800
I'm willing to do anything.

440
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,580
Although the coldness isn't completely removed,

441
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,500
she's fine for now.

442
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,610
But you can't

443
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,570
use your internal force to extract the coldness from her again.

444
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,970
Otherwise, your life will be in danger too.

445
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,510
Let me do it, Mother.

446
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:04,730
I can't believe you did that to save her.

447
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,080
You've really broken my heart.

448
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:18,890
I'm guilty.

449
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,800
I made you worried about me.

450
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,380
I'll be fine in a few days.

451
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,260
You are affectionate and loyal,

452
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,990
but she has no feelings for you.

453
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,260
I don't think it's worth it.

454
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,640
I believe one day,

455
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,800
Chuyue will understand my feelings.

456
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,900
I hope so.

457
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,200
But

458
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,660
in this world,

459
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,980
it's really hard

460
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,060
to obtain

461
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,920
a heartless person's love.

462
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:49,860
Ling,

463
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,900
our top priority now

464
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:55,330
is to get rid of An Jingzhao

465
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,540
and become the lord.

466
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,550
I haven't heard anything

467
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,620
from the guards sent to look for An Jingzhao.

468
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,550
I'll think of a way to lure him out as soon as possible.

469
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:12,700
Sir,

470
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,980
Miss Chuyue is awake.

471
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,660
Chuyue.

472
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,180
Ling, you are...

473
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,130
Chuyue is awake.

474
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:21,960
-Ling.
-Chuyue.

475
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,500
Chuyue.

476
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,950
Chuyue, you're finally awake.

477
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,710
-Are you alright?
-Go away!

478
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,740
Miss Chuyue,

479
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,120
your body was invaded by the coldness.

480
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,380
It was very dangerous.

481
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,050
Mr. Jingling transferred his internal force to you

482
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:56,290
and extracted the coldness from you to save you.

483
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,840
The coldness has been transferred into his body.

484
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,790
He's been sick.

485
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,580
Stop talking.

486
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:04,940
You may leave.

487
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:06,040
Okay.

488
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,940
Chuyue,

489
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,740
don't feel burdened.

490
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,720
As long as you are safe,

491
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,230
I'm willing to do anything.

492
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,260
I only have one request.

493
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:22,780
Chuyue.

494
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,480
I'm suffering from the coldness.

495
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,500
Please don't do this to me. Okay?

496
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,240
I didn't ask you to do this.

497
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,700
I want to keep you by my side.

498
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,060
I'll make you happy.

499
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,380
But I don't want this.

500
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,650
You can transfer the coldness into my body again

501
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:50,460
and let me go.

502
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,300
How could you say that?

503
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,930
For you,

504
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,380
I'm willing to sacrifice my life.

505
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,150
Why are you hurting my feelings like this?

506
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:05,960
You...

507
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,550
Go away!

508
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:09,940
Chuyue.

509
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,580
I won't let you go.

510
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,139
I want you to stay by my side.

511
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,429
I really like you,

512
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,010
Chuyue.

513
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,300
Can you let me go

514
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,710
and let yourself go?

515
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,980
I will never let you go.

516
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,940
You gave me hope

517
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,580
and made me ambitious.

518
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,989
I turned against my brother

519
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,780
and fought for the position of the lord for you.

520
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,260
Because I want you to think highly of me, attach great importance to me,

521
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,300
and be with me.

522
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,620
I did everything for you.

523
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:41,080
You did everything for your selfish desire.

524
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,600
You won't believe me no matter what I say.

525
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,940
Fine.

526
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,520
I did everything for my selfish desire. So what?

527
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,699
I want someone I like.

528
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:57,400
Is that wrong?

529
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,880
What are you doing?

530
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,420
Even if you do this to me,

531
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,750
you won't get anything.

532
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,480
An Jingzhao and I are married.

533
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,040
My body

534
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,530
and my heart belong to him.

535
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,580
An Jingling,

536
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,470
you've made many mistakes.

537
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,780
Just stop.

538
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,340
I can pay back whatever I owe you.

539
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:19,740
Stop mentioning An Jingzhao in front of me.

540
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,460
I'll kill you if you mention him again.

541
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,990
I love An Jingzhao.

542
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,240
I will make you understand

543
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,430
An Jingzhao doesn't love you that much.

544
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,480
An Jingzhao and I are married.

545
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:16,980
My body

546
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,540
and my heart belong to him.

547
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,660
Why?

548
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,030
Why do you do this to me?

549
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,860
Young Lord.

550
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,120
Young Lord.

551
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,440
You're awake, Young Lord.

552
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,670
Mr. Yueming,

553
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,060
Young Lord is awake.

554
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,620
How are you feeling, Young Lord?

555
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,670
Mr. Yueming.

556
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,710
How is he?

557
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,100
Young Lord is fine now.

558
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,010
But this method has evil energy.

559
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,140
It goes against the primordial energy in Young Lord's body.

560
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,000
You still need to rest to recover.

561
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:50,740
Remember,

562
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,190
don't use your internal force.

563
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,110
Thank you for saving me.

564
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,990
Where is Chuyue?

565
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,380
Donghua.

566
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,100
Young Lord.

567
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,310
Where is Chuyue?

568
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,350
Young Madam

569
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,980
was taken away by An Jingling

570
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,570
in order to cover us.

571
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:21,980
Young Lord.

572
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,680
Young Lord.

573
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:23,820
Under this circumstance,

574
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:25,340
we can't act rashly.

575
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,100
No.

576
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,290
I'm going to save her.

577
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:27,950
Young Lord,

578
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,620
you can't force yourself to use your power now.

579
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,320
I'm going to take a look first,

580
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,660
and then we can make a plan. What do you think?

581
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:32,980
No.

582
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,540
That's right.

583
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,980
Go. Go. Go.

584
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:35,890
Young Lord.

585
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,460
Young Lord.

586
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,460
Come on.

587
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:42,960
Young Lord.

588
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,340
I'm here today to ask you just one thing.

589
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,580
Are you willing to marry Jingling?

590
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,100
No.

591
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,980
Good.

592
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,180
Either you marry Ling,

593
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,300
or you die.

594
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,080
You have no other choice.

595
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,180
I won't marry him.

596
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:27,930
You demon!

597
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,070
You made my son lose his mind

598
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,030
and suffer a lot.

599
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,180
I'm going to kill you today.

600
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:42,640
Chuyue.

601
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:49,980
Chuyue.

602
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,710
An Jingling,

603
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,700
haven't you suffered enough these years?

604
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,300
This woman is not worth it.

605
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,580
Mother,

606
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,400
I don't allow anyone to hurt Chuyue.

607
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,410
Please don't break my heart again.

608
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,670
An Jingling,

609
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,980
you're so silly.

610
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:17,100
Li Chuyue,

611
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,280
if you dare to hurt Ling again,

612
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,810
I won't let you go.

613
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,660
Mother.

614
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,500
Chuyue.

615
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,670
What you just used

616
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:33,700
is the Art of Starshift, right?

617
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,540
I used it to save you.

618
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,390
But you used it to harm many people.

619
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,240
You even slandered your own brother.

620
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,350
Whenever I think of what you did,

621
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,430
I'm scared.

622
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,380
Sir,

623
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,910
a chief wants to see you.

624
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,940
Spread the news.

625
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,180
Chuyue's body has been invaded by the coldness,

626
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,410
and her life is in danger.

627
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,920
And I've let her stay in the secret room in the back mountain.

628
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,370
Okay.

629
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,730
Since I can't get out,

630
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,810
I should find evidence first.

631
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,410
Why does he know how to draw this scene?

632
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,500
Unless...

633
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,820
Isn't... Isn't this my phone?
