[Episode 4]

4
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,150
My daughter Bai Zhi and Young Lord grew up together.

5
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,410
Bai Zhi has admired Young Lord for a long time.

6
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,670
As her foster father,

7
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:51,050
I know what my child is thinking.

8
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,580
So I came here today to Lord and Madam

9
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,030
to propose marriage.

10
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,640
That old fox

11
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,110
wants to spy on Zhao?

12
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,700
Second Lord.

13
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,140
Yunwei Villa is surrounded by enemies.

14
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,840
Rumors are everywhere.

15
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,570
It's not the time to talk about matrimonial issues.

16
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,630
Zhao,

17
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,460
you're old enough to get married.

18
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,680
I think Miss Bai Zhi is kind and elegant.

19
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,220
She's also the successor of the Fengnuan Pavilion master.

20
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,740
If Yunwei Villa

21
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:25,650
can marry Fengnuan Pavilion,

22
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,180
it will be a beautiful story in the martial arts world.

23
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,900
Father.

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,570
Enough.

25
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,810
Don't talk about it anymore.

26
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,490
Marriage follows

27
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,440
the order of parents,

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,570
and the words of matchmakers.

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,900
Don't think that

30
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,579
you can disobey your father

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,090
just because you destroyed the evil sect.

32
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,420
I'm still in charge of the Yunwei Villa.

33
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,730
Father.

34
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,300
Jingzhao is right.

35
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,090
The martial arts world is full of turmoil.

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,290
Jingzhao is both virtuous and intelligent.

37
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,070
The most important thing now is to protect the villa.

38
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,910
Ling, stop it.

39
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,570
Who are you to meddle in the affairs of the villa?

40
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:02,790
Father.

41
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,310
Have you forgotten?

42
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,510
I have another marriage engagement.

43
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,060
I remember

44
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,430
Young Lord and the Second Lady of the Hanshui Sect

45
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,250
had an engagement.

46
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,100
But everyone knows

47
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,650
this lady went missing years ago

48
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,930
and her whereabouts are still unknown.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,220
That engagement doesn't count anymore.

50
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,990
Not only is there a show today,

51
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,500
but it's a big show.

52
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,390
Live telecast.

53
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,680
Full-on action.

54
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,070
She is Han Wanqing, the Second Lady of Hanshui Sect.

55
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,790
She is my fiancée.

56
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,329
Zhao, you...

57
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:52,730
No, no, no.

58
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:53,230
No.

59
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,200
You don't have to hide it anymore.

60
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,240
You don't have to wander around anymore.

61
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,440
This is your home.

62
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,650
As your husband,

63
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,460
I will treat you well.

64
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,060
Zhao,

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,330
is that true?

66
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,660
She is Han Wanqing?

67
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,160
How can you prove that she is Han Wanqing?

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,440
Yunwei Villa is the top sect in the martial arts world.

69
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,110
We can't let a fake

70
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:20,230
become the Young Madam.

71
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:22,980
Grandmother,

72
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,960
do you remember you once said

73
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,160
that Han Wanqing had a birthmark on her hand?

74
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,310
Do you remember what the birthmark looks like?

75
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,020
A birthmark?

76
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,090
Its body is yellow.

77
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,230
It's a little fat.

78
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:45,040
It's a spiritual animal unique to Hanshui Sect.

79
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,970
Wanqing

80
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,180
went out to play when she was six years old.

81
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,530
She got lost.

82
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,200
She has been missing since then.

83
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,760
I've sent people all over

84
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,970
to look for her everywhere.

85
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
It's been more than ten years.

86
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,670
She hasn't been found anywhere.

87
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,160
I couldn't believe that Zhao

88
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,630
met her by chance and brought her home.

89
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,290
It's fate.

90
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:20,170
They are indeed family.

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,460
I admit defeat when it comes to talking nonsense.

92
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,580
No, no.

93
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,710
Don't speak.

94
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,730
All these years,

95
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,420
you've suffered a lot, child.

96
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,790
Come inside with me.

97
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:36,180
Put on the bracelet that your grandmother gave you.

98
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,350
Come.

99
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,610
Come.

100
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,310
Lord.

101
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,930
It’s just a birthmark.

102
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,670
Are you sure she's Han Wanqing

103
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,840
just based on a birthmark?

104
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,030
Hottie,

105
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,180
I didn't expect you to be my old friend.

106
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,960
You just found out, right?

107
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:05,780
Madam.

108
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,430
How can you trust this based on a birthmark?

109
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:11,810
Second Lord,

110
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,620
you don’t trust me anymore.

111
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,110
How can I harm Zhao?

112
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,630
Zhao is my grandson.

113
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:22,020
Miss Chu Yue is my granddaughter-in-law.

114
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,460
Lord.

115
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,450
A birthmark alone

116
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:29,810
can't prove that she is Han Wanqing.

117
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,200
You are right.

118
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,170
A birthmark alone

119
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,320
can't prove that you are Han Wanqing.

120
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,409
An Chenghu.

121
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,970
I almost died

122
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,310
when I gave birth to you, you know?

123
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,140
Your father passed away early.

124
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,610
I worked so hard to raise you.

125
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,240
Now you're Lord.

126
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,460
You don't need me anymore.

127
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,070
Mother.

128
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,010
How dare you disobey me

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,140
and stand with others to contradict me?

130
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,060
How can I continue to live in this world?

131
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,870
I'll die now!

132
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:14,660
Grandmother!

133
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,230
Your Highness.

134
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,220
Madam, please don't do this.

135
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:16,790
Mother.

136
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:18,550
I'll do whatever you say.

137
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,170
Please don't do this.

138
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,740
I'll listen to you.

139
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,690
I'll listen to you.

140
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,280
Mother.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,090
You're still somewhat sensible.

142
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,450
Lord.

143
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,550
Lord is not feeling well.

144
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,790
Take him to rest.

145
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,260
Come on.

146
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,070
I’ll go with you.

147
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:39,520
Lord.

148
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,659
Master...

149
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:42,800
Master...

150
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,250
Ah, my back hurts.

151
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,120
I'm so tired that my back hurts.

152
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,409
Really.

153
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,050
Second Lord, please forgive me.

154
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,460
You can’t even do such a small thing well.

155
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,400
Why should I keep you?

156
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,400
You are a noble man.

157
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,090
Why are you getting angry over a servant?

158
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,530
Young Lord,

159
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:28,240
I don’t need your permission

160
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,320
to punish my own servant.

161
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,860
Sorry to offend you.

162
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,190
I think this sword belongs to my father.

163
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,940
It seems you don’t know how to use it.

164
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,860
I think it’s better to return it to its owner.

165
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
After all, some things that are not yours

166
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,330
will never be yours.

167
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,300
Young Lord, you're wrong.

168
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,990
You should know

169
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,420
I get everything

170
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,190
that I want.

171
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,130
Goodbye.

172
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,500
I slept well last time

173
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,830
and suddenly fell down.

174
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,140
Maybe when I wake up,

175
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,460
I'll be back again.

176
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,580
What are you doing?

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,180
Go to bed and rest.

178
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,190
An Jingzhao,

179
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:04,650
you must keep your promise.

180
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,330
I helped you.

181
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,470
So I'll use this bed today.

182
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,540
Aren't you already in bed?

183
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,460
What are you doing?

184
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,050
I did promise to lend you my bed,

185
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,480
but not the whole bed.

186
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,130
If you don't even want to use this half,

187
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,220
you can leave now.

188
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,850
Don't worry.

189
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:27,780
I don't like you.

190
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,980
I don't intend to do anything.

191
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,590
I won't lay a finger on you.

192
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,960
Of course.

193
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm just afraid that I might touch you instead.

194
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,310
What did my grandmother say

195
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,070
to convince you to pretend to be Han Wanqing?

196
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,660
Nothing special.

197
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,910
I liked her

198
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,360
once I saw her.

199
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
She told me how despicable Zhou Wei is.

200
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,800
So I think I should help her.

201
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,420
Is that all?

202
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:06,980
What else could it be?

203
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,530
By the way,

204
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,630
she also promised

205
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,700
to take me to eat

206
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,800
all the delicacies in Yunwei Villa.

207
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,260
Marriage is not child's play.

208
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,770
How can you marry someone you don't like?

209
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,970
Of course you should marry someone you like.

210
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,190
But

211
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,080
I don't belong here.

212
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,400
I'm going back soon.

213
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,340
This time, I'll help you as a favor to Grandmother

214
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,300
and to experience

215
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,560
a wedding here.

216
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,230
By the way,

217
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,290
what's the color of the wedding dress here?

218
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,660
Maybe I can learn

219
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,640
and use it on my wedding dress in the future.

220
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,190
- Maybe my wedding with Prince Charming…
- Stop it.

221
00:11:59,370 --> 00:11:59,980
You're noisy.

222
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,760
Please.

223
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,500
When you wake up,

224
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,780
you must be back in your bed.

225
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,570
Oh no.

226
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,820
I can't even go back when I sleep.

227
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,220
There are five days left till registration.

228
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,910
What should I do?

229
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,580
Don't think too much.

230
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:10,320
I just want to prevent you from touching me.

231
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,900
Pack up.

232
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,570
Go back to your room.

233
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,940
If you delay it any longer,

234
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,190
I'll make you compensate with something else.

235
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,580
The compensation I'm referring to

236
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,460
is work and silver.

237
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:50,780
I told you

238
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:52,530
I have no interest in you.

239
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,540
Young Madam.

240
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:23,430
Young Lord.

241
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,090
Let me measure your finger size.

242
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,980
On TV, they often show that

243
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,050
the passageway will open when the moon is full.

244
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,610
The day after tomorrow is the 15th.

245
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,730
I have to fight for another chance.

246
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,390
Young Lord,

247
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,330
if I make clothes for you,

248
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,470
as a gift in return,

249
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,500
on the night of the 15th,

250
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,270
can I borrow your bed for one night?

251
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,820
What do you think?

252
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:14,860
I'm not short of clothes.

253
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,440
But you said

254
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,850
I can use labor to get a chance to use the bed.

255
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,110
Keep your promise.

256
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,490
Of course.

257
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:23,980
Young Lord,

258
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,280
I’m here to grind ink for you.

259
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,690
I'm great at making ink.

260
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:34,170
Lately, I've been painting banana trees awaiting rain,

261
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,000
and misty mountains and forests.

262
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:37,470
I'm tired of it.

263
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:38,730
I want to draw people.

264
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,190
Why don't I draw someone you know?

265
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,600
Although the name is a bit vulgar,

266
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,420
I'll draw the Gu Qingfeng you always mention.

267
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:58,540
Keep it.

268
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,290
Describe his appearance for me.

269
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,930
He has thick eyebrows,

270
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,140
deep eyes,

271
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,000
a high nose,

272
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,980
and smiling lips.

273
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,630
Anyway, he's very handsome.

274
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,090
My Prince Charming doesn't look like this.

275
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,850
[Gu Qingfeng]

276
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:43,940
That's it.

277
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,200
I drew it as you said.

278
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:50,830
Young Lord.

279
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,890
Young Lord.

280
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:07,780
Young Lord.

281
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,020
We agreed that

282
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,350
after I practiced with you today

283
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:12,260
I can borrow your bed for another night.

284
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,180
Of course.

285
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,590
I'll keep my word.

286
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:15,870
In order to go home,

287
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:17,360
I'll tolerate this.

288
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,690
Come on.

289
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,860
No, no, no.

290
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,420
Left.

291
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:10,810
No, no, no.

292
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,500
Stop.

293
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:12,950
Stop. Stop.

294
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:13,560
I can't do it.

295
00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:14,650
I can't take it anymore.

296
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,460
Jingzhao,

297
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,990
can I have a try?

298
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,570
Bai Zhi, what are you doing here?

299
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,390
I'm not practicing martial arts.

300
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,770
Can't you see that Wanqing is having fun?

301
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:26,990
I'm accompanying her.

302
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,040
Don't disturb us.

303
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,700
I'll change my spear.

304
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,090
Han Wanqing.

305
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,280
What are you afraid of?

306
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,340
We're just sharing martial skills.

307
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,920
Since we're competing,

308
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,330
we should work together as a couple.

309
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,580
Miss.

310
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:10,810
Miss.

311
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:15,830
You must be tired.

312
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:17,910
Go back and rest.

313
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,530
Miss.

314
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,450
Young Lord.

315
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,050
I suffered so much for you.

316
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,170
You must lend me your room for the night.

317
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,490
Do you think this is enough?

318
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,180
You...

319
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,130
From now on,

320
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,540
you will stay by my side and serve me

321
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,700
until I'm satisfied.

322
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,320
Then I'll allow it.

323
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,950
You're playing with swords every day.

324
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,250
Do I dare to serve you?

325
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,980
You said I can exchange silver for it.

326
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,240
How much do you want?

327
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:04,780
Not much.

328
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,710
Twenty taels.

329
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,300
First, chop up the beetroot

330
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:20,790
and cook it in the pot.

331
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,090
When it's ready,

332
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,040
add some beeswax

333
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,470
and enough vegetable oil

334
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,810
and then put it back in the pot.

335
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:34,660
Mix it.

336
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,070
When it's time,

337
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,260
we'll take some out.

338
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,220
Didn't you know you have to take it out?

339
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,990
Then, we put them in the mould.

340
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,810
It smells good.

341
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,420
She's amazing.

342
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,940
What are you doing?

343
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:57,530
This...

344
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,820
Put the mould in the ice cellar to cool it down.

345
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,580
Here.

346
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,530
Will it be ready soon?

347
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,460
Yes.

348
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:09,820
Just wait.

349
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,740
I'm looking forward to it.

350
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,260
It's here.

351
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,870
Let's see what it looks like.

352
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,980
It's time to witness a miracle.

353
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,250
What a beautiful color.

354
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,410
Anyone wants to try on the color first?

355
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:30,900
Let me do it.

356
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,440
Okay.

357
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,530
Here.

358
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,320
This color

359
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,960
is called "Men Slasher" at home.

360
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,560
Lady Chuyue.

361
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,050
Although I'm a servant,

362
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,320
I'm still innocent.

363
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,570
How can I hurt a man?

364
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,770
That's not what I meant.

365
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:50,030
The color of this lipstick is called Men Slasher.

366
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,960
After applying it,

367
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,180
you can win a man's heart

368
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,860
and make him fall for you.

369
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,010
Then I want it.

370
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,730
Me too.

371
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,460
Great!

372
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:57,580
One by one.

373
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,970
Here, put the money inside.

374
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,390
Here you are.

375
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,650
I'll take one.

376
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,460
Doctor Luo developed the antidote.

377
00:23:05,810 --> 00:23:06,820
He deserves his reputation.

378
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,460
Now,

379
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,870
if he takes it on time,

380
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,420
after a round of treatment,

381
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,770
Father will definitely get better.

382
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,010
I want to give it a try.

383
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,700
So beautiful.

384
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,730
But Father is surrounded by Zhou Wei's people.

385
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,170
Now he is controlled by Zhou Wei.

386
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,120
It's hard for us to send the medicine in

387
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,220
without being noticed by them.

388
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:25,670
Come on.

389
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,820
Next.

390
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,140
Miss Chuyue is playing some new tricks again.

391
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:38,140
Come on.

392
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,050
Look.

393
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,150
This is called Peach Blossom 'dating' makeup.

394
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,210
It's also known as Young Girl's makeup.

395
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,570
It is the easiest to win a man's favor with this.

396
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,000
I want this look too.

397
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:51,590
No problem.

398
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,240
Two coins.

399
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:53,610
Me too.

400
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:54,220
Me too.

401
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,730
Come on.

402
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,580
Young Lord.

403
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,080
Second Young Master.

404
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,570
What's with the noise?

405
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,760
I'm teaching everyone about makeup and beauty

406
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,940
and making money with my own hands.

407
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,020
Did I break any rules?

408
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:12,700
How is it?

409
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,530
See, is my makeup beautiful?

410
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,620
I'm not bragging.

411
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,410
I'm a professional.

412
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,970
Different clothes go with different makeup.

413
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,930
I learned it specially.

414
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,460
It's ugly.

415
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:25,860
Handsome,

416
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:27,100
what do you think?

417
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,120
I think it's very bright

418
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,490
and interesting.

419
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,180
It feels vivid.

420
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,330
This...

421
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,050
Grandmother.

422
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,380
Are you doing a high five?

423
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,230
You two have a shot too.

424
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,740
Come on.

425
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,940
Come on.

426
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,730
Hit it.

427
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,500
Bravo! Bravo!

428
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,030
Zhao may not say it,

429
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,220
but he also thinks your makeup is beautiful.

430
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,110
I don't.

431
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,090
Hottie,

432
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:13,040
what do you think of my makeup?

433
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:15,860
Naturally beautiful.

434
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,680
It's pretty.

435
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,020
I like it.

436
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,730
Chuyue.

437
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,440
Do you have a look for a Domineering Lady style?

438
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,440
Of course.

439
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,060
But...

440
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,010
Hottie,

441
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,030
although we are good friends,

442
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,030
I still have to be clear with you.

443
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,560
I still have to charge you for this.

444
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,500
Charge?

445
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,710
Of course.

446
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,970
Give her silver.

447
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,630
You're so good at this.

448
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,420
Come on.

449
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:00,940
Close your eyes.

450
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,780
Not bad.

451
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,740
Jingzhao.

452
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,710
Grandmother may be the best candidate to deliver the medicine.

453
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,500
First, Grandmother is lively.

454
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,420
She doesn't like to worry about the villa.

455
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,180
Zhou Wei won't guard against her.

456
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,570
Second,

457
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,160
Grandmother is an elder of Yunwei Villa.

458
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:21,260
Zhou Wei's men dare not do anything.

459
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,230
Are you done?

460
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,820
Grandmother,

461
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,790
please return to Chongyue Pavilion.

462
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,700
Ling and I have something to discuss with you.

463
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:32,960
Wait. Wait.

464
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,180
It's not over yet.

465
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,850
It's done.

466
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,210
Let me see.

467
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,770
It's so beautiful.

468
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:42,870
What?

469
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,800
Go to Chongyue Pavilion?

470
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,620
Let's go.

471
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:45,420
Let's go.

472
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,100
So beautiful.

473
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,380
Young Lord.

474
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:52,060
Good.

475
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,850
This is 20 taels.

476
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,620
I look like a Domineering Lady.

477
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,240
I'll take your room tonight.

478
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:01,420
You guys can have it.

479
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,630
Thank you, Young Lord.

480
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,220
Great.

481
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:23,650
Madam.

482
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,220
Move!

483
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,700
Madam.

484
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,320
Lord is in the midst of recuperating.

485
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:31,930
Shut up!

486
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:34,180
Don't think you can be so arrogant

487
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,780
just because you are Zhou Wei's men.

488
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,270
I just need to give the order

489
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:40,800
to deal with some servants.

490
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,000
Who wants to die?

491
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,740
Come out and have a try.

492
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:01,930
Go report to Second Lord.

493
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,430
No.

494
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,790
If we really anger Madam,

495
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,470
even if Second Lord is protecting us,

496
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,300
we’ll lose our lives.

497
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,770
So,

498
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,780
he won’t blame us

499
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,440
if we don't tell Second Master.

500
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,700
Well...

501
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,480
Besides,

502
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,410
Madam's lip color is abnormal.

503
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,860
She seems to have been poisoned.

504
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,560
I guess she's seriously ill.

505
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,960
So we don't need to worry.

506
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
This old man.

507
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,090
Dad, Mom.

508
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,310
I pray that I can go back tonight.

509
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,770
I must make it to the New Designer Competition.

510
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,720
Is there really another world

511
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,900
that exists in this world?

512
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,920
Will she really leave?

513
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,400
One, two, three.

514
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,600
Dad, Mom.

515
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,310
Yang.

516
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:47,840
I really can't go back. What should I do?

517
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,590
There's three days till the Designer Competition.

518
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,500
What should I do?

519
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,160
What should I do?

520
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:07,290
Oh yes,

521
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,500
the marriage.

522
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,640
When that happens,

523
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:14,010
I'll still have a chance to use this bed.

524
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,020
It's not a real marriage anyway.

525
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:19,620
Grandmother.

526
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:21,580
Tell me.

527
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,910
Why are you messing around with her?

528
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,530
What do you mean?

529
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,940
Chuyue and I just have fun.

530
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,060
But some people's hearts

531
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,400
have been stolen.

532
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,280
Grandmother.

533
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,000
We both know that

534
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:39,500
this marriage is just for show.

535
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,820
It seems that some people really think it's for show

536
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,460
but some people want

537
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,650
to make it real.

538
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,270
Who are these people?

539
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,090
I don't understand.

540
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:50,700
I don't know.

541
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,010
I bet you want to say

542
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,140
that's not you.

543
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:55,490
I don't know.

544
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,510
Nonsense.

545
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,150
You'll deny it three times.

546
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,750
Grandmother,

547
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,720
can you not

548
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,350
learn these weird words from her?

549
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,340
Did you take my father's medicine?

550
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:12,420
Medicine?

551
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:14,770
Don't worry.

552
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,840
Zhou Wei

553
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,860
always thought I was crazy

554
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,480
and didn't guard against me.

555
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:21,700
I'll take care of the medicine

556
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,340
from now onwards.

557
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,140
This medicine needs to be taken once every seven days

558
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,490
and it needs to be taken within the specified time.

559
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,880
Otherwise, your efforts will be in vain.

560
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,620
Doctor Luo said,

561
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,990
seven days after taking all the medicine,

562
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,340
it'll take effect.

563
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:36,700
At that time,

564
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,250
I need someone to guard my father by his side.

565
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:40,230
Okay.

566
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,030
We need to plan carefully.

567
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,710
Thank you, Grandmother.

568
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,670
I don’t need to worry about these things.

569
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,190
But there are things

570
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:53,010
that I do need to worry about.

571
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,050
But don't worry.

572
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:58,590
I will help you win the heart of Chuyue.

573
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:03,620
I...

574
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,469
The wedding night

575
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,980
is the last day of registration.

576
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:12,820
I will seize this opportunity.

577
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,860
It's just a marriage.

578
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,730
It's not a big deal.

579
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:17,780
It's fake anyway.

580
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,520
I can practice my acting skills.

581
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,460
I will go back.

582
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,600
Miss Chuyue.

583
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,170
You've lost weight.

584
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:34,920
Miss Taoyun,

585
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:36,030
you've grown more beautiful.

586
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:38,909
Don't disturb me.

587
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm now

588
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,980
a sewing machine without emotions.

589
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,770
Miss Chuyue,

590
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,989
Madam asked you to go to Chongyue Pavilion.

591
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,889
Today is the Huaxi Festival

592
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,550
and the wedding day is coming.

593
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,360
Madam

594
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,650
prepared a banquet

595
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:57,460
and invited you to have peach blossom wine,

596
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,530
enjoy the spring plums,

597
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,500
and have five-colored sugar cake together.

598
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:00,860
Great.

599
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,750
Great.

600
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:02,760
Wait for me.

601
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,580
I'll be ready soon.

602
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,520
Done.

603
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:13,150
Let's go.

604
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,790
Grandmother.

605
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,790
Zhao.

606
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,140
You're drawing.

607
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,860
These are clothes from Chuyue.

608
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,530
Try them on.

609
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,390
No.

610
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,670
Just put them there.

611
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:41,120
Try them.

612
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:14,840
Come on.

613
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,530
What are you taking off?

614
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,300
I saw it.

615
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:26,940
Chuyue.

616
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,800
Look how much Zhao likes the clothes you gave him.

617
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,300
You taught me this before.

618
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,190
Beauty.

619
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,720
That means beautiful woman.

620
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,450
Isn't this a description of women?

621
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,650
Well...

622
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,520
Oh no.

623
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,200
I can't offend him.

624
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,470
When under someone's roof, one has to lower their head.

625
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:50,470
I have to try to go home again.

626
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,980
Who said that’s just for a woman?

627
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,150
Young Lord is so beautiful.

628
00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:00,490
He's a beauty too.

629
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,790
You know,

630
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,870
the kind where you take one look

631
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,550
and you want him as your own.

632
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,420
Did you hear that?

633
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,250
Hottie,

634
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,740
wasn't there a banquet?

635
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,860
Of course.

636
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:13,870
But

637
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,020
you need to draw this healing charm.

638
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,710
This is the custom of the Huaxi Festival.

639
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,560
Besides this custom,

640
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,780
there is another custom.

641
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,830
The wife who is about to get married

642
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:32,420
must draw this charm herself.

643
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,740
Otherwise, we can't eat.

644
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,690
Isn't that easy?

645
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:37,420
Draw.

646
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:37,950
You draw.

647
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:51,790
I can't draw this.

648
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,660
If you can't draw,

649
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,210
then you can't eat.

650
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,250
If you really can't do it,

651
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,700
ask Zhao to teach you by hand.

652
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,240
That'll count as you drawing it.

653
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,270
Go.

654
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,810
Thank you.

655
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
I can help you,

656
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,840
but I have a request.

657
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,390
What is it?

658
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:30,680
Change the words on this shirt to Prince Charming.

659
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,170
Are you saying yes?

660
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,660
What does it say?

661
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,230
Write.

662
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,200
Jingzhao

663
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,110
is going to marry that woman.

664
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,380
What's the point of me moving into Yunwei Villa?

665
00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:32,860
Did you hear anything?

666
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:33,790
Miss.

667
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,340
An Jingzhao and Li Chuyue

668
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:37,130
were celebrating the Huaxi Festival in Madam's place.

669
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,150
There’s news that

670
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:41,370
Young Lord taught Han Wanqing

671
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,540
to draw the charm by hand.

672
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,770
I can't let them get married.

673
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:48,410
Jingzhao is mine.

674
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,590
Don’t worry.

675
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:53,470
Look at this.

676
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,640
This is from Second Lord.

677
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:56,770
It’s called the Lethal Pill.

678
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,740
It's colorless and odorless.

679
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,060
Once someone takes it,

680
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,520
they will disappear without anyone knowing.

681
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,780
Second Lord said

682
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,610
no one in the martial arts world knows this medicine.

683
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:06,290
Naturally, no one will find out it's from you.

684
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,690
Besides,

685
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,850
there's also this.

686
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,520
What is this?

687
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,010
The Aphrodisiac Pill.

688
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,150
Second Lord said

689
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,440
you've always loved Young Lord.

690
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,270
If you get physically intimate with him,

691
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:23,240
everything will fall into place.

692
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,320
He values Yunwei Villa's reputation so much.

693
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,000
How dare he refuse to marry you?

694
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,950
However,

695
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,400
how can I

696
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,760
poison Jingzhao and Li Chuyue separately?

697
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,180
Today is the best time.

698
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:43,270
Young Lord and Li Chuyue are both in Chongyue Pavilion.

699
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,140
We just have to put the medicine in the wine pot,

700
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,830
and Miss goes to Chongyue Pavilion openly

701
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,910
to pretend to apologize to Li Chuyue

702
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,050
and let her drink the poisoned wine.

703
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,100
Impossible.

704
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,530
As the heir of Fengnuan Pavilion,

705
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,510
how can I apologize to a wild girl?

706
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,380
Your status is so noble.

707
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,140
of course Li Chuyue can't compare to you.

708
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,240
But Young Lord is bewitched by her now.

709
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,530
If you don’t hurry,

710
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,180
she will become Young Madam.

711
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,700
Miss,

712
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,980
This is the best way.

713
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,430
Please bear with it.

714
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,390
After this,

715
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:13,750
you'll be the Young Madam of Yunwei Villa.
