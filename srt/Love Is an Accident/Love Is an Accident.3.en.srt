1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,450
You'd better hold me tight

3
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:49,950
so that I can protect you.

4
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,020
Why is it suddenly so windy?

5
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,550
Isn't it normal?

6
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,700
Don't move.

7
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,079
Let's go.

8
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,190
Don't worry.

9
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
The assassins won't follow us here.

10
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,710
Now I'm going to ask you to do something.

11
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,070
I will go out for about half an hour.

12
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,020
During this period,

13
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,070
you have to pretend that I'm still in here.

14
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,400
Don't let anyone in.

15
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,300
You are the young lord.

16
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,670
As long as I say you're resting,

17
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,930
no one dares to come in.

18
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,460
If the spy feels suspicious,

19
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,180
he will barge in at all costs.

20
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,190
I don't care how you do it,

21
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:26,250
but you can't let him have his way.

22
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,880
What a great opportunity!

23
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,990
I can take the chance to escape.

24
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,900
Don't worry, Young Lord.

25
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,030
It's a piece of cake.

26
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,790
If you get this done,

27
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,350
surely I'll let you use my bedroom.

28
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,020
However,

29
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,670
if you dare lie to me

30
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,180
and run away,

31
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,990
the assassins outside will catch up with you,

32
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,650
and I won't let you go, either.

33
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,270
The scheming devil is right.

34
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,530
It's not safe outside.

35
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,110
I'd better do as he said.

36
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:59,990
Then there might be a chance to go home.

37
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,620
No problem, Young Lord.

38
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,350
I promise I'll pull the job off.

39
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,720
Young Lord.

40
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,860
Doctor Luo is waiting
at the waterside pavilion ahead.

41
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,670
I've checked.

42
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,820
There are no Zhou Wei's informants near the pavilion.

43
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,500
Young Lord,

44
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,860
we don't know where that woman is from,

45
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
and she kept saying strange things.

46
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,710
She seems kind of idiotic.

47
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
Is she really reliable?

48
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:34,990
Yes.

49
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,030
Also,

50
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,030
don't be rude.

51
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,510
You should call her Miss Chuyue.

52
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,230
Yes.

53
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,110
Doctor Luo, you practice medicine
to save the world.

54
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,230
You're such a brilliant doctor.

55
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,290
I'm really honored

56
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,470
to meet you today.

57
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,030
You flatter me, Young Lord.

58
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,910
You're famous for being smart.

59
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,820
And you exterminated the evil sect.

60
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,500
You even solved my problem easily.

61
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,110
You're indeed both brainy and brawny.

62
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,260
I wonder why you want to see me.

63
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,350
My father was drugged and his mind is disturbed.

64
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,280
None of the doctors could cure him.

65
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,860
So I'm pleading with you, Doctor Luo,

66
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,390
to come and treat my father.

67
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,180
Young Lord,

68
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,940
I only treat the ordinary people.

69
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,360
I don't have any dealings with any sects in Jianghu.

70
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,350
So please forgive me.

71
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,380
Goodbye.

72
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:56,860
27 years ago,

73
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,470
a massacre exterminated
a whole family in Wuzhou.

74
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:02,790
The Yang family in Jiayu was wiped out overnight.

75
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,910
The murderer coveted the Yang family's spear skills,

76
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,740
so he foully murdered

77
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,600
over 50 people of the Yang family.

78
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,670
At that time, only one young child

79
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,710
and two servants survived.

80
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,230
No one knows who the real murderer is.

81
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,030
But I do.

82
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,870
The real murderer is

83
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:23,240
the Second Lord of Yunwei Villa, Zhou Wei.

84
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:27,380
And that young child is you, Doctor Luo.

85
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,590
Young Lord, you spoke of the past

86
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:43,210
just to achieve your own purpose.

87
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,710
I stopped caring about the martial arts world long ago.

88
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,240
Goodbye.

89
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,180
Doctor Luo, Zhou Wei is vicious.

90
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,909
He would do anything to achieve his aim.

91
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,909
Now he poisoned and controlled my father

92
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:55,860
to seize the position of the lord of the villa.

93
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,260
Then in virtue of Yunwei Villa,

94
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,030
the biggest sect in the martial arts world,

95
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:01,260
he can become the leader of all the sects.

96
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
Once he succeeds,

97
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,620
the martial arts world will be full of terrors.

98
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,350
The people won't be able
to live in peace, either.

99
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,060
Doctor Luo,

100
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,860
you wanted to save the world
by practicing medicine,

101
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,860
are you going to wait for the worst to happen

102
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,460
and watch the people suffer?

103
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
Go get the peach blossom wine.

104
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm gonna drink with Young Lord.

105
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,470
Yes.

106
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,280
Young Lord.

107
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,110
I found some traces of the assassins.

108
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,110
Are you all right?

109
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,360
Young Lord is fine.

110
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,990
He just fell asleep.

111
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,590
Miss,

112
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,420
I collected some dew on the lotus leaves.

113
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,420
It is perfect for making tea.

114
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
May I go in to get the teapot

115
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,340
and make some tea for you?

116
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:00,350
No need. I need to rest too.

117
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,710
I'm so sleepy.

118
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,670
This task is so easy. Go to sleep.

119
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,150
Young Lord, don't. I'm shy.

120
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:26,710
Don't, Young Lord.

121
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,740
I'm so shy.

122
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,470
Come on, Beauty An.

123
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,309
Let me pamper you.

124
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,280
Come on, Chuyue.

125
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,950
Let me kiss you too.

126
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:39,950
No.

127
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,850
It doesn't sound like Young Lord.

128
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,190
So naughty?

129
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,540
Can you really do

130
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,610
what you said just now?

131
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:11,730
Young Lord.

132
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,230
I-I'm sorry.

133
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,870
It was just a picnic?

134
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,110
Nothing unusual?

135
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,950
Leave.

136
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:29,710
Yes.

137
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
A new lover suddenly appeared

138
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,820
and he suddenly went on a picnic.

139
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,310
It couldn't be that simple.

140
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,500
Even if An Jingzhao didn't meet Li Qing,

141
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,540
there must be

142
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:54,380
some plot behind this.

143
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,260
Tell Yuan Shu to go on monitoring him.

144
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,860
Don't let go of a single clue.

145
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:00,660
Yes.

146
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,190
There's no passage or mechanism.

147
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,140
Am I really going to be trapped here?

148
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,590
Go back and tell Bai Zhi,

149
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,740
if she hurts Li Chuyue again,

150
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,580
I won't go easy on her.

151
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,900
What the heck is this place?

152
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,660
Why does everyone want to kill me?

153
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,110
How on earth can I go home?

154
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,260
The martial arts world is always dangerous,

155
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,190
not to mention

156
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:23,260
you're just a woman who only knows tempting people.

157
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
Of course it's much tougher for you.

158
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,310
But you did well in the cabin in the woods.

159
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,660
If you have nowhere to go,

160
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,830
I can take you in for now

161
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,110
and protect you.

162
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,260
Do I look that stupid?

163
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,860
You tried to poison me

164
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,110
and to kill me.

165
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,560
How dare I live here?

166
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,810
I thought you worked for Zhou Wei.

167
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,060
Now I know you are not.

168
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,420
Why would I still try to kill you?

169
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,140
I have no money and nowhere to go.

170
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,910
I know nothing about boxing or kung fu.

171
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,050
Indeed, it's not safe for me to go out.

172
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,310
Besides, the New Designer Competition is coming up.

173
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,070
I must go back as soon as possible.

174
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,260
I should try his bed more.

175
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,860
Maybe I can go back

176
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,720
after a night's sleep in it.

177
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:15,020
Young Lord, that's great.

178
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,350
Now that you're willing to lend me your bed,

179
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,470
can you lend it to me for the whole night?

180
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,070
No.

181
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,350
Where shall I sleep
if I lend it to you for the whole night?

182
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,660
You can sleep with me!

183
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,760
I'm a boy who'd get into danger just going out.

184
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:31,470
How can I spend the night with you in a room?

185
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,620
You're a fast learner.

186
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,020
But if you promise me one thing,

187
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,740
maybe I'll agree to it.

188
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,870
What do you want now?

189
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,270
Go to a place with me.

190
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:47,230
Have some tea and have fun.

191
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,070
That's all.

192
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,740
Useless! You can't be trusted.

193
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,430
Get lost!

194
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,470
Don't show up these days.

195
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,020
Yes.

196
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,260
No, I can't let Jingzhao

197
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,190
be together with an unknown woman.

198
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,080
I have to expel her from Yunwei Villa.

199
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:17,990
Miss Bai Zhi,

200
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,780
are you here to look for my brother?

201
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,660
Why do you look so worried? What happened?

202
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,460
It has nothing to do with you, Second Young Master.

203
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,760
Even if I practice hard,

204
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,710
I still have no improvement in martial arts.

205
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:58,620
It seems that I'm not qualified
to practice martial arts.

206
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,750
Ling, it's fine if you don't practice.

207
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,950
You have me.

208
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,090
No one from the martial arts world
dares to hurt you.

209
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,380
Jingzhao, when can we

210
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,310
have Father treated by Doctor Luo?

211
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,900
Grandmother's birthday is in a few days.

212
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,590
That will be the perfect opportunity.

213
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,110
Do you have a plan?

214
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,230
I told you

215
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,860
Yuan Shu was now Zhou Wei's spy.

216
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,230
We intercepted the secret letter

217
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,360
he wrote to Zhou Wei.

218
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,400
It turns out that Zhou Wei
has been inquiring about Li Qing.

219
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,190
That old fox.

220
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,260
He is afraid of Yuwei Hall

221
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,780
and wants to instigate Li Qing to turn traitor.

222
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,710
Since he wants to know Li Qing's whereabouts so much,

223
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,350
I revealed to Yuan Shu

224
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,710
that I'd meet Li Qing on Grandmother's birthday.

225
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,430
They will definitely take the bait.

226
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,500
Then we can sell the dummy.

227
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,070
Ling.

228
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,250
When it's done, use firecrackers as the signal.

229
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:00,300
OK.

230
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,760
Young Lord.

231
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,579
The secret room is ready.

232
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,060
Besides,

233
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,910
I've prepared a mattress and silk bedding on the stone bed.

234
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,910
I also asked the kitchen

235
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,630
to prepare fresh fruits,

236
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,910
snacks, and wine in advance.

237
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:12,430
OK.

238
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,099
When did you become so particular?

239
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:19,099
Ling, you must be tired.

240
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:19,900
Get some rest.

241
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,780
Chief of the Hall, you
brought such a big gift this time.

242
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,180
My grandmother will be very happy for sure.

243
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,790
My pleasure. It's Madam's birthday after all.

244
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,100
Young Lord.

245
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,500
An Jingzhao is taking action soon.

246
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,430
Report to our Master immediately.

247
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,520
An Jingzhao is on the move.

248
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,990
Good.

249
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,230
No matter what An Jingzhao wants to do,

250
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,500
as long as we can catch Li Qing,

251
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,660
I'll never let the chance go.

252
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,790
Let's go.

253
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,020
Stop!

254
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,300
Master,

255
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,360
An Jingzhao has entered the secret room.

256
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,560
Did you see anyone else?

257
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,300
No.

258
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,350
Surround the secret room immediately.

259
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,060
I'd like to see

260
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,470
what An Jingzhao is up to.

261
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,960
Let's go.

262
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,950
Although you don't work for Zhou Wei,

263
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,080
I still don't know exactly who you are.

264
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:25,230
I still have a few questions.

265
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:25,740
Shoot.

266
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,900
Tell me about your hometown.

267
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,340
My hometown

268
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,740
is quite different from this place.

269
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,670
There are cars, airplanes,

270
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,280
and high buildings.

271
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,630
Most importantly, there are mobile phones and the Internet.

272
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,100
You said you wanted to pursue a man.

273
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,740
What do you mean by that?

274
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,230
Is that man your enemy?

275
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,140
I don't have any enemies.

276
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,950
My enemies are rather fat and flab.

277
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:58,870
I just have a crush

278
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,740
on a designer in our company.

279
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,870
His name is Gu Qingfeng.

280
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:03,870
I want to pursue him. You know it.

281
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:12,710
You...

282
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,390
It means I like him.

283
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,030
I want to be with him intimately.

284
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,970
Now do you understand?

285
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,190
Is everything okay?

286
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,430
Let me eat something.

287
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,590
What sect is he from?

288
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,920
What unique skill does he know?

289
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,100
Flirting.

290
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,780
Flirting? What kind of unique skill is that?

291
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,210
I've never heard of it.

292
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,580
Is it good in terms of strength

293
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,580
or speed?

294
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,500
Speed. It's fast.

295
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,910
So what?

296
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,780
Surely it's not as good
as our light-body skills at Yunwei Villa.

297
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,840
Do you want a drink?

298
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,220
Now that we're already here, have some.

299
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,020
I don't want it. If you want it,

300
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,050
it's all yours.

301
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,430
So cool.

302
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,150
But

303
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,090
I've seen the male lead use this trick in a drama.

304
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,430
Is this fast enough?

305
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,580
Isn't it better than flirting?

306
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,950
Let's go. Hurry.

307
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,300
Search!

308
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,040
Search!

309
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,580
Don't you have a bigger room?

310
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,520
It's a place to practice one's inner skill.
So it doesn't have to be spacious.

311
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,200
Why is your heart beating so fast?

312
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:24,820
I...

313
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:27,870
I'm strong.

314
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,230
Naturally, my heart is stronger than those of others.

315
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,490
I'm definitely better than Gu Qingfeng.

316
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,100
When can we get out?

317
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,020
I can't breathe.

318
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,520
I don't know how to get out.

319
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,350
Today is Madam's birthday.

320
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:52,500
I was sent by Madam

321
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,870
to deliver some snacks and things to Father.

322
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,330
Second Young Master, Lord is still resting.

323
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,300
No one is allowed to disturb him.

324
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,780
I saw Leng Yun’s men

325
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,160
going to the back mountain with the Second Lord.

326
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,830
They seemed to be in a hurry.

327
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,950
Don't fall behind.

328
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:54,490
Luckily, my father is still fast asleep.

329
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,400
Otherwise, he wouldn't be willing to be treated.

330
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:01,530
I'll leave him to you, Doctor Luo.

331
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,150
This kind of mind-controlling drug

332
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,910
is refined from various rare herbs.

333
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:35,230
I've been practicing medicine for decades,

334
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,630
but I've only heard of some of the herbs.

335
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,220
I've never seen them.

336
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,590
Is there a way to treat it?

337
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:45,950
I can't answer you now.

338
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,800
I need some time to develop medicine.

339
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,670
This is exactly like

340
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,060
in TV series.

341
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,710
Can one really master martial arts
by practicing these moves?

342
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,740
I can, but you can't.

343
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,430
Is your dream to lead the martial arts world?

344
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:28,580
No.

345
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,500
I hope there will be no conflicts in the martial arts world

346
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,960
and that peace can return.

347
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,150
You said you wanted to be a designer.

348
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,210
What is a designer?

349
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,910
Costume designers

350
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:44,780
design clothes with different materials

351
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,180
and in different styles.

352
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,870
My dream is

353
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,820
to go to a design school abroad

354
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,670
and to become an independent designer.

355
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,100
I know it's difficult,

356
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,040
but I will work hard for it.

357
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,470
A tailor?

358
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,470
The tailor of Yunwei Villa

359
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,230
only started to make clothes after more than ten years of practice.

360
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,670
You're so young and yet you can do it?

361
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,910
I must design a suit of clothes for you

362
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,580
to show you my excellent skills.

363
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,380
Wait a minute.

364
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,630
Come on.

365
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,050
What're you doing?

366
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,630
Measure your size. Come on.

367
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,550
This will solve the problem.

368
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:43,230
You can measure my finger next time.

369
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,230
Looks like it's done.

370
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,340
Has the birthday banquet begun?

371
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
I want to watch it.

372
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,690
When can we get out?

373
00:28:57,670 --> 00:28:58,230
What?

374
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,910
Don't you want to go out?

375
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,470
The mechanism in this secret room

376
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,300
can only be opened

377
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,710
under the weight of us two.

378
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,060
Then we can stand on that at the same time.

379
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,060
No. Only two feet are allowed on it.

380
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,780
If you can lift me up,

381
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,030
then it's fine you stand there.

382
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,260
If you don't want to go out,

383
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,910
we can stay here together.

384
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,260
Okay, let's give it a try.

385
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,620
It's open.

386
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,320
You can't come down yet.

387
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,870
Chenghu was poisoned by Zhou Wei

388
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:03,080
and completely under his control.

389
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,670
The atmosphere in Yunwei Villa is poisonous now.

390
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,910
I'm in no mood to celebrate my birthday.

391
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,540
Madam, do you forget what Young Lord said?

392
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,310
He told you to act as usual

393
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,260
and pretend you don't know anything
about what happened to the Lord.

394
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,430
I know. I'm best at acting.

395
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,910
I believe Zhao

396
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:27,820
can get rid of Zhou Wei.

397
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,150
Speaking of whom,

398
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,780
he said he'd come in here
as soon as the firecrackers started.

399
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:35,950
Where is he?

400
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,020
By the way,

401
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,910
I heard that Zhao had been very close

402
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:44,190
with a girl named Li Chuyue recently.

403
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,070
The servants said she was quite a loose woman.

404
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,670
But Zhao is inexperienced in love.

405
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,260
I guess

406
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:57,020
he did something he shouldn't do.

407
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,190
I feel bad.

408
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,910
Are you feeling unwell?

409
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:02,500
No.

410
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,260
I feet bad because I don't know
about the details of the story.

411
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:09,670
I must ask Zhao when he comes.

412
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:13,430
I heard Young Lord met that woman

413
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,630
on his way back after he eliminated the evil sect.

414
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,630
Her background seems to be unclear.

415
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,950
I wonder

416
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,060
who she really is.

417
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,150
Happy birthday, Madam.

418
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Please be seated.

419
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,100
Thank you, Madam.

420
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,430
Grandmother, in the box are some pills
to promote blood circulation

421
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,830
and enhance your health.

422
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,710
I got them from a famous doctor.

423
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,630
I wish you good health.

424
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,710
Thank you. Do you know where Zhao is?

425
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:09,740
Well...

426
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,540
Grandmother.

427
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,470
Zhao, why were you nowhere to be seen at my birthday party?

428
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,260
How could it be? Look, I'm here.

429
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,310
Doesn't look like someone from the evil sect.

430
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,260
You couldn't take it anymore?

431
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,390
Did you fall in love?

432
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,740
Grandmother, what are you talking about?
I don't understand.

433
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,670
Look what I brought you.

434
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,820
Cold Rice Cake made by Xueyue Sect?

435
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,550
I haven't had it for a long time.

436
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:44,150
My grandson, you're the one who knows me well.

437
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,740
Here, let me cover it for now.

438
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,430
Madam.

439
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,820
Madam.

440
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,300
This is the bird's nest

441
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,990
newly obtained in Fengnuan Pavilion.

442
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,250
It is most nourishing.

443
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,500
Don't fall into the trap.

444
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,020
Looks like she's a tough grandma.

445
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,020
I'll have a good show to watch today.

446
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,020
Li Chuyue.

447
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,950
May I know which sect you belong to?

448
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,670
She's an orphan I ran into.

449
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,120
She has no sect.

450
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:27,100
Madam, we don't know her background.

451
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,150
There's no information
about her family or birthplace.

452
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,150
She might be a member of the evil sect.

453
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:37,000
Jingzhao just wiped out the evil sect.

454
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,340
Their remaining confederates

455
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,230
must want to seek revenge at Yunwei Villa.

456
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,230
That's why she was sent here as a spy.

457
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,150
If this woman is really a spy,

458
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,190
the consequences will be unimaginable.

459
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,740
It's better to believe it than not.

460
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,390
Guards, lock her up

461
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,430
and investigate her carefully.

462
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,230
Grandmother, I fought with the evil sect.

463
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,740
I know them the best.

464
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,580
I'm sure

465
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,990
she's not from the evil sect.

466
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:04,620
Grandmother, Miss Chuyue is innocent and kind.

467
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,820
There's no way she's from the evil sect.

468
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:09,469
Zhao, this is a serious matter.

469
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,280
It concerns the lives of the entire family of Yunwei Villa.

470
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,949
We must be cautious.

471
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,620
Guards!

472
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:22,060
Master, Young Lord is in Chongyue Pavilion.

473
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,540
What tricks is he playing?

474
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,219
Master.

475
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,989
Why are you here

476
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,350
instead of guarding the Lord?

477
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,210
I heard that you need backup here.

478
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:39,429
What? Who said that?

479
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:42,500
It's Second Young Master.

480
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:46,960
Let's go.

481
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:48,219
Go.

482
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:51,179
Wait. Wait. Wait.

483
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,139
Hottie,

484
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:55,929
you should give me a chance to defend myself.

485
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,580
I'm really not a member of the evil sect.

486
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,100
I don't know kung fu either.

487
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,350
I can guarantee that.

488
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,620
She doesn't know kung fu.

489
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,700
Madam put on makeup carefully.

490
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,150
Looks like she's very interested in cosmetology.

491
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,140
I'm actually an orphan.

492
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,100
I traveled all over the world

493
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:20,140
and learned some skills in medical cosmetology.

494
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,620
I make a living by that.

495
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:26,790
Madam, I can teach you some beauty knowledge.

496
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,820
She really doesn't know kung fu.

497
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,910
It seems Bai Zhi sowed discord on purpose.

498
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,180
I almost fell into her trap.

499
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,840
How could you be a member of the evil sect?

500
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,430
I'm such a dotard.

501
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,430
Will you blame me?

502
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,060
No.

503
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,220
I have no resistance to a hottie.

504
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:02,580
What do you mean by hottie?

505
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,950
That's how we address

506
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,020
a cute and pretty young girl.

507
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,980
Madam, she's talking nonsense.

508
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,270
The members of the evil sect are most cunning

509
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,470
and best at disguise.

510
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,510
Don't be fooled by her appearance.

511
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:22,010
Look, the fox tail is showing.

512
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,870
Miss Bai Zhi, you've got pimples.

513
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:26,700
You have oily skin.

514
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:29,180
Don't eat too much spicy food.

515
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,140
Make sure your skin is clean.

516
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,750
You must take care of your skin.

517
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,390
Miss Chuyue, you said you knew beauty skills.

518
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,430
Have a look at me then.

519
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,470
Hottie, look at you.

520
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,910
Your makeup is exquisite. You're fair and beautiful.

521
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,310
But there is one thing that goes wrong.

522
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,020
What's wrong?

523
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,810
Show me your wrist.

524
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:53,350
Come on.

525
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,660
Look, your blood vessels are green.

526
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,790
It means your skin has a warm yellow tone.

527
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,720
People with such a skin tone should never apply pink.

528
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,750
You should wear lipstick

529
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,580
with the color of dusty rose or period red.

530
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,750
What is period red?

531
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,790
It's a kind of red color that is darker than red.

532
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,400
This color will show your temperament

533
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,660
as a domineering lady
who treats everything with contempt.

534
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:20,310
What do you mean by domineering lady?

535
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,060
Simply put,

536
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,790
you don't need to get angry to be formidable.

537
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,670
No one dares to bully you.

538
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:32,180
OK. You said you knew medicine.

539
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,950
I feel upset

540
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:37,180
every few days.

541
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:40,390
I don't have the energy to do anything. Am I sick?

542
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,620
You're not sick.

543
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,830
That's just the blues.

544
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,360
It's good that I'm not sick.

545
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:53,180
Zhao, I really like Miss Chuyue.

546
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,750
Since she's your guest,

547
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,270
bring her to Chongyue Pavilion to accompany me in the future.

548
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,010
Yes, Grandmother.

549
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,220
Good.

550
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,540
If only I could make people happy

551
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,870
like Miss Chuyue.

552
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,060
You look so adorable.

553
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,750
Lord.

554
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:36,830
Lord.

555
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,990
What did An Jingling do when he came here?

556
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,120
Tell me everything.

557
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,280
Do not miss any single detail.

558
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,540
Master,

559
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,220
Second Young Master just said that he was sent by Madam

560
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,020
to deliver some food and things.

561
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,550
I was guarding outside.

562
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,020
I didn't see anything.

563
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,270
That's all?

564
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,470
Yes.

565
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,500
Master.

566
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:04,910
An Jingzhao

567
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,100
must have found something.

568
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:12,220
Master, since now we can't find…

569
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,870
You may leave.

570
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,500
Yes.

571
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,790
Tell me.

572
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:27,390
Master, Li Qing is nowhere to be found,

573
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,870
and we don't know what An Jingzhao is up to.

574
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,100
I have an idea.

575
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,990
Miss Bai Zhi.

576
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,220
Since Miss Bai Zhi likes An Jingzhao,

577
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,790
why don't we help her to grant her wish?

578
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:48,390
That's the problem. She likes An Jingzhao.

579
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,140
Do you expect her to kill him

580
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,790
after getting married?

581
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,580
Even if Miss Bai Zhi doesn't kill An Jingzhao,

582
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:57,660
as long as she sleeps with him,

583
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,180
we'll get more information.

584
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,830
Then we can deal with him in the future.

585
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,270
That makes sense.

586
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:09,470
Today is Madam's birthday.

587
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,850
It's a good occasion to double the joy

588
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,540
and make this marriage work.

589
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,830
Lord. Lord.

590
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,950
Help me up.

591
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,060
Slowly.

592
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,540
How are you?

593
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:35,950
I feel better.

594
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,870
The doctor told me

595
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:48,020
that as long as you take
one of these pills every day,

596
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,180
you will get well soon.

597
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,830
You are so nice to me.

598
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:58,470
You went through all the trouble
to find a good doctor for me.

599
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:02,950
It's my duty to serve you.

600
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,870
You're the blessed one,

601
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,750
so you will be fine.

602
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,660
Come and play with me

603
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:21,660
-whenever you're free.
-Madam.

604
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,310
The birthday banquet is about to begin.

605
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,870
Why don't we go to Lingyun Pavilion?

606
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:25,390
Father.

607
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,580
Chenghu, why are you here?

608
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,620
Come on.

609
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,310
-Mother. -Sit down.

610
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,280
Sit down.

611
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,830
Be careful.

612
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:39,430
Why are you out?

613
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,500
Mother, today is your birthday.

614
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:46,180
Of course I should come
and give you a birthday gift.

615
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,500
I won't blame you even if you don't.

616
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,750
Madam.

617
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,560
Call me Domineering Lady.

618
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,140
D-D…

619
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,200
Domineering Lady.

620
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,010
Domineering Lady.

621
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:05,580
I brought you a birthday gift today.

622
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:09,620
You and the Lord will like it for sure.

623
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,700
Here is the thing.

624
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:15,540
My foster daughter Bai Zhi and Young Lord grew up together.

625
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,100
She's admired him for a long time.

626
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:23,540
As her foster father, I know what's on her mind.

627
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:27,350
So I came here today to propose the marriage to the Lord and Madam…

628
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,540
I mean, Domineering Lady.
