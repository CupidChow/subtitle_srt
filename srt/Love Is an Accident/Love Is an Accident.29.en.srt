[Episode 29]

4
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,100
Bring it to me.

5
00:01:59,460 --> 00:01:59,900
Okay.

6
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,390
You can't take it.

7
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,820
Who dares to touch my precious!

8
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,070
Sir.

9
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:15,660
You...

10
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,420
It's not easy to obtain this part.

11
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,550
I'll practice hard.

12
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,270
I advise Grandmother

13
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,810
not to take pains to do anything like this again.

14
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,480
Take good care of Madam.

15
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,770
Don't let her go out of Chongyue Pavilion again.

16
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,790
Okay.

17
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:47,780
Bastard!

18
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,920
-Bastard!
-Madam.

19
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,930
I didn't expect to stabilize my meridians so soon.

20
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,540
Each of you

21
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,430
tried so hard to guard against me

22
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,590
and deal with me.

23
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,150
I'll see what you can do to me now.

24
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,070
Sir.

25
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,650
Sir,

26
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,650
the guards reported

27
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,430
that they've found where An Jingzhao

28
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,650
and Miss Chuyue are.

29
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,050
Do you think we should send guards there?

30
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:06,700
No need.

31
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,190
I'll go personally.

32
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,150
It's time to take Chuyue back.

33
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,040
Lord is not here.

34
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
She went on a trip.

35
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,230
Where did she go?

36
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,149
When will she be back?

37
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,029
I don't know.

38
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,400
She is supposed to come back these days.

39
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,730
She should be back soon.

40
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,080
Please make sure you deliver this letter to Lord.

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
[To Hongfei]

42
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,460
Okay.

43
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,210
Keep looking for Hongfei.

44
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,670
I'm going back to take care of An Jingzhao first.

45
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,260
Okay.

46
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,740
Don't worry, Young Madam.

47
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,320
An Jingling is here.

48
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,650
He even brought guards.

49
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,200
Young Lord,

50
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,740
you definitely can't use your internal force now.

51
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,000
I've lost my power too.

52
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,590
What should we do to deal with him?

53
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,220
Yueming,

54
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:02,950
you go first.

55
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,080
We can't let him find out you are here.

56
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,780
Young Lord,

57
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,490
it's also dangerous for you to use your power now.

58
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,830
You and Mr. Yueming go first.

59
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,690
I'll stall him.

60
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,240
No.

61
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,540
We don't have time.

62
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,620
As long as you are safe,

63
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,550
I can find a way to escape by myself.

64
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,960
If anything happens to you and Mr. Yueming,

65
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,760
no one else in this world can deal with An Jingling.

66
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,080
Go, Young Lord.

67
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:31,980
Let's go.

68
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:33,440
Let's go.

69
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,440
Be careful.

70
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,490
Okay.

71
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,409
Let's go.

72
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,180
Li Qing.

73
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,200
I'm here for An Jingzhao.

74
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,220
I don't want to kill innocent people.

75
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,880
Step aside.

76
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,600
You want to see Young Lord.

77
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,530
It depends on how capable you are.

78
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,790
How arrogant!

79
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:09,490
Young Lord.

80
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,430
What's wrong?

81
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,890
Mr. Yueming, you go first.

82
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,890
Young Lord.

83
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:14,350
You…

84
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,700
Stop!

85
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,870
Li Qing.

86
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:57,790
Young Lord.

87
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,020
Why did you come back?

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,570
How touching.

89
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:07,790
Lord,

90
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:08,950
no one is inside.

91
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,610
An Jingzhao,

92
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,660
where did you hide Chuyue?

93
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,320
Give her to me.

94
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,410
Otherwise, I'll kill both of you.

95
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,790
Why would I tell you where Chuyue is?

96
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,850
Don't waste your time.

97
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,700
Jingzhao,

98
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,340
it's just been several days since I saw you last time.

99
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,540
I didn't expect that you've lost all your internal force.

100
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,909
Young Lord.

101
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,180
Li Qing.

102
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,830
Li Qing.

103
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,350
Take him away.

104
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:16,710
Li Qing.

105
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,700
Move.

106
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,110
Li Qing.

107
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,790
An Jingzhao.

108
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,500
An Jingzhao.

109
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:48,710
Why are you here?

110
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,210
Come with me.

111
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,890
Let go of me, you devil!

112
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,880
What did you do to them?

113
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,010
Be good.

114
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,830
Come home with me.

115
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,350
Hongfei.

116
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,550
Stay out of my business.

117
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,440
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

118
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,060
I don't want to meddle in the business of you righteous sects.

119
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,260
But as long as it's related to this girl,

120
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,320
I have to meddle.

121
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,240
In 3 days,

122
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,250
I will invite all the heroes in the world to the alliance meeting

123
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,510
and let An Jingzhao atone for his crimes.

124
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,140
Chuyue,

125
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,670
don't miss it.

126
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,370
I didn't expect that Yueming is still alive.

127
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,810
An Jingzhao has inherited all his power.

128
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,870
He should be able to break the Art of Starshift soon.

129
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,880
But he still needs to handle two streams of primordial energy.

130
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,170
At the Martial Arts Gathering,

131
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,330
I will make him eat the Power Dissipating Elixir.

132
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,460
Thank you, Hongfei.

133
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,130
Lord,

134
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,620
this is the list

135
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,670
of the sects who will participate in the alliance meeting.

136
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,730
Please have a look.

137
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,590
Has the doctor checked on An Jingzhao?

138
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,820
The doctor said

139
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,540
An Jingzhao was seriously injured before.

140
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,770
He survived thanks to a method of the evil sect.

141
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,580
So the two streams of primordial energy in his body are fighting with each other.

142
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,180
His internal force can't be used normally.

143
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,380
It's very dangerous.

144
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,440
That's good.

145
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,520
At the alliance meeting tomorrow,

146
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,050
the primordial energy in his body

147
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,440
will be the evidence that he has colluded with demons.

148
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,830
Let's see how he can defend himself.

149
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,290
The sects in the martial arts world join hands

150
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,350
to uphold justice.

151
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,340
The so-called righteous sects

152
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,610
always like to do such shameless things.

153
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,670
An Jingling's intention to harm people is obvious.

154
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,110
Please help

155
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,600
save An Jingzhao.

156
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,420
Don't worry.

157
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,020
Since I promised you,

158
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,300
I will keep my promise.

159
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,830
I will definitely save him.

160
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,830
An Jingling is getting more and more rampant.

161
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,300
He won't let us go.

162
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,400
After saving Young Lord tomorrow,

163
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,460
we should let him eat the Power Dissipating Elixir as soon as possible

164
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,420
to help him neutralize the two streams of primordial energy,

165
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,360
so that he can break the Art of Starshift as soon as possible.

166
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,560
An Jingling damaged our sect's reputation

167
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,820
and stole our sect's secret manual.

168
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,190
I'll let him pay the price.

169
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,510
Miss Hongfei,

170
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,480
I heard you've been looking for the Art of Starshift too.

171
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,280
Yes.

172
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,040
Listen to me.

173
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,680
The Art of Starshift will make people lose their mind.

174
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,240
It has caused bloodshed in the martial arts world many times.

175
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,040
It's really not a good thing.

176
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,060
I've been looking for the Art of Starshift

177
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,830
because I want to make our sect more powerful,

178
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,160
so that we won't be bullied by other sects.

179
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,710
Since it's not a good thing,

180
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,590
it's okay to make it disappear.

181
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,180
That's a relief.

182
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,520
Guys,

183
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,370
there will be many powerful people at the alliance meeting.

184
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,500
We are outnumbered.

185
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,910
To save An Jingzhao,

186
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,270
we need to think of a way.

187
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,690
I have an idea.

188
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:07,990
What is it?

189
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,580
Create a diversion.

190
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,180
Come here.

191
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,910
Young Madam.

192
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,340
I heard that Young Madam was rescued by Lord Hongfei,

193
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,320
so I came here.

194
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,230
Besides,

195
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,180
I have something important to tell you.

196
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,500
An important person will show up

197
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,430
at the alliance meeting tomorrow.

198
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,150
Who?

199
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:46,430
Mr. Yueming.

200
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,710
You are here.

201
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:51,700
Qing.

202
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,610
Bring him here.

203
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,500
Young Lord.

204
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,470
An Jingzhao.

205
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,500
Young Lord.

206
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,590
Everyone,

207
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,230
this guy has finally been caught today.

208
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,850
I can't believe he's still alive after being hit by the Shenyuan Whip.

209
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,280
An Jingzhao used the Evil Sect's skill, the Art of Starshift, many times

210
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:49,210
and caused a lot of trouble in the martial arts world.

211
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,190
Father has disciplined him many times,

212
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,750
but he never repented.

213
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,580
I had to arrest him

214
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:58,950
to seek justice for the martial arts world.

215
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,070
I apologize to you

216
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,700
on behalf of my brother An Jingzhao.

217
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,310
Kill him to uphold the justice in the martial arts world!

218
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:25,430
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

219
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,360
He looks like a gentleman.

220
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,600
I didn't expect him to be such a demon.

221
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,280
We really can't judge a book by its cover.

222
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,380
But no one

223
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:38,060
saw Young Lord use the Art of Starshift

224
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,990
to kill Master Xuanfeng and other martial artists with their own eyes.

225
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,350
Could there be any misunderstanding?

226
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,340
What misunderstanding?

227
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,910
We have solid evidence.

228
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,910
I don't think he can deny it.

229
00:16:58,180 --> 00:16:58,860
Jingzhao.

230
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,380
An Jingling,

231
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,830
you are so despicable.

232
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,160
I'm going to enforce justice on behalf of Heaven today!

233
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,680
Bai Zhi.

234
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,089
Miss Bai Zhi,

235
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,150
are you going to stand against the whole martial arts world?

236
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,619
You...

237
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,079
Let's go.

238
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,200
It's Hongfei.

239
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,950
-Go after them.
-Go after them.

240
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:41,900
Hurry up!

241
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,720
Over there!

242
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,580
Go after them.

243
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,940
This is the Power Dissipating Elixir.

244
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,690
Eat it now.

245
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,250
They will be here soon.

246
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,980
They're quick.

247
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,190
An Jingzhao,

248
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,590
you really have gone astray

249
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,610
and colluded with this witch.

250
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:16,470
Good.

251
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,790
We'll capture both of you today.

252
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:35,980
You all saw it.

253
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,550
I don't need to say anything more.

254
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,220
Jingzhao,

255
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,590
you broke the peace in the martial arts world.

256
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,320
I have no choice but to stand against you.

257
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,980
Amitabha.

258
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,430
-Master.
-Master.

259
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,030
Master Jingling, calm down.

260
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:56,550
This...

261
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,710
-Master Xuanfeng.
-Master Xuanfeng.

262
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,550
Master Xuanfeng.

263
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,480
What's going on?

264
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,780
He has come back to life? This...

265
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:12,710
Master Jingling, are you still wondering

266
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,200
why I came back to life?

267
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:19,370
That day, someone suddenly attacked me with the Art of Starshift.

268
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,550
I had no choice but to use my unique skill

269
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,610
to shut down my meridians and breath.

270
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,780
So the murderer thought I died.

271
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:31,060
My disciples escorted me back to a private place to recover.

272
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,700
When I woke up,

273
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:35,790
I heard that there has been a sudden change in Yunwei Villa.

274
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,510
The innocent person has become a prisoner.

275
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,470
But the murderer has become the lord of the villa.

276
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,200
-This...
-This...

277
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,310
So this is what happened.

278
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:45,640
Master, don't turn the facts upside down.

279
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,940
Everyone knows

280
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:50,540
my brother has the primordial energy of the Evil Sect in his body.

281
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,740
It's solid evidence.

282
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,910
You are still alive.

283
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,490
It's a good thing.

284
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,270
But you can't help him hide the truth

285
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,310
just because you are close friends.

286
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,220
What we do instead of what kind of primordial energy we have

287
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,550
decides we are evil or righteous.

288
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:08,930
Master Jingling,

289
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,910
that's all I want to say.

290
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,950
It is never too late to mend your ways.

291
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,940
I'll leave the rest

292
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,810
to Young Lord.

293
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,740
This…

294
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,140
You all heard him, right?

295
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,490
Master, thank you for telling the truth.

296
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,670
Everyone, please calm down.

297
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,670
I will handle this properly.

298
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,220
An Jingling,

299
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,020
if you stop now,

300
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,070
you'll still have a chance to be alive.

301
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:47,700
Jingzhao,

302
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,540
you are the one who should stop.

303
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,470
I've become the lord of the villa.

304
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,900
Of course I need

305
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,040
to get rid of bad things for Yunwei Villa.

306
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,980
What kind of martial art is this?

307
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,430
So powerful.

308
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:45,990
So it was him.

309
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,130
This is really out of my expectation.

310
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,470
Young Lord.

311
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,140
What kind of martial art is this? It's so powerful.

312
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,710
It's the Art of Starshift.

313
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:01,740
The Art of Starshift?

314
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,540
The Art of Starshift?

315
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,740
The Art of Starshift?

316
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:04,620
It was him.

317
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,720
He did everything.

318
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,390
What did you do to me?

319
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:14,710
The Profound Earth Sutra doesn't have another part at all.

320
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,070
Young Lord.

321
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,410
[Shangyu]

322
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,540
Yueming.

323
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,480
The Yueming Sword.

324
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,520
Could it be that the Yueming Sword can defeat the Art of Starshift?

325
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,710
An Jingling,

326
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,680
don't make more mistakes.

327
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,950
You always look righteous.

328
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,680
I hate you so much.

329
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,870
If you hadn't come back to interfere,

330
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,400
I would have married Chuyue

331
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,700
and become the lord.

332
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,450
And the reputation of Yunwei Villa would have long been restored.

333
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,500
An Jingling,

334
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,990
it was you.

335
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,990
You hurt people,

336
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,060
confused right and wrong,

337
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,190
and fooled martial artists.

338
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:01,660
You...

339
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,650
You're so evil.

340
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,470
If you want to take revenge,

341
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,470
come on.

342
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,180
I'm right here.

343
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,020
Kill him.

344
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,990
No need to bother you.

345
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,230
He is a traitor of Yunwei Villa.

346
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,200
I'll deal with him myself.

347
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:05,260
Do it.

348
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:30,510
An Jingling!

349
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,020
Stop!

350
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,790
Chuyue!

351
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:37,420
Miss Chuyue.

352
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,140
Chuyue!

353
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:42,260
Chuyue.

354
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,220
Chuyue!

355
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:45,790
Don't touch her!

356
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,170
An Jingzhao,

357
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,190
you die first.

358
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,180
I'll take good care of Chuyue after you die.

359
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,020
Chuyue.

360
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,370
Chuyue.

361
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,990
Come on.

362
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,660
Young Lord.

363
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,060
It worked.

364
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,940
The Art of Starshift has been destroyed,

365
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,820
and he has lost all his power.

366
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,260
Fate

367
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,670
is still on your side.

368
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,860
You end like this

369
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,030
because you deserve it.

370
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,220
You shouldn't blame anyone else.

371
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,870
Yes.

372
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,380
This is what I deserve.

373
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,500
Mother.

374
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:57,620
Still, I've let you down.

375
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:00,180
Jingzhao,

376
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,190
do it.

377
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,510
Everyone,

378
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,870
after all,

379
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:12,740
An Jingling is a member of Yunwei Villa.

380
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,600
Please

381
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,550
leave him to me.

382
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,190
Okay.

383
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,870
You're unforgivable.

384
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,790
But you are pitiful too.

385
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,990
I don't have the heart to execute you.

386
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,520
But you have to be punished.

387
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,660
Now that you've lost your power,

388
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,380
you can't practice martial arts anymore.

389
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,780
For the rest of your life,

390
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,930
you will be imprisoned in Yunwei Villa.

391
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,270
You are not allowed to leave the villa.

392
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,850
[Yunwei Villa]

393
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,020
Donghua.

394
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,650
Madam asked me to deliver flowers to Young Madam.

395
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,990
There are new kinds of flowers again.

396
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,190
You deliver flowers here every 3 days.

397
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,120
Young Madam's room is almost full.

398
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,030
Madam dotes on Young Madam the most.

399
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,120
She said she can't walk around during the recovery stage.

400
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,070
But don't let her get bored.

401
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,180
Looking at the flowers and plants

402
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,580
can relieve her boredom.

403
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:26,310
Just give them to me.

404
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,320
Listen.

405
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,470
If you go in now,

406
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,980
you'll be stunned.

407
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,020
It's inhumane

408
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,780
and bloody.

409
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,540
Young Lord and Young Madam are killing a dog in the room?

410
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:41,440
It's not the dog you think it is.

411
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,150
Forget it.

412
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,350
Give them to me first.

413
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,870
You'll get hurt if you go in now.

414
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,500
Leave.

415
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,950
Actually,

416
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,780
I'm that dog.

417
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,050
What? Is it too bitter?

418
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,830
Yes.

419
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,190
I have a way

420
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,230
to make you feel less bitter.

421
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,560
Preserved fruit again?

422
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,660
I eat it every day. I'm tired of eating it.

423
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,860
I'm not talking about preserved fruit.

424
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,850
Do you still feel bitter?

425
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,470
It seems to be useful.

426
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,410
But it's not sweet enough.

427
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,990
I need more.

428
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,910
Grandmother is here.

429
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,050
Chuyue,

430
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,350
you've fully recovered.

431
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,230
I have a gift for you.

432
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,490
This is so exquisite.

433
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,460
This Phoenix Crown is the symbol of the madam of Yunwei Villa.

434
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,270
Wear it

435
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,260
at the inauguration ceremony of the lord in 3 days,

436
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,220
and you will really become the madam of the villa.

437
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,780
Zhao,

438
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,190
what do you think?

439
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:30,130
Beautiful.

440
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,700
Do you mean the Phoenix Crown

441
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,510
or Young Madam?

442
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:34,430
Madam,

443
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:34,870
Young Madam,

444
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:35,350
and the Phoenix Crown

445
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,410
all are beautiful.

446
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,230
No wonder you have such a good wife.

447
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,120
You are glib-tongued.

448
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,660
Be careful.

449
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,530
Don't let the stone fall off.

450
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,810
What happened?

451
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,470
I was careless.

452
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,320
Young Lord, please punish me.

453
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,700
Young…

454
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,300
All right, you may leave now.

455
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:14,910
Okay.

456
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,790
Luckily, it didn't fall off.

457
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:22,590
Otherwise, it would have completely cracked.

458
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,470
The energy of this meteorite is running out.

459
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,590
What do you mean?

460
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,530
Every time I use it,

461
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,880
it will crack a little.

462
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:38,310
Now it seems

463
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,640
there is only one chance left.

464
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,120
Do you mean

465
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,700
if you go back again,

466
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,800
you can never come back?

467
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,460
Don't worry.

468
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,030
I've decided to be your wife here.

469
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,750
I won't leave you.

470
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,000
Sister,

471
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:31,840
are you there?

472
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,140
Yes.

473
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,150
I'm here.

474
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,860
It was sunny these days.

475
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,510
I had no time to contact you.

476
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,040
Your brother-in-law is back.

477
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,910
In several days,

478
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,270
there will be various entertainment events in the villa.

479
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,190
What a pity.

480
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,980
You can't come back.

481
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,780
Do you know what events there will be?

482
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,310
Sister,

483
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,040
come back quickly.

484
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,000
Mom was hit by a car.

485
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:54,500
What?

486
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,360
Now...

487
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,040
Li Chuyang.

488
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,460
Li Chuyang.

489
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,070
Li Chuyang.

490
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,980
Hit by a car?

491
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,110
Someone.

492
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,730
Is anyone here?

493
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,110
Hurry up.

494
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,110
Come here.

495
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,920
Go to the temple now and ask the master

496
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,469
when there will be a thunderstorm again.

497
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,060
Okay.

498
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:20,090
Be quick.

499
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:30,989
But if I go back this time,

500
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,409
I can never come back.

501
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,050
Young Madam.

502
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,590
I've asked the master.

503
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:05,540
He said there will be a thunderstorm tomorrow night.

504
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,340
I know.

505
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,520
Go back to work.

506
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,040
Mom,

507
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,350
please be fine.

508
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,080
Chuyue.

509
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,270
The training is over so soon?

510
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:05,820
So soon?

511
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,390
It's been two hours.

512
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,250
It was too long.

513
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,320
Did you miss me?

514
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:10,620
No.

515
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,150
I'm angry.

516
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,350
You have to please me.

517
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,960
That's more like it.

518
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:26,020
I drew these paintings for you.

519
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,670
If you miss me in the future,

520
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,530
you can take a look at them.

521
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:35,730
This...

522
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,910
This one is my favorite.

523
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,510
Thank you for the gift.

524
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,500
But

525
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,870
we are together day and night.

526
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:52,930
Why did you say something so strange?

527
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,910
Thank you, Chuyue.

528
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,340
I really like your gift.

529
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,300
Hang this pouch on the bedside,

530
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:15,470
and you can live happily ever after.

531
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,020
Chuyue,

532
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,190
something is wrong with you.

533
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,060
You are supposed

534
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,460
to smile happily now.

535
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,920
Who bullied you?

536
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:32,030
Tell me.

537
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,670
I'll beat him up for you.

538
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,880
Hottie,

539
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,640
you are so nice to me.

540
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,460
I'm afraid I'll let you down one day.

541
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,540
Are you afraid that you can't be a good madam?

542
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,350
It's okay. I'm here.

543
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,880
Just be yourself like before.

544
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,360
You... You can even be more lively.

545
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,410
I'm also afraid

546
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:57,090
I can't be with An Jingzhao forever.

547
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,590
What...

548
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,720
What makes you say that?

549
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,310
If...

550
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,710
If one day I'm gone,

551
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,910
you have to take good care of yourself.

552
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:10,910
And you should persuade An Jingzhao

553
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,590
not to be so sad.

554
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:15,820
If you're gone but I'm still here,

555
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,380
I would become

556
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,580
a 1000-year-old demon, right?

557
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,990
You must promise me.

558
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:24,940
Okay.

559
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,350
Have you memorized what I told you?

560
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,890
Yes, Young Lord.

561
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:39,460
Go.

562
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,440
Young Lord, everything is ready.

563
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,660
Well,

564
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,320
Young Lord,

565
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,790
what are you looking at?

566
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,690
Is there something on my face?

567
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,850
Have you arranged the meeting tomorrow?

568
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:01,700
Of course.

569
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,570
You'll be the lord from now on.

570
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,070
I have to be reliable.

571
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,070
Go to Madam later.

572
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,470
Ask someone for help

573
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,030
about the villa's accounts.

574
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:11,450
Okay.

575
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:13,390
I will complete the mission,

576
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,070
Boss.

577
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:22,460
According to what Li Chuyang said,

578
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,340
now I'm of great importance

579
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,820
among the people who are being cultivated.

580
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,140
Chuyue,

581
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,400
why are you here?

582
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,990
You didn't go home,

583
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,340
so I came to look for you.

584
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,110
The moon is so beautiful.

585
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,470
Let's sit down

586
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,910
to eat and enjoy the moon together.

587
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,300
Okay.

588
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,310
Come on.

589
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:09,500
Is it good?

590
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,140
Enjoying the moon together

591
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,460
is somehow happy.

592
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,590
If you like it,

593
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,500
we can enjoy the moon here

594
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,750
at the full-moon night every year.

595
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,140
But life is not always happy.

596
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,630
That's why we say

597
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,190
"let us wish that man will live as long as he can. Though miles apart, we'll share the beauty the moon displays."

598
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,920
I don't know.

599
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,000
I don't care about others.

600
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,500
As long as we are together,

601
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:39,740
life is happy.

602
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,740
Meeting you is the most beautiful dream I've ever had.

603
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,380
I've thought about this a lot.

604
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,240
If we have children in the future,

605
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,980
will we still lean on each other like this

606
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,430
when our children grow up and we grow old?

607
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,180
If this is really a dream,

608
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,110
I promise you

609
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,630
that you will never wake up.

610
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,980
Let's talk about something realistic.

611
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,710
Since you mentioned children,

612
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:14,000
don't you want to ask me how many children I want to have?

613
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:17,780
Can you

614
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,990
say something pleasant to me?

615
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,620
Like "you are a fairy"

616
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,750
and "I love you". Something like this.

617
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,070
You're a fairy.

618
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,470
I love you.

619
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,620
I will never leave you.

620
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,590
I will always be with you.
