Taoyun.

5
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,380
No, Miss Han.

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,180
Wang.

7
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,110
Please don't call me that.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,880
I...

9
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,860
I'm not used to it yet.

10
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,090
I still want to congratulate you, Miss Han.

11
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,890
Firstly, you finally found your family.

12
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,479
Secondly,

13
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,200
The Hanshui Sect has been on the decline recently,

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,010
and has been bullied by some sects in the martial arts world.

15
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,450
If you marry the young lord,

16
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,130
with the reputation of the Yunwei Villa,

17
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,470
life will be much easier for the Hanshui Sect.

18
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,000
Is the Hanshui Sect really in this situation?

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,860
Yes.

20
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,920
Since your parents passed away,

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,940
the Hanshui Sect's situation has been getting worse.

22
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,280
Jingling, why do you want to see me?

23
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,450
I have a gift for you.

24
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,650
I made a hairpin myself.

25
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,860
I wonder whether you'll like it.

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,600
Yes, I like it.

27
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,860
Is there anything you can't do?

28
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,060
Do I look good with it?

29
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,940
I heard that Taoyun is the real Han Wanqing.

30
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,570
Really?

31
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,870
His Lordship has summoned the young lord to see him,

32
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,100
and asked Taoyun and the young lord to get married soon.

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,560
The young lord has agreed.

34
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,890
Let’s go.

35
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,840
Is what you said true?

36
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,150
This is...

37
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,430
Where did you hear that?

38
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:22,260
What nonsense were you talking about?

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,660
Leave.

40
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:23,880
Yes.

41
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,100
Chuyue, where are you going?

42
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,100
I want to be alone.

[Yunwei Villa]

44
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,450
Donghua.

45
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,579
Have you ordered people of the Lingxiao Yard

46
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:50,520
not to tell Chuyue about the news that

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,710
my father wanted me to marry Taoyun?

48
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,630
Young Lord, I've ordered them not to tell her.

49
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,870
I'm really afraid that she’ll be angry.

50
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,980
I must solve this problem as soon as possible.

51
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,350
Is she still sewing clothes?

52
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,720
She went to Master Jingling's residence at 3 p.m.

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,850
Master Jingling wanted to give a gift to the young madam.

54
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,440
Young Lord.

55
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,579
I think recently, Master Jingling

56
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,709
has given me the impression that he's a bit pretentious.

57
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,830
Alright.

58
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,760
You may leave first.

59
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,150
Yes.

60
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,920
Young Lord.

61
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,450
I think you are too conservative.

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,300
Go for it, Young Lord!

63
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,330
Show your style as her official spouse. Go for it!

64
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,900
Donghua,

65
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,100
have you learned too much

66
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,370
from Li Chuyang recently?

67
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,140
Yes, buddy.

68
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:50,060
No, Young Lord.

69
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,210
It's due to the daily homework

70
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,130
which the young madam's brother asked me to do previously.

71
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,900
Okay.

72
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:56,950
Yes.

73
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,630
An Jingzhao.

74
00:04:59,220 --> 00:04:59,690
An Jingzhao.

75
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:00,420
Young Madam.

76
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,580
An Jingzhao.

77
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,740
I've heard from them that

78
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,780
Taoyun is the real Han Wanqing.

79
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,660
Yes.

80
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,090
Taoyun is Han Wanqing.

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,100
So, His Lordship asked you to see him,

82
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,230
because he wanted you to marry Taoyun?

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,020
-No. Don't… -You’re lying!

84
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,280
They said you had agreed.

85
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,140
I didn't agree.

86
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,070
Chuyue, what are you doing?

87
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,370
We're not a real married couple anyway.

88
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,050
I'm not the real Han Wanqing, either.

89
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,290
We can't be together.

90
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,170
Yes.

91
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,560
You are not the real Han Wanqing indeed.

92
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,560
But you are the person I really love.

93
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,480
I don't want to talk to you now.

94
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,010
Get out of my way.

95
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,480
No.

96
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,450
We're married. Why should I get out of your way?

97
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,040
I'm going to sleep in the guest room.

98
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,380
I don't want to talk to you.

99
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,909
Do you want to see Jingling?

100
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,460
Yes.

101
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,900
Jingling is cute and gentle.

102
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,180
How I wish I could have a dozen of such younger brothers.

103
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Are you willing to hear my explanation patiently now?

104
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,020
Yes.

105
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,500
I went to see my father today.

106
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,659
He did ask me to marry Taoyun.

107
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,720
But I didn't agree.

108
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,880
Just now, I didn't tell you

109
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,760
because I didn't want to make you sad.

110
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
I should solve this problem myself.

111
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,760
Then why did people outside say that you had agreed?

112
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,980
There are many people in the villa, and it's easy to spread rumors.

113
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:01,890
This is normal.

114
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,450
The most important thing is that I didn't agree.

115
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,650
Do you trust me or not?

116
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,700
Yes, I do.

117
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:07,770
But...

118
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,900
No buts.

119
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,820
Trust me.

120
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,150
Give me some time.

121
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,080
I will persuade my father.

122
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,140
You are mine.

123
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,380
Yes.

124
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:49,990
I'm yours.

125
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,750
Young Lord.

126
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,409
His Lordship has set up a banquet,

127
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:57,210
and wants to invite you and Ms. Chuyue to have dinner there together.

128
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,160
Go on sleeping.

129
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,950
Help me reply to my father.

130
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,250
Tell him I’m not feeling well.

131
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,930
Young Lord, His Lordship said that

132
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:15,950
it would be a family banquet today.

133
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:19,210
I need to make sure that you and Ms. Chuyue will go together.

134
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,350
Got it.

135
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,600
It's okay. Don't think too much.

136
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,460
I'm here.

137
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,580
My father knows that my grandmother likes Chuyue.

138
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,780
It looks like he didn't invite my grandmother purposely.

139
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,170
Zhao. Ms. Yue.

140
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,180
It's a family banquet today. There's no need to stand on ceremony.

141
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,730
Come on.

142
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,170
Make yourself comfortable. Sit down.

143
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:31,170
Lord.

144
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,770
Miss Wanqing is here.

145
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,640
Ask her to come in.

146
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:33,940
Yes.

147
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,390
Lord.

148
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,050
Young Lord. Young Madam.

149
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,820
Wanqing.

150
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,020
You don't have to curtsy to them.

151
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,940
You are the real young madam

152
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,790
of the Yunwei Villa now.

153
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,510
Father, I've never agreed to...

154
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,730
Help her sit down.

155
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:06,980
My lady.

156
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,890
Come on. Have a seat.

157
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,260
Miss Wanqing,

158
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,070
I haven't taken good care of you these years.

159
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,790
I've made you suffer.

160
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,060
The martial arts world is in turmoil now.

161
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,560
Zhao is the future Lord of Yunwei Villa,

162
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,760
and he'll have to go through many tests.

163
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,960
If you marry into our villa,

164
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
you will be Zhao's

165
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,800
most helpful wife and assistant.

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Others are no match for you.

167
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,670
Lord, something wrong happened to the Hanshui Sect.

168
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,790
Zhao, I have something to tell you.

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,000
I will solve the problem.

170
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,160
You should leave first.

171
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:20,980
Lord.

172
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,800
I'm leaving.

173
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,920
Take good care of Miss Wanqing.

174
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,760
Yes.

175
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,340
Chuyue.

176
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,060
Chuyue!

177
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,250
I'm sorry. I...

178
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:41,870
I need to look for embroidery.

179
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,600
I have no time to talk to you now.

180
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:55,980
Lord.

181
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,810
Lord. Young Lord.

182
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,780
I’m Ye Kong, the second disciple of the Hanshui Sect.

183
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,510
Our chief has been missing for two days.

184
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,590
He's missing?

185
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,360
Where did he go missing?

186
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,420
Around the valley.

187
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,690
After our departure that day, we walked for half a day and arrived at the valley.

188
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,980
Our chief discovered a scenic spot,

189
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,340
so he said that he wanted to take a look there.

190
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,000
After that, we couldn't find our chief anymore.

191
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,550
Did you search everywhere?

192
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,400
Yes, we searched everywhere,

193
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,790
but we didn’t find him.

194
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,100
That's why I came to ask you

195
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,980
to help us.

196
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,210
Father, I'll go take a look.

197
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:27,460
Okay.

198
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,490
Hurry up.

199
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,680
You must find Chief Han.

200
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,570
Yes.

201
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,520
Young Lord.

202
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,270
The young madam is packing up and is going to leave.

203
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,300
She said she was going to see someone called Mr. Ju.

204
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,220
Where is she now?

205
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,890
She's outside the gate,

206
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,880
and will get into the carriage soon.

207
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,340
Get the horse ready.

208
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,740
Yes!

209
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:55,310
Chuyue!

210
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,340
Wait!

211
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,180
Chuyue.

212
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:07,250
Don't care too much about what my father said.

213
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,430
I don't want to hear it. Get off the carriage.

214
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:09,580
This is the carriage I hired.

215
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,670
I'm going to look for embroidery.

216
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll go home after I find it.

217
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:14,860
I'll go wherever you go.

218
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,230
As your husband, I'll follow you everywhere.

219
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,310
Get off the carriage. I'm leaving.

220
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:23,000
Chuyue. The martial arts world is full of danger,

221
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,700
and you don't have any martial arts skills.

222
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,300
How can I let you go out alone?

223
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,500
Who told you that I don't have any martial arts skills?

224
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,860
I've learned many moves.

225
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,820
Yes, your skill of buttering others up is good.

226
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,070
This kind of martial arts skill is incredible.

227
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,460
With my cultivation like this, I can't resist it at all.

228
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:39,980
But...

229
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,140
But I'm just worried.

230
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:46,190
If you go out alone, I'll feel worried.

231
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,700
Get off the carriage at once. I'm leaving.

232
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,240
Go, go, go.

233
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,880
Chuyue!

234
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,480
Do you know the Yunwei Villa

235
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,740
is the top sect in the martial arts world?

236
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Do you know how many people are up to no good in the martial arts world?

237
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,220
If they know that you are my wife

238
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,860
and you'll go out alone,

239
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
what will happen?

240
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,620
They might come to take revenge.

241
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,580
I need to go out to deal with something, too.

242
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,580
If we go together,

243
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,340
no one will dare to bully you.

244
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,750
Who is your wife?

245
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,920
Our ties were cut a long time ago.

246
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,970
You are my ex at most.

247
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,490
You are just my wife!

248
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,300
You're my wife in this life, and you'll still be my wife in the next life

249
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,030
and in the life of the next life.

250
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,400
You'll be my wife forever.

251
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,520
Sit properly at once.

252
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,000
So you're saying yes to me?

253
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,750
Let's go!

254
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:45,840
Yes!

255
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,700
Young Lord.

256
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,430
Our chief disappeared around here.

257
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,770
We searched all the places nearby,

258
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,030
but no trace was found.

259
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:48,820
Have you searched the area down the cliff?

260
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,790
Our disciples' cultivation is not good enough, and their light-body skills are just so-so.

261
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,990
None of us can go down.

262
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,280
I’ll go have a look.

263
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,030
Young Lord.

264
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:55,740
Be careful.

265
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:59,290
Down there, it's the area which no one has ever set foot on.

266
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,350
Don't worry.

267
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,680
I'm going, too.

268
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,990
Why do you want to go as well?

269
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,660
You're just worried about me, right?

270
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,790
How thick-skinned.

271
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,690
Taoyun is my friend.

272
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,060
She finally found her brother.

273
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,320
I also don't wish that something wrong would happen to him.

274
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,730
I have a lot of knowledge.

275
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,010
You'll need it by then.

276
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,440
Come on.

277
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,350
It's dark here.

278
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,920
Follow me closely.

279
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,880
I'm not afraid of darkness. I can walk by myself.

280
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,160
There might be a trap here.

281
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,950
Don't move recklessly.

282
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,890
Let's continue to go forward when they calm down.

283
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,780
Chuyue.

284
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,370
I know you feel bad

285
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,470
because of Taoyun.

286
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,340
But the engagement was decided by my father.

287
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,140
What my father said only represents his own views.

288
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,890
You don't have to care about what he said.

289
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,300
I don't need a helpful wife

290
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,280
or an assistant.

291
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,470
I only want you.

292
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,610
You are the only woman I love in my life.

293
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,700
No one can replace you.

294
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,510
Only when you're by my side

295
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,660
can I feel peaceful

296
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,010
and have the courage to face all kinds of difficulties.

297
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,300
You're right.

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,530
Why should I care about what others think?

299
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,700
Your attitude towards me is the most important thing.

300
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,370
It should be safe now. Let's go.

301
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,230
Someone is here.

302
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:43,490
Chief Han.

303
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,040
Chief Han! Chief Han!

304
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
He's still alive.

305
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,300
But why has he lost all his martial arts skills?

306
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,830
Chuyue, help me lift him up.

307
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,060
Chief Han.

308
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,130
What happened?

309
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,740
Young Lord.

310
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,310
After our departure, we walked for half a day.

311
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,140
As soon as we arrived at a valley,

312
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,760
I saw the beautiful scenery here.

313
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,430
Master.

314
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,060
The scenery here is splendid.

315
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,380
It's good.

316
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,780
I'll go to the place ahead to take a look.

317
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,310
You don't have to follow me.

318
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,460
The Art of Starshift has actually reappeared in the martial arts world?

319
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,060
Yes.

320
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,300
I didn't expect that, either.

321
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,970
I'll take you to leave here first.

322
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:27,970
Okay.

323
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,710
-Master! -Master! -Master!

324
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,310
Young Lord, are you alright?

325
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,360
There's no need to make a fuss.

326
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,300
I won't die.

327
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,300
Chief Han.

328
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,360
Have you noticed that there is

329
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,020
a strange smell on your body?

330
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,020
Maybe it's the smell of insect repellent.

331
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,150
In the past few days,

332
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,020
there have been many mosquitoes and insects.

333
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,480
You are weak for no reason.

334
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,180
I think

335
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,630
someone schemed against you on purpose.

336
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,900
If that's really the case,

337
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,390
I won't recover soon.

338
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,880
Please help me find out about the truth, Young Lord.

339
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,570
Chief Han, you trust me so much.

340
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,690
I will do my best.

341
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,940
This matter concerns the safety of the martial arts world.

342
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,240
We must find out who is practicing

343
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,180
Art of Starshift as soon as possible.

344
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,180
If he really masters this skill one day,

345
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,300
no one in the martial arts world will be able to control him.

346
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,760
What you said makes sense.

347
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,210
Chief Han,

348
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,510
I have another request.

349
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:26,550
Young Lord.

350
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,360
Please say it.

351
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,850
There is no love between Miss Wanqing and me.

352
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,740
I hope you can agree to cancel

353
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,360
the marriage between us.

354
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,920
Does Wanqing refuse to marry you?

355
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,980
I already have someone I love.

356
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,110
Miss Wanqing doesn't like me, either.

357
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
If it's true that

358
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,290
Wanqing doesn’t want to marry you,

359
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,620
after you help me find out about the truth,

360
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,360
I’ll explain it to your father personally.

361
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,340
Thank you, Chief Han.

362
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,020
Chief Han.

363
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:58,800
You're still weak now, and it's not easy for you to walk.

364
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,330
I think you should find an inn nearby to rest.

365
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,780
When you get better,

366
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:04,220
you can return to the Hanshui Sect.

367
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,720
Okay.

368
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,050
However, I'd like to ask you

369
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:10,840
to pass on a message to your father for me.

370
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,880
I don't think I can go.

371
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,470
Don't worry, Chief Han.

372
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,580
Thank you.

373
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,730
Master, be careful.

374
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,890
The poison which Chief Han got will make his whole body feel weak

375
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,350
and make him unconscious.

376
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,460
I can't judge what poison it is.

377
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,520
Can you judge

378
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,730
how long Chief Han has been poisoned till now?

379
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
Ten hours.

380
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,960
From my departure to my arrival at the bottom of the valley,

381
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,500
it took about four hours.

382
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,380
That means

383
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,700
I was poisoned when I was in the stronghold.

384
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:10,380
But they would test whether the food was poisonous before I had a meal every time.

385
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,710
How come I was poisoned?

386
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,700
If he was not poisoned by food,

387
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,360
could there be any other ways?

388
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,940
Other ways?

389
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,340
Chief Han.

390
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,090
Could it

391
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,790
have something to do with the strange scent on your body?

392
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,130
What scent?

393
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,660
I smelled something strange

394
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,590
from Chief Han's body previously.

395
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,460
Chief Han said it was caused by the insect repellent.

396
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,060
But...

397
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,820
I always feel that besides the scents of the insect repellent,

398
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
there seems to be other smells, too.

399
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,430
There are some strange smells indeed.

400
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,950
If I didn't smell it carefully,

401
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:44,510
I wouldn't notice it.

402
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:45,980
Chief Han.

403
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,120
For the incense burner you usually use,

404
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,580
do you have it with you now?

405
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:51,850
May I have a look at it?

406
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,700
Guards!

407
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,160
Fetch the incense burner.

408
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,920
Doctor.

409
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,180
Can you check whether it's poisonous?

410
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,600
Wait.

411
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,320
There is no change at all.

412
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,620
There's only the smell of the insect repellent inside the burner indeed.

413
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,940
The stitches on this garment

414
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,850
were obviously added later.

415
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,810
They're a bit different from other stitches.

416
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,860
Look.

417
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,130
Doctor, do you have scissors?

418
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:49,770
Yes.

419
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,660
Here you are.

420
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,880
Come on. Let me take a look.

421
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,610
It's the Dissolving Bone Powder.

422
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:25,160
I didn't expect that the murderer would hide this poison here.

423
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,540
Who is it?

424
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,910
How could he be so malicious?

425
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,700
Chief Han.

426
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,960
It seems that there's a mole in the Hanshui Sect.

427
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,420
Do you remember

428
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,700
who once approached your clothes?

429
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,390
This outer garment

430
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,020
was kept in my bedroom all the time before my departure.

431
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,750
In order to prepare my luggage,

432
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:50,660
many people went in and out of my room.

433
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,690
All the people who are travelling with me this time

434
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:56,290
had the chance to approach this outer garment.

435
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,850
In that case,

436
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,510
there's no way to verify it.

437
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,980
We can only start the investigation with the Dissolving Bone Powder.

438
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,710
But the Dissolving Bone Powder

439
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,250
can be bought in many places.

440
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,060
An Jingzhao.

441
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,260
The red color on this cuff

442
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,580
was also dyed subsequently.

443
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,070
This is raw lacquer.

444
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,450
Have you ever touched raw lacquer recently?

445
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,490
No.

446
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,190
Was this raw lacquer

447
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,260
left by the mole accidentally?

448
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Chief Han, please

449
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,240
send someone to check

450
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,230
all the places that sell Dissolving Bone Powder.

451
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,760
Besides selling medicine,

452
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,740
it's very likely that this shop

453
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,810
also runs the business of lacquerware.

454
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:44,270
I'll send someone to investigate it at once.

455
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,440
Chief Han.

456
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:48,780
You should recuperate first. We'll leave first.

457
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,260
Okay.

458
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,100
Thank you.

459
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,620
Chief Han, take care. I'll take my leave.

460
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,800
Thank you.

461
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,660
Chuyue.

462
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,030
Miss Han.

463
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,460
Young Lord, how is my brother?

464
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,340
Chief Han has no danger of life.

465
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,210
However,

466
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,420
he has lost all his martial arts skills.

467
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,670
Chuyue. Young Lord.

468
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:38,870
I’ll go check on my brother first.

469
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,300
I believe that

470
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,510
you will handle this matter well.

471
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:56,740
Brother.

472
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,360
Ling. Why are you here?

473
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,860
Miss Han wanted to come to the Hanshui Sect to see you.

474
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,050
I was worried about her safety on the way,

475
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,050
so I came with her.

476
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,350
Let's go inside.

477
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,460
Miss Han.

478
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,380
Chief Han...

479
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,170
My brother is in a good mental state.

480
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,300
Young Lord, why do you come to see me?

481
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,260
Miss Han,

482
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,190
I'd like to tell you this directly.

483
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,610
It's my father's idea to ask me to marry you.

484
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:46,950
I won't agree.

485
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,240
My wife can only be Chuyue.

486
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,700
Young Lord.

487
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,030
I know the deep affection between you and Chuyue.

488
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,700
However...

489
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,830
Miss Han, if you have any concerns,

490
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:00,090
just tell me directly.

491
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,560
I've heard that

492
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,240
the Hanshui Sect is always bullied by some other sects.

493
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,260
Since I'm a member of the Hanshui Sect,

494
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,180
I think if we can get help from the Yunwei Villa...

495
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:13,620
It turns out that you're worried about this matter.

496
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,500
Don't worry.

497
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,500
The Hanshui Sect once helped the Yunwei Villa.

498
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,060
If you are willing to accept it,

499
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:20,870
I will treat you as my own sister.

500
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,090
In the future, if anything wrong happens to the Hanshui Sect,

501
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,090
I will do my best to help you.

502
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,470
Thank you, Young Lord.

503
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,020
I will assist you

504
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,350
in explaining the matter to my brother and His Lordship.

505
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,950
Thank you.

506
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,370
Brother,

507
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,560
who did this malicious thing to Chief Han?

508
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:51,150
Now we can only be sure that

509
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,790
there is a mole in the Hanshui Sect.

510
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:57,370
This mole colluded with the person who practiced the Art of Starshift

511
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,370
to hurt Chief Han.

512
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,340
The Art of Starshift?

513
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:06,320
Hasn't this martial arts skill been missing in the martial arts world for a long time?

514
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,130
That's the problem.

515
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,430
Chief Han and I can't figure out

516
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,620
who practiced this evil skill.

517
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:17,540
Have you found any clues about the mole in the Hanshui Sect?

518
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,700
Now we've knonw

519
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,980
how he poisoned Chief Han.

520
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:24,210
The Dissolving Bone Powder is an ordinary poison,

521
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,380
so we can’t confirm the source of the poison.

522
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,240
which has caused us some trouble.

523
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,380
But now I've got new clues.

524
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,540
This time,

525
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,110
I will find him.

526
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:38,000
With your intelligence, you will definitely find him.

527
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,070
By the way, Brother,

528
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,220
our father asked me to supervise and urge you to practice martial arts skills.

529
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,820
I've been negligent lately.

530
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,780
Why don't you practice in the pavilion?

531
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,910
I want to see it, too.

532
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:52,840
Of course.

533
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:54,380
Ling,

534
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,660
I will give you

535
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,670
whatever you want,

536
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,370
except for the woman I love.

537
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,050
Come on.

538
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:22,760
Brother.

539
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,530
How about I recite the pithy formula for you?

540
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:33,080
You can start from the second move.

541
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,560
Clear spring water falls straight down.

542
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,800
Left slash, right dragon.

543
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,530
I won't disturb you any longer.

544
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,020
Qing.

545
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,929
-Young Master. -I'll go outside to find Chuyue.

546
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:30,980
You should ask Han Wanqing to come here.

547
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,239
Tell her Chuyue wants to talk to her here.

548
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,650
Young Lord?

549
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,590
Ms. Chuyue, be careful.

550
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,600
What's wrong? Are you okay?

551
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,260
Chuyue.

552
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,570
Don't worry, Chuyue.

553
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:17,880
I'm fine.

554
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,640
I just feel a little dizzy.

555
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,870
I'll be fine if you can stay by my side.

556
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,340
You…

557
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,010
Young Lord!

558
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,170
An Jingzhao!

559
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,160
-You... -Chuyue.

560
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,850
What are you doing?

561
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:40,760
This...

562
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,640
Chuyue, it's not like what you think.

563
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:03,230
Chuyue.

564
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,090
I don't know why I mistook

565
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,420
Taoyun for you just now.

566
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,880
Don't think too much,

567
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,680
and don't misunderstand. Okay?

568
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:12,330
Is this the explanation you want to give me?

569
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,300
I don't know how to explain it to you.

570
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,960
But you must trust me, Chuyue.

571
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,080
-Chuyue. Chuyue! -Chuyue.

572
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:18,910
Chuyue.

573
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:20,980
Young Lord.

574
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,620
Chuyue, where are you going?

575
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,620
I'm going to leave here,

576
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:43,680
as far as possible.

577
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,820
Take a look.

578
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,500
Come on.

579
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,380
Take a look.

580
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,580
Li Chuyue, don't miss him.

581
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,540
Focus on your career.

582
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,740
This is the north.

583
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:14,540
I can ask about Ju Wutang.

584
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,130
Sir,

585
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,350
give me a pot of tea.

586
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:38,360
Coming.

587
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,060
Thank you.

588
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:44,930
Sir,

589
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,620
I want to ask you something.

590
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,870
Do you know a great master

591
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,820
of embroidery whose name is Ju Wutang?

592
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,880
Miss, you've found the right person.

593
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,450
I know everything about this place.

594
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,740
Where is he?

595
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,260
Exclusive news

596
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,860
costs one tael of silver.

597
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,400
One tael of silver?

598
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,970
Your price is so high, isn't it?

599
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,300
Rare things tend to be expenseive.

600
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,860
If you think it's expensive,

601
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,340
you can go somewhere else.

602
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,780
I was in a hurry when I came out.

603
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,180
I didn't bring any money.

604
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,980
I'm sorry then.

605
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,430
How about this, sir?

606
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,520
I'll go out and help you attract customers.

607
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,860
I'll earn one tael of silver.

608
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,750
Then you should tell me the news about Ju Wutang.

609
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,750
What do you think?

610
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Okay. Deal.

616
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,050
It's so cheap?

617
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:46,150
-It’s so cheap. -Let’s take a look inside.

618
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,570
Let's go.

619

Go, go, go.

-Let's go. -Let's go, too.

625

Right. They'll give us so many cups of tea for free.

626
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,250
Sir, this is worth one tael of silver, right?

627
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,770
Your idea is very good.

628
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,740
Now you can tell me

629
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,280
where Ju Wutang is, right?

630
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
Mr. Ju often goes to the music house.

631
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,540
He likes to spend time with a musician named Yuege.

632
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,180
Yuege?

633
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,110
Young Lord.

634
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,430
Where's Chuyue?

635
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,180
The young madam has left the inn

636
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:33,500
and gone to the nearby street market.

637
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,030
Besides,

638
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,000
she has got the news about Ju Wutang.

639
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,060
She's heading to the music house now.

640
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,720
Be careful.

641
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,540
Young Lord, what happened to you?

642
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,020
Why did you suddenly faint?

643
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,700
You even mistook Miss Han for the young madam.

644
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,100
I don't know why, either.

645
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,610
Left slash, right dragon.
