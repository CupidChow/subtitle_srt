1
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,520
[Nanno] How do we measure our existence?

2
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,800
By fame or the number of your viewers?

3
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,800
[beeps]

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,560
We exist as long as people
are watching us.

5
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,520
[phone chimes]

6
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,680
But what must we sacrifice
to get people's attention?

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,600
I want to die.

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,280

[chuckles]

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,280
[on mic] Hello, there. This is JennyX.

13
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,320
I was almost late
for our livestream tonight.

14
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,960
I've been so crazy busy with school work.

15
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I also have exams coming up.

16
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,120
But I didn't want
to keep you all waiting.

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,080
So, I thought I'd get all my homework done
while talking with you all.

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,360
[chuckles]

19
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,560
YOU KEEP ME FOCUSED IN SCHOOL.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,600
YOU'RE SO BANGABLE.

21
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,280
Hmm.

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
This one's hard.

23
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,800
I don't know if I'll be able to solve it.
Can anyone out there help me?

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,920
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU. YOU GOT THIS.
I'LL HELP YOU.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,960
I can't solve it right now.
Give me a second.

26
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,720
Hmm.

27
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
IT'S REALLY HARD. - WOW.

28
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,400
[hums] I got it. I think I got the answer.

29
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,040
[sighs] I almost couldn't solve it.

30
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,240
What about you?
Have you finished your homework?

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,680
If you haven't done it yet,
then we should do it together.

32
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,760
I want my channel to be the place
where we can all help each other out.

33
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,960
Or if anyone needs my help,
please tell me.

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,760
If there's ever any way I can help you,
I totally will.

35
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
POLICE ARE SAVING SOMEONE
WHO'S ATTEMPTING SUICIDE.

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,800
WHERE?

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,200
GO TO WWW.LIVENEWS.COM

38
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,880
Hey. Has everyone left
to do their homework?

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
N. - I'M ALWAYS HERE WITH YOU.

40
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,680
TELL PEOPLE TO GO SUPPORT THE POLICE.

41
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,480
Oh, no. An emergency.
Has something happened?

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,280
I'm so worried.
I hope everyone is going to be okay.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,320
I've got an idea.

44
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,920
Let's all go give the police our support.

45
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,320
I'll go give them my support too.

46
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,120
I'll do another livestream soon.

47
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,120
I look forward to doing my homework
with you then.

48
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,480
I'll see you again soon. Bye bye.

49
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,160
N. - I'LL BE WAITING
NO MATTER HOW LATE IT IS.

50
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,360
[beeps]

51
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,400
[sighs] Why did you make me stop so soon?

52
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,640
We could've gotten more views.

53
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,440
Oh, we couldn't get the views up
after that.

54
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,400
That suicide is trending number one
on Twitter.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,440
Ugh.

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,040
Will we still get
the endorsement fee for the drink?

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,400
She didn't even mention
the product's name.

58
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,760
They only gave us half of the payment
upfront this time.

59
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,160
If we don't finish the job--

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,600
But I'm tired. [clicks tongue]

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
How about I make you some coffee, huh?

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,360
All right? Be right back, okay?

63
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,640
Don't bother. Both of you leave.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,960
Hmm?

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,200
[sighs]

66
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,200
[sighs]

67
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
This is bullshit.

68
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,640
[grunts]

69
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,720

[indistinct chatter]

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,720
-[student 1] Look.
-[student 2] She's here.

73
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,640
Hello, Mon!

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,160
Oh, my. Oh, my.

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,480
[Jane] How are you doing?

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,920
Yeah, hi, Jane.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,040
[chuckles]

78
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,520
-[all giggle]
-[student 1] Wow.

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,960
What did you do?
Why did she say hello to you?

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,080
-Yeah, tell us.
-Well, I just left a compliment

81
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,520
on her live stream the other day.

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,960
[student 1] She's so cool and nice.

83
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
[Jane] Hello, Cake!

84
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,600
How's your sprained wrist?
Is it still hurting?

85
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,200
Oh, it's already healed.
Thanks for asking.

86
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,520
[chuckles]

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,800
-[student] She remembered.
-She remembers me.

88
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,640
[indistinct chatter]

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,800
Oh, Non!

90
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,840
How's your mom? Is she still sick?

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
If there's anything I can do,
please let me know.

92
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,320
Okay, thank you so much.

93
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
[chuckles]

94
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,960
Damn, dude. [chuckles]

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,520
Jane remembers things about you, Non.
I'm so jealous of you.

96
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
-[student] Hi, Jane.
-[Jane] Hello.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Excuse me. You're sitting in my seat.

98
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,320
Jane? JennyX, is that you?

99
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
Are you really in this class?
I'm so happy.

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,040
I've been a big fan of yours
for a long time now.

101
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,320
I never thought, when I moved here,
we'd be classmates.

102
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,920
Hmm… it's nice to meet you too.

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,000
I watch your livestreams
no matter how late they are.

104
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:03,320
Hey, do you go by "N" online?

105
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,520
You know who I am?

106
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,080
I'm surprised someone like you remembers
a faceless fan like me.

107
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,560
Hmm… I think every person is memorable.

108
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Oh…

109
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,080
your words are so touching.
You really are JennyX.

110
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,360
Anyway, is this seat assigned to you?

111
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,120
Yes.

112
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,480
Can I have it? I really love sitting here.

113
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
There's an empty seat back there.

114
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,040
Oh… fine.

115
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,680
[sighs]

116
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,280
You can be honest. You can tell me
if you're not okay with it.

117
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,280
[chuckles]

118
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,800
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

119
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,120
I've been your fan for a long time now,

120
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,280
and I check your Instagram posts everyday
and watch all your livestreams.

121
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,680
You know, I see what's going on.
I can see that you're not happy.

122
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,520
No, really. I promise you I'm fine.

123
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,880
I don't mind sitting here.
Really, it's okay.

124
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
Go back to your seat, Jane.

125
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,360
I can see that you don't really
wanna sit here.

126
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,400
Am I right?

127
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,080
When you're with me, you can be honest
and say how you're really feeling.

128
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,160
I don't want you to be lonely anymore.

129
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,960
[teacher] That's how you calculate
half life from a half life graph.

130
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,880
The next problem is about
a velocity-time graph.

131
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,640
The slope of a velocity-time graph

132
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,640
represents the acceleration of the object.

133
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
[student] Jane,
do you want to sit with us?

134
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,560
Uh…

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,080
Will you live-stream yourself
doing homework today?

136
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,640
I don't know yet.

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,760
I'm so jealous. How does it feel
to have so many followers?

138
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,240
Well, I just did it for fun at first.

139
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,840
-I never thought I'd get many followers.
-[student] Huh.

140
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,960
How much do you get paid
to endorse a product?

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,440
I don't really know.
My parents take care of that for me.

142
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,080
-[student] Oh.
-[Nanno] Jane!

143
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,360
Can you come over here?
I need your help with something.

144
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,640
Uh… bring your lunch too.

145
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
Excuse me.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,680
[student] Never mind. I got her picture.

147
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,920
-Gosh. Jane is so pretty.
-Wow.

148
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,400
So, what did you want me to help you with?

149
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,600
Nothing really.

150
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,480
You just seemed
so uncomfortable over there.

151
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,760
I would be uncomfortable too.

152
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,240
Was that a chat or an interview?
I couldn't tell.

153
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,520
[chuckles]

154
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,480
What kind of food is that?

155
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,040
Why does it look like shit?

156
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,880
Well, my mom just put me on a diet

157
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,080
to help me stay in shape.

158
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,360
Blech.

159
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,120
It doesn't look good at all.

160
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,640
That's what you're thinking, right?

161
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,520
Mmm-hmm.

162
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,360
[Nanno] Eat this instead. It's so good.

163
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,000
Should I?

164
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,280
Mmm-hmm.

165
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,720
[Nanno] Come on.

166
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Mmm…

167
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,960
I haven't eaten
this kind of food in so long.

168
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,280
[chuckles]

169
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,600
I think that if you like it
you should have more. Here.

170
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,440
-Mmm…
-[Nanno] Enjoy.

171
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,160
It's fine to eat like this
once in a while.

172
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,680
Everyone needs to do
what they want sometimes

173
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,320
without having to worry about anything.

174
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,520
You don't have to be perfect all the time.

175
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,480
[Nanno] I want you to remember,
you can be yourself with me.

176
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,880
When we're together, you don't have
to be JennyX. I won't judge you.

177
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
You know, this snack that you reviewed,
it's not even good.

178
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,560
Do you think I liked it?

179
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,280
When I was eating it, I had to have
a trash can by me. It made me gag.

180
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,080
But this is what I have to do.

181
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,320
Hello, everyone. This snack is so good.

182
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,400
[scoffs]

183
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,720
[chuckles]

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,280
Mmm. And that one.

185
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,000
It made me break out so bad,

186
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
I covered it with make up for days.

187
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,080
And your parents? Don't they screen
the products first before you review them?

188
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,640
My parents?

189
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,960
They have me review anything
as long as I get paid.

190
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
Jane, someone wants to hire you
to review some kitchenware.

191
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,240
You'll even get to cook.

192
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,280
[Jane] They have me do anything
that earns them money.

193
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,880
They don't care if it's late
or if I'm tired.

194
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,160
These face masks are really the best.

195
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,960
No one's paying me to say this.

196
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,800
I promise, I even use them myself.

197
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,320
[Jane] I have to lie to everyone and
tell them that these are amazing products.

198
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,280
[man] …four, five, six, seven.

199
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,320
-Wow.
-[woman laughs]

200
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:28,280
May God bless us.
We made so much money this month.

201
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,360
Honey, Jane's birthday's coming up.
What should we get her?

202
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,040
Hmm.

203
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
How about cellphone?
She said she wanted one.

204
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,840
Hmm.

205
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,200
How about we buy her more followers?
She will get more sponsors.

206
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,680
We might be able to negotiate
a higher fee for her.

207
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
[ominous music playing]

208
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,840
Hmm. Good idea.

209
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,400
Let's do that.
Can you check how much it costs?

210
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
[Jane] Screw them.

211
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,280
[sighs]

212
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:10,480
I guess being famous,
it isn't as great as I thought.

213
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,880
My followers, they want a role model.
They always want me to act happy.

214
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,160
As for my haters,

215
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,480
they think they can post
whatever they want about me,

216
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,040
because I have an image
of being a nice person.

217
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,080
I have to be kind and understanding
towards everyone.

218
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
[exhales]

219
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,600
It makes me wanna vomit.

220
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,440
So, what is it that
you actually want to do?

221
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,760
I want… to run away from everything.

222
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,120
I'm sick of being happy all the time
or caring what they think.

223
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,280
I'm sick of my parents treating me
like a product.

224
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,040
Basically, I'm sick of being JennyX.

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,480
I'm done with it.
I want to disappear from this world.

226
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,720
Ah, you want to disappear from this world.
Do you really mean that?

227
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
Mmm. I do.

228
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,240
But I don't think it's really possible.

229
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
Well, if you want, there's a way
you can make that happen.

230
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,440
Are you saying that I should
run away from home?

231
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,720
[sighs]
I can't go out anywhere in public anymore

232
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,280
without being recognized.

233
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,480
Even if I could, my parents…

234
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,360
track me with this.

235
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,240
I wasn't saying you should run away
from home.

236
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,760
You should consider leaving this world
all together.

237
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,480
Is Jane home, honey?

238
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,320
[beeping]

239
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,240
Yes, she is.

240
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,920
Oh, that's good.

241
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,920
[chimes]

242
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,080
[on mic] Hello, everyone! It's Jane.

243
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,560
Today, I have something important
to share with you.

244
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
Let me tell you about my feelings.

245
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,680
Oh. She's live early today.

246
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:37,360
-[Jane] …what I want to do with my life.
-Is everything okay, honey?

247
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,760
Yeah. She's just doing it for fun.

248
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,400
When you hear me say that,
you think those are my dreams.

249
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,200
YOU'RE SENTIMENTAL TODAY.
I'M GOING TO CRY.

250
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,120
But you know what?

251
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,640
THIS IS DIFFERENT. - DON'T TEASE US.

252
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,840
Every time I try dreaming…

253
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,400
I just feel completely empty.

254
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,040
That's because everyday…

255
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,280
I don't have any time
to think about myself.

256
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:05,880
I spend all of my time
reviewing all these crappy products.

257
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,520
[Jane] Do you think these products
are really good?

258
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,880
What the hell does she think she's doing?

259
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,360
Jane, what are you doing?

260
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,720
[door rattling]

00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,520
Jane, open the door. Jane!

263
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,920
Honey, go get the key.

264
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,360
Jane, it's your dad. Open the door!

265
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,760
I have to lie to you all.

266
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,200
Do you want to know why?

267
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,920
TELL US WHO HURT YOU.

268
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,480
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LIKE THIS.

269
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,040
TELL US WHO HURT YOU.

270
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,800
DON'T CRY, JANE. - YOU POOR THING.

271
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,640
TELL US, JANE. - HANG IN THERE. - DAMN.

272
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,720
[sobs]

273
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,600
It's because my parents don't know
how to earn money themselves.

274
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,480
They use me to make money for them.

275
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,280
[knocking on door] Jane!

276
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,120
THEY'RE ABUSIVE PARENTS.
CAPITALISM IS EVIL.

277
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,280
THAT'S SO LOW.
I FEEL BAD FOR YOU, JANE.

278
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,520
But I'm sick of lying to everyone, okay?

00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,760

HEY! - YOU LYING BITCH.

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm sick of doing things
I don't want to do.

00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,440
I'm mad. Mad, mad, mad, mad.

[gasps]

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,200
[Jane] But when realized I don't want
to do any of this anymore,

289
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,280
one thought popped into my head.

290
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
And I knew immediately

291
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,200
that's what I'll do.

292
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,840
CALM DOWN, JANE.

293
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,040

Hello, officer.

00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,840
My daughter's live-streaming her own
suicide, but I don't know where she is.

296
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,960
I need you to track the location
of her phone for me.

297
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,920
It's JennyX.

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,960
CALM DOWN, JANE.

299
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
YOU JUST SAY THAT TO GET ATTENTION.

300
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,880
NO, JANE. - SHE WOULDN'T DARE.

301
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,880
YOU ATTENTION SEEKER.

302
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,200
If I do this, where do you think I should…

303
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,720
cut myself, everyone?

304
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,720
Should I cut my wrist, stab myself,

305
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,280
or slit my throat?

306
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,120
You have to help me decide.

307
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,840
I can't stand living like this anymore.

308
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,560
-Officer, please hurry up.
-[crying]

309
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
Now, I have an idea.

310
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,080
CUT YOUR THROAT IF YOU DARE.

311
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,880
Click "like" for the wrist.
"Wow" for the chest.

312
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,480
THINK THIS THROUGH, JANE.

313
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,600
For the throat, click on the "heart."

314
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,160
DON'T DO THIS. - HEART ALL THE WAY.

315
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,000
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
CUT YOUR THROAT AND DIE.

316
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,080
CUT YOUR THROAT AND DIE.
YOU CAN TALK TO ME, JANE.

317
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:30,600
Oh, the wrist. That's getting the votes.

318
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,560
Um, but I don't think that will kill me.

You helped me choose.

I'm really gonna miss you all.

OH, MY GOD.

You really are a top internet star.

Well, if you want, there's a way
you can make that happen.

338
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,200
How?

339
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,640
You just have to kill yourself, Jane.

340
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,680
[laughs]

341
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,640
I don't mean you actually have to die.

342
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,600
I'm just saying that you should fake
your death.

Yes, she is.

Wow.

Now, your parents will have no idea
that you weren't actually at home.

By the time they realize it,
everything will be over.

Here are all the tools you can use
to kill yourself.

You're finally free.

You don't even have to use
the name Jane anymore.

357
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,800
From now on, what would you like
to call yourself?

-What do you have to say?
-Ugh.

367
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,120
First of all, my wife and I would like
to say to anyone watching

368
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,280
that we're both devastated
by what happened to Jane.

We also have something to say.

We'd like to beg everyone to stop sharing
Jane's suicide clip

371
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,200
out of respect for her.

372
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,640
[reporter] Do you want people to stop
sharing the clip because of what she said

373
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,800
about product endorsement deals
and what the two of you made her do?

You can say anything you want about us,

375
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,520
but please you have to believe that

376
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,800
we both truly love and care about her.

But it's okay.
We'll soon forget all about JennyX.

They will move on and someone new will
replace you. Everyone will forget you

live-streamed her suicide.

I'm actually very close to her.
We're best friends.

I believe a kind and sweet girl like Jane

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,400
couldn't think of something
like this herself.

Someone else must be behind this.
I'm sure of it.

In order to uncover the truth,

They're the same size exactly.

Aren't I a good liar? [chuckles]

You'll have to teach me some tips.

Tell me what you want from me.

It's not too late
to change your mind, Jane.

[sighs]

482
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,200
I thought you wouldn't show up, Jane.

483
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Who's Jane? I'm Rosie.

484
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,720
[chuckles]

485
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
That's right. Rosie.

486
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,240
First, you changed your name,
then what did you do after that?

487
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:38,200
You got a haircut, a tattoo.
You pierced your nose.

488
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,760
-You bought new clothes--
-Stop.

[tense music playing]

490
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,560
I have all the pictures. I can prove it.

491
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,720
You went from being Jane
to being this Rosie. Is that right?

492
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,800
What do you want from me?

493
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,400
Money?

494
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,800
[mimics buzzer]

495
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,040
If you don't want money, what is it?

496
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,480
I'm trying to help you here.

497
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,680
I know you're working with someone.

498
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,400
Someone that goes by the name
of Nanno, maybe?

499
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,920
She's the real danger.

500
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,720
How do you know Nanno?

501
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:17,920
[chuckles]
I know her better than you do, Rosie.

502
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,480
For example, these pictures…

503
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,320
Who could've taken them besides Nanno?

504
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,040
I hacked these pictures from her cloud.

505
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,280
If you don't believe me, look through
her cellphone and see for yourself.

506
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
But let me tell you one thing.

507
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,240
Your only way out…

508
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,040
is to get away from Nanno.

509
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,680
However,
just running away won't be enough,

510
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,920
because Nanno will still be able
to get you.

511
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,640
Then what should I do about her?

512
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,160
I know of one way to keep her quiet.

513

Understand now?

516
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,720
I only want what's best for you.

517
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,040
[door closes]

518
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Where have you been?

519
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,400
I just wanted to get some fresh air.

520
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,560
Staying in this room is not
what I call freedom.

521
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,520
It's not as fun as I thought it'd be.

522
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,480
Do you want to go back to being JennyX?

523
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,400
Have you forgotten how you are now Rosie?

524
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,760
You should forget about JennyX.

525
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,680
Be patient a little longer
for things to die down.

526
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,160
Then you can live your life
whichever way you want.

527
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,240
I guess you're right. As long as
no one finds proof of what we did.

[chuckles]

529
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,880
If Yuri really had any proof,

530
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,120
she would've leaked it by now.

531
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:33,640
So, do you think there's anyone else
who might have evidence?

532
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,280
I think that…

533
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,320
you're feeling confused right now.

534
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,160
I guess I'm just missing home.

535
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,720
[laughing]

536
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Home?

537
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,640
Do you mean the home where your mom
and dad exploited you for money?

538
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,640
If you do this, you will never go home
or see your parents ever again.

539
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,760
You sure you want that?

540
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,800
[scoffs]
I'll be fine. I don't need my parents.

541
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,080
Besides, they're the ones
leeching off of me.

542
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,240
With a family like that,
who needs them anyway?

543
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,680
I'm sorry…

544
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,320
but I don't think you'll be able
to go home ever again.

[whimpers]

547
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,880
[Yuri on phone] I've recently discovered
that Jane had a new friend named "Nanno."

548
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,680
Maybe she's the missing link,
the reason behind all of this.

549
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,680
Do you want to know how close they are?

550
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:44,160
On top of that, I've also found another
set of footprints at the suicide scene.

551
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,040
Do you see there are two sets
of footprints?

552
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,480
I think that one of them belongs to Nanno.

553
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,880
More importantly,
someone has already informed the police

554
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,320
giving them clues
about where these two girls are hiding.

I don't want to be Rosie anymore.

[Nanno sighs]

559
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,680
I already told you.

560
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,280
You should've thought this through
before you did all this, right?

561
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,080
But now you don't have a home anymore.

562
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,240
Come to think of it…

563
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,400
there might be a way.

By now, your desperate parents
must be missing their darling daughter.

Their precious daughter
has been missing for so long.

And their goody-goody daughter
isn't having fun.

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,520
She wants to go back to her old life.

[Yuri on phone] Shut up and listen, Jane.

587
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,960
You have to mess up the room

588
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,960
and cut yourself a few times
to make it look like you two had a fight.

Then, put the knife
in Nanno's hand to frame her.

After all that,

00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,240
because we know
what food she's allergic to.

640
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,880
We would never put our daughter at risk.

641
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,440
And we put a tracker on her

642
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,800
because we were afraid
she would meet someone like you.

643
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,280
[man] We do all those things
because Jane wants us to.

644
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,080
That's what she's always wanted
ever since she was little.

645
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,600
[imitating little girl] Ta-da! Dad, Mom…

646
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,040
I want to be famous.

647
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,320
Can you two help me?

648
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,720
[man] That's why we do everything we do.
We want to make her dreams come true,

649
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,880
so she can be the superstar
that she wants to be.

650
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,560
[sobbing]

651
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,720
You deceived our daughter.

652
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,200
Are you trying to deceive us too?

653
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,280
I'm not deceiving you.

654
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:38,360
Do you two really not remember me?
I'm your daughter, Jane.

655
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:40,240
[Jane sobs]

656
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,760
But…

657
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,320
do you remember what you said to me?

658
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,880
"I'll be fine. I don't need my parents."

659
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,280
"Besides, they're the ones
leeching off of me."

660
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,160
"A family like that…"

661
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,800
"Who needs them anyway?"

662
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,960
If you can't even remember
what you said and what you did,

663
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,560
how can anyone remember you?

664
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,640
Nanno, you…

665
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,480
You bitch.

666
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
[grunting]

667
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,840
-You ruined my life!
-[choking]

668
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,760
-I killed you! How come you're still here?
-[man] Stop that.

669
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,080
Get out!

-[panting]
-[Nanno gasps and laughs]

671
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,680
I ruined it?

672
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,000
You're the one who ruined your life.

673
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,320
Don't you remember?

674
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,800
You're the one who killed JennyX.

675
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,720
[smacks lips]

676
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:54,240
Jane told us about all the horrible
things, everything that you did to her.

677
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,920
[sobbing] That's right.

678
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:02,840
They forced me to do all these things
that I didn't want to do.

679
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,160
Then they tried to pretend to be me.

680
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,480
I don't know what happened.

681
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,520
They were both working together.

682
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:14,040
[whimpering]

683
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,080
[man] Right.

00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,080
Please, dad.

685
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,760
Where did we set up the camera?

686
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:32,960
I want everyone
to see exactly what's happening.

687
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,760
It's over there.

688
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,480
[tense music playing]

689
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,920
DON'T LET HER GET AWAY, JANE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS BITCH?

690
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,040
CALL THE POLICE, JANE.

691
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,720
SHE'S PROBABLY A WANNABE.

692
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,000
MAYBE SHE'S MENTALLY ILL.

693
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,800
[on mic] Everyone, it's me, Jane.

694
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,200
Did you all see what happened?
What this imposter did to me?

695
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,920
[Nanno] You all must help me.

696
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:08,600
Please, show me your support
by sending me hearts.

697
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,520
You can send angry emojis
to this imposter.

698
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,880
WHY DID SHE DO THIS TO YOU? - POOR JANE.

699
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,480
[sobbing] Dad. Mom.

Please, it's me, Jane. I'm Jane.

701
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,280
Don't you remember me?

702
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,840
Are you really going to keep lying?
You're shameless.

703

[sobbing] Dad.

Dad.

705
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,680
Did we call the police yet?

706
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,800
Yes, honey.

-It's me, Jane.

I'm right here.

Was I really that wrong, Nanno?

720
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,960
Did I really deserve this at all?

It didn't heal?

You can't answer Jane's question?

Are you starting to doubt
what you're doing here?
