[Nanno] Everyone says
that friendship is a valuable thing.

And it's even more precious when people
from different classes form friendships.

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,960
However, how high can the price
of friendship really be?

Just throw your bag away.
You see how old and crappy it is?

There aren't any seats for me

54
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,280
because no one wants to let
a new kid into their group.

You aren't like the rest of them.

Your friendship isn't about class
or even about money,

57
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,600
and you probably wouldn't mind a new face.

[Nana] You should know

00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,840
that we don't usually let
random people join our clique.

Yeah?

[Tubtim] If you want to join our clique,

70
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,240
you have to give us proof
that you can be a true friend.

Our clique doesn't do stuff like that.

But I thought that friends are supposed
to help each other with everything.

You're so naughty.

What do you mean? Who's a servant?

They're my friends.

All of that in exchange for money.

when I beat you to it.

What about it?

169
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,840
What's wrong with that?

00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm just doing my job, you get it?

171
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,360
I play my part and they push me around.

172
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,640
It's not easy to find a job,

173
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,200
and this one pays well.

174

Yuri, you're quite an interesting girl.

I'm not that interesting.

Tell me something,

177
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,480
is money really that important to you?

Yes, it is.

[Yuri's mom] Hello.

I hope I'm not a bother.

I made stir-fried pork and basil.

[Yuri] I'll eat it later.

188

I bought you a new phone.

189
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,680
Isn't this too expensive?
Where did you get the money?

190
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,080
Hmm. My friends paid me
to help tutor them.

-Uh, isn't it nice?
-Mm-hmm.

195

This is the newest model
they have in the store.

196
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,440
You don't have to watch your shows
on the TV.

197

Now, you can watch things on this.

You won't get lonely when I'm not here.

-Come on. Cheese.

…and you can send it to me like this.

205
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,600
[Yuri] I do wanna have some real friends.

206
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,440
But this is where I live.

207
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,440
My family is poor.

208
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,400
If I didn't do what they want,
how else can I have a better life?

209
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,360
They just treat me the way rich people
always treat poor people.

210
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,920
They treat poor people
like we're a charity case.

211
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,240
They throw scraps our way…

212
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,920
but it's just to make themselves
feel generous.

213
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,080
But they never really accept us,
poor people, as being like them.

[sighs]

215

Nana and Tubtim are like most rich people.

216
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,360
When I first started hanging out
with the two of them,

217
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,720
I thought I had friends I could depend on.

218
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,040
I imagined what it would be like

219
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,800
if I became rich one day.

220
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,960
If I were richer than them…

221
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,240
I'd treat them the way they treat me.

"Here, Tubtim, here's a new bag.

225

Your bag is so frumpy, I just
couldn't stand to look at it anymore."

226
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,960
Or maybe, I'll do the same thing
they do to me.

"Here, I just wired you money.

Wonderful friendship, fuck them. [scoffs]

[Nanno] You can actually do all of that.

Do what?

232
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
You can do all the things you just said.

233
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,840
Why wouldn't you do them?

234
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,320
How could I do that?

It really shouldn't be too hard.

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,640
Why don't you keep
your fucking mouth shut?

Your life is in our fucking hands.

Hmm…

332
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,320
I think it's the other way around.

That evidence,
I already uploaded all of it to the cloud.

Take care of her dead body, will you?

375
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,520
Put her in a tub.
And make it look like suicide.

What are you waiting for?

[Yuri] You two

378
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,880
have to get rid of her body yourselves…

379

[somber music playing]

Since the moment we became friends…

385
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,760
you treated me like some kind of victim.

386
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,480
So I let you.

You like throwing money at me…

388
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,520
so I let you.

389
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,320
You had me play some innocent girl
to lure people here…

390
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,440
and I did it.

why don't you take care of her body?

Do it.

403

I'm begging you.

You're used to barking orders.

409

Now, it's your turn to take them.

Please, don't hurt us. I'm begging you.

What do you think?

A hundred thousand.

Is that really enough for your freedom?

419

A million?

420
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,520
You think freedom is that cheap?

What you did to other people…

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,760
it can't be paid back with money.

426

It has to be paid for with pain.
