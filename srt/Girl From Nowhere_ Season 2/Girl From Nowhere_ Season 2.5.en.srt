-Come on, admit it.
-Pin him down, come on.

All right, grab him. Come on.

I didn't touch her. What else can I say?

You ran off and kept your friends waiting.

Do you all know what unity means?

391
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,200
Unity means…

392
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,640
You must take responsibility together.

393
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,360
So, if your friend does something wrong…

394
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,480
…you'll all take responsibility for it,
right?

395
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,240
[Nanno] For example, if your friend
runs away during the initiation ritual,

396

you'll all have to be punished for it.

Since K tripped and sprained his ankle,

398
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,360
I'll have to give his punishment
to everyone,

399

That's a dog.

He may be a dog,
but Mr. Lucky has seniority over you.

He's been here longer than even me.

to get undermined just because of you?

I won't.

I told you to bow.

Bow down on the ground right now.
What's so hard about that?

00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,960
[Nanno] K hurt Mr. Lucky!

484
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,680
Mr. Lucky has run off!

485
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,280
You're fucked.

486
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,360
[junior 1] Lucky.

487
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,960
-[junior 1] Lucky.
-[junior 2] Lucky!

488
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,840
Lucky!

489
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,440
[junior 3] Lucky, buddy. Lucky.

[rain pattering]

492
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,120
[senior 1] Where's Lucky?
You didn't find him?

-[panting]
-[rain pattering]

494
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,640
I looked all night, I couldn't find him.

495
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,120
He's nowhere to be found.

496
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Please, don't punish us for this.

497
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Right now,
we have a more important thing to do.

498
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,960
We need to find a new dog to be class pet.

499
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,640
What if we get someone
to replace Lucky for the time being?

500
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,960
What do you all think about that?

501
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,040
-Grab him.
-Hit him.

502
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,080
-Go, go.

504
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,680
I said sit down!

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,040
[senior 1] Sit down!

506
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,200
-Grab him.
-Hold him down.

507
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,720
Right now, you're a dog.

508
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,840
-[laughter]
-You must sit like a dog

509
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,440
and follow your master's orders.
You understand?

510
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,120

-Stay still. Don't move.
-Stop moving.

513
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,920
Why are you so stubborn?

514
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,360
-Hey, stop it! Do you have a problem?
-Do you wanna try me, asshole?

515
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,640
[Nanno] Don't bully K, guys.

516
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,560
[senior 2] Pull him up.

517
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,960
-[senior 2] Get him to sit up.
-[senior 3] Sit.

518
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,040
[senior 3] Sit up. Come on.

00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,360
[Nanno] You're so adorable.

[Nanno]
Can you please let K off the leash?

523
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,320
Fetch this for me. One, two…

Move it!

532
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,760

00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,200
What do you do after giving me your paw?

546
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,680
What do you do next?

Yum, yum.

[breathes heavily]

557
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,240
See? It's much better to be a dog

558
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,560
than a centipede.

559
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
If you're angry,

560
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,920
you can take it out
on the freshmen next year.

with you assholes!

643
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,040
-[overlapping yelling]
-We don't believe you!

644
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,720
Why won't anyone believe me?

645
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
So, this is your way of helping?

646
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,840
That's right. Isn't it fun?

647
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,520
It's so much faster than your way.

648
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,680
You even killed Mr. Lucky.
Was that really necessary, Yuri?

649
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,560
[chuckles]

650
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,520
Everyone!

651
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,760
Since K killed Lucky,
he needs to pay for it.

652
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,680
Whoever hits K in the head the most times

653
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:11,080
gets to be the head of the freshmen class
and can skip the initiation ritual.

654
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,840
[students clamoring, shouting]

655
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,640
Mr. Lucky would be honored to die
for such a good cause.

656
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,080
-[groans]
-Do you think that if we let K live,

657
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,840
he'll just stop bullying
the next class of freshmen?

658
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,760
You're too fast to judge, Yuri.

659
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,120
I can't believe
those words came out of your mouth.

660
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,640
If you keep talking like this,

661
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,760
I really am going to have
to take your job from you.

662
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,320
-[student] Don't let him get away!
-What are you waiting for?

663
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,360
[thuds]

664
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,640
[clicks tongue]

665
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,640
