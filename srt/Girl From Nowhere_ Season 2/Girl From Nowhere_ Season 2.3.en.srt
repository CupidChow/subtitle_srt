If you had owned up to what you did

none of this would've happened.

[reporter] In today's news,
key evidence has just been found.

516
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:59,040
We believe it will lead the police
to reopen the investigation

517
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,760
of the case of Minnie Four Corpses.

518
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,600
An anonymous source
has sent these pictures

519
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,160
to our station this morning.
Let's take a look at them together.

MINNIE FOUR CORPSES CASE TO REOPEN
KEY EVIDENCE FOUND

522
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,120
[reporter] Besides the pictures that
you're seeing, there's also an audio clip.

523
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,240
The voice in the clip
allegedly belongs to Mr. Songkiat,

524
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,760
who is Minnie's father.

525
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,000
It appears that he was threatening
this anonymous person

526
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,080
not to leak the photos
that we are currently showing you.

527
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,520
[Songkiat] I'm only paying you once.

528
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,800
If these pictures ever show up again,

529
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,280
I won't be able to guarantee your safety.

[Yuri] From now on,

531
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,600
Mr. Songkiat…

532
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,800
won't be able to help out
his precious daughter.

There's only one way to end this hell.
