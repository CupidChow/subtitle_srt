1
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,175
How about we set work hours?

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,344
Can we really do that for making dramas?

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,264
-Let's just set the time first.
-Why?

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,559
We will just focus on work

5
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,561
during those hours.

6
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,646
Then I want to do something romantic

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,899
before and after work.

8
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,194
I think it'd be great
to have exact boundaries.

9
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,448
Does something sweet

10
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:15,825
have anything to do with me?

11
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,706
It has everything to do with you.

12
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,212
Now is the time
after getting off work, right?

13
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,671
Sure.

14
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,975
When he holds my hand,

15
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:44,646
I somehow feel comfortable.

16
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,941
I feel like I can hug him

17
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,401
and I won't regret anything.

18
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:55,949
I mean dating is all about
the process of breaking such trust.

19
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,286
Gosh, why would you say that again?

20
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,541
There's also a time
of restoring the broken trust.

21
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,959
That's dating, too.

22
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,378
You're thinking long-term, aren't you?

23
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,546
But the thing is,

24
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,049
I want to do only the sweet things now.

25
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,135
But something unexpected has happened.

26
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,389
I think it's good to go to work
in the morning.

27
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,224
Walking makes me feel good.

28
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,559
I'm walking too.

29
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,436
-I'm going to your office.
-Okay.

30
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:27,522
-Did you have breakfast?
-No.

31
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,774
I'm bringing some cherry tomatoes.

32
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,319
I see. I'll buy some bread
and milk on the way.

33
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,654
What kind of bread do you like?

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,197
Loaf bread.

35
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,824
Then I'll buy eggs too.

36
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,285
-I'll see you at the office.
-Okay.

37
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,843
I like loaf bread

38
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,308
I like milk too

39
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,522
I also like eggs

40
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,984
Delicious protein and calcium.

41
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:16,321
But if I keep eating, I'll keep farting.

42
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,698
How? Like this.

43
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,453
Then I should turn on the air purifier.

44
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,880
Why are you there?

45
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,050
I'm sorry. I was going to play a prank.

46
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,427
It was a bad idea.

47
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,804
And I didn't hear anything.

48
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,014
Don't lie to me.

49
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,475
Even a neighbor in the next door
would've heard it.

50
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,394
It's nothing. It's no big deal.

51
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,022
I once farted when you were around.

52
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,941
-It's okay.
-Don't come close.

53
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,776
I said it's no big deal.

54
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,195
It's just a sound.

55
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,446
It doesn't even smell.

56
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,994
I can't believe it.
It starts running all of a sudden?

57
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,378
I said don't come close.

58
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,719
We still have five minutes left
before we start.

59
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,641
I'll come back at nine.
And everything will be okay.

60
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,113
What? It feels a little too soon.

61
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,408
But it's something that lovers will
eventually have to compromise.

62
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,452
I don't think it's bad
to start it this way.

63
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,371
Gosh, I just don't like it.

64
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,041
Farting in around someone
you love is no good.

65
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,169
If it's something you can hide,
you better hide it.

66
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,005
I don't like it either.

67
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,881
But it just got laid bare.

68
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,009
Is it something to be serious about?

69
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,803
I'm serious. I really hate it.

70
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,889
So why did you fart
while putting eggs in the fridge?

71
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:07,974
Wait.

72
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,602
Are you sure it sounded like that?

73
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,646
Be honest.

74
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,774
Was it this cute sound?

75
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,236
Are you sure
it didn't sound a little dirty?

76
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,536
What sound was that?

77
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,497
It's a little hard to make

78
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,708
with my mouth.

79
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,585
Is it really something that serious?

80
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:38,087
She says it wasn't something
she can describe with her mouth.

81
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,630
That changes everything.

82
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:42,341
It's just a sound caused
by the vibration of a sphincter.

83
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,802
It doesn't matter how it sounds.

84
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,971
That's the sound. How did you know?

85
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,391
What? What did I do?

86
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,185
Gosh, that's not it.

87
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,187
Do it again.

88
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:58,024
I don't know. Why does it even matter?

89
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,487
It's a fart. That's what
we're talking about.

90
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,491
So what did Mr. Son say?

91
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,706
About the gas fairy you just let out.

92
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,792
It's inevitable
in the process of digestion.

93
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,251
And it has to be expelled.

94
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,253
-Stop it.
-If you hold it back,

95
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,089
the gas will be accumulated in your bowels

96
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,840
-and cause abdominal inflation.
-That's enough.

97
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,550
Some of the gas will be
resorbed to your blood

98
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,344
and released through your breath.

99
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,430
-So what?
-We need to be cool about it.

100
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:32,433
-I don't want to.
-Holding back your fart?

101
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,435
Doesn't it sound like an obvious lie?

102
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,229
Everyone knows we fart,

103
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,272
but we hide it and let it out in secret.

104
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,566
Sometimes you even get caught farting
and feels embarrassed.

105
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,651
Why would you do that?

106
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,277
Today was an accident.

107
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,238
Accidents are meant to be prevented!

108
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:47,031
Okay. Fine. Don't get upset.

109
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,616
The old saying "Farters blame the fart

110
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,034
on the bystanders" seem to fit this--

111
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,577
What did you just say?

112
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,122
I didn't say anything.

113
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,748
He's just a man.

114
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,210
He approaches the problem rationally.

115
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:00,670
But he can't say,

116
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,840
"Jin-joo, even your fart sounds lovely."

117
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,592
It's not that I want
an emotional approach.

118
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,679
It can be really annoying if it stinks.

119
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,976
Hey, why are you lost in thought again?

120
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,394
I mean it's good.

121
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,897
If you love someone, you just like
whatever the person does.

122
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,275
But there are things
that still bother you.

123
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,778
You should be careful
about the things that bother you.

124
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,822
There are times when you have a fight

125
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,782
and you don't even remember

126
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,034
what it was about after a while.

127
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,704
In most of the cases,
you weren't cautious enough

128
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,706
about the things that can be bothering.

129
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,959
Fine. Let's be rational then.

130
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,170
A human being farts
about eight times a day.

131
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:45,339
You should hide it four times
and open it the other four times, okay?

132
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,594
It might sound reasonable, but...

133
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,679
Farting is like a goalie.

134
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:54,765
Even if you block seven shots,
you might lose if you fail to block one.

135
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,894
So is there a conclusion to this?

136
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:01,355
Yes. I erased his memories
when we went for a walk

137
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,900
-after dinner.
-What?

138
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:08,237
Let's erase our memories
and start all over.

139
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:11,073
Do we have to do that?
I already heard and smelled it.

140
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,909
Gosh, don't say that.

141
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,453
Let's not be like this.
When we feel like fart,

142
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,706
why don't we hug each other
and let it out warmly?

143
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,917
Don't be ridiculous.

144
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:25,087
I don't want you to think that I'm farting
when I hug you out of affection.

145
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,173
I guess that's not good.

146
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,968
Okay.

147
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,308
Let's erase the memories and start over.

148
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,144
This is...

149
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,980
My gosh.

150
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,944
-What? It's gone.
-What?

151
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,946
-Your fart.
-It's not done yet.

152
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,864
It hurts.

153
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,160
-Your temple?
-Does it really help

154
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,412
erasing my memories?

155
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:06,170
The day we fought and got sick

156
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:11,133
You went to the bathroom
And made the sound

157
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,145
-Are you writing a song?
-Yes. I was bored.

158
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,483
-It's already titled "It Still Stinks"?
-I recently watched a short film,

159
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,195
which inspired me greatly.
It's the title of that movie.

160
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,407
What about it was so inspiring to you?

161
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,784
The husband fails in business.

162
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,537
And he has a fight with his wife
the day before they move.

163
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,872
He goes number two in the bathroom

164
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,916
and ends up making up with his wife
while smelling it.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,751
What is this? B-grade comedy?

166
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,962
No. It's a beautiful love story.

167
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,886
What the... What's with the lyrics?

168
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,806
"The day we fought and got sick,

169
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,267
you went to the bathroom
and made the sound, boom, boom."

170
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,438
-What is this?
-Why? What's wrong?

171
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,816
It's so cute.

172
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,445
It reminds me of my ex-boyfriend.

173
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,948
We had a huge fight over a fart.

174
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,454
-Is the ex-boyfriend happen to be--
-Right.

175
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,165
It's him.

176
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,750
I see.

177
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,294
I guess he really hated it.

178
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:31,213
He hated it so much.

179
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,508
It doesn't matter anymore.

180
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,054
I want to send him a message
with this song.

181
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,641
That the smell will eventually go away.

182
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:51,025
Let me hear it once it's done.

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,409
Take it easy. You might get sick.

184
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,662
I get off work right on time. Don't worry.

185
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,456
And I don't eat a lot here.

186
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,084
Don't bring stuff to eat.
I'll just end up throwing them out.

187
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,503
Don't eat out.
All you need to do is cook rice.

188
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:15,132
And I'm dating Director Son. It's serious.

189
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,093
What?

190
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,054
What do you mean?

191
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:23,474
He's a director while I'm at work.
And he's my boyfriend after work.

192
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,145
How could you talk about
something so huge so casually?

193
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,439
It's not something huge.

194
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:35,403
It must've been
a difficult decision for him.

195
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,365
Why would he want to date you?

196
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:43,744
I think he's dating me
because of my looks.

197
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,664
-Is it even possible?
-Sure.

198
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,918
Bring him home.

199
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,379
I feel bad for him.
I should cook him a meal.

200
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,215
-You feel bad?
-Yes.

201
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,552
I don't fart.

202
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,930
So why? For your whole life?

203
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,726
I don't know why.

204
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,772
It just feels natural that way.

205
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,192
But I don't remember

206
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,652
why it feels natural.

207
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,990
You've never farted even once?

208
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,576
I just don't make a sound.

209
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,665
Then it means Dad has never heard

210
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:31,500
your fart his whole life.

211
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:32,793
That's right.

212
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,837
But Dad farts.

213
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,756
I know. But we're the older generation.

214
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,760
Try farting.

215
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,515
-What?
-Try farting around Dad.

216
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,698
Why?

217
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,160
You seem concerned.

218
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,663
I just can't hide my feelings, can I?

219
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:13,125
No. But you look just the same
whether you're concerned

220
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,669
about little things or big things.

221
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,505
What does that mean?

222
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,675
For example, you look the same
when you decide what to eat

223
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,346
and when you work on a budget

224
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,680
for billions of won.

225
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,600
-Do I really do that?
-Yes.

226
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,479
You're like a philanthropist who loves

227
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,772
all kinds of concerns equally.

228
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,403
I do hate discrimination.

229
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,781
But this sounds a little weird.

230
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,119
So what's your concern?
As your subordinate,

231
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,705
I'd like to help you find a solution
at least once.

232
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,374
It's about the casting matter.

233
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,460
Cheon I-seul is holding back for too long.

234
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,047
Whether she will work with us or not,

235
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,216
I just want her
to give us an answer quickly.

236
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,218
We just can't move onto the next stage.

237
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:07,221
You're right. She should give us
an answer quickly.

238
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,559
I wonder why something important like this
can't be absolute manners.

239
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:12,810
It's just too bad.

240
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,571
What are you doing?

241
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,449
I want to resolve it for you,
but there's nothing I can do.

242
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,451
So I'm just casting a spell.

243
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:34,248
Give us a call. Call us right now.

244
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,252
-Call and say that you'll do it.
-What?

245
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,214
It's from Cheon I-seul's agency.
Excuse me.

246
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,509
Hello, sir.

247
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,553
Yes.

248
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,223
Yes. Okay, then.

249
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,767
I'll call you back soon.

250
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,811
Bye.

251
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,613
Yes. All right. Okay.

252
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,574
Thank you. Bye.

253
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,792
This is so exciting

254
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:29,178
Ms. Lee. I got a call
from Cheon I-seul's agency.

255
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,596
Gosh, finally. What did they say?

256
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,515
She wants to meet
with the director and the writer.

257
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,434
It means we're almost there, right?

258
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,645
We should meet and convince her.

259
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,523
Call the director and arrange a meeting
as soon as possible.

260
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:44,985
Okay. And what do we do about Lee So-min?

261
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:48,197
The president of her agency
called us first.

262
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,490
Ask the director

263
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,909
and arrange a meeting if he likes her.

264
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,868
Okay.

265
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,886
Call me. Give me a call now.

266
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,518
HA-YUN

267
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,569
Okay. That's good.

268
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,740
Set it whatever time is good
for you and let me know.

269
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,495
Okay.

270
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,504
I guess we'll be casting Cheon I-seul.

271
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,256
I see.

272
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,883
But why do you look like
we didn't get her?

273
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,679
-I'm just nervous.
-About what?

274
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,766
How many difficulties do you think
we face while producing a single drama?

275
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,351
-Big ones or small ones?
-All together.

276
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,270
-3,600 times.
-Exactly.

277
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,940
But it feels like things are
going smoothly this time.

278
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,319
Why do we feel nervous
when things go smoothly?

279
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,448
A drama is like dating.

280
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,367
It's no fun when there's no crisis.

281
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:18,454
When it's not fun, it gets canceled early.

282
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,248
So I'm nervous. I'm afraid
that it will happen all at once.

283
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,375
It's okay. Just hang in there.

284
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,170
What's a director's job? It's hanging on.

285
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,381
Hold out and survive.
Just hang in there as you always do.

286
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,758
Whether it's a drama or dating.

287
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:33,677
Look at me. I'm hanging on so well.

288
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,973
You couldn't reach her yesterday again?

289
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,517
No.

290
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:44,646
She didn't pick up the phone after ten,
but she says she was asleep.

291
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,357
If she says she was, then she was.

292
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,110
Don't look at me like that. I'm fine.

293
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,654
I couldn't reach her for 16 hours.
So what?

294
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,157
It's no fun when there's no crisis.

295
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:57,326
I'm just holding out. That's all I can do.

296
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,412
Why did you lose so much weight?

297
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,375
I'm okay. I'm happy.

298
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,796
Beom-su, you should be happy too.

299
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,589
Why do you look so haggard?

300
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,102
Is he not here because he's busy
getting ready for the shoot?

301
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,354
I guess it's because of you.

302
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,941
He wouldn't want to see you.

303
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,026
He has to hold out.

304
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,570
If he does, everything will be all right.

305
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,284
All right.

306
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,246
Please tell us about So-min.

307
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,206
As a woman, person, and an actress.

308
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,166
She's honest.

309
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,503
Is it okay to talk casually like that?

310
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,547
I was just talking to myself.

311
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,507
Oh, okay.

312
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,552
Next question.

313
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,389
Is that all?

314
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,313
Is "she's honest" all you have to say?

315
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,398
Yes.

316
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,947
When did you first start
working with So-min?

317
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:22,953
Spring?

318
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,414
Was it spring?

319
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,624
What's with this jerk?

320
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,626
He either swears or is curt.

321
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,503
Is he doing this on purpose?

322
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,797
-He drinks cassia seed tea.
-Cassia seed?

323
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,633
-What about it?
-Do you know why?

324
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,038
I'm working now.

325
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,497
This isn't alcohol.

326
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,833
It's cassia seed tea.

327
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,034
Do you know

328
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,583
why I drink cassia seed tea?

329
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,593
I don't think I do. But maybe...

330
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,056
Because it's good for your eyes?

331
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,779
It's savory.

332
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,241
Because it's savory.

333
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,292
So what?

334
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,295
Isn't cassia seed tea bitter?

335
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,630
Is it savory? Let me take a look.

336
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:42,467
I can tell what people are like
just by looking at their eyes.

337
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
Let me see.

338
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,557
He's a successful commercial director.

339
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,641
Why is his office so shabby?

340
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,060
I don't know. I bet
he makes a lot of money.

341
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,314
He doesn't seem like
the humble type, though. Anyway.

342
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,108
I bet he loses money in gambling.
That's how he looks.

343
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,568
-How old is he?
-Thirty-four.

344
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,653
-He seems to have broad shoulders.
-He does.

345
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:02,821
-What about his height?
-Tall.

346
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,573
I can tell what type of guy he is.

347
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,241
-Your type?
-Yes.

348
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,951
He's so cute.

349
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,329
If he says it's savory, it's savory.

350
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:15,042
I don't mind gambling
as long as he doesn't lose my money.

351
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,960
Women like you are the reason

352
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,296
that bad guys don't stop being bad.

353
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,548
All right. Let's go to work.

354
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,013
She just arrives at the hair salon.

355
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,349
She just gets off the car.

356
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,229
-Hello.
-Hello.

357
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,398
She just says hello.

358
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,359
She just gets her hair done.

359
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,947
What?

360
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,491
I've thought about it.

361
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,993
Don't you think this documentary
will be so boring?

362
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,536
Why? Are you worried?

363
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,457
Everything is just so predictable.

364
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,292
What I think and how I work.

365
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,087
The only place I go to is a hair salon.

366
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,297
It's not even a beauty show.

367
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,841
It doesn't always have to be fun.

368
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,635
I know what you're saying,

369
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,971
but I'm a commercial actress.

370
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,099
I'm not trying to deny it.

371
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,101
So what? What do you want to do?

372
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,103
When we're together like this,

373
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,938
I should talk about Min-jun.

374
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,357
You could also shoot videos
of us being lovey-dovey.

375
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,566
-What?
-What do you think?

376
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,985
-What are you trying to do?
-Isn't it obvious?

377
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,572
We can add some of my love story.

378
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:30,534
People will like it
only when there's some romance.

379
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,660
Can we really do that?

380
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,288
No, we can't. But who knows?

381
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,458
I might get married to him
before the documentary is released.

382
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,709
I can do that.

383
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,294
My gosh.

384
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,005
I guess you like Min-jun a lot.

385
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,216
If I didn't, I wouldn't have dated him.

386
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,180
Then let me ask you my first
official question about Min-jun.

387
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,307
This is exciting. Go ahead and ask it.

388
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,684
Do you fart around each other?

389
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,189
What? Is it your first question?

390
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,693
Well...

391
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,530
That's one intense question.

392
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,784
But what's there to ask?

393
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,869
What?

394
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,163
Because I don't fart.

395
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,709
-You don't fart?
-No.

396
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,127
I didn't see this coming.

397
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,337
I'm serious.

398
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,564
I'm sorry. I went to the bathroom,

399
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,400
but I can't control what's happening
inside of my body.

400
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,360
We should be more careful
when we're in the car.

401
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,196
Okay. I'm sorry.

402
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,199
He intercepts your fart?

403
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,453
Was it part of his work or love?

404
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,079
Love.

405
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,207
That's one intense love.

406
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,710
As long as I'm with him,
I can live without farting.

407
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,212
Good for you.

408
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,757
So where are you going

409
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,175
after dressing yourself up like this?

410
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,344
I'm going to fight with the president.

411
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:16,014
You go to a hair salon
to fight against the president?

412
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,183
I need him to see with his own eyes

413
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,393
how amazing of a person I am.

414
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,980
You're amazing. I know that.

415
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,273
Of course I do.

416
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,652
But what? I'm only 32 now.

417
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,528
Why do you want me to play a mom?

418
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,947
I just can't help it.

419
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,699
It's not like I go around
asking people for mom roles.

420
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,618
It's not just a mom of a baby.

421
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,495
It's a mom with a teenage kid.

422
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:41,081
The drama is about school violence.

423
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,166
Do you want me to ask the writer

424
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,585
to change it into a story
about kindergarten violence?

425
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,420
Why should I be a mom of a teenager?

426
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:48,546
Do you want to be a teenager?

427
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,756
Why not?

428
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,424
I look young for my age.

429
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,509
Seon-mi.

430
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,386
You're a good actress.

431
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,805
You really are, but you don't look young.

432
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,183
Okay. Fine. I'll tell them no.

433
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,643
How could you say that as a president?

434
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,186
How could you say that to a president?

435
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,114
Hello, Seon-mi.

436
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,824
Hi. Carry on.

437
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,710
I told you to wait a few days.

438
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,712
I shouldn't accept
a supporting role right away.

439
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,380
What would they think of me?

440
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:34,384
There are a lot of rookie actresses
who want to play the role.

441
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,429
If you lose that role,
what would you think of me?

442
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,807
Why would I lose the role?
Am I worse than a rookie actress?

443
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,561
That's not what I mean. What if
they sign a contract with someone else?

444
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,480
-Then I should play the main role.
-Cheon I-seul is doing it.

445
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,482
Even if she wants to do it,
you should get me the role.

446
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,528
Am I the director here?
Do you think that's my drama we're making?

447
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:54,863
Can't you do that as a president?

448
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,949
So-min, you're a good actress.

449
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,660
But I can't buy you a drama.

450
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,997
Stop it. So you're not doing it, okay?

451
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,457
How could you say that as a president?

452
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,916
How could you say that to a president?

453
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,629
I'm glad that I decided not to do

454
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,049
a management agency.

455
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,886
I think he is

456
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,972
one of the pathetic ones out there.

457
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:28,438
It's better to yell and fight.

458
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,856
Some actors

459
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:33,943
pretend to be nice and obedient
in front of me,

460
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,654
but they suddenly move to another agency.

461
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,408
They say goodbye over a text message.

462
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,370
Are there people like that?

463
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,580
I've been in this industry for 20 years.

464
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,624
This is nothing.

465
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,043
I don't smoke, but I smolder inside.

466
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,296
But it's nothing. It's like...

467
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,714
Damn it.

468
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,509
I'm lonely.

469
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,137
Are you crying?

470
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,730
The shooting will begin soon.
You shouldn't be doing this.

471
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,444
You're the one who called me out.

472
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,321
You come out every time I call you.

473
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,365
Anyway,

474
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,742
Hwan-dong is doing a good job, right?

475
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,957
The problem is he's trying to be perfect.

476
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,795
He might melt down one day.
You should give him some advice.

477
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:37,173
Young people these days don't like advice.

478
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,009
They don't respect our generation.

479
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,471
But my assistant writers respect me.

480
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,600
That's a sad joke.

481
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,729
I'm lonely.

482
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,565
It gets lonely, indeed.

483
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,860
You have two dogs.

484
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:00,613
Oh, right. I should go feed my dogs.
I should get going.

485
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,659
-How much is it?
-Fifty-four thousand won.

486
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,120
-Did you include the soda?
-Yes.

487
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,665
We drank three bottles of soju, not two.
You took a bottle earlier.

488
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,834
That's right. It's 58 thousand won.

489
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,045
That's right. You should be careful. Bye.

490
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,715
That damn jerk.

491
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,259
Ms. Jung.

492
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,845
Mr. So.

493
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,514
Are you here alone?

494
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,058
Yes. My friend just left.

495
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,269
I came alone too. May I join you?

496
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,021
Sure.

497
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,067
By the way, why are you alone?

498
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,737
I have no one to hang out with me.

499
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,158
People should be good at playing alone.

500
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,787
It's not like I'm good at it.
I'm just alone anyway.

501
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,205
Thank you.

502
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,916
By the way, are you a cyborg?

503
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,459
Of course not. Why?

504
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:55,710
You never seem to get old.

505
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,045
You haven't changed a bit.

506
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,047
Gosh, stop it.

507
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,800
I have wrinkles on my face.

508
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,177
A bunny is still a bunny
even when she has wrinkles.

509
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,891
-"A bunny"?
-You do look like a bunny.

510
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,229
-What's going on?
-Mr. Sung.

511
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,816
So you're the one who just left.

512
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,150
I went to the restroom.

513
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,694
Gosh, it's been years.

514
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,072
-Why have you gotten so old?
-Like how?

515
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:27,534
In general. You should
be the president now.

516
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:37,001
By the way, you become more handsome

517
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,711
as you grow older.

518
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,673
You look like Antonio Banderas.

519
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,008
From The Legend Of Zorro.

520
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:50,223
"Zorro is everywhere."

521
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,559
And Ms. Bunny is only right
in front of me.

522
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,687
Is he crazy?

523
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,991
Are you crazy?

524
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,083
Hey, Zorro.

525
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,294
Come and catch me.

526
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,923
My beautiful villain, Montero Bunny.

527
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,676
Hop, hop, hop.

528
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,177
I have to hide.

529
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:32,348
Hop? You shouldn't be hopping.

530
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,726
You're too beautiful to hop.

531
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,770
No one has hopped like her ever before!

532
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,773
Is she an elk or a bunny?

533
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,651
I'm not an elk.

534
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,195
Is she a deer or a bunny?

535
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,908
I'm a bunny who wants Karaoke!

536
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,274
What do you think? Is it fun?

537
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,990
I'll try my best until the end.

538
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,700
I guess it's not fun.

539
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,870
I can't say it's not fun.

540
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,125
It feels like something's missing.

541
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,129
But I don't know what it is.

542
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:49,258
You're being too good,
so there's nothing missing.

543
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,678
Maybe that's why it feels like
something's missing.

544
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,887
No way.

545
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,807
It wouldn't feel like that
if it was perfect.

546
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,644
I sometimes felt that way
when I saw you work.

547
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,814
Everything will be fine
because you're good.

548
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,857
Am I

549
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,236
really doing a good job?

550
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,409
Why do you not believe me?

551
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,579
You used to believe me.

552
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,404
Where's Eun-jeong?

553
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,948
She's editing.

554
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,535
What about Jin-joo?

555
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,537
She went to her room with some beer.

556
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,500
What? Is she making
a video call or something?

557
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,882
Gosh, seriously?

558
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:15,303
I see. All right then.

559
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,140
I should do it too.

560
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,278
-In-guk, do you want to go to bed?
-Let's go to bed.

561
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:35,782
Okay.

562
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:44,290
Aren't you excited or something?

563
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,502
This is your first meeting
with an actress.

564
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,796
I'm not that excited.

565
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,424
I guess she's prettier than I am, right?

566
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,228
I think you're finished with that.

567
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,316
It's empty. What are you swallowing?

568
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,569
Gosh, it's refreshing.

569
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,824
Once Cheon I-seul is cast,
we will be busy.

570
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,910
She may be prettier than me, right?

571
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,542
I'm going to kill you.

572
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,270
-Did you have a good sleep?
-Yes. Did you?

573
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,489
-Hello.
-Hello.

574
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,324
-Hello.
-This way, please.

575
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,951
-Are they here yet?
-Yes.

576
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,290
-Hello.
-Hello.

577
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,461
He's the director, and she's the writer.

578
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,839
-Hello.
-Hello.

579
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,633
As you know, this is Cheon I-seul.

580
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,720
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you. Please have a seat.

581
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,349
We are not late, are we?

582
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,518
No. We came early.

583
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,938
I liked it because it's like a sitcom.

584
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,773
I mean, in a good way.

585
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,444
That's what we intended.

586
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:37,904
You're right about that.

587
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,239
The characters are fun,

588
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,116
and the lines are interesting.

589
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,869
But I'm a little worried though.

590
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,873
I'm the main character,
but she doesn't seem to have history.

591
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,458
It might look immature.

592
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,754
That's because the main character
has a clear goal.

593
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,715
She has an external goal as a writer

594
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,468
and an internal goal
she's trying to achieve through that.

595
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,888
She's the person who leads the story

596
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,849
and introduces the pains
of surrounding characters.

597
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,101
If she shows her growth that way,

598
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:12,355
I believe it will move people's hearts
in a simpler way later on.

599
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,649
-Oh, right. Mr. Son.
-Yes?

600
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:16,192
I look better from the left.

601
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,401
What? All of a sudden?

602
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,195
It just came to my mind all of a sudden.

603
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,157
So suddenly, yes.

604
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,535
You look better from the left.

605
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,295
Hello.

606
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:38,005
Oh, you're here.

607
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,548
This way.

608
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,509
-He's our director of photography.
-I see.

609
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,136
-He's the lighting director.
-Hello.

610
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,972
-It's hot, isn't it?
-Yes, it is.

611
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,390
Thank you for coming.

612
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,725
Let's go to the meeting room then.

613
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,227
They're just here to say hi.

614
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,229
Let's go to the meeting room,
I mean, the lounge.

615
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,314
-Okay. Fine.
-Shall we go?

616
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,568
This is our reference.

617
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,195
What we talked about earlier.

618
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,369
This one. This is it.

619
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,371
The camera should go under

620
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,164
and follow him.

621
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,582
-It's something like this.
-I see.

622
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,543
There you go again.

623
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:19,380
They specially made the equipment
to shoot this scene.

624
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,923
We can make one too.

625
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,718
This movie's budget was 200 billion won.

626
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,928
Why would you want something
from a Hollywood movie?

627
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,557
Why would you refer to an action movie
when you're shooting romantic comedy?

628
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,977
What's the budget
for this drama? How much?

629
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,520
What?

630
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:41,360
It's a little lower than this movie.

631
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,778
A little? Is it like

632
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,240
A little less than 200 billion won short?

633
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,286
It's a little lower than that.

634
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,831
There's no way we can do this.

635
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,792
Why not? What kind of people are we?

636
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,337
What kind of people?

637
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,589
We're people of delivery food.

638
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,923
That's right.

639
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,260
Damn it. I'm hungry.

640
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,262
Seriously.

641
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:20,733
Park Seo-joon, Jang Ki-yong,
Nam Joo-hyuk, Park Bo-gum,

642
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:22,526
Jung Hae-in, and Yang Se-jong.

643
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,070
Can we cast those actors?

644
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,321
No. We can't.

645
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,740
They are busy,

646
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,451
and the main characters
of our drama are women.

647
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,870
Then why are you naming them?

648
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,413
I'm just saying.

649
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,582
Why are you just saying that?

650
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:41,128
Jung Woo-sung, Gang Dong-won,
Ha Jung-woo, and Lee Byung-hun.

651
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,671
-Can we cast them?
-No.

652
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,590
Then why are you talking about them?

653
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,636
If we say names like this
before starting a project,

654
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,388
it brings us good energy.

655
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,932
What are you talking about?

656
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,228
-Gong Yoo?
-My gosh.

657
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,397
-All right, Gong Myung.
-I love him.

658
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,400
-I like him.
-My head hurts.

659
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,366
Stop. This is the concept
for Ju-yeon's house.

660
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,617
This is our reference.

661
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,286
Once you give us your opinion,
we will make revisions accordingly.

662
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,122
We don't need revisions.

663
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,791
I think we have to start over.

664
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:19,959
This is just a reference.

665
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:22,461
We should drop the whole idea.

666
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:25,923
Ju-yeon is a fickle character.

667
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,176
Do you think that matches her?

668
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,469
A characterful girl like Ju-yeon

669
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,179
would have sofa and furniture like this?

670
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,723
That's just what you can see
in any interior design magazine.

671
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,350
It's just a reference.

672
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,602
Stop saying that it's just a reference.

673
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:42,231
I mean, we will just refer to it.

674
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,905
I'm not saying I don't know the word.

675
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,038
What is this?

676
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,332
About the psychiatric treatments.

677
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,251
The data on psychological treatments.

678
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,503
-You should summarize it.
-I did.

679
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,011
I see.

680
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,598
Once I finish this, I'll make a doctor.

681
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,892
I guess you're more
likely to become a patient.

682
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,395
Thank you. You worked hard for this.

683
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,814
I'm so happy.

684
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,463
We will put these away first.

685
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,589
Move them.

686
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,678
Mr. Son, watch carefully. This is a scene
where Dong-u and Gyeong-jae fight.

687
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,722
We should show you a video of this,

688
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,767
but we wanted to get your confirmation
first. Just see how it goes.

689
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,018
Here we go.

690
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,895
I'm Gyeong-jae and he's Dong-u.

691
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,397
Okay. Wait.

692
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,775
You should do it while acting.

693
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,443
-You read the script.
-Okay.

694
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,694
All right. Do it again.

695
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,322
-You jerk.
-That's right.

696
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,074
He comes and Gyeong-jae flips him over.

697
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:18,911
So Gyeong-jae gets Dong-u on the floor

698
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,871
and gets him in an arm bar...

699
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:23,457
-Hey, move your arm a little.
-Okay.

700
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,750
I'll just pull on it.

701
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,043
Okay, arm bar.

702
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:29,672
So it's an arm bar, but Dong-u
manages to get out of it.

703
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,675
Gyeong-jae grabs him again

704
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,176
and triangle...

705
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,804
Damn it. Lower your head a little.

706
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:37,721
Okay.

707
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,310
Gyeong-jae takes him down like this.

708
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,980
The triangle choke is the point here.

709
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,524
-Sir.
-Yes?

710
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,359
-Director.
-Yes?

711
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,695
Gyeong-jae and Dong-u are
drama directors here.

712
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,655
Why would they suddenly do jujitsu?

713
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,907
A lot of people do jujitsu these days.

714
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,742
What's wrong with you?

715
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,120
How would they do the triangle choke?

716
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,872
I thought it would be
a little far-fetched.

717
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:05,749
-We did, right?
-Sure.

718
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:08,586
So we prepared something else.

719
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,504
-Bring it.
-Okay.

720
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,006
Watch.

721
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,009
Ready.

722
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,802
Head, head.

723
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,138
Head and straight to the stomach.

724
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,558
So this is what would've happened
if they learned kendo.

725
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,268
The quick moves are the point here.

726
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,978
Quick moves...

727
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,731
I'm glad it's not archery or gunning.

728
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,153
Watch it again. Hey, come here.

729
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,739
Let's do it again. All right.

730
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,825
-Are you okay?
-Did you not read the script?

731
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,243
Gosh, what's going on?

732
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:43,120
Am I dreaming or what?

733
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,681
Mr. Son.

734
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:05,768
I'm sorry to say this
when you have a headache.

735
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,854
But you need to decide the music director.

736
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,022
Okay.

737
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:14,443
I don't think Kim Tae-seong's
schedule will be available.

738
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,738
Then could you get me a list of directors?

739
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,822
Sure.

740
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:25,746
What do you think of Jeon Jo Mun-su?

741
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,873
He's been getting favorable reviews
with his recent works.

742
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,000
You mean Jeon Jo Mun-su from Plan D?

743
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,210
Yes.

744
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,253
Okay. I'll think about it.

745
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,089
Sure.

746
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,637
It's finally out.

747
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,643
We finally have the revised script
of episode seven.

748
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,853
It feels like editing
takes even more time.

749
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,857
Haruki is amazing.

750
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,318
What? Haruki?

751
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:59,905
-Haruki, all of a sudden?
-A regular life.

752
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:02,574
He listens to classical music
in the morning,

753
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,493
rock music in the afternoon while jogging,

754
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,787
and finishes a fixed amount
of his work every day.

755
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,331
He listens to jazz with some beer

756
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,707
feeling happy after work.

757
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,043
Before going to sleep, he chooses

758
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,586
the classical music for the next morning.

759
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,925
If you want to become
a master of your field,

760
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,885
you must have strict self-discipline.

761
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,847
You've been speaking for long,
but I don't get your point.

762
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,809
I do like music,
I do have the will to exercise,

763
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:30,644
and knows the happiness beer brings.

764
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,938
So I tried a regular life like Haruki did.

765
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:35,149
-Congratulations.
-But I gave up in two days.

766
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,025
I drank too much beer.

767
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:39,778
I got carried away
by the happiness from beer

768
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,072
and drank over and over again.

769
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:45,075
It's just too hard to lead a regular life.

770
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:46,243
So I made a decision.

771
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:50,330
If that's the case, I don't
have to become a master.

772
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,958
-I'll just be plain good.
-You need to make a decision for that?

773
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,756
This is what I did to be plain good.

774
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,300
Don't expect it to be the best.

775
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,051
I'm so excited.

776
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,179
This is a script that's just plain good.

777
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,722
I'll enjoy it.

778
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,470
You know what?

779
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,351
When the script is good,
the drama is fun however it's directed.

780
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,859
It will be fun however it's directed.

781
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,321
My headache is gone.

782
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:20,170
All right. Let's go to eat.

783
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,341
Where shall we go?
Let's eat something delicious.

784
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:27,427
It's six o'clock. I'm getting off work.
Can we leave now?

785
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,846
Sure.

786
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:33,392
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Good work.

787
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:35,811
See you.

788
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,775
Gosh, it's hot already.

789
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,739
-How may I help you?
-Turn on the AC.

790
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,950
The AC is on.

791
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,411
Thank you.

792
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,915
I think Ms. Lim and Mr. Son
are really cool.

793
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,250
They really are.

794
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,920
They both look a little clumsy,

795
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:05,507
but if you take a close look at them,
you can see

796
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,593
that both their work and love life
are very stable.

797
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:11,305
I know. It could be uncomfortable
to work together.

798
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,223
But once they finish their work,

799
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,517
they make honest decisions
about their feelings,

800
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,853
and take responsibility
for their decisions.

801
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,605
They don't even sway.

802
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,523
And that's why
they don't have to hide anything.

803
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,859
I think that's
how they respect each other.

804
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:25,360
That's amazing.

805
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,738
Do you know what's even more amazing?

806
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,324
They don't actually know

807
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,659
that they're so amazing.

808
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,335
That's why they don't seem condescending.

809
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:43,629
They are pure in a way.

810
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,386
But don't pure things

811
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,348
break easily?

812
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,835
Yes.

813
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,508
-Why don't you reconsider?
-Pardon?

814
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,136
He said

815
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:37,683
-he wants you to reconsider.
-I see.

816
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:41,853
Even though we're working together now,

817
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,189
I'll make sure our relationship
won't affect our work.

818
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,410
How do we look?

819
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,578
Like an assailant and a victim.

820
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,581
-Am I the assailant?
-Of course.

821
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,875
-Thank you.
-I'll be the assailant.

822
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,796
I'll try to become an assailant of love...

823
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,589
Stop it.

824
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,514
Thank you so much

825
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,516
for welcoming me like this.

826
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,656
I bet Jin-joo caused a lot of trouble

827
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,199
when she was younger.

828
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,660
But I don't think you scolded her a lot.

829
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:42,122
Her mom did. She beat her up a lot.

830
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:44,958
So she got beaten up,
but she didn't learn her lessons.

831
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:53,049
When she was nine, she packed her stuff

832
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:54,760
after she got scolded by her mom.

833
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:57,846
So I asked, "Are you
running away from home?"

834
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,432
She said yes.
She couldn't take it anymore.

835
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:04,311
So I told her, "It's cold outside.
Why don't you behave yourself

836
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:07,773
so you won't get beaten up and stay home?"

837
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,025
And she said "I'm not sure
if I could do that, Dad."

838
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,360
That's very simple.

839
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,820
So did she run away from home?

840
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,990
Yes. She came back in two hours

841
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,950
and got beaten up again.

842
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:23,914
I can imagine her face. That's funny.

843
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,794
I bet she was reckless and mischievous.

844
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,969
-Mom.
-Yes?

845
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,971
-Did you do that?
-What?

846
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,600
-That?
-Yes.

847
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,813
I did. I tried hard.

848
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,314
You don't have to try it so hard.

849
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,556
I mean, I farted around him.

850
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,516
But he didn't seem to care.

851
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,226
I know it's no big deal,

852
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,979
but it was a little disappointing.

853
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:01,761
Later on, I even tried harder to fart
out of spite.

854
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,223
Why would you try so hard?

855
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,977
If I farted that often,

856
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,440
he should've asked me
if I wasn't feeling good or upset.

857
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,860
Don't you think that's
what he's supposed to do?

858
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,363
You're being too serious about it.

859
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,367
That's right. It was really serious.

860
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:27,329
-I mean, your dad.
-What?

861
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,960
After a few days of farting...

862
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:38,340
-You're home.
-Hey.

863
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,346
He can't even hold his liquor,
but he came home drunk.

864
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,058
Hey.

865
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,102
What is this?

866
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:56,816
FULL MEDICAL EXAMINATION

867
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,318
I made an appointment.

868
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,407
We made a promise.

869
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:08,244
Once our kids get married,
we will go to the countryside

870
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,833
and live with nature.

871
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:19,005
But if we lose one of us,

872
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,424
we can't live with nature.

873
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:23,885
I'll be there all alone.

874
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,814
Without you,

875
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:39,150
it's all meaningless to me.

876
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,864
Your dad's friend recently lost his wife

877
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,741
from cancer.

878
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,412
She kept farting, and it smelled horrible.

879
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,708
But he just criticized her
without knowing about her cancer.

880
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,005
Damn it. All I did was fart a few times.

881
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,882
But we ended up talking about death.

882
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,448
That's just what people of our age do.

883
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,661
Hey. Just keep farting.
If you want to see him for a long time.

884
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,926
All right. Let me sing the song.

885
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:58,730
The day we fought and got sick

886
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:02,984
You went to the bathroom
And made the sound

887
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,447
Boom, boom, boom

888
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:14,454
I liked everything about you

889
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,958
But I hated it so much that day

890
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:23,421
Boom, boom, boom

891
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,178
It still stinks

892
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:33,807
It's not your fault

893
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:35,391
Gosh, I ate too much.

894
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,185
Can we walk a little more?

895
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:38,895
Sure.

896
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,957
What are you doing?

897
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,841
What?

898
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,637
That's enough.

899
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,473
I know what this is about.

900
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,351
I really do. I think this is enough.

901
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:21,980
The air is so nice.

902
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,899
It is nice.

903
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,237
Let's not just do it in a row.

904
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,822
That's just too much.

905
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,783
I feel like getting attacked.

906
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,036
-Okay.
-Thank you.

907
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,205
Me too.

908
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,459
I'm safe now.

909
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,253
I spared your life.

910
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,464
Thank you so much.
You're the savior of my life.

911
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:07,734
It still stinks

912
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:11,362
It's not your fault

913
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,117
It's just smell
That eventually goes away

914
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:21,122
I'm sorry I hurt your feelings

915
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,000
It still stinks

916
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,883
It's only natural

917
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,947
Gosh, I'm not late.

918
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,121
-Hello.
-Hello.

919
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,639
Hello.

920
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,307
Hi.

921
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,157
Hello.

922
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:42,954
Hello, Ms. Lim. Everyone's here.

923
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,998
Mr. Son isn't here though.

924
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,375
I'll bring some coffee.
What would you have?

925
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,459
Coffee, please.

926
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,212
Okay. This way, please.

927
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,036
It's been a long time.

928
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,495
Hello.

929
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:29,334
Or should I be more formal?

930
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,756
Let's just keep it casual.

931
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,050
Hello.

932
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,635
Hello.

933
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:56,653
WHEN HE HOLDS MY HAND
I SOMEHOW FEEL COMFORTABLE

934
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:58,529
I FEEL LIKE I CAN COUNT ON HIM

935
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,281
I FEEL LIKE I CAN HUG HIM

936
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:03,326
AND I WON'T REGRET ANYTHING

937
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,537
I MEAN DATING IS ALL ABOUT
THE PROCESS OF BREAKING SUCH TRUST

938
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:13,252
I GUESS YOU LIKE MIN-JUN A LOT

939
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:18,091
IF I DIDN'T, I WOULDN'T HAVE DATED HIM

940
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,178
IT'S OKAY, JUST HANG IN THERE

941
01:01:22,261 --> 01:01:24,180
JUST HANG IN THERE AS YOU ALWAYS DO

942
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:27,684
WHETHER IT'S A DRAMA OR DATING

943
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:30,436
LOOK AT ME, I'M HANGING ON SO WELL

944
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,357
I'LL BE THE ASSAILANT

945
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,611
I'LL TRY TO BECOME AN ASSAILANT OF LOVE

946
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:43,741
You're a writer. You shouldn't go out
drinking, especially not with men.

947
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,618
Mr. Sung, are you jealous?

948
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:47,036
I'm the CP of this drama.

949
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,373
I have to protect my writer.

950
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,666
What happened to your chin?

951
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,793
A shaving accident.

952
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,129
You should pluck up your courage
at a time like that.

953
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:57,088
Who bought you that?

954
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,173
You don't use electric shavers
because your beard is soft.

955
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,466
Let's do something fun.

956
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,970
-Let us be bold and go somewhere far.
-Yes!

957
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,722
Let's go somewhere farther away next time.

958
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:08,307
Let's think and feel a lot of things.

959
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,560
It's time to find something
we wanted to find during the trip.

960
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,228
But I've already found it.

961
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,646
I'll give you an important mission.

962
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,273
Is he doing some kind of

963
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:17,442
community service here
to make up for his crimes?

964
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,110
I saved her.

965
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,737
That was very righteous of me.

966
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,448
Are you worried it might seem
like you're trying to get over him

967
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,199
and it would disappoint him?

968
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,660
-Can I give you a hug?
-Why would you hug me?

969
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,328
Because you're sad.

970
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,414
