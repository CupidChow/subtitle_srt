1
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:42,542
Anyway, to tell you the truth,

2
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,294
I'm seeing someone.

3
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,440
Seriously? So who is the guy?

4
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,942
Where did you meet him?
How long has it been?

5
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,487
Well, that's...

6
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,198
He's tall.

7
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,658
He's cute.

8
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,079
He's Jae-hun.

9
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,498
-It's Jae-hun?
-No.

10
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,458
I mean, he's the same age as Jae-hun.

11
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,127
-I see. A younger guy.
-I see. A younger guy.

12
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,212
And

13
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,465
remember that day?

14
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,425
When we went clubbing?

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,720
I told him that I was there with you guys.

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,807
But he came back and asked for my number.

17
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:44,312
When he asked,
his shoulders were so broad.

18
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,481
You gave your number for his shoulders?

19
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,191
I think I can kind of understand.

20
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,528
My head is spinning.
That was such shocking news.

21
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,154
She knows how to shock us.

22
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,572
My gosh, my head is spinning.

23
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,242
Well, I can't say that we are dating.

24
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,953
We're just texting each other.

25
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,123
Every day?
Even on your way to work in the morning?

26
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,375
When you're working during the day?
Before you go to sleep?

27
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,001
Probably.

28
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,795
They are dating.

29
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,088
-You're in a relationship.
-Really?

30
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,090
Byeong-sam and I text each other
all the time, too.

31
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:13,299
That's work.

32
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,052
Then, how many times
do you see him in a week?

33
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,888
We have a meal and drinks once a week.

34
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,891
-They're not in a relationship.
-They're not.

35
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,894
-We're not?
-It means you meet up regularly.

36
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,813
If you're not sure, you can just ask.

37
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,065
-That'd be confessing her feelings.
-Is that so?

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,316
-Right.
-Right.

39
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,361
Goodness.

40
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:38,116
You know, I wasn't going to ask
since this is just too childish.

41
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,450
Let's clear this up in one go.

42
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,870
How far did you go?

43
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,542
-Eyes.
-What?

44
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,002
We just exchanged eye contact.

45
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,882
Han-ju. No one will fall
for your innocent act anymore.

46
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,216
Just tell us.

47
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,596
-Gosh.
-I knew it.

48
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,556
That's it. It's settled.

49
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,724
You're in a relationship.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,601
It's settled.

51
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,104
No, listen.
But we didn't define the line yet.

52
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,939
That's okay. Just have fun with him.

53
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,191
-Good job.
-It's settled. That's all right.

54
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,820
Be quiet. Quiet down.

55
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,073
-Be quiet.
-Congratulations.

56
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,367
Nice.

57
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,207
There was a drama I liked.

58
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,836
Two main characters who loved each other

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,673
sacrificed their love first
to satisfy their own desires.

60
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,968
After going through
all kinds of hardships,

61
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:42,305
they lost everything and were back
to where they started before.

62
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,892
They fully realized how foolish
they had been for trying

63
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:48,519
to get something so small
in exchange for something so big.

64
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,814
They realized that their foolish act

65
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,525
was bound to happen again.

66
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,612
And they comfort each other
by saying the time gave them

67
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,655
the courage to start again.

68
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,493
This extremely unproductive process

69
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,079
that doesn't even help us
become a more mature person

70
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,957
is something most of the people around me

71
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,625
have gone through.

72
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,300
Watching dramas isn't educational at all,

73
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,097
so we end up becoming
the main character in the drama.

74
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,266
How foolish we are.

75
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,192
However,

76
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,362
we don't turn down
our desire to start again.

77
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,281
How brave we are.

78
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,125
Perhaps, our bodies

79
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,252
are bound to be one of these love types.

80
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,422
MELODRAMATIC SOYANG TYPE,
MELODRAMATIC TAEYANG TYPE,

81
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,507
MELODRAMATIC SOEUM TYPE,

82
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,801
AND MELODRAMATIC TAEUM TYPE

83
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,495
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,335
I told you that I loved you guys.

85
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,714
But look at this.

86
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,026
This is the last batch of cherry tomatoes.

87
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,654
-Why?
-They withered away

88
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,073
because I couldn't take care of them.

89
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,493
-You must be feeling guilty.
-A bit.

90
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,997
I lost them,
but I won't think of it as a failure.

91
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,666
We indeed had good times together.

92
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,335
Yes.

93
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,712
We can start again.

94
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:23,174
We can plant the seeds,
and wait until the sprouts grow.

95
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,469
The process that we go through
until the plant bears fruits

96
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,180
might seem a bit of a hassle to you,
but...

97
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,099
And it's hard to grow sprouts.

98
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,644
You're supposed to do it until they grow.

99
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,605
We can live without the cherry tomatoes.

100
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,316
But it's nice to have them.

101
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:44,112
This kind of emotion reminds me
of the last episode of Sandglass

102
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,323
when Hye-rin and U-seok
were scattering the Tae-su's ashes.

103
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,117
What's this fuss over cherry tomatoes?

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,326
Hye-rin.

105
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,620
U-seok.

106
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,622
Do you think they started again?

107
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,583
I feel like U-seok
has a wife he loves now.

108
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,710
And for some reason,
Hye-rin might be alone.

109
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:02,130
You know that we're in the middle
of the script meeting, right?

110
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,508
You guys are doing this
because you don't want to work.

111
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:08,803
She caught us.

112
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,390
Half of the things we talk about
during the script meeting are useless.

113
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,225
Chitchatting is the soil for inspiration.

114
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,727
And the pressure of the deadline
is lurking around during the meeting.

115
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,314
Shall we continue our meeting
while eating?

116
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,441
-Shall we?
-Yes.

117
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,986
So how's the preparation coming along?

118
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,195
This is the script meeting.

119
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,573
Given how pressed we are for time,
it's going smoothly.

120
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:30,158
Well, the staff has a lot of experience.

121
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,285
We're not experienced. Why don't we--

122
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,203
But I noticed this
when I was watching dramas.

123
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,456
They put so much effort
at the beginning of the drama,

124
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:39,125
but as the story progresses,
it gets a bit sloppy.

125
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,960
It's because they don't have much time.

126
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,295
But don't worry about that.

127
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,047
I figured out a plan
to prevent that from happening.

128
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,593
-I see.
-It will be a groundbreaking suggestion.

129
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,510
How?

130
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,513
To prevent the quality of the drama
falling later in the story,

131
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,891
we'll lower the quality of the drama
from the beginning.

132
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,481
My gosh. Goodness.

133
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,902
Gosh. How come no one has thought of this?

134
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:07,778
But you said

135
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,947
you wouldn't half-ass it
because you don't have time.

136
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,157
Ms. Lim.

137
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,785
For a marathon like a drama,

138
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,704
consistency means quality.

139
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,831
I knew it.

140
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,752
Directors don't look at the trees.
They look at the forest.

141
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,587
Ms. Lim, you told me

142
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,381
that you promised yourself
not to be the best.

143
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,134
I was so inspired when you said that.

144
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,427
I was truly impressed.

145
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,519
We're inspiring each other
to grow tremendously.

146
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,854
You inspire each other to deteriorate.

147
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,232
I get that you guys are tired,

148
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,109
but you can't go crazy yet. Both of you.

149
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:50,321
It's okay to be a bit crazy.

150
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,406
And yet, the earth still moves.

151
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,242
What the heck are you saying?

152
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,203
Let's talk about the script.

153
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,123
-Do you want to have some cake?
-I like that idea.

154
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,834
Bang, bang, bang.

155
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,630
Bang.

156
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,801
Bang.

157
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,303
It's a Yirgacheffe.

158
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,807
Discussion of the meeting,
cherry tomatoes.

159
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,684
Lower the quality from the start.

160
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,227
Cake. Didn't talk about the script.

161
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,479
We ought to discuss the script
outside the studio.

162
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,647
I agree.

163
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,525
I write all day in the studio.
It gets suffocating.

164
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,361
But why do we always come
to this coffee shop?

165
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,613
There's a reason.

166
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:38,077
The Melodramatic Soyang Type
thing in Episode ten?

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,662
I really liked that bit.

168
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,540
I came up with that spontaneously.

169
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:44,709
Really? I really liked it.

170
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:48,421
You're saying that at the end of the day,
it all comes down to types, right?

171
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,131
What happens to Choe, the team manager?

172
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,091
Is there an ending
you didn't write in the synopsis?

173
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,302
See? They were over the moon, right?

174
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,636
Yes.

175
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:01,017
When I saw how happy they were
after hearing that I was dating,

176
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,477
it sort of

177
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,981
made me pity myself.

178
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,360
"Is this something they should be
that happy about?

179
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,237
How have I living so far, then?"

180
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,489
Yes. It's exactly that.

181
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,371
People say that they are tired of dating,
but I guess it's still a good thing.

182
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,290
-What?
-When people hear that someone is dating,

183
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,208
no one worries about it first

184
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,085
except for special cases
like if you were dating

185
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,587
a foe of your family.

186
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,671
Is that so?

187
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,507
Hello.

188
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,052
-Hi.
-Hello.

189
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,850
-Would you like a cup of tea?
-No.

190
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,441
It's the coffee beans you like.

191
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,526
They'll start filming soon.
You must have a lot of work.

192
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,112
I'll hire more help
for the production team.

193
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,198
Don't overdo yourself. Okay?

194
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,075
Take it easy.

195
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,753
Why...

196
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,506
Why is she being so nice?

197
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,549
Is she leaving or something?

198
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,552
I got goosebumps.

199
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,437
You know why.

200
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,273
Please tell me.

201
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:36,529
Oh, my. It was supposed to be a secret,
but you got me.

202
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,949
Oh, my. I thought
we were supposed to share secrets.

203
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,785
Oh, my. Then, I must tell you.

204
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,297
Well, I'll tell you

205
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,967
what happened.

206
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,493
Honey.

207
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,955
So-jin just finished work.

208
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,459
Dang it. If you keep being grumpy wumpy,

209
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,043
I will bite you.

210
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,422
What do you mean where?
Of course, it will be your lips.

211
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,304
Did you say you missed me?

212
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:46,557
Okay. So-jin will be there soon.
Wait for me.

213
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,559
Okay. Bye.

214
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,854
I love you! Gosh!

215
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,402
Well, that's what she sounded like.

216
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,321
I tried my best to show you, but I can't.

217
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,490
Try using only half of your tongue.

218
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,911
"I'll be there soon. Wait for me."

219
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,079
That's not how she did it.

220
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,751
The sound couldn't have come
from a human being.

221
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,544
How long have they been dating?

222
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,131
It's been 50 days,
so they got promise rings.

223
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,343
How lovely.

224
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,228
I like it. I agree.

225
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:33,521
It's great.

226
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:36,941
Since this is a twist,
why don't we take it farther?

227
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,317
What? Like how?

228
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,860
Why don't they get promise rings?

229
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,654
They don't look like the type
who'd get that.

230
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:43,948
I like that.

231
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,158
Right. I had a question.

232
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,663
-Mr. Sung and Ms. Jung.
-Yes.

233
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:53,832
-Their romance wasn't in the synopsis.
-Yes.

234
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,334
What will happen to them?

235
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:20,651
How could she be so rude to me?
How could she?

236
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,328
Damn it.

237
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,248
My heart is pounding.

238
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,418
Gosh, I'm 50 years old.
What's happening to me?

239
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,837
This is embarrassing.

240
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,141
I mean...

241
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,019
How do we end up meeting here every day?

242
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,355
I guess you do go to tent bars often.

243
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,191
I like the sentiment of tent bars.

244
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:04,111
It tastes moderately bad, expensive,

245
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:05,738
and uncomfortable.

246
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,990
It's a good place to stay for a moment.

247
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,367
It's like lonely people
aren't being comforted

248
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,328
or taken advantage of.

249
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,331
It's like,
"Rest for a while here. Or not."

250
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,959
You're philosophical and sentimental.

251
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,713
This question might sound funny,

252
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,008
-but why are you still single?
-Pardon?

253
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,222
I am married.

254
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,976
What? I thought you lived alone.

255
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,938
I do because I sent her away.

256
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:44,902
Did she pass away?

257
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:48,030
No. She's in the States.

258
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,032
I work here alone to support my family.

259
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,997
So you're a father.

260
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,125
I only raise dogs.

261
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:23,232
You had a family to support abroad.

262
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,071
Do you want to get into a taxi?

263
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,782
Yes.

264
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,455
But

265
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,168
I think it might be better
if I could sober up more before I go home.

266
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
Then,

267
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,758
we should walk around a bit more
and get a taxi.

268
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,969
Right.

269
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,771
I didn't know you were so short.

270
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,481
What?

271
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,648
I didn't notice that

272
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,568
because you were like an Appalachian
black bear when you were yelling at me.

273
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,445
You're so short.

274
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,863
Stop right there

275
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,741
before the Appalachian black bear
sucker punches you in your gut.

276
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:59,244
You should think about your height.
My height is average.

277
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,288
Gosh, don't you know who I am?

278
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,540
I hugged a lot of women, so I can tell.

279
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,669
I'm sure you probably hugged
a lot of dogs.

280
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,840
-You know what?
-I don't want to know.

281
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,884
When I was young,
I got lost because didn't know better.

282
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,928
Nowadays, I get lost
because I pretend not to know.

283
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,306
Right. Let's stay clueless
for the rest of our lives.

284
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,684
That makes us look younger.

285
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,478
Right.

286
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,024
We're young.

287
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:32,945
Goodness.

288
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,337
-Is that it?
-Yes.

289
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,550
I don't know. Will they stay as
good friends for the rest of their lives?

290
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,387
Or will they face a day when
they will stop pretending to be clueless?

291
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,806
-So an open ending?
-Yes.

292
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,435
I want things to work out for them,
but what they have now isn't so bad.

293
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,937
Right. Exactly.

294
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,983
What about him?

295
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,236
Will he still be single?

296
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,409
All right. I studied them when I was
gathering information on horse riding.

297
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:21,827
I thought it'd be useful to you.

298
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:25,330
But our drama isn't about horse riding.

299
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,875
That's just the main character's hobby.

300
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,585
That's why we must
be extensively educated.

301
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,672
I reviewed the script for Episode 12.
I printed it out myself.

302
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:36,341
There were some parts
that seemed a bit random in the story.

303
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,801
I did fact-checking

304
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,095
and analyzed the emotions of the character
from Episode one.

305
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,055
And I added some of my ideas in it.

306
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,601
A review is your opinion about the drama.

307
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,604
How can it be longer
than the script itself?

308
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,230
It adds to the details, doesn't it?

309
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,067
Mr. Kim, don't you have hobbies
other than working?

310
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,277
I don't.

311
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,029
Why don't you date?

312
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,907
I married dramas.

313
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:04,953
So you're married.

314
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,915
Right. I started exercising.

315
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,583
It doesn't matter which exercise it is.

316
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,168
Doing it regularly is the most important.

317
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,755
To exercise regularly, being motivated
must be the most important, right?

318
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,549
Is there a goal that made you
want to exercise?

319
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,675
Yes.

320
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,095
I want to be good at arm-wrestling.

321
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,472
"Arm-wrestling"?

322
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,268
-You know this is a Pilates center, right?
-Yes.

323
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,897
I thought about my goal in terms of
modern anatomy and science of exercise.

324
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,565
I need to build my core first.

325
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,401
And building my muscles afterward
is my strategy.

326
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,195
I see.

327
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,030
For arm-wrestling?

328
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,574
Arm-wrestling. I'll beat him.

329
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,952
-Pardon?
-What?

330
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,913
Anyway, that's my plan.

331
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,456
First, relax your wrists.

332
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,749
-Okay.
-Shake your wrists.

333
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,378
Rotate your wrists inward.
Hold the bar and lift it.

334
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:55,462
All the way to the ceiling.

335
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,589
Relax your traps now.

336
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,383
And close your ribcage.

337
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,301
Close it. Inhale.

338
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,220
Use your abdominal muscles.

339
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,514
Tighten your muscles
when you come back up.

340
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,766
Two, three. Good job.

341
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,562
Thank you.

342
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,482
Hwan-dong.

343
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,485
-Yes?
-Do you follow a dietary plan?

344
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:20,904
Well, I try.

345
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:25,242
There's a new salad restaurant
in front of the studio. It's good.

346
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,245
If you eat a healthy meal,

347
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:31,039
I think you allow yourself
to have a glass of beer.

348
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,379
It's your friend's restaurant, isn't it?

349
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,922
Are you promoting it?

350
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,093
I'll go there with my staff some time.
Have a good day.

351
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,681
Well, he might be single
for the rest of his life.

352
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,351
No. Who knows?
He might meet a coach of his own.

353
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,483
Gosh, he's stimulating
the competitive side of me.

354
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,403
You think so?

355
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,280
Should I make it happen?

356
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,575
I wanted to see more
of her sister and her boyfriend.

357
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:07,909
They are cute.

358
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,037
Right.

359
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,963
If only one of us passes the exam,

360
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,009
and if one of us fails, will we break up?

361
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:27,137
If you study one more page instead of
thinking about that, you'll pass.

362
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,223
Don't say stuff my mom would say.
I'm serious.

363
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,644
Just eat.

364
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:41,568
If only one of us passes the exam,
why don't we both give up?

365
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,156
If you tell me that load of crap
in that serious tone,

366
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,200
I don't know how to respond to that.

367
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,170
Whatever happens, I'll take care of you.

368
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,800
-Jeong-hwan.
-Yes.

369
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,677
Take care of yourself.

370
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,931
If you can do that, I'll love you.

371
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,729
Really? Okay.

372
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:18,814
Eat up.

373
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,610
But they'll probably break up.
They are still young.

374
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,529
What kind of logic is that?

375
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,989
Her sister is a utilitarian.

376
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,366
Because she's utilitarian,

377
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,285
she'll know that protecting
her relationship will be beneficial.

378
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,498
When the relationship fails,
she won't even give it another chance.

379
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,041
She'll get married early in her life.

380
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,043
If her long-term relationship is over

381
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:41,711
in her 30s,

382
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,880
she's the type to marry a guy
from a blind date.

383
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,757
She'll probably marry a civil servant.

384
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,051
I don't want to hear that.
I won't listen to it.

385
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:52,139
They'll love each other until they die.
Just do that for me.

386
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:57,561
Then, let's wrap it up
where they make the empty promise.

387
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,563
-How about that?
-Come on.

388
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,692
And this couple.

389
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,570
They shouldn't make
their relationship public.

390
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,238
Let's just marry them off.

391
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,698
-All of a sudden?
-Yes.

392
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,033
"Even if he was held back a year...
Held back a year...

393
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,411
We're the same age."

394
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,708
-"Even if he was held--"
-You're studying the script hard.

395
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,085
Yes. I suck at memorizing.
I must read it 100 times.

396
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,962
Anyway, you're making an effort.

397
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:28,008
One time, I got my line wrong
12 times at a shoot.

398
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,551
My scene was the last one to film.

399
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:32,512
Because I kept getting it wrong,
the filming didn't end.

400
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,098
And it was one of the coldest days.

401
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,017
It was minus 20 degrees Celsius.

402
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,477
-You still filmed that day?
-Yes, as long as it doesn't rain.

403
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,898
Before I froze to death that day,

404
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,525
I thought I would die
from the scowls on the staff's faces.

405
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,069
They were scowling at me
like I should freeze to death right there.

406
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,779
That's when I promised myself
to make efforts.

407
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,163
I'm hungry.

408
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,956
-You're hungry?
-Let's eat first.

409
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:01,499
Jjajangmyeon? Should we get that?

410
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,876
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

411
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,297
Min-jun.

412
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,054
I'll kill her first.

413
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,138
What?

414
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,894
You're a head manager.
Why accompany her to the salon?

415
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,605
Our road manager couldn't make it.

416
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,608
So why you out of all people?

417
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,110
Because I'm diligent.

418
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,405
Do you want to diligently get beaten up?

419
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,997
That bitch asked for you, right?

420
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,083
You have so much passion
for your love life.

421
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,043
Aren't you tired?

422
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,799
Hello, Seon-ju.

423
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,717
Hi, So-min.

424
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:58,556
I can't get up right now.
I'm drying my nails.

425
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,226
I see. Do you need your nails to get up?

426
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,978
The rhinestones are heavy, you know.

427
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,938
Gosh, how heavy.

428
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:10,986
I hear congratulations are in order.

429
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:11,945
Oh, that.

430
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,447
An actress filming a movie
is nothing to celebrate.

431
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,824
I heard you're dating.

432
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,244
I did back then.

433
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,246
The last time I had a boyfriend
was 20 years ago.

434
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,622
I heard it's been two months.

435
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,083
And he's a baseball player.

436
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,167
I don't even know baseball.

437
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,211
-He's in the Giants.
-It's the Bears.

438
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,965
What? What do you want?

439
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,884
You tell me.
Should I get a tabloid reporter on you?

440
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,178
One that's good at keeping focus, perhaps?

441
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,806
Why would you do that?
We're both actresses. Stop it.

442
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,766
The CEO caught me with my ex-boyfriend.

443
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,310
He gave me an earful for that.

444
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,728
Didn't you last date 20 years ago?

445
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,979
Fine. It was a month ago.

446
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,981
You've been with your current boyfriend
for two months.

447
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,068
So-min, do you need something?

448
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,486
Min-jun is mine.

449
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,156
-What?
-I'm dating Min-jun.

450
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,867
What? My Min-jun?

451
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:02,912
I mean, Mr. Kim?

452
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,207
Address him properly.

453
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,173
Don't look at him

454
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,008
for more than three seconds
with your pretty eyes.

455
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:16,885
No way.

456
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,720
This is so fun.

457
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,722
-Did you get that?
-Yes, So-min.

458
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,684
You're leaving?

459
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,936
So-min, bye.

460
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,355
-Okay.
-I love you.

461
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,907
Marry them all of a sudden?

462
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,784
Well, they've been together for so long.

463
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,952
They aren't the type to weigh
the pros and cons of love.

464
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,662
We can fast-track their marriage.

465
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,208
I don't want a wedding
in the last episode.

466
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,502
It looks like I added that
because I have nothing else to say.

467
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:51,544
That's not true.

468
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,798
What I had in mind
was the beauty of the scene itself.

469
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,216
Happy endings are nice.

470
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,802
What?
Getting married isn't a happy ending.

471
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,637
If I were to be precise,

472
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,306
declaring to stay single
is closer to a happy ending.

473
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,808
You're not going to marry me?

474
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,439
I thought
he would say something like that.

475
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:14,275
He probably won't. I know.

476
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,278
Well, I do think
they will get married though.

477
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,322
They can't ever break up.

478
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,409
She's a celebrity,
but she's not calculative.

479
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,577
Being innocent actually suits her better.

480
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,955
If this drama were to have more seasons,

481
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,791
they can get married in the fourth season.

482
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,626
This isn't Rude Miss Young-ae.

483
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,294
How many seasons do you want to have?

484
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,504
All right.

485
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,674
How about this couple
who just started dating?

486
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,135
-Marry you?
-Yes.

487
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,387
-Is that a proposal?
-Yes.

488
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,056
Gosh, this is so exciting.

489
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,517
But why are you doing it here?

490
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:49,978
I thought it was meaningful this way.

491
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,689
Well, okay.
I'll give you a pass for the location.

492
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,483
It's a bit too early
to get a proposal from you.

493
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,985
I'll do it anyway, so I just did it now.

494
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,361
You have that much confidence in me?

495
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,655
No. It's because I don't
that I wanted to do it early.

496
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,825
Are you trying to chain me on papers
as soon as you can?

497
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,827
No. I want to be chained to you.

498
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:08,121
I'm so happy whenever I listen to you.

499
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,959
Okay, then. When should we get married?

500
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:15,003
Well, let's tell our parents first.

501
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:18,047
Gosh, you're so old-fashioned.
Why invite our parents to the wedding?

502
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,549
-What?
-It'll be just us.

503
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,176
Small weddings are popular now.

504
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,680
But a wedding without our parents
would be too small.

505
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,265
Let's do it this Sunday.

506
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,267
I don't think we can get a venue by then.

507
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,562
You're so old-fashioned.
Why would we rent a venue?

508
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,189
It's a small wedding.

509
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,817
Let's do it
at the Indian restaurant nearby

510
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,152
while having curry.

511
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,529
I see. Curry.

512
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,617
Well, should we book the restaurant then?

513
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,792
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

514
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:56,669
Enjoy your meal. Is that Set A?

515
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,924
-We'll have a happy marriage.
-Thank you.

516
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,219
-Let's go over there.
-Okay. I'm hungry.

517
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,889
-Who are they?
-I don't know.

518
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:27,575
But by the time
she gets used to the guy's jokes,

519
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,786
wouldn't the table turn?

520
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,121
The girl will like the guy more?

521
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,624
-It's possible.
-Based on what?

522
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:38,253
That's up to me, the writer.
The table won't turn.

523
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,754
Listen.

524
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,133
This guy seems obedient
and moderately dumb.

525
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,469
But he created his own world of jokes.

526
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,805
And he doesn't cave in
and is always consistent with his jokes.

527
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,141
He doesn't give up. He makes
the other person get used to the jokes.

528
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,518
He's persistent.

529
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,062
Well, it's true.

530
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,022
Besides, you're forgetting something.

531
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,316
He got into this company
because he got good grades.

532
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,278
When he studied, did he stay away
from other desires he had?

533
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:06,531
No.
He knows how good coffee is after lunch.

534
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,449
He knows how good beer is after work.

535
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,786
Surprisingly, he manages to get all of
that without spending a dime of his own.

536
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,913
On top of that,
he has good relationships with people.

537
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,749
-The girl he's dating is pretty, too.
-Yes.

538
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,211
I created him,
but I didn't know how great he was.

539
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:24,007
He wasn't being strategic.
He's been living like that his whole life.

540
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,218
Getting used to him means
that she's falling for him.

541
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,929
Later, when things don't go her way,

542
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,931
she'll think it's unfair
because it feels like losing.

543
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,976
She'll be frustrated,
but she can't break up with him.

544
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,895
That's why she'll be anxious.
Something like that?

545
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,104
Something like that.

546
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,276
That does sound fun. Okay.
I'll keep that in mind.

547
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:45,528
I don't think
if we'll have a chance to do that.

548
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,915
What is it? What's going on?

549
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,333
It gives me a heartache.

550
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,880
This is a feeling I don't dare say I know.

551
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,516
Disgusting.

552
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,306
My back is going to break.
Why is it so hot here?

553
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,064
Will you keep complaining next to me?
Don't do it, then.

554
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,357
I have to do this.

555
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,651
You don't have to do this. Just get out.

556
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,195
Why are you complaining next to me?
You're annoying me.

557
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:10,488
I didn't ask you to be by my side.

558
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,533
Oh, right.

559
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,785
Then, go over there.

560
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,205
I sat here first.

561
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,665
So you should get up first.

562
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,792
I see. What?

563
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,421
What are you thinking?
That didn't make sense.

564
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,089
Wait, just do it here.

565
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,634
-Why?
-If we do it separately...

566
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,804
it looks too cold.

567
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,726
You and your demands.

568
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,993
Are you interested in me?

569
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,913
No.

570
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,832
Same here.

571
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,752
That's why I'm asking this.

572
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,879
Do you want to go to Africa with me?

573
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,883
Why?

574
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,053
I don't have enough money.

575
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,472
I don't have money, either.

576
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,892
Then, we can't.

577
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,022
Seriously. Wars are the problem.

578
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,319
You're talking to yourself, right?

579
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:33,863
Isn't that ridiculous?

580
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,574
You start a war

581
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,410
because you want to gain something
by forcing someone against their will.

582
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:43,164
What's the point of gaining anything
by destroying the future? Crazy jerks.

583
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,665
You know the Korean War, right?

584
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:46,834
I'm Korean.

585
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,587
Kim Il Sung sent thousands of war orphans

586
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,256
to his allies,
the socialist countries in East Europe.

587
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,258
We can only suppose
they lived happily ever after.

588
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:55,968
But did they?

589
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,179
Do you think they lived a good life?

590
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,598
No. After the war, they went back.

591
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:04,352
Do you think it was their idea to send
them back? No, it was North Korea's.

592
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:08,231
Do you think North Korea brought them back
for a humanitarian purpose after the war?

593
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,191
No.

594
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,402
They were probably dispatched
to reconstruct the country after the war.

595
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,697
No one knows
whether those innocent kids were dragged

596
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,866
to the coal mines or traded abroad.

597
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,041
I hope someone would make
a documentary about that.

598
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:58,281
THE CHILDREN WHO HAVE GONE TO POLAND

599
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,831
Can't they stay?

600
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:10,042
"They lived happily ever after here."

601
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,752
Can't we do that?

602
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,755
We don't have to follow the synopsis.

603
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,674
I'll think about it.

604
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,136
I trust you.

605
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,853
This guy is a problem.
What are we going to do with Dong-u?

606
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,814
I'm not sure, either. What should I do?

607
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:45,703
Whiskey

608
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,664
can be useful.

609
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,126
Today, I had a feeling
whiskey would be better than beer.

610
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,340
Thank you.

611
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,384
Thanks to you, working is fun.

612
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,720
And you comfort me, too.

613
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,057
No one is lucky like me
to have a boss like you.

614
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,391
Same here.

615
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:12,230
I like working with you because
I feel like I have someone on my side.

616
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,027
Let's work together for a long time.

617
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,030
I will

618
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,532
become stronger

619
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,326
and support you better.

620
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,212
I think I became stronger.

621
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,381
I got a little stronger just now.

622
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,133
You'll collapse soon, then.

623
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,346
It seems

624
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,141
people pretend to be strong
because they want to collapse.

625
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,813
They do it until they think
breaking down a bit wouldn't be

626
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,022
a problem.

627
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:03,906
Is that so?

628
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,117
But

629
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,038
I don't have the courage to collapse yet.

630
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,666
Can you do it for me?

631
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,085
Me?

632
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,839
Can you just tell me the truth?

633
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,882
Don't you have anything to tell me?

634
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,724
-Do you think you can handle it?
-Yes.

635
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,270
Then,

636
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,856
starting now,

637
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:41,235
I'll be possessed by someone in your past.

638
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,049
All right. I'm ready.

639
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:07,303
What do you want to hear from me?

640
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,646
How you really feel.

641
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,956
Chu Jae-hun.

642
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,754
You loved me.

643
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,884
No, to be precise, you used your love

644
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,054
and tried to force me
into your idea of love.

645
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,431
When I didn't behave as you expected,

646
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,684
you criticized me.

647
00:39:56,435 --> 00:40:00,439
You abandoned me to tame me.

648
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,819
You weren't trying to love me.

649
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,946
You tried to possess me.

650
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,489
Stop it!

651
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,366
-Get out.
-You

652
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,160
didn't want to accommodate me.

653
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,038
-Everything is my fault.
-To fit me into your idea of love,

654
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:18,958
you used my foolishness against me,

655
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,252
controlled my feelings however you wanted,

656
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,255
and made endless demands.

657
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,383
When I didn't meet your demands,

658
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,010
you criticized me.

659
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,305
You abandoned me.

660
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:39,937
Did

661
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,314
you

662
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,445
love me?

663
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:37,077
I didn't even fully understand the cause.

664
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,916
And yet, it's pathetic
how I'm struggling like this.

665
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,419
No one can fully understand themselves.

666
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:49,423
People who believe
that they fully understand themselves

667
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,220
will get hurt even more in the end.

668
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,515
Did you know this?

669
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,685
This was probably painful for you.

670
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,980
But when I observed you in pain,

671
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,692
it made me want to date again.

672
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,157
Isn't that weird?

673
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,368
it's such a foolish act.

674
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:19,954
But I like

675
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:23,374
that.

676
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:32,007
It will be hard to get people
to sympathize with this couple.

677
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,676
Receiving deep sympathy and support

678
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,095
from a small group of people
is still a nice thing.

679
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,642
But when they think back
and feel more embarrassed about it,

680
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,436
they won't show their support.

681
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,230
They'll hide it.

682
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,317
But why aren't you stopping me?

683
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,403
I'm working hard to write this story.

684
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,988
Because it's meaningful.

685
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,324
It might make some people
cry their eyes out.

686
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,202
Let's not get scared and just go for it.

687
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,579
Shall we?

688
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,748
Okay. Let's do that.

689
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,545
Gosh, I worked so much today.

690
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,755
We're just getting started.

691
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,466
Then,

692
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,303
shall we really start working?

693
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,470
Shall we?

694
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,860
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

695
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,331
-Hello.
-Hi.

696
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:46,999
-Hi.
-Hello.

697
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:54,465
-Hi.
-Hello.

698
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,805
Hello. I'm Cheon I-seul.
I'll be playing the lead role.

699
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,557
I'm Kim Seong-je
for the role of Gyeong-jae.

700
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,351
I'm Kim Seon-jae
for the role of Kim Pan-su.

701
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,852
I'm Jeong Jae-ho for the role of Dong-u.

702
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:10,272
I'm Lee So-min for the role of Sin-ae.
I hope we can work well together.

703
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:17,196
It's a bit scary to see the people

704
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,158
who have been torturing me
alive and well in front of me.

705
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,660
But you all seem very cool.

706
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:27,039
I'll do my best in order not to
hinder your coolness.

707
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,415
Thank you.

708
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,500
WRITER LIM JIN-JOO

709
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:38,342
I'm sure this is a very valuable period
of time in your life.

710
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:40,678
I would like
to sincerely express my gratitude

711
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:44,139
for everyone in this room for sparing
that valuable time with our project.

712
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,268
I hope we can be a good person
to one another.

713
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:49,687
Thank you.

714
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:50,813
"Have you been well?"

715
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,107
"You haven't changed."

716
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,110
-"Where are you going?"
-"To the restroom."

717
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,237
-"No!"
-"Why not?"

718
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,322
"It's okay. I already know what happened."

719
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,698
"I'm a woman, too!"

720
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,785
"This is kind of awkward for me. But hey,

721
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,328
are you sure this is going to be enough?"

722
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:07,746
DIRECTOR SON BEOM-SU
WRITER LIM JIN-JOO

723
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:08,997
The starting point.

724
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,418
It's the point
where the end seems the farthest.

725
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:16,380
It's the hardest to predict the result
at this point.

726
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,425
We met countless staff members,
actors, and actresses.

727
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:22,261
And countless ideas of our values collide.

728
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,599
In hundreds of situations
and through hundreds of emotions,

729
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,811
our interpretations
can't always be the same.

730
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,523
Let's do this.

731
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:38,902
To solve a problem
without a definite answer,

732
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:41,530
we'll discuss

733
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,824
and find our answer.

734
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,117
We'll get started now!

735
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:55,752
A start.

736
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,258
By nature, starting means
to race towards the end.

737
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,637
But we don't say that it ended,
We say we completed it.

738
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:12,186
Good job.

739
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,604
Good work.

740
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,607
This monitor isn't working!

741
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,443
Please check on it now.

742
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:23,822
It means that we will not put any weight
whether it's a success or a failure

743
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,535
A start is meaningful when it's completed.

744
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,581
For now, I'll just enjoy
the excitement that beginnings give.

745
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,339
Of course,
unwanted major and minor problems

746
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:43,091
are bound to rise up, right?

747
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,178
All right. Let's try one more time.

748
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,888
-We'll try again.
-Get ready.

749
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,975
Ms. Lim, the TV ratings mean nothing.

750
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:54,186
No one checks
the household TV ratings these days.

751
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,065
There's nothing to worry about.
We're only at our first two episodes now.

752
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,526
You know people are talking
about our drama, right?

753
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,694
Don't you worry.

754
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:03,987
Mr. Son.

755
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,657
Your voice is shaking right now.

756
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,325
Are you crying?

757
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,661
What are you talking about? Goodness.

758
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:13,163
It doesn't sound like
you're still in this world.

759
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,331
That's not true.

760
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,875
It doesn't matter where...

761
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,002
No. Ms. Lim.

762
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,837
Don't worry about the TV ratings.

763
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,174
Mr. Son.

764
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,303
Don't think about anything else.
Just go home and get some sleep today.

765
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,138
You've been filming the whole day.

766
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,684
You're doing a fantastic job. Don't worry.

767
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,853
Just keep doing what you've been doing
so far. And have faith in me for the rest.

768
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,398
You said dramas were all about the story.

769
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,858
I'll write a jaw-droppingly crazy story.

770
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,360
Have faith in me.

771
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,946
-Okay?
-Thank you.

772
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,577
I'll go home and call you again. Okay.

773
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:00,460
I thought the drama was pretty good.

774
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,962
Why aren't people watching it?

775
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:05,173
Hey, let's grab a beer before we go home.

776
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,012
Our TV ratings are at one percent.

777
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,141
How could you look at me
as if you're on a reward vacation.

778
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,935
-Are you in another drama?
-No.

779
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,729
A staff member like you

780
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,481
watches Show Me the Money Friday night
instead of watching our drama.

781
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:28,113
You jerk.

782
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:31,491
If I don't watch it, it's impossible
to talk to people the next day.

783
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,329
-You're heartless.
-You know nothing about hip hop.

784
00:48:37,372 --> 00:48:40,125
However, by word of mouth,
people began to take interest in our show.

785
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,918
-And our drama got more buzz.
-It was really fun.

786
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,171
As our drama began
to garner more attention,

787
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,006
I was tortured by mean comments, too.

788
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,468
Who the heck are you?
How dare you call me trash?

789
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,762
I lived diligently.

790
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,264
You only see what you want to see.
You're trying

791
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,974
to find faults to pick a fight with me.

792
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:59,269
You're not a human being.
How dare you criticize me?

793
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,648
Why do you only read hateful comments?

794
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,776
This is hard.

795
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,532
I worked so hard to get to where I am now.

796
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,619
Look what I'm facing now.

797
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:18,580
That's what that hater wants you to do.

798
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,123
Get up now.

799
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,876
Hey, this is a murder.

800
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,670
Fingers shouldn't be used as spears.

801
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,049
What's the National Assembly doing?
They must round up people like that hater.

802
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,428
Wait.

803
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,641
Can this jerk be an assemblyman?

804
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,602
I should read this again.

805
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,358
When people review dramas,
they might criticize your work.

806
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,943
And you should be humble and accept it,

807
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,528
but hateful comments are different.

808
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,488
You must filter them out.

809
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:54,491
It's not like hateful comments
aren't categorized with a warning color.

810
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:55,492
How can I filter them out?

811
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,245
You should just forget about them
and not be affected by them.

812
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:02,374
People are saying mean things online
because they are lonely.

813
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:05,127
If people murder other people
because they are lonely,

814
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,462
they are not human beings. They are Satan.

815
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,508
Aren't you glad that there are more good
people in the world than bad ones?

816
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,719
You know, it's natural
that good people are bound

817
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,721
to work harder in this world.

818
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,473
It might feel like
it's a huge disadvantage on our part,

819
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,852
but we can't let
the bad people rule the world.

820
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:25,522
In that sense,
we are protecting the world.

821
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,983
I thought the Avengers
were protecting the world.

822
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:31,069
I'm feeling sad
now that I'm reminded of Iron Man.

823
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:35,699
Anyway, our drama is rated PG-15. Right?

824
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:38,785
I'll bet my right wrist
and your entire savings

825
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:41,163
that the haters
are all under 15 years old.

826
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,581
Why are you betting my money?

827
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,459
You need to write,
so I'll provide the wrist.

828
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,586
I heard the real estate market
will do well next year.

829
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,212
So we'll use your money.

830
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,715
You're crafty in a situation like this?

831
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:52,924
I'm being rational.

832
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:03,643
I don't think I made a romantic joke.

833
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,103
You're being generous.

834
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,940
I like that about you.

835
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,737
I like your lame jokes
while taking a walk.

836
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,238
You're sexy when you talk casually.

837
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:21,369
Don't get so worked up. I don't like that.

838
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:24,539
Just stay like this at this pace

839
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,833
and be with me forever.

840
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,635
You're getting me excited.
I need to cool down.

841
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:39,846
Come here. It's nice and cool today.
It's okay.

842
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,849
No, I shouldn't. I'm feeling very hot.

843
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,103
Come here. I don't want
to stay away from you right now.

844
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:56,863
Good occasions are
always accompanied by misery.

845
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:58,907
Luckily, we knew

846
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,285
that this small gesture we make
to comfort each other

847
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,622
is the biggest weapon we have
when facing a crisis.

848
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:10,794
1 YEAR LATER

849
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,551
A WOMAN, AN ACTRESS

850
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,557
What are you doing with your documentary?

851
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,601
That's what I'd like to ask you.
You helped So-min hit fame.

852
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,437
You filmed her and her former manager
as a couple.

853
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,064
That was the key point.

854
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,068
Who knew that she would get married
as soon as she hit her second prime?

855
00:52:35,151 --> 00:52:38,113
So-min is quite the businesswoman.

856
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:41,116
Gosh, I'm an artist.

857
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,285
I ended up filming
a matchmaking documentary.

858
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,413
That's the purest form of art.

859
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,959
Anyway, let's go.

860
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,254
Screenwriter for a hit drama
and director for a hit documentary.

861
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,630
Let's go.

862
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,151
Thank you.

863
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,153
It's getting hot again.

864
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,657
Right. I like the bingsu here.

865
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,076
You should have it. It's on the house.

866
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,077
No.

867
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,414
You should.
We're closing the cafe after this month.

868
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,834
We managed to keep afloat.

869
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,003
But it's hard.

870
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,382
Okay, I'll have a bingsu.

871
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:41,718
Okay. Please wait.

872
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,757
This cafe will close down.

873
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,179
They ran for a long time.

874
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:31,184
-Have a safe trip.
-Okay.

875
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:36,022
I'll meet them, film them,

876
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,358
and come back with a tanned face.

877
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:41,861
That's cool.
I'm sure you'll do a great job.

878
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,448
You'll look pretty tanned.
It will be a long trip.

879
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,368
Are you disappointed?

880
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,288
Your happiness is all I want.

881
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,000
When you come back,

882
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,461
this cafe will be gone.

883
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,381
I'll be gone, too.

884
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,263
Are you disappointed?

885
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,350
Do you know

886
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,812
why the universe is immeasurably big?

887
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:17,397
Why?

888
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:21,860
Everyone has a place in this universe.

889
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,364
Since we can't stay forever on earth,

890
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,867
when the time comes,

891
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,911
we're moved to that place.

892
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,040
Let's meet there.

893
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:37,459
You and I.

894
00:55:57,854 --> 00:56:00,690
Please let In-guk stay for a few days

895
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,027
in Jeju Island during summer his break.

896
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,236
Okay.

897
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,240
What? What is it?

898
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:12,077
Why do you keep showing off your house?
What do you want?

899
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,912
This is the apartment

900
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,373
I used to live in.

901
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:21,711
Well, I just need a small studio
to stay for a few days

902
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,963
when I have work in Seoul.

903
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,884
I want to give this to you.

904
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:29,761
When will you be able

905
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:32,347
to buy a house with your salary
while raising a boy?

906
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,434
You knew this all along
and didn't do anything about it until now?

907
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,272
You're right. Anyway,

908
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:44,150
I don't want to brag
about giving you the apartment.

909
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,443
Don't think about it.

910
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:49,197
Of course, I'll take it.
Why would I think about that?

911
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:53,535
You know what? You can brag about it
given the apartment you're giving me.

912
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:56,746
Okay.

913
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,665
-I guess.
-Is that all?

914
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,749
Yes.

915
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,628
I'll get going.

916
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:08,591
Seung-hyo.

917
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,065
What about the transfer tax?

918
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,363
The transfer tax?

919
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,078
What are you looking at?

920
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,331
Of course,

921
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:42,500
I should cover it.

922
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,379
-Thank you.
-It's settled, then.

923
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:49,257
-Bye.
-Yes. Bye.

924
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,135
Thirty.

925
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,929
If you use your age as an excuse,

926
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:58,516
you will be criticized
because you're a grown-up now.

927
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,852
If you intimidate someone with your age,

928
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,188
people will easily mock you
and laugh at you.

929
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,314
It's an odd age.

930
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,984
Now that we have passed that age,

931
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:11,696
we were about to become truly independent.

932
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:15,408
This is kind of spacious.

933
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,204
You will have to live
and work here, Ms. Lim.

934
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:23,416
Our company wanted to get you a penthouse
if we could.

935
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,502
-Then, do it.
-Just appreciate the thought for now.

936
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,921
Right. She signed to write two dramas
with the company.

937
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,714
How long do you have to stay here?

938
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,091
Is this a prison cell?

939
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,386
I hope this will be a clean
and peaceful prison cell.

940
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:38,681
It feels nice and soft,
but sticky at the same time.

941
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,142
That's life.

942
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,020
But this is nice.

943
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,689
Ms. Lim.

944
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,985
Ms. Lim who hit it big
with her debut drama.

945
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,321
-Were you being sarcastic just now?
-Are you being grumpy?

946
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,865
"You're being too proud
because you made a hit with your debut."

947
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,202
Aren't you trying to use my success
that has nothing to do

948
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,371
with the script
as a tool to criticize and attack me?

949
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,415
Attack you? Why would I do that?
We're on the same side.

950
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,334
As a director,

951
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,628
I'm suggesting the right path
for the drama to take.

952
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,255
If you want me to take your suggestion,

953
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,006
don't get sidetracked from the topic.

954
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,300
Why do you take such a petty approach
like using sarcasm

955
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:16,052
in order to claim
that you're better than me?

956
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,388
Petty? You're the one
who's not listening to me

957
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:20,014
and choosing negative words on purpose

958
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,101
to use them as your weapon. What about
your approach? Isn't that evil?

959
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:25,144
Evil? You should keep your manners.

960
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,896
Can you call me petty
if you kept your manners?

961
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,023
How come you expect me
to listen to you all the time?

962
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,316
Gosh, this is not fair.

963
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,652
That's what I would like to tell you.

964
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:36,614
You have a new work studio.

965
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,283
Why do we always come to this cafe?

966
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:40,618
Did I choose this place?
Why are you taking it out on me?

967
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:42,620
-It's six o'clock.
-Let's go home.

968
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,497
-Let's talk tomorrow.
-Okay.

969
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,418
I'm off now.

970
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,030
How was your day today?

971
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,741
That jerk, your director,
gave you a hard time, right?

972
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:22,493
Yes. Don't even start. He's so stubborn.

973
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,163
He needs to get royally screwed some time.

974
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,749
How was your day?

975
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,336
I had the script meeting
the whole day today,

976
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,880
but that writer
isn't listening to me at all.

977
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,465
She needs to hit rock bottom

978
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,008
without her second drama.

979
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,312
-Stop it.
-I won't do it.

980
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:53,691
-You stop it.
-I won't start. You stop it.

981
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:57,278
-Stop it.
-Stop it. I said I wouldn't.

982
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,239
Cool down. Cool it.

983
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,546
Aren't you hungry?

984
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,256
What do you want to eat?

985
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,384
Let's go to a good restaurant.

986
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,178
I came up with a list of restaurants.

987
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:24,806
Good job.

988
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,561
Anyway,

989
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,564
I like you.

990
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:38,778
He's very eager.

991
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,530
-I guess I make him that way.
-Han-ju!

992
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,781
It's my fault.

993
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,033
Go and keep making it your fault.

994
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,243
Bye.

995
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,790
I said you didn't have
to come and pick me up.

996
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,166
You never listen.

997
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:55,086
I said I won't listen to that.
You never listen, do you?

998
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:57,922
Bye.

999
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,865
That's dried smelt.
I doubt you could get that in Europe.

1000
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:28,453
I never said that I liked this.

1001
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,290
It doesn't matter if you like it or not.

1002
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,125
I just wanted to give it to you.

1003
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:37,920
Come to think of it,

1004
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:40,506
you kind of look like a smelt.

1005
01:02:45,845 --> 01:02:47,305
I have nothing to give you.

1006
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,891
I'm sure there are less stuff
in Africa than in Europe.

1007
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:53,352
Well, you'll be back
after a few months, too.

1008
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,189
Let's...

1009
01:02:57,648 --> 01:02:58,900
just talk.

1010
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,779
-About what?
-You know,

1011
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:06,324
things we never talked about.

1012
01:03:08,826 --> 01:03:09,869
Our stories.

1013
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,985
It's a line from Casablanca.

1014
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,321
It was translated super dope in Korean.

1015
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:31,701
"Whatever you see through your eyes.

1016
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,578
Cheers

1017
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:36,497
to

1018
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,542
your eyes."

1019
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:02,940
Get it off me.

1020
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,293
Let's meet in Morocco.

1021
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,173
Before I go to Rwanda,

1022
01:05:28,841 --> 01:05:30,426
let's experience Casablanca.

1023
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,974
Let's think about it.

1024
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:55,785
ART CENTER

1025
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,596
Are you here to watch a musical?

1026
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:18,516
-Yes.
-I see.

1027
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,602
Funny running into you here.

1028
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:24,522
I know. Did you come with your friend?

1029
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,024
I came here alone. What about you?

1030
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:29,360
Same here.

1031
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,363
I didn't know you liked musicals.

1032
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,657
I watched a few. It was nice.

1033
01:06:35,574 --> 01:06:36,575
I see.

1034
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,371
Where are you sitting?

1035
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:42,623
Here.

1036
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:46,961
It's far from mine.

1037
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,135
Okay. Enjoy the show.

1038
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,178
Okay.

1039
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:04,603
Ha-yun.

1040
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,776
-Yes?
-What are you doing after this?

1041
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:13,404
Nothing.

1042
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:15,489
Do you want to have a beer?

1043
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:19,452
Okay.

1044
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,704
Okay. Let's meet out front after the show.

1045
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:23,456
Okay.

1046
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:49,231
In-guk, I told you to eat!

1047
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,941
I'll eat when I get hungry.

1048
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,486
Just let me have fun when I'm playing.

1049
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:56,489
Goodness.

1050
01:07:56,697 --> 01:07:58,407
That little brat.

1051
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:01,243
Kids like him might listen to you better
during adolescence.

1052
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,413
Let's not put our hope
on a slim possibility.

1053
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,499
When he grows up,
it's bound to get physical, too.

1054
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,459
Yes. Let's exercise,

1055
01:08:08,709 --> 01:08:11,337
so we can control him
with all of our strength combined.

1056
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,340
When will we meet up again?

1057
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,558
-Go.
-Okay.

1058
01:08:25,392 --> 01:08:26,727
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

1059
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,897
I said you don't have to. The airport bus
stops in front of the house.

1060
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:32,191
Be quiet before I stop you from leaving.

1061
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:36,737
Gosh, Hyo-bong. You've gotten
all manly now that you live with Mun-su.

1062
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,740
You newlyweds must be excited.

1063
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:43,744
I take that back. I'd been one before.
It wasn't so good.

1064
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:44,995
Bye.

1065
01:08:45,788 --> 01:08:47,414
Okay. See you tomorrow.

1066
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:53,796
-Bye.
-Bye.

1067
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,261
I thought about it.

1068
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,680
I think we are at an awesome age.

1069
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:07,143
We're at an age where starting
something new wouldn't be so weird,

1070
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,686
and we're more experienced than most.

1071
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:13,023
At our age, we're the quickest
among people who consider starting

1072
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,567
something new to be odd.

1073
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,070
All of a sudden, I feel full of life.

1074
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,531
So we were young and smart.

1075
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,784
But I don't want to be smart

1076
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:25,327
when I'm with you guys.

1077
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:29,123
It's fun to chitchat
when people aren't so smart.

1078
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:32,126
I'm going to talk to you guys
until the day I die.

1079
01:09:32,376 --> 01:09:34,628
To improve the quality
of our conversations.

1080
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,672
don't do foolish things on purpose.

1081
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,049
Don't be arrogant because you're smart.

1082
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,677
Don't think you're really young
because we are considered young.

1083
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:44,513
In my opinion,
here's the most important thing.

1084
01:09:45,764 --> 01:09:49,143
Focusing all of your energy
on the crisis you have now

1085
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,729
Is the only way not to worsen
the crisis you have.

1086
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,233
Don't bring up ramyeon.

1087
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:05,659
Eun-jeong always tackles
this big crisis with food.

1088
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:06,869
Let's follow her example.

1089
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:11,790
You're the one who started this!
It was you.

1090
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:18,005
Right.
Stay away from the terrorist attacks.

1091
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:19,340
How can I stay away from it?

1092
01:10:19,423 --> 01:10:21,091
Watch out for handsome guys.

1093
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:22,259
Why should I?

1094
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:24,762
-Don't go where there are civil wars.
-I'm going to Europe.

1095
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:27,014
I know you're going to Africa
after going to Europe.

1096
01:10:27,097 --> 01:10:29,725
Right. What was that?
Stay away from Nalaria.

1097
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:32,311
-Malaria.
-Stay away from that.

1098
01:10:38,609 --> 01:10:41,445
-This is it.
-Yes. This is it.

1099
01:10:41,528 --> 01:10:42,780
My mouth is already watering.

1100
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,282
-Let's dig in.
-Dig in. Start with the broth.

1101
01:10:45,532 --> 01:10:47,409
No, I'll eat the noodles first.

1102
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:50,204
-Okay. Let's eat.
-Let's just eat.

1103
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,087
As always, we had fun
talking to each other today,

1104
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:00,506
enjoyed our food together,

1105
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:02,591
and are happily in love.

1106
01:11:02,841 --> 01:11:03,842
This is it.

1107
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,886
-Ramyeon at night
-This is so good.

1108
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:08,347
will never be healthy.

1109
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:10,349
Even if so,

1110
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:13,519
we are happy that we have enough time

1111
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,062
to recover from this.

1112
01:11:15,562 --> 01:11:19,275
We compliment ourselves
for recognizing our ability to do so.

1113
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:22,820
First, enjoy it and slurp it up.

1114
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:24,530
I mean,

1115
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:26,532
there's nothing wrong with that, is there?

1116
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:32,121
SPECIAL THANKS TO JUNG SO-MIN

1117
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:27,152
WE HAVE FUN TALKING TO EACH OTHER,
ENJOY OUR FOOD TOGETHER,

1118
01:13:27,236 --> 01:13:29,905
AND ARE HAPPILY IN LOVE

1119
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:33,742
AS WE ROOT FOR OUR PRESENT
