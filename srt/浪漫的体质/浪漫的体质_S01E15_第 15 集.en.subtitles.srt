1
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,133
Who were you with?

2
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:55,180
Never mind. I'm sorry.

3
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,870
What did you do today?

4
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,539
I waited for you.

5
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,340
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:32,675
I'm late.

7
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,667
What are you doing?

8
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,672
I'll leave now.

9
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,714
What?

10
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,425
I won't come here anymore.

11
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,768
What are you saying?

12
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,853
I'm fine

13
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,856
now.

14
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,024
I'll break up with you.

15
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,866
Then why were you here all along?

16
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,993
I thought

17
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,164
you'd give me a warm hug
for the last time.

18
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,006
So,

19
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,551
are you happy now?

20
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,595
Yes.

21
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:00,555
Thanks.

22
00:03:00,638 --> 00:03:03,516
Stop it. That's enough.

23
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,312
-I'm sorry.
-Don't say that.

24
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,188
I know I'm making it hard for you.

25
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,276
I'll stop.

26
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,780
Bye.

27
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,329
Just what are you doing?

28
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:32,503
Why do you have to be so selfish
until the end?

29
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,672
After giving me such a hard time...

30
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,300
You put me through the breakup,

31
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,844
and you came back after everything.

32
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,348
After struggling for a few days,

33
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,767
you're fine now?

34
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:50,438
Why do you have to do everything
your way all the time?

35
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,154
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

36
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,283
Tell me. What are you sorry for?

37
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,664
Why are you doing something to feel
sorry for again?

38
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,207
This happens all the time.

39
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,086
Am I a pushover to you?

40
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,884
I used to hate it when you yelled.

41
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,513
I guess I made you yell again.

42
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,309
You're not a pushover.

43
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,813
Sorry.

44
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:37,527
When you first fall in love,

45
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,906
you do so without knowing much
about each other.

46
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:46,911
There are good things and bad things
that you discover.

47
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,623
It's not common to discover
more good things than bad.

48
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:58,256
And those bad things tend to
have a strong presence.

49
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,883
It's only natural that
you remember them more.

50
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,971
It's kind of obvious
that you feel disappointed.

51
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:09,100
Compromises and falling apart.

52
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,644
The aggressive process of falling apart.

53
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,522
Getting to know more about each other

54
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,691
is like facing a series of variables.

55
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,445
Love, in the end,
is about fighting the variables.

56
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,990
And so is a drama.

57
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,624
I can't believe there are only
two episodes left.

58
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,251
There's nothing else to watch.

59
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,587
Isn't My Country: New Age the next series?

60
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,132
Right. I'm glad.

61
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,719
Why are there only 16 episodes?

62
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,971
I wish they made it longer.

63
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,266
Excuse me, what about the writers?

64
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,478
An episode is about 35 pages long.
That adds up to 560 pages in total.

65
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,563
It goes over 600 to count
the proposal and synopsis.

66
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,482
It's endless if you count
the revised scripts.

67
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,902
Have you ever broken your wrist
from typing too much?

68
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,530
Why are you getting worked up?

69
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,494
I don't know. It just happened.

70
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:17,668
Actress Jeong Ji-yeon

71
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,545
fell off the horse while horse-riding

72
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,673
and broke her leg this afternoon.

73
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,302
Her agency reported that
Ms. Jeong was trying to practice

74
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,638
for a horse-riding scene in her drama

75
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,431
and that she fell off the horse.

76
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:33,935
They also added that she'll have to wear
a cast for over a month.

77
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,730
The drama Ms. Jeong was preparing for
was to be aired on JBC,

78
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:40,483
-a series written by Ms. Jung Hye-jeong.
-What will happen then?

79
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,444
-Their time slot will be pushed.
-It was ready to be aired from next week.

80
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,280
-The production crew is not thinking of
-What about that slot then?

81
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,365
a replacement.

82
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,033
They announced that

83
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,662
they will postpone shooting indefinitely
until Ms. Jeong recovers.

84
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:14,559
Hey, stop looking so down.

85
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,061
Isn't this the appropriate face?

86
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,650
-I hurt the lead actress's leg.
-Cut it out.

87
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,694
It's not your fault.

88
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,362
The director is responsible
for everything,

89
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,656
but that didn't happen because of you.

90
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,992
What? That sounds weird.

91
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:34,245
That's normal. Directors are weird.

92
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,248
All the actors and staff will
look at your face on the set.

93
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,418
Because you're the director,
they look at your face and mouth

94
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,712
to see how you feel and what you say.

95
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,088
And if you sleep...

96
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,676
You can sleep if you feel tired,
but if you look like a loser,

97
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,054
your actors and staff will
feel like a loser too.

98
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,849
Don't you know that as a director?

99
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
You don't?

100
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,978
Come to my office.

101
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,359
What are you talking about?

102
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,360
Didn't you hear me?

103
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,071
I just want to switch the order
of Hwan-dong and your drama.

104
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,698
We can't move up the shoot for two months.

105
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,450
We only just got the crew
and cast the actors.

106
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,660
The set isn't ready yet.
How can we start shooting?

107
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,162
Shoot outdoors first.

108
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,330
We're not ready at all.

109
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,248
-Get ready as you shoot.
-That's nonsense.

110
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,918
What do you suggest then?
The lead actress is hurt and can't shoot.

111
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,921
She'll be wearing a cast for a month.
Other actors can start shooting first.

112
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:28,341
Even after she takes off the cast,
she won't be able to walk properly.

113
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,259
And the lead actress has to appear
in every scene.

114
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,552
It won't work.

115
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,221
What about for us?

116
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,806
It'll be like going live on air
for us to start shooting now.

117
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,934
You've been there and done that. Come on.

118
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,354
Things have changed now.
What about the legal working hours?

119
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,689
We can finally work like humans.

120
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,775
Do you want to change the law again?

121
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,237
Do you want to protest
that you want to work 100 hours a week?

122
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,821
Don't say such scary things.

123
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,573
Can't you see who's scared here?

124
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,992
Whatever. This has been decided
by upper management.

125
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:59,121
An experienced director like you

126
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,832
should step forward for the company.

127
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,585
You used to belittle me
for not getting high ratings.

128
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,129
-I didn't mean it.
-That's too late.

129
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,383
I don't know. This isn't going to work.
I can't do it.

130
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,677
You say, "I can't do it",
but you'll be getting ready.

131
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,096
That's how you become
a part of an organization.

132
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,183
Want to make a bet
on whether you'll do it or not?

133
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,398
Damn it.

134
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,495
You're not just a loser.

135
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:42,081
You just look dead.

136
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,041
Your actors and staff members

137
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,586
will feel like mourners.

138
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,254
It's your fault.

139
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,631
You made her break her leg.
It's all your fault.

140
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,050
You should've bought her
a horse-riding machine.

141
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,928
How could you let her ride a horse?
Don't call yourself a director.

142
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,015
Stop staring into the air.
You're a freaking loser.

143
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,195
Why did you make the lead actress's hobby
horse-riding?

144
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,869
It could've been something safe
like flower arranging or mowing the grass.

145
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:23,122
If she's destined to get injured,
mowing the grass could've hurt her too.

146
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,916
Have you ever had scrub typhus?

147
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,420
Fine. It's actually better
to finish your script

148
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,589
before we shoot.

149
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,550
I'm used to using the viewer's feedback
to fix my script.

150
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,886
-How's your writing going?
-I have more time now.

151
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,804
-Did you visit Ji-eun at the hospital?
-Yes, I did.

152
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:39,972
How's Mr. So doing?

153
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,308
Mr. So... What?

154
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:44,226
What? Why?

155
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,228
Why did you bring up Mr. So

156
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,481
when we were talking about the drama?

157
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,193
What? Well, you seem to drink

158
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,195
with him often.

159
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,279
And?

160
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,449
It's good I have more time
to drink with him.

161
00:10:58,532 --> 00:10:59,909
Why would you drink with that guy

162
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,869
when your project is to set off?

163
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,329
What kind of guy do you think he is?

164
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,664
Mr. So.

165
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,957
-Do you like him?
-Of course, I do.

166
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,042
Why?

167
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,503
Why would you get angry?

168
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,463
I like him because he's nice to me.

169
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,714
He's nice to you?

170
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,676
He goes around smiling at everyone.

171
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,261
That's his job.

172
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,764
Being nice to screenwriters and directors.

173
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,516
That's his job.
Don't you know that already?

174
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,851
-I do know!
-You do?

175
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,478
You know?

176
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,313
Do you still like him
because he's nice to you?

177
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,024
Fine. Since you're a successful writer,

178
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,111
I guess a lot of people would be
nice to you. Good for you!

179
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,779
Aren't we old and wise enough

180
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,156
to have a good judge of character?

181
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,033
Are you just happy that he's nice to you?

182
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,993
Why can't you be nice to me then?

183
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,833
How should we take this?

184
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,584
If Mr. Sung leaves first,

185
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,211
it's just a silly fight.

186
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,131
If Ms. Jung leaves first,
it's a lovers' quarrel.

187
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,715
Something like

188
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,135
a woman running away
pretending to be upset.

189
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,555
Like how the guy would go after her
and give her a hug?

190
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,600
Then the woman would hit his chest

191
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,811
and hug him back pretending to give in.

192
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,105
I see.

193
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,746
Damn it.

194
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,709
How can she talk to the director that way?

195
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,252
Unbelievable!

196
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,045
Damn it!

197
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,559
Honestly?

198
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,811
Yes. Say anything about how you feel

199
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,646
when you work with So-min.

200
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,232
Just tell us how you feel honestly.

201
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,902
-Honestly...
-Yes. Honestly.

202
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,696
It's so annoying.

203
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,823
Is she going through a rough patch?

204
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,784
She's always angry in the car.
But she's not the only one there.

205
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,620
It's really annoying.

206
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,581
You can't be that honest.

207
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,501
But you told me to...

208
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,629
Don't tell me this will be aired.

209
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,048
Did you think I filmed this
to keep it for myself?

210
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,927
I'm so sorry. Please delete it.

211
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,268
You look serious.

212
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,480
The shooting schedule has been moved up.

213
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,149
I don't think that would cause
such a face.

214
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,859
Don't you like the script?

215
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,904
-I don't like how Min-jun is.
-What?

216
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,907
He's flirting with the actress
he's managing.

217
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,411
What is this? You sound very serious,

218
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:51,789
but I find it hard to trust you.

219
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,624
Do you know what he did?

220
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,797
Right. It's more important for the agency
that you stand out

221
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,923
than the drama, ma'am.

222
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,717
"Ma'am"?

223
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,011
Right.

224
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:15,646
It's his job.

225
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,899
Does his job need him to say
that she's pretty?

226
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,943
I read the scenario.

227
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,570
You're perfect for the role.

228
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,530
You majored in dancing,
so you don't need lessons.

229
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,074
Plus, you've been toning yourself,
so you have a better figure now.

230
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:30,411
Right.

231
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,247
-It's fine.
-You're speaking casually to her.

232
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,041
-No, I'm on your side, Seon-ju.
-You're on her side?

233
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,962
If you ask me, I think it's time

234
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:42,089
that you film a movie instead of a drama.

235
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,633
And you're the production company's
first pick, so we still have time.

236
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,135
Let's not rush.

237
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,181
Stop being so weak. You're doing great.

238
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,808
You have two great options,

239
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,144
so let's give it some thought together
until this week.

240
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,896
Hey!

241
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,981
Let us think!

242
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,859
I've said this so many times already!

243
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:04,320
Why would you call me at this hour
for that?

244
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,571
Do you call this a worry?

245
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,197
Do you call yourself an actress?

246
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,158
Don't call me so late!

247
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:10,951
I'm hanging up!

248
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,791
And you call that "flirting"?

249
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,669
I'm sure he let her on
more than necessary.

250
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:24,089
I'm not sure, but isn't Min-jun
the type of guy you can trust?

251
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,758
He secretly likes to flirt.

252
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,134
No woman would say no to that.

253
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,969
I'm going to go kill her.

254
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:31,680
Why would you kill her
when it's Min-jun that flirts?

255
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,059
Don't try to reason with me.

256
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,812
This is so annoying.
I haven't thought this far.

257
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,689
Of course, they have actresses there too.

258
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,191
Should I bring him back?

259
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,902
What if he's with her now?

260
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,362
MIN-JUN

261
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,242
CHAIRMAN KIM

262
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,085
Delete them right now.

263
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,420
What?

264
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,967
What are you doing?

265
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,220
Delete them.

266
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,846
I asked, what are you doing?

267
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,890
I meant to send them to my niece.

268
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,308
Her name is Eun-jeong.

269
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,394
Delete them. Right now.

270
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,231
Don't boss me around.

271
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,440
I deleted them.

272
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,025
No, you didn't.

273
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,486
It's your fault you sent them to me.

274
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,823
It's your fault your name
is Lee Eun-jeong. Delete them now.

275
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:32,533
I did delete them.

276
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,372
No, you didn't.

277
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:39,748
What is he doing?

278
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,126
-Why? What is it?
-What?

279
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,255
Nothing. Just work.

280
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:50,968
One moment.

281
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,554
Delete them right now.

282
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,976
I'm with So-min now.
Shall I show them to her?

283
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:00,477
No.

284
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,439
Say, "Please delete them."

285
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,358
Please delete them.

286
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,820
Say, "Thank you."

287
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,699
Thank you.

288
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,662
Be polite like this from now on.

289
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,623
Okay. Did you delete them?

290
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,126
I'll just show these to her.

291
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,461
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,881
-Is work that fun?
-Yes.

293
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,175
It's Director Hey.

294
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,511
Oh, my gosh. Is he crazy?

295
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,846
What is he doing?

296
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,057
Does he do drugs?

297
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,313
Wait. Why is he exchanging these photos
with you?

298
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,440
He meant to send them to his niece.

299
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,649
Her name is Eun-jeong.

300
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,236
Still, it means your name was
at the top of his recent call names.

301
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,322
Well, I interviewed him.

302
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,490
Right.

303
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,035
Can you send these to me?

304
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,329
He's completely nuts.

305
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,539
I can't believe he sticks his tongue out
and acts cute.

306
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,833
He seemed to like kids.

307
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,376
He donates all the money he makes,

308
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,046
and he goes to an orphanage to eat
because he doesn't want to buy rice.

309
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,964
What a weirdo.

310
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,635
He's weird but nice.

311
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,846
No. He's weird but good.

312
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,516
No. He's just weird.

313
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,976
Send them to me now.
I'm going to tease him.

314
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,687
No. I happen to have something on him,

315
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,564
so let me use this for my interview.

316
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,608
-You did it already.
-He gave short answers,

317
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:30,943
so I can't use anything.

318
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,194
Get it done quickly.

319
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:34,113
I'm going to show it to him
whenever he yells.

320
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,533
How far do you think you can write?

321
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,745
We'll be able to finish up to Episode ten
before the shoot.

322
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,705
We actually have more time now
than before,

323
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,874
so it's not a big deal for us.

324
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,167
I'm worried about the shoot.

325
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,419
I'm not going to work less hard
just because I'm in a rush.

326
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,588
Don't worry about the shoot.

327
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,174
Just do your work like you're doing now.

328
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,009
I'm good.

329
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,222
He makes me trust him naturally
without begging.

330
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:04,143
That's what it seemed like,
but we've seen the variables.

331
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,186
You said that before the presentation.

332
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,729
That's the only thing I'm not good at.

333
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,481
I can never get better.

334
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:13,110
It's time for the general meeting.

335
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,070
Let's go.

336
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,365
Jae-hun, you should leave first.

337
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,118
I need to talk to Ms. Lim
about the script.

338
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,536
Okay.

339
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,247
-Do you have time, Ms. Lim?
-Sure.

340
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,040
-Let's get going then.
-Okay.

341
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,709
-See you later.
-See you.

342
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,127
-See you later.
-Bye.

343
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,800
The assistant director will
join you tomorrow.

344
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,887
And I have some requests for you, Su-hui.

345
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,514
We checked the scripts in advance
as we're running out of time.

346
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,809
These things will be flagged
once the scripts are reviewed.

347
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,144
But this is...

348
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,272
It won't be as fun
if you take out all the swear words.

349
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,607
I know it from my experience,

350
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,067
but I'm sure "son of a bitch" is allowed.

351
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,737
-It can't be directed at someone.
-But you can say it to yourself?

352
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,822
You can, but you can't keep saying it.

353
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,867
"You punk, you fool, you jerk."

354
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,035
Is that what they want?

355
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:06,288
To make this world
a pure one without swear words,

356
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,208
let us put our hearts together...

357
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,960
Have you not seen how schoolkids swear
these days?

358
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,504
Their voices haven't broken
but they are worse than adults.

359
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,299
They didn't learn that from TV.

360
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,802
How about we outright swear on TV?

361
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:23,055
If we make it repulsive,
they might stop swearing.

362
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:26,225
I get the feeling that it might help
make this society purer.

363
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:29,144
Right. To make a purer society,

364
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,604
let's give up on TV.

365
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,773
Let them swear only on TV.

366
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,191
That's

367
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,110
not something you should offer to me.

368
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:40,113
You should form a group of people
with the same belief

369
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,659
and go to Korea Communications Commission,

370
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,912
the Blue House, or the National Assembly,

371
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,289
and go on a protest

372
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,709
or write up a national petition.

373
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,170
That'd be faster.

374
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,006
How many people do you think
will agree to my petition

375
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,300
asking us to allow cursing on TV?

376
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:02,094
Another petition will be up,

377
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,554
asking Ms. Lim Jin-ju to be expelled.

378
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,390
More than 200,000 people will agree

379
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,308
and the Blue House will respond
to it officially.

380
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,936
-Will I be expelled?
-Yes.

381
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,146
I kind of want to try it.

382
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,526
We'll start shooting soon.
Please stop those scary thoughts.

383
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,321
Since we're tight on schedule,

384
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,949
if you could keep the due for the scripts,

385
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,494
it'll be very much appreciated.

386
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,871
And this.

387
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,792
These are the product placement offers.

388
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,838
Please check if you can include this
in your script.

389
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,258
I believe you can do it.

390
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,218
No.

391
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,138
-Ms. Lim?
-No.

392
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,764
What kind of friends are we?

393
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,266
Friends like any other.

394
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:52,102
We're still friends, so I'll count on you.

395
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,063
Lovely.

396
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:05,073
-Gosh.
-I trust you.

397
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,244
Jeon Jo Mun-su is confirmed to be
the musical director.

398
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,956
But we haven't decided on his pay yet,
so I'm heading to Plan D Studio now.

399
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,960
And I'll finish signing contracts
with the head staff within this week.

400
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,795
Okay.

401
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,465
All right.

402
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,637
IN-GUK'S DAD

403
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,225
Hello?

404
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,228
What is it?

405
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,650
In-guk doesn't have time this week.

406
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,486
You always call me out of the blue.

407
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,029
We're busy too.

408
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,241
What?

409
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:01,129
It's harder to write
because I think I'm running out of time.

410
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,882
Right? Same here.

411
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,968
Something is off. It's too ordinary.

412
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:10,305
This really must be the beginning.
Are you nervous?

413
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,683
But wasn't I good at pretending
to be laid-back?

414
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:17,062
Yes. You're not letting them catch you.
Great job.

415
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,442
I keep thinking of Ms. Jung these days.

416
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,905
"What would she do at a time like this?
How would she deal with this?

417
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,949
How did she do this?"

418
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:31,993
She was annoying,
but she did give us useful advice.

419
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,078
Right.

420
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,498
Let's try to remember.

421
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,126
Let's try to remember.

422
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,711
It seemed okay when you were writing,
so you kept on going.

423
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,840
But when you are done,
it's just so ordinary.

424
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,552
If you think it's special, your eyes,
your sensory organs are not working.

425
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,555
You're not special.
You're ordinary. It's a fact.

426
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,265
Don't think the opposite. You're wrong.

427
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,851
What should we do now?

428
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,603
Fix it. Your script gets better
the more you fix it.

429
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,940
If it gets worse after your amendments,
then you have no talent.

430
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,109
You're not qualified. Quit then.

431
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,821
So what do we need now?

432
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,869
My ability as a writer?

433
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,745
That's a given.

434
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,165
I'm not here to talk about
something so obvious.

435
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,251
The reason to give up?

436
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,921
What you need is time.

437
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,923
The time to re-write.

438
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,677
Then what do you need to earn more time?

439
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,889
-Diligence.
-And?

440
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,056
And...

441
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,855
It's too hard.

442
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,485
-Guts.
-Guts?

443
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,740
Don't let anyone including the director
intimidate you. Fight head-on.

444
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:55,202
They are as anxious as you are.

445
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,787
So think about how to improve your script

446
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,289
if you have time to be intimidated.

447
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,126
But you have to be intimidated by me.

448
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,216
-Let's just write.
-Okay.

449
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:12,886
Let's trust the director.

450
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,096
-Our director.
-Okay.

451
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:19,517
The layout of the set.
We've changed it as you suggested.

452
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,646
We need you to confirm it by today
to meet the deadline.

453
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,813
That's Ju-yeon's house.

454
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,859
I wanted to have the full view
of the living room from the entrance.

455
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,278
How much of it?

456
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,864
What do you mean?
The house isn't that big.

457
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,366
The full view of the living room.

458
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,034
Oh, the living room.

459
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,287
Okay. "Full view of the living room."

460
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,873
Mr. Son, this is the list of car scenes.

461
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,292
Will you film them in a tow truck
or on the set?

462
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,044
-The set for many lines.
-All of them?

463
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,545
-On the set on hot days.
-It's summer.

464
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,464
-The set.
-Okay.

465
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:50,840
Drama is all about the set.

466
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,759
-Set.
-Well.

467
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:54,719
This is the styling concept sent from

468
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,179
Ju-yeon and Sin-ae.

469
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,350
Tell them not to doll up. Keep it natural.

470
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,102
Don't doll up. Keep it natural. Okay.

471
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,895
This is the concept for hair. How is it?

472
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,188
Don't doll up. Keep it natural.

473
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,107
-Don't doll up. Keep it natural. Okay.
-Okay.

474
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,317
Are Scene 24 and 25 in Episode 1
shot on the same day?

475
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,278
-Yes.
-How about Scene 34 and 35?

476
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,529
-Different days?
-Different days.

477
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,489
May I go to the restroom?

478
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,574
-Next.
-What kind of flowers

479
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,201
are we using for Scene 40, Episode 1?

480
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,494
-Pretty flowers.
-How many?

481
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,329
-Enough.
-Should we wrap it in plastic

482
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,622
or paper?

483
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,000
That's hard.

484
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,127
Which wig should we use

485
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,753
-for Sin-ae's disguise?
-The right one.

486
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,797
Which design for the tattoo
on Gyeong-jae's back?

487
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,551
He once planned to have a trendy one,
size of two fingers,

488
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,386
but he got swayed by
the yakuza-style tattoo.

489
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,722
Make it look like something in between.

490
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,475
What shall I order for lunch?

491
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:43,977
Anything you want.

492
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,481
The director swears in Scene 33,
Episode 2.

493
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,275
Will it be revised or bleeped out?

494
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,986
-Bleeped.
-How much of it should be heard?

495
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,448
You can tell it's obviously a swear word,
but it'll be vaguely bleeped,

496
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,783
so it'll be hard
for the inspectors to tell.

497
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,244
It'll be so vague that it will
make them think for 16 episodes

498
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,247
whether they should give us
a warning or not.

499
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:09,294
How many lanes will Dong-u run across
in Scene 6, Episode 3?

500
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,378
Six lanes.

501
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,464
It'll be hard to get permission for that.

502
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,215
-Five lanes.
-That too.

503
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,843
Four lanes.

504
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,220
-Three lanes.
-Okay.

505
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,224
The pretty flowers you mentioned earlier,

506
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,769
what kind of flowers are pretty?

507
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,610
When you say "enough",

508
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,236
how many...

509
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,783
I'll have them wrapped in paper.

510
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,162
What should I order for dinner?

511
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,289
Anything you want.

512
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,596
DIRECTOR SON

513
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,769
-Su-hui.
-Yes?

514
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,813
-Something feels odd.
-What is it this time?

515
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,564
I've promised myself

516
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,525
-I'd write five pages a day.
-Okay.

517
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,402
Let's say there are 40 pages per episode.

518
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,904
-I should've finished one in eight days.
-Right.

519
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,532
But why haven't I finished an episode
after 15 days?

520
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,325
Because you didn't keep the promise.

521
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:39,551
I've been sitting here for hours,
but why haven't I written a page?

522
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,513
How could I spend the whole day
on writing a line?

523
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,390
Because that's all you think about.

524
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,809
It's 6 p.m. I should get off work.

525
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,603
You're not planning to finish your quota
but going home.

526
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,605
I promised myself to get off work at six.

527
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,899
So why is that the only promise you keep?

528
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:58,486
I should keep the promise I can. Bye.

529
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,364
What does that even mean?

530
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,621
Look at this punk.

531
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,041
He's been leaving me alone
saying he's busy.

532
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,008
Should we make employee ID cards

533
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,760
-for the network staff?
-We should.

534
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,553
-Should we add photos too?
-Yes.

535
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,597
Should they be ID photos?

536
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,391
What else? Family photos?

537
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:29,809
Some people use selfies.

538
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,447
Let's take a five-minute break.

539
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:45,492
Let's have some coffee.

540
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,494
-What do you say?
-Buy us some coffee.

541
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,745
Sure. What do you want?

542
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,551
-Hello?
-I want to see you.

543
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,969
That's good.

544
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,598
But I guess the same thing
isn't happening to you.

545
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,768
I'm dying to see you.
Can't you hear how anxious I am?

546
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,852
It doesn't sound that bad.

547
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,271
Come on. My hands shook in the morning
because I needed sugar,

548
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,440
and now, they shake because I need you.

549
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,192
Hand tremor has become
an on-going condition.

550
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,821
But what can I do? I should work.
It's our project.

551
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,324
Don't try to get away
with your sweet talk.

552
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,828
You always say that.

553
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,580
All right. Go back to your meeting.

554
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,167
Okay. Don't skip your meal. Eat slowly.

555
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,169
Smooch, smooch.

556
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,963
Captain fart!

557
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,091
I'm proud of you.

558
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,303
Okay.

559
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,640
Okay. Enjoy your dinner.

560
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,726
All right. I'll call you later. Bye.

561
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,029
Laugh or something.

562
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,282
What's the matter?

563
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,076
Why are you staring at me?

564
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,460
He doesn't want to see this?

565
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,588
Is that even possible?

566
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:25,800
Fine. I'll approach this
from a man's point of view.

567
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,980
I told you not to come to my work.

568
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:41,816
Ms. Hwang.

569
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,526
Had you told me to come,
I wouldn't have come.

570
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,737
You still don't know me.

571
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,655
Why should I know you?

572
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,282
I know a quiet cafe nearby.

573
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,533
I know one too.

574
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,787
Someone should give him a ticket.

575
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,427
I can't stay for long. Be quick.

576
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:12,055
Let the coffee cool first.

577
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:13,806
Let it cool while you talk.

578
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,188
Look at this.

579
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,569
Did you call me here
to brag about your house?

580
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,908
I built a house in Jeju Island.

581
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,745
There's too much fine dust here.

582
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,665
To think that In-guk is breathing
and running around

583
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,458
in this city...

584
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,336
It's not right.

585
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:48,841
You want to take In-guk?

586
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,803
Do you want to die?
I can kill you right here.

587
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,139
You've changed a lot.

588
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,975
That's good.

589
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,062
How could I take In-guk from you?

590
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,940
I... Well...

591
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,402
How about

592
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,155
-we live together?
-What?

593
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,908
I mean, I know apologizing for what I did

594
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,411
won't make you forgive me.

595
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,871
That's why I'd like to make up for it

596
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,250
for the rest of my life.

597
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,629
If you give me the last chance, that is.

598
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,384
Why are you being like this
all of a sudden?

599
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,886
It's not all of a sudden.
I thought about this for long.

600
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,305
Why did you think about this for long?

601
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,725
I've lost my faith in you.

602
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,727
Be as honest as you can,

603
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,354
then maybe I'll consider listening to you.

604
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,071
To tell you the truth,

605
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,699
I am...

606
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,162
a bit sick.

607
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,373
I'm not sure if I'll be cured.

608
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,543
I don't know.

609
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,627
What?

610
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,886
You're the worst.

611
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,764
So you're sick?

612
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,767
-Is that why?
-I'm sorry.

613
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,311
I know I'm shameless.

614
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,896
So you need a caregiver now?

615
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,230
It's not like that.

616
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:29,025
I have enough money to hire a caregiver.

617
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,360
Fine. Go on.

618
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,322
How sick are you? Are you dying?

619
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,698
Well...

620
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,246
Why are you doing this to me?

621
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,124
Why...

622
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,711
Why are you ruining my life?

623
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,882
What did I do so wrong to you?

624
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,762
I'll receive treatments. I'll get better.

625
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,766
I'll have to change my constitution
to cure rhinitis.

626
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,477
It's hard to fully recover.

627
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,561
What?

628
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,485
-"Rhinitis"?
-Yes.

629
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,404
It's getting worse.

630
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:18,407
I can't use toilet roll
because it has a lot of dust.

631
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,409
I can only use facial tissues.

632
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,995
And it costs quite a lot.

633
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,542
To think that this is all
because of fine dust...

634
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:49,480
I made a mistake talking
for too long with you.

635
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,066
It's my fault. Right.

636
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,902
I'll get going.

637
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,282
I'm not done talking.

638
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,325
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

639
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,496
I meant it when I said I want
to get back with you.

640
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,526
I'm sorry.

641
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,570
I'm a junior member of staff
at Ms. Hwang's company.

642
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,656
It's my job to take care of
her unfinished business.

643
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,200
You can sue me.

644
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,423
I'm sorry.

645
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:04,138
I'm sorry. I got worried and followed you.

646
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,350
Why were you worried?

647
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,855
All the weird things that are around you.

648
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,568
He is a weirdo indeed.

649
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,320
I'm sorry.

650
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:22,365
He's still In-guk's dad. Out of impulse...

651
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:23,908
Don't worry.

652
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,913
He's usually good at dodging
and running away.

653
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,416
It's really hard to hit him. Great job.

654
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:36,879
But what if he actually sues you?

655
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,131
Then it happens.

656
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,097
How did you punch him
to knock him down like that?

657
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,434
Well, the jaw.

658
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,271
The jaw?

659
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,148
Just below the mouth.

660
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,364
Anyway, this is how I feel.

661
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,451
I can't let you go.

662
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:11,998
Thanks.

663
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,167
Hold on tight so I can't go.

664
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,086
Okay.

665
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:34,895
Is that what you call
"approaching from a man's point of view"?

666
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,523
Yes. Men are weak
when it comes to pretty women.

667
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,483
I'm pretty enough already,

668
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,777
but given the situation,
I need to become prettier.

669
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,446
What kind of situation is that?

670
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,615
Work is taking my boyfriend away from me.

671
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,579
It sounds serious.

672
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,955
Is it?

673
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,125
Yes. Men like to make
working sound really important.

674
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,918
"Let me off. I'm working."

675
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,545
They think it's only right
to think that way.

676
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:00,629
Why do they do that?

677
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:05,051
It's part of the instinct they had
when they had to hunt in the past.

678
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,428
Why is their instinct so behind time?

679
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,847
Ask them to keep up.

680
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,599
I'll try.

681
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:15,144
-I put In-guk to sleep.
-Thanks.

682
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,980
Don't you want any beer?

683
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:20,691
Something happened to her, right?

684
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,446
You're right. Something happened,

685
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,532
but let me gather my thoughts
before talking to you.

686
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:14,745
Gosh, he isn't the only one who works.

687
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,059
-Hi, Ms. Lim.
-Are you still at work?

688
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,688
Yes. I'm looking for some clips
I can use as a reference.

689
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:43,232
-It's late. What did you do today?
-I don't know.

690
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,608
You don't know what you did today?

691
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,361
No, I don't. I'm going to sleep. Bye.

692
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,823
You must be tired. Goodnight.

693
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,096
Gosh, this is bad.

694
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,556
All right.

695
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,850
I'm letting him off the hook today.

696
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,103
Damn it. That fool.

697
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,195
Since we'll have to start shooting
outdoor first,

698
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,655
we took some photos of the location.

699
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:34,909
This can be the alleyway
around Ju-yeon's house.

700
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,368
Here.

701
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,371
Wait, that's...

702
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,540
-Go back.
-Okay.

703
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,334
-One more.
-Okay.

704
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,295
I think I saw this photo
for the last drama.

705
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,215
Are you reusing it?

706
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:52,343
Oh, I opened the wrong folder.

707
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,971
No, you didn't. You just opened Things
Will Be Fine Once You Turn Thirty.

708
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:59,934
Oh, I named the folder wrong.

709
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:08,901
We need to discuss
the concept of our shoot too.

710
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,070
Let's schedule another meeting.

711
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,614
So-min is shooting a documentary now.

712
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,283
Can she bring a cameraman with her?

713
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,869
Sure. As long as it doesn't get leaked
before it gets aired.

714
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,456
Okay. And it seems we'll have to
create Team B.

715
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,250
Do you have anyone in mind?

716
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,376
Yes, I do.

717
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,172
I want you to be my Team B.

718
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,219
Do you mean it? How can I?

719
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,388
-Just do it. I don't have time.
-But...

720
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,306
Stop annoying me. Be quiet.

721
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,225
I'm glad you acknowledge my--

722
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,894
I do acknowledge that you have
a lot of free time.

723
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:47,815
I'm about to lose my mind,
so don't talk to me.

724
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,484
Okay.

725
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,947
Beom-su.

726
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,367
Can you let me talk to you about my worry?

727
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,162
You're going to talk about Da-mi again.
Is she your only kind of worry?

728
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,373
Yes. I just want to know.

729
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,294
Why is it so hard to reach her at night?

730
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,004
Go and ask her yourself.

731
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,338
-She says she slept.
-Then she did.

732
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,216
Well, she could call me
before going to bed, right?

733
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,552
One time, we were texting
but she wouldn't answer her phone.

734
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,137
-What's that about?
-I don't know.

735
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:22,099
She started nitpicking and said
she's too upset to talk.

736
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,393
You should've behaved better
so she wouldn't nitpick you.

737
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:26,895
-So I should've been perfect.
-Yes.

738
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,733
Try to talk to her and see what's wrong.

739
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:34,320
I tried, but whenever I do, I lose.

740
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,572
I always end up apologizing.

741
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,907
All I want to know

742
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,994
is why she doesn't answer her phone.

743
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,788
I don't know.
How in the world would I know that?

744
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,791
Hey, both you and I.

745
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:50,127
We're respected here as directors,

746
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,337
but outside,

747
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,214
we're just two lame guys.

748
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,759
But you're better than me.
You're in Team A and I'm in B.

749
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,720
Go and tell Da-mi your worry
as if it were mine.

750
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,640
She wouldn't know it's about her
and start giving advice.

751
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,768
Come on.
Of course, she'll know it's about her.

752
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,729
She loves to talk. I'm sure she won't.

753
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,614
I decided to manage Beom-su's Team B.

754
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,783
Will you be all right with that?

755
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,993
The schedule has been moved up,

756
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,579
so at least he'll need a reliable Team B.

757
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,416
Why would he need a reliable team?

758
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,962
I think he's got some problems
with his girlfriend as well as work.

759
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,799
That's why the director and the writer

760
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,967
shouldn't have gotten hooked
before the drama is over.

761
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,596
Why? What kind of problem?

762
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,890
Never mind. It's his business.

763
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,602
How can we not mind it?
It's our friend's business.

764
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,980
I read 26 magazines a month.
I'm the expert here. Tell me.

765
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,983
It's nothing serious.
He can't reach her at night.

766
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,568
Maybe she went to bed a couple of times...

767
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,696
It's common. It's so obvious.

768
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,657
-Is it?
-There's always a reason.

769
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,951
She doesn't pick up because she can't.

770
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:05,202
There are only three cases

771
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,870
where one can't answer the phone at night.

772
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:07,913
Three cases?

773
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,250
When you're bedridden, mourning,
or don't give a shit.

774
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,462
It's either disease, funeral,
or you don't give a shit.

775
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:19,258
That's right. And you can't be ill
or be at a funeral all the time.

776
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,135
You don't give a shit
when he's your boyfriend?

777
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,928
That just doesn't make sense.

778
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,513
Then what does it mean?

779
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,016
It means she was doing something
that she's not very proud of.

780
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,811
Like going out drinking with guys

781
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,729
or going clubbing.

782
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,737
-Did I just get fooled?
-If that's how you feel.

783
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:46,410
Well, that's me.

784
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,328
I went out to drink.

785
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:52,082
I make plans with my friends
every quarter.

786
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,917
I couldn't cancel those plans,

787
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,836
and it hasn't been long
since we started dating.

788
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:59,590
If I kept going out,
it'd make me look bad.

789
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,301
That's why I avoided your calls and lied.

790
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,428
I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore.

791
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:08,599
Okay. Well, it's fine.

792
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,851
-It's understandable.
-Don't get disappointed.

793
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,729
-Okay.
-Go on and work on your Team B.

794
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,564
Okay.

795
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,617
It feels iffy but relieving.

796
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,330
It feels relieving but iffy.

797
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:36,543
I won but why does it feel like I lost?

798
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,441
MR. SON

799
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:04,863
Are you busy?

800
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,625
In a meeting. I'll call you after this.

801
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,842
-It's 6 p.m.
-I'll work as well.

802
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,387
Does he think I have nothing to do?

803
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,597
Come on.

804
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,736
MR. SON

805
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,032
Yes, Mr. Son.

806
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,034
What are you doing?

807
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,079
I'm working.

808
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,872
I'm sorry.

809
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,043
-For what?
-For asking that too late.

810
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,088
It's more annoying that you know it.

811
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,008
Right. I understand. I apologize.

812
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:09,678
Forget it. What are you doing anyway?

813
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:13,890
I was watching the audition clips
and didn't realize the time.

814
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,144
-Did you eat?
-No.

815
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,230
Shall we go to eat something nice
and go for a walk?

816
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,151
I'll consider it in a positive light.

817
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,236
Thank you.

818
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,869
I'm getting off work.

819
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:49,217
Just be nice to me.
I don't need you to be shy.

820
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,594
Is that so?

821
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,304
Come in.

822
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,983
When I look at So-min's eyes,

823
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,695
it feels like they are
asking me questions.

824
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:10,614
How should I put this?

825
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,034
They are innocent and full of curiosity.

826
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,995
They are like those of a smart kid

827
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,248
who wants to find out the answer herself
instead of asking the adults.

828
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:24,461
She's basically innocent
and has a passion for her work.

829
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,630
And I'm grateful

830
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:28,799
that I get to work with someone like her.

831
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,851
You could've been like this before.

832
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,062
Thank you.

833
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,280
I deleted them.

834
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,783
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

835
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,703
Do you want some beer?

836
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,250
Don't you get cute with me.

837
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,637
It's not that I'm trying to save my money.

838
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,098
I had some great snacks at the studio.

839
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,267
It's dried smelt.

840
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,102
Try it.

841
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,450
-It's good.
-Do you want to take some?

842
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,826
I have a lot at my studio.

843
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:41,329
Do you know
that being nice actually suits you?

844
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,750
Of course. I'm doing my best to be nice.

845
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,168
It's really uncomfortable,

846
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,044
but my superhuman power
is helping me get through.

847
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,338
Those photos were no big deal.
They were cute.

848
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:51,339
I don't like cute.

849
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,091
You like kids, but you don't like cute?

850
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,010
I don't want to be cute.

851
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:56,261
-That's cute.
-No.

852
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:58,305
-You're cute.
-Damn it.

853
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,518
Can't you be nice when you work too?

854
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:06,772
Does yelling or cursing
make things better?

855
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,023
I can't control myself.

856
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,234
That's why I say something
they don't understand.

857
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,737
It's not about the language.

858
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,822
They can feel the energy.

859
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,743
Sorry?

860
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:21,745
They won't understand me in Africa.

861
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,956
I'm going to go to Africa.

862
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,085
Are you going to see the children?

863
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:36,510
I'm going to stay until I get sick
of them this time.

864
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,094
So I'm saving up.

865
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,722
How can you save up
when you keep donating?

866
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:45,644
I actually wanted to ask you something.

867
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,479
At the orphanage...

868
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:50,023
I mean,

869
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:55,153
it was easy to breathe there.

870
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,199
What's there to ask?

871
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,869
Just feel what you feel.

872
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:05,497
Right.

873
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,500
-Thanks.
-For what?

874
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,837
I don't know. I just feel that way.

875
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,015
Then...

876
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,101
Gosh.

877
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,688
What's the big deal?

878
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,190
God.

879
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,862
Here.

880
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,949
I've deleted them all.

881
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,033
What about the copies?

882
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,953
Come on. We're not in a crime film.

883
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,336
I'm finished. See you later.

884
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:56,172
Delete them from your memories too.

885
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,728
LEE SO-MIN

886
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,316
Director.

887
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:27,078
-How fast can you run 100m?
-15 seconds.

888
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,872
You're really fast.

889
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:53,229
You've been a bit upset
since yesterday, haven't you?

890
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:55,398
No.

891
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,945
"Upset" makes me sound petty.

892
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:03,198
Then how should we describe this?

893
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,867
Something that's along the same line.

894
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:10,288
I'm looking at you in a negative light.
That would do.

895
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,625
I see.

896
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,836
So you're hurt.

897
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:22,467
I was crazy busy.
I had to confirm every single thing.

898
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,052
That's an excuse.

899
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,350
I don't see why this is an excuse.

900
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,520
I had to work.
It's not like I met my friends

901
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,522
or drank all night long.

902
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:39,025
I made the time to meet you
amidst my busy schedule.

903
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,611
You made the time?

904
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:46,616
Did that phrase upset you?

905
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,912
You and I are both very busy.

906
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:55,250
Isn't it great that we still manage
to make time for each other?

907
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,296
I don't want to be someone

908
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,966
my boyfriend needs to make
time to meet with.

909
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,175
Should we not meet at all then?

910
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,095
That's not what's important here.

911
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,263
Gosh, this is frustrating.

912
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,933
I understand it's hard to meet
if you're busy.

913
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:15,395
But I'd hate that.
That's why I make time to see you.

914
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,813
No, that's not what I mean.

915
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,899
Whether we meet briefly
or don't meet at all,

916
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,360
what matters is how we feel
for each other.

917
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:27,490
I feel like you're treating me
like the laundry

918
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,075
you've been procrastinating.

919
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:32,287
How can you say that?

920
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,622
Why would you talk like that?

921
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:39,169
Laundry? Procrastinating?

922
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:47,218
Gosh, you know that both of us are busy.
Why do you always let this upset you?

923
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,933
"Always"?

924
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,519
What do you mean, "always"?

925
00:55:58,563 --> 00:56:00,315
I never did this.

926
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,192
This is my first time.

927
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,777
You're right.

928
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:13,995
Did I just get the baton
passed on from your ex-girlfriend?

929
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,539
I made it sound misleading.

930
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:20,001
I'm sorry. It's my bad.

931
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:21,669
I'm sorry.

932
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,637
I started at my own starting line.

933
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,055
You're right.

934
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:35,141
I'm going to be

935
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,435
disappointed in you today.

936
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,480
I'll get going.

937
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,744
Ms. Lim.

938
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,373
I'm sorry.

939
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,794
If a human being didn't make
the same mistake repeatedly,

940
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,047
it'd be the best to date
someone who's dated a lot of times.

941
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:09,300
But then,
why did they end up dating so many times?

942
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:12,595
Gosh,
I won't let the variables take me down.

943
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:16,391
There are more good things
than bad things about you.

944
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:19,436
Follow me already.

945
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:24,274
-What?
-Why are you so far behind?

946
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,029
Weren't we going to walk apart,

947
00:57:30,113 --> 00:57:31,990
go home, regret all night long,

948
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,700
and apologize tomorrow?

949
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,663
-Come to me.
-Sorry?

950
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,123
I said to come to me.

951
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,334
-You want me to come to you now?
-Should I go?

952
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:46,421
I'm the generous one here.
Should I walk there too?

953
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,142
What is this?

954
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,646
I feel like I survived without doing much
at the brink of death.

955
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,774
This is how generous I am.

956
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,485
You're lucky.

957
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,531
Since I met you, I've been thinking
maybe I saved the country

958
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,493
in my previous life, but that wasn't it.

959
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:20,288
I must have saved a lot more than that.
I must have been a hero.

960
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,417
Gosh, a hero? You happy now?

961
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,838
I'll never do it again.

962
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,508
Of course, you won't.
Were you going to do it again?

963
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,598
This is something In-guk shouldn't hear.

964
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,558
So we'll whisper from now on.

965
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:49,734
I met his dad.

966
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:54,239
He wants to get back together.

967
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,574
I'm thinking about it.

968
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,451
Why would you even think about that?

969
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,621
Don't tell me you're thinking about it.

970
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:06,042
I should've just killed him then.

971
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,129
Gosh, you really are thinking about it.
Are you crazy?

972
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:14,133
Don't even think about it.
Just swear at him and forget about it.

973
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:16,135
He was so fast.

974
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,972
Don't get so emotional.

975
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:24,727
Don't even think about it. Stop it.

976
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,021
I'm going to cut our ties if you do.

977
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,856
That's a bit too much.

978
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:33,027
How can I not think about this?

979
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:37,407
Why would you need to?
Do you still have feelings for him?

980
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,826
-No, I don't!
-Then why?

981
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,620
Wait. Things are getting too heated up.

982
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,330
Calm down.

983
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,625
So...

984
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,504
Okay. Because you have In-guk,

985
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,716
I know you can't think
only about yourself.

986
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,634
I'm not saying she should only think
about herself.

987
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,303
I'm saying she should put herself first.

988
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,888
That's thinking about myself only.

989
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,974
-It's different.
-How?

990
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:10,523
It's just different,
so stop talking nonsense.

991
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:13,568
Stop it. Let me hit him
from behind this time.

992
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,487
I'll come with you.
Let's hit him from front and back.

993
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,368
Hey, why won't you care about how I feel?

994
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,746
You're telling me how you feel.

995
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,333
Have you ever given birth to a child?

996
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:29,959
Have you raised a child without his dad?

997
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:32,920
Have you put yourselves in my shoes?

998
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,339
Or In-guk's?

999
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:37,133
Have you thought about how he lives
or how this would influence him?

1000
01:00:37,216 --> 01:00:39,510
That hurts.

1001
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,346
We care about In-guk too.

1002
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,764
If you do,

1003
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:47,393
then you should seriously consider
these things.

1004
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:50,229
Why are you telling me
not to even think about it?

1005
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:53,900
It's because he doesn't deserve it.
He's not normal.

1006
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,694
Don't badmouth In-guk's dad.

1007
01:00:57,236 --> 01:01:00,657
Are you ditching me
and taking his side now?

1008
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:04,452
People could change over time, you know.

1009
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,081
He asked you to get back together
just like that because he changed?

1010
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,124
He never even tried.

1011
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,626
He has no manners. He hasn't changed.

1012
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:13,753
Why are you being so negative?

1013
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,464
-Because he's a jerk.
-He is a jerk.

1014
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,426
People don't change that easily.

1015
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:23,721
And nothing changes what he did to you.

1016
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:29,268
Now that the kid's grown up,
he's talking nonsense.

1017
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:31,229
Tell him to get lost.

1018
01:01:31,312 --> 01:01:34,190
-I can never live with him.
-Of course not.

1019
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:35,900
Wait.

1020
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,653
Lower it down. You might wake him up.

1021
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:42,907
Oh, we're whispering already.

1022
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,496
It's become strange.

1023
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:51,165
They were arguing,
but now they are on the same side.

1024
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:55,670
Well, how did you form an ally
after swinging knives at each other?

1025
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,173
What is this?

1026
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,511
Why did you suddenly start agreeing to me?

1027
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:08,850
Well, I...

1028
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:14,522
I don't intend to find
my happiness in men.

1029
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,524
That's the right thing to do.

1030
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,695
But because you changed your stance,

1031
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,739
you made it awkward for me.

1032
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,868
But I still want to date.

1033
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:32,582
I want to sweet-talk with guys
and go on dates.

1034
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:33,916
There you go.

1035
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,754
And do some dirty things too.

1036
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,006
Or is this not right?

1037
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:44,510
Whatever. You're actually the one
that likes those things the most.

1038
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,221
Anyway, I have no intention

1039
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,474
of moving in with him

1040
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,476
at all.

1041
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:55,813
Something about this conversation...

1042
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,567
It's going in the right direction,
but it's strange.

1043
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:00,735
What happened?

1044
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:03,863
It's because of Han-ju.
You should've said so from the start.

1045
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,199
What does that make me?
I threw a fit and swore at you.

1046
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,658
Well...

1047
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,288
I should act as if I thought about it

1048
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,082
so I'd feel less sorry to In-guk.

1049
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:25,343
Gosh, so you used me

1050
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:26,761
to feel less sorry to In-guk?

1051
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,722
You're losing yourself as you age.

1052
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,516
It's because she lives with you.

1053
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,060
Anyway,

1054
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,521
to tell you the truth,

1055
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,359
I'm seeing someone.

1056
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,706
Now, I feel hungry.

1057
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,919
Why did I even throw a fit?

1058
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:09,512
Gosh.

1059
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,724
-I'm sorry.
-What was all this?

1060
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,551
COMPROMISES, FALLING APART

1061
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,512
COMPROMISES, FALLING APART

1062
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:54,849
THE AGGRESSIVE PROCESS OF FALLING APART

1063
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,644
GETTING TO KNOW MORE ABOUT EACH OTHER

1064
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,855
IS LIKE FACING A SERIES OF VARIABLES

1065
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:03,566
LOVE, IN THE END,
IS ABOUT FIGHTING THE VARIABLES

1066
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:07,987
WHAT'S THERE TO ASK?

1067
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,114
JUST FEEL

1068
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:13,576
WHAT YOU FEEL

1069
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,996
SINCE I MET YOU,

1070
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,706
I'VE BEEN THINKING

1071
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:20,458
MAYBE I SAVED THE COUNTRY

1072
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,001
IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE, BUT THAT WASN'T IT

1073
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:24,462
I MUST HAVE SAVED A LOT MORE THAN THAT

1074
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:28,549
I love you.

1075
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:30,468
The sound couldn't have come
from a human being.

1076
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,136
How lovely.

1077
01:05:32,219 --> 01:05:34,055
-I love you.
-I love you.

1078
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:35,348
I love you.

1079
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,975
When I was young,
I got lost because didn't know better.

1080
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,810
Nowadays, I get lost
because I pretend not to know.

1081
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,771
Let's stay clueless
for the rest of our lives.

1082
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:43,648
-I love you.
-I love you.

1083
01:05:43,731 --> 01:05:44,607
Is that a proposal?

1084
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,692
I'll do it anyway, so I just did it now.

1085
01:05:46,901 --> 01:05:48,778
-I love you.
-I love you.

1086
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,738
You're a head manager.
Why accompany her to the salon?

1087
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:52,573
So-min, do you need something?

1088
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:54,033
Min-jun is mine.

1089
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,078
-I love you.
-I love you.

1090
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,997
What do you want to hear from me?

1091
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:01,832
How you really feel.

1092
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:04,168
-I love you.
-Do you want to go to Africa with me?

1093
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,838
When you come back, I'll be gone too.

1094
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,299
Let's meet there. You and I.

1095
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:13,260
-I love you.
-I love you.

1096
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:14,887
You're not going to marry me?

1097
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:17,640
I don't want a wedding
in the last episode.

1098
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:18,683
So an open ending?

1099
01:06:18,766 --> 01:06:22,520
Just stay like this at this pace
and be with me forever.

1100
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,606
As always, we had fun
talking to each other today,

1101
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,108
enjoyed our food together,

1102
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,693
and are happily in love.

1103
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:32,780
SIN-AE, DONG-U, AND GYEONG-JAE
LOOK AT JU-YEON WITH HAPPY FACES

1104
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:36,701
JU-YEON MEETS EACH OF THEIR EYES
AND SMILES

1105
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:39,495
JU-YEON
PERHAPS, WE ARE BOUND TO BE...

1106
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,998
