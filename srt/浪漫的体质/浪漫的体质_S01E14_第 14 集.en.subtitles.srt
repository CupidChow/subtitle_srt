1
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,684
In-guk, this is weird.

2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,853
I know this can't be,

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,314
but strangely, my body feels light.

4
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,734
I bet. It's because we overslept.

5
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,444
I see.

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,614
-It's not the weekend, right?
-No.

7
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:15,658
-It's not a national holiday, either.
-Right.

8
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,628
In-guk, didn't you hear the alarm?

9
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,838
-Why didn't you wake up?
-Beats me.

10
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,799
Why didn't you wake me up?

11
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,842
You didn't on purpose
to be late for school, didn't you?

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,344
I'm not sure.

13
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,555
Come on.

14
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,602
Wake up. Please.

15
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:48,650
-Hello.
-Hi.

16
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:51,486
-Hello.
-Hello.

17
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,530
Good morning.

18
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,532
Hello, sir.

19
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,278
I'll clean up.

20
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,492
You need to get to work.

21
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,995
You didn't get much sleep, either.

22
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,873
Are you worried about me?

23
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,583
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,502
I'll clean it up. I made the mess.

25
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:56,843
-Hi, ma'am.
-Hello.

26
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,927
Hello.

27
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,721
-Hi.
-Hello.

28
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,389
Is Ms. Hwang here yet?

29
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,390
Well...

30
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,601
-Let's have a meeting this morning.
-Okay.

31
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,822
It's not even urgent.
Why did you stay all up night?

32
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,574
What?

33
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,743
Just because.

34
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,790
I have a lot of footages,
so I've been getting stressed.

35
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,459
And I had a slight headache.

36
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,210
You worked when you had a headache?

37
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,755
That means you're a workaholic.

38
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,174
It's better than being a gambler
or a drug addict.

39
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,968
Most people would do
something called resting.

40
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,721
I see. You're right.

41
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:07,121
You never go for a run.
Why did you suddenly want to run?

42
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,915
You didn't get much sleep, either.

43
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,834
You're right. Why won't you let me sleep?

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
People might get the wrong idea.

45
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,673
Aren't you tired?

46
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,718
Something didn't feel right
when I was with them.

47
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,679
Them?

48
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,747
They seemed younger than I expected.

49
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,791
Who? You?

50
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,875
No, them.

51
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,711
What's wrong with that? What?

52
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,170
They were prettier than I remembered.

53
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,798
What's your point? You're prettier.

54
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,174
Obviously.

55
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,343
Then, what's wrong? What is it?

56
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,928
I'm prettier,

57
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,056
but it wasn't overwhelming.

58
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,725
Goodness, damn it.

59
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,022
I'm an actress, so I take care of myself.

60
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,857
Even without that,
I was prettier than them.

61
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,067
So I should be overwhelmingly
prettier than them.

62
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,654
but for some reason,
my presence wasn't overwhelming.

63
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,908
So you're saying that you won,
but you own by decision?

64
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,910
You didn't knock them out.
You scored more points?

65
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,996
Is that why something doesn't feel right?

66
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,791
No, there shouldn't have been a match,
to begin with.

67
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,129
But I think you're setting up
the match on your own.

68
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,672
Let's go. Get up.

69
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,091
I won't go. Hey.

70
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,678
You'll age faster
if you run without getting enough sleep.

71
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,264
Stop running.

72
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,851
I won't do it.

73
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,312
I won't.

74
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,900
JU-YEON, SIN-AE, AND HO-PAL
LOOK AT HER AS IF THEY FIND HER PATHETIC

75
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,907
SHE AWKWARDLY WINS AT HO-PAL

76
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,585
-Jin-joo.
-Yes?

77
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,753
It's hard, isn't it?

78
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:21,923
No, I'm okay.
I just feel like I'm going to die soon.

79
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,801
You're okay. You didn't say
you were about to die right away.

80
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,969
I'm happy.

81
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,809
Rest for a bit.

82
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,645
Yes. I think I need to rest.

83
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,439
-How should I rest?
-While sitting up.

84
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,275
While writing your script.

85
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,071
Right. Rest up like that.

86
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,199
You give me a lot of moral support.

87
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,742
I'm glad to hear it.

88
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,291
She's working hard on her scripts.

89
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,836
How can I ask her to include
a massage chair in her scripts?

90
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,757
I'm happy to get sponsors, but still.

91
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,302
Whatever. Anyway,
until she finishes the script

92
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,929
for the eighth episode, don't call her.

93
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,390
Besides, why massage chairs?
I won't accept that.

94
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,724
Are we clear?

95
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,232
-Hey, why are you so upset this morning?
-Your face is more upsetting.

96
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,775
Are we running an inn here?

97
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,528
He's busy
because he'll start filming soon.

98
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,823
And I'm busy because I'm dating.
We're busy for different reasons.

99
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,116
Good for you.

100
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,993
-I guess things are going well.
-Yes.

101
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:35,955
Hey, Da-mi doesn't answer my calls
or texts when she goes out for drinks.

102
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,041
I was really upset, so I did
the same thing to her yesterday.

103
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,585
So that's going well.

104
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,671
Yes. I didn't check my phone last night
and went drinking and had fun.

105
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,965
-Do you know what happened to me, then?
-What happened?

106
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,258
I got tired.

107
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,096
Oh, right.
Something more important happened.

108
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,057
-What is it?
-Da-mi didn't text or call me at all.

109
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:58,227
She can see right through me.

110
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,521
Just go to sleep.

111
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,523
Go to sleep.

112
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,193
I should drink a cup of horse bean tea.

113
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,055
I sort of expected this would happen.

114
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:36,766
But my feelings for her were strong enough
to make me risk it.

115
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,144
If I were to disregard my feelings
because things may be awkward between us,

116
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:43,105
I thought that
it would be a silly thing to do.

117
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,483
If you need an explanation
to help you understand,

118
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,527
I will do so.

119
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,779
You don't need to explain this to me.

120
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,365
Don't worry.

121
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,117
Will you keep avoiding me?

122
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,287
-I didn't avoid you.
-Is that really true?

123
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,167
-I just turned away from you.
-They sound about the same.

124
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,212
Okay. I cannot force anything.

125
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,423
I understand.

126
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,188
Sir.

127
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,442
-Do you want to arm-wrestle with me?
-Arm-wrestle?

128
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,821
It's an unexpected turn of events.

129
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,032
I want to beat you at something.

130
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,451
With my strength.

131
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,580
Do you think you can beat me?

132
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,082
Well,

133
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,085
I don't think it will be hard.

134
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,976
What is this match for?

135
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,395
Money? Honor? Love?

136
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:09,066
All right. Whatever it may be,
don't be a sore loser.

137
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,443
Even if there's no return match,

138
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,736
you can't call the other a coward.

139
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,987
Even if your wrists break,

140
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,488
you'll cover medical bills on your own.

141
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,407
All right. Get ready. Go.

142
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,310
-Why are you staring at me like that?
-I'm working.

143
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,062
Sitting there is part of your job?

144
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:50,191
You're a writer.
You shouldn't go out drinking,

145
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,234
especially not with the president
of an agency,

146
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,028
especially not with men.

147
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,323
Which one is the problem?
His job or his gender?

148
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:58,616
He is the problem itself.

149
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,077
Mr. Sung, are you jealous?

150
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,414
I'm the CP of this drama.

151
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,750
I have to protect my writer.

152
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,420
I don't think a writer whose drama
is about to be filmed should drink.

153
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,798
I heard the writer, Park Hae-yeong,
doesn't even eat raw food

154
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,174
to avoid getting food poisoned.

155
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,343
That's the responsibility of a writer.

156
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:22,473
Just by looking at you, I feel exhausted.

157
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,350
That's a skill.

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,521
-Hello.
-Hi.

159
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,151
I made an appointment with Ms. Jung.

160
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,778
I see. Okay. You can go in.

161
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:39,448
-Did you cure your hangover?
-Welcome. Come in.

162
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,121
What? Why are you here?

163
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,248
I'm the CP of this drama.

164
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,126
Didn't you know that?

165
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,544
Why are you here?

166
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:54,880
What would you like to drink?

167
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,757
Anything cold will do.

168
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,179
I came by to give her the profiles
of the actors in my agency.

169
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,098
She said there were still
a few roles to fill.

170
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,893
Did the president have to come himself?
It sounds more like a manager's job to me.

171
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,437
No, I do things myself.

172
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,188
That way,
they'll get a chance to audition.

173
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,440
Give them to the director.

174
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,401
Why did you barge into her studio?
You're distracting her from her job.

175
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:17,194
She asked me to come, so I did.

176
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,322
Considering the effort you make,
the outcome doesn't seem so great.

177
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,825
That's why I work harder, sir.

178
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,909
I said that to piss you off.

179
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,619
-Why did you laugh?
-No, I'm pissed off.

180
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,496
That's how you look when you're pissed?

181
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,374
Yes. This is how I look when I'm pissed.

182
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,172
You're ugly.

183
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,766
Please allow me to tell you
that you are twice...

184
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,353
No. You are three
to four times uglier than me.

185
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,942
Thank you for the cool drink.

186
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,112
Here you go.
Here's the profile I promised you.

187
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,241
I'll have a talk with the director.

188
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,784
Put in a good word for me.

189
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,078
-Which one of us is uglier?
-What?

190
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,374
Which one of us is uglier?

191
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,628
What are you saying?

192
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,339
Mr. So is considered handsome.

193
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,632
That's shocking.

194
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,512
Then, are you telling me
that I'm considered ugly?

195
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,180
That's shocking.

196
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,476
Don't tell me that you didn't know
for the past 47 years.

197
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,813
What on earth is going on here?

198
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,661
I don't think
he really knew that about himself.

199
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:56,710
What happened to your chin?

200
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,839
A shaving accident.

201
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,097
Now that casting is done for the drama,

202
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,473
more PPL offers are coming in.

203
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,268
-That's great.
-Our director is the roadblock.

204
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,728
He's famous for turning down
product placement.

205
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,272
He is?

206
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:19,692
His reputation precedes him.
He said no to our marketing team.

207
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,826
I see. The massage chair.

208
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,620
The main character is a poor writer.

209
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,789
It's hard to place this in the drama.

210
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,916
I know that you're crazy busy these days,

211
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,878
but you have eight years of experience
in marketing. Please handle this.

212
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,839
There's too much money at stake
for me to side with the director.

213
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:43,215
Okay.

214
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,344
I'll do it.

215
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,349
-What?
-Ms. Hwang has a lot of work these days.

216
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,976
I can take care of something like this.

217
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,688
I'm not trying to marginalize you,

218
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,150
but you've been in marketing
for eight weeks.

219
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,486
This isn't just something
you can casually take over.

220
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:09,617
It's important from whom I learned
the trade for eight weeks.

221
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,160
I can do this.

222
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,334
It stinks

223
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,342
It's only natural

224
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,479
It's a nice song.

225
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,981
Yes. This song is from Plan D Studio.

226
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,734
The music director said
this might suit the drama well.

227
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,321
I was informed that if you want it,
you can use it as a soundtrack.

228
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,906
They are very eager to participate.

229
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,617
Should I set up a meeting?

230
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,456
-Yes, please do.
-Okay, I will.

231
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,961
But what happened to your wrist?

232
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,590
-Oh, this? I typed too much.
-I see.

233
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,094
-That must be hard.
-It's all right.

234
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:12,972
I'm sorry to bring this up now,

235
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,182
but this is the last of
product placement offers we received.

236
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:16,392
FRIED CHICKEN

237
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,770
MASSAGE CHAIRS
WE'LL SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENCE!

238
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,731
Gosh. I know that it's hard realistically

239
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,693
to produce a drama without advertisement.
I've done this before, haven't I?

240
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,902
For my last drama,

241
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,113
I actually persuaded the writer
to include product placement.

242
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:31,448
But a massage chair
doesn't fit in our drama.

243
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,993
We have a small set to begin with.
Where would we put this?

244
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,954
You can put it in for one episode
and take it out.

245
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,040
This isn't a hand massager. It makes
no sense to take out a chair this big

246
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,041
after using it for a day.

247
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,961
You can come up with an episode
that supports that.

248
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:47,464
The episode can be random.
You can just place it in one scene.

249
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,717
-It's easy.
-You think that's easy?

250
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,554
Of course, it is easy.
I can give you an example.

251
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,724
-Mom.
-In-guk.

252
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,565
Mom. I've been worried.

253
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,902
My gosh. Tell me about it, my son.

254
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,113
I am so bored.

255
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,741
That's why you've been worried.

256
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,578
In that case,
let's spend our time in a meaningful way

257
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,414
with something I prepared in advance.

258
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,923
Mom, what is this big thing?

259
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,761
You know what it is. Why ask?

260
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,430
Mom, I don't really mind,
but I'm just curious.

261
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:40,100
I told you I was bored,
but why are you on the massage chair?

262
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,103
There's no context in this scene, anyway.

263
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,940
Mom, I can't understand
what you just said.

264
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:50,402
And why do we have a massage chair
all of a sudden?

265
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,946
I think that's kind of random.

266
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,450
In this world,
various types of lifestyles exist.

267
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,827
And at times, our beliefs
could be compromised based on

268
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,913
reasons we cannot say no to.

269
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,751
It has to be placed in the drama
for 15 seconds. Please wait.

270
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,635
Okay. It's good now.

271
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,805
I'll come down since it's been 15 seconds.

272
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,809
Since you've started getting the massage,
you should finish it. I can wait.

273
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,936
Shall I?

274
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,862
-Like that?
-Yes, just like that.

275
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:39,076
-You're a genius.
-Thank you.

276
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,454
All right. Let's go talk this over
with my team.

277
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,666
Wait. Then, you'll include this
in your scene, right?

278
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,959
We just did.

279
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,836
We already did that.

280
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,341
-Thank you. Good work.
-Gosh.

281
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,467
It was nothing.

282
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,679
Since you worked hard,
you should have a sip of this.

283
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,389
Shall I?

284
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,573
We're amazing.

285
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,075
-It's all good now. Let's go.
-Okay.

286
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,201
Let's go.

287
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,623
What should we get?

288
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,960
-This place serves good kimchi stew.
-Right.

289
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,879
We'd like to order, please.

290
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,805
Excuse me. Weren't you on TV?

291
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,974
Yes.

292
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,435
I was on TV once. You recognized me.

293
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,439
I'm sorry, but could you please leave?

294
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,817
I don't mind,

295
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,237
but the owner asked you to leave.

296
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,829
Okay.

297
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,790
Let's go.

298
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,471
Are you upset?

299
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,515
Of course. We lost a restaurant
that serves good food.

300
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,726
Is their food good?

301
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,519
Yes.

302
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,063
That's a shame.

303
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,942
Do you want pho?

304
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,860
Sure.

305
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,216
Lately,

306
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,885
he's been showing up in my dreams a lot.

307
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,222
Usually, he doesn't say anything

308
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,058
or gets extremely mad at me.

309
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,310
That's him in my dreams.

310
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,022
Have you seen him behave similarly before?

311
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,983
Not at all.

312
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,193
He's not that kind of person.

313
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,196
He always smiled

314
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,657
and cheered me on.

315
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,996
He was really committed to the point
that it could be boring.

316
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,498
Are you worried
that he might be disappointed?

317
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,875
-Pardon?
-What I mean is,

318
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,004
are you worried it might seem
like you're trying to get over him

319
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,590
and it would disappoint him?

320
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,634
No.

321
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,934
I feel like I'm using him.

322
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,898
It's not that I'm disappointed.

323
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,068
I feel sorry.

324
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,281
I still

325
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,284
need him.

326
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,123
And I miss him.

327
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,626
So is that why

328
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,087
I'm mad at myself?

329
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,134
-I'm sorry.
-You can cry here.

330
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,151
It's odd though.

331
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:44,279
It's not your fault.
Why would you feel sorry?

332
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,698
Aren't you being too considerate?

333
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,283
That might offend him more.

334
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,368
If he does that again next time,

335
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,829
don't lose to him.
Get angrier and yell at him.

336
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,956
Have you two never fought?

337
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,667
We never fought.

338
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,712
You can take this opportunity, then.

339
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,672
Have a big fight. Okay?

340
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,342
He was the one who messed up.
Why is he making you the bad one?

341
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,636
That's how all men are.

342
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,263
Right.

343
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:14,392
I'll give you an important mission.

344
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,686
-A mission?
-Yes.

345
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,314
-You must complete it, okay?
-Okay.

346
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,650
Take a break from work.

347
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,984
Well, that's...

348
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,654
Don't people say that to you sometimes?

349
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,905
"Why don't you go on a trip?"

350
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,323
They all say that for a reason.

351
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,743
Even if you don't call it a trip,

352
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,287
spend some time
in a different environment.

353
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,040
In a different environment?

354
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,086
-You said that you made donations.
-Yes.

355
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,046
Have you been to the charity organization?

356
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,631
No.

357
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,925
I just made donations to the foundation.

358
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,635
That's easier, then.

359
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,722
Treat it as a break and pay a visit.
I'm sure it will be helpful.

360
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,768
They say that true rest is not at home.

361
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,846
What brings you here?

362
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,223
Glad to see you didn't cook this time.

363
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,766
I'm hungry.

364
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,687
You've never come here
because you were hungry.

365
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:45,025
Well, I was walking and thought about us.

366
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,777
When I did,
we looked like two pitiful siblings.

367
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,279
You're hungry because we're pitiful?

368
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,240
We need to have a lot of energy
to stay pitiful.

369
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,284
You do have a point.

370
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,287
I want to have a meal with my brother.

371
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,122
I'll accept it.

372
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,419
-Did something happen?
-Yes.

373
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,047
I had pho for lunch.

374
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,091
I see.

375
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,053
-Let's get Vietnamese spring rolls.
-Okay.

376
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,851
I'm tired. Give me a piggyback ride.

377
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,354
-Get on my back.
-Really?

378
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,231
Is there a baby carrier around here?

379
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,357
Really?

380
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,070
I'm tired.

381
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,880
What's happening?

382
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,549
This is sad.

383
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,846
Are you crying
as you're writing your own script?

384
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,850
Don't you laugh, cry, and say the lines

385
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,143
when you write scripts?

386
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,895
-I do.
-That's it.

387
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,105
Goodness.

388
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,482
Living my life is already hard enough.

389
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,151
But a screenwriter has to keep up
with the characters' emotions.

390
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,279
If so, shouldn't the screenwriter
work for half the time

391
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,281
other people work for?

392
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,365
That's a great line.

393
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,950
I should use that.

394
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,910
I know we work out of passion,

395
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,997
but people have to understand
when screenwriters throw a fit.

396
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,207
I like that. Thanks.

397
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,964
"You have to understand
when screenwriters throw a fit."

398
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,173
Thanks.

399
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,343
I'm tired.

400
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,478
SMART SHAVER

401
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,785
POMEGRANATE STICK WITH RED GINSENG

402
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,300
Ms. Hwang, you must be tired.

403
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,593
Make sure you take one.

404
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,934
I don't get it.

405
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,605
Is it because of my laugh lines?

406
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,950
DERMATOLOGY CLINIC FOR LAUGH LINES

407
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,478
Do you want to arm-wrestle?

408
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,193
I lost my wrist.

409
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,581
Let's play just one round. Just one round.
I'm serious.

410
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,126
Give me your arm. Give it to me.

411
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,151
Is this our first time having this dish?

412
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,696
Yes.

413
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,458
Can you give us one bowl of pho?

414
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,602
Who bought you that?

415
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,522
I bought it.

416
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,775
You don't use electric shavers
because your beard is soft.

417
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,684
YOU HAVE A NEW MESSAGE

418
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,855
This is Ha-yun, Jae-hun's girlfriend.

419
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,566
I can take care of my own boyfriend.

420
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,549
THIS IS HA-YUN, JAE-HUN'S GIRLFRIEND
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY OWN BOYFRIEND

421
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:51,891
Damn it.

422
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,868
You'll die if you keep running!

423
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,332
I want to be happy even if I'm exhausted.

424
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:24,674
You must be tired.

425
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,219
At least, I sleep well.

426
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,181
Preparing to shoot must be exhausting.

427
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,517
I never took a break.

428
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,187
It's hard to hire the staff, isn't it?

429
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,190
The budget is the same, but the living
expenses and rates keep going up.

430
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,568
We have never had enough budget,
to begin with.

431
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,738
Isn't it tiring to be so handsome?

432
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:56,164
I was making a joke
because everyone seemed exhausted.

433
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,750
When I saw his face after making
that joke, I realized he's handsome,

434
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,168
so the joke's on me.

435
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,429
Drink this since you're tired.

436
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,556
A light drink.

437
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,101
That's enough.

438
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,544
Let's do something fun.

439
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,175
I can't work like this. Let's go somewhere
and have fun. We should stop working.

440
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,261
I'm torn in two
because my heart wants to say yes,

441
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:55,098
but my body knows I should say no.

442
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,725
Will you follow your heart or your body?

443
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,189
There's this saying.

444
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,900
"One finds what one wants to find
when one's back from the trip to find it."

445
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,819
We should go somewhere.

446
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,156
Let's not get stressed out thinking
we should've picked a farther destination.

447
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,784
Let us be bold and go somewhere far.

448
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,620
-Yes!
-Nice!

449
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,414
Awesome!

450
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:24,544
YEOSAN CITY HALL TO YEOSAN CATHEDRAL

451
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,753
JANGEUNG CHURCH

452
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,339
YEOSAN CITY HALL

453
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,425
YEOSAN CATHEDRAL

454
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,761
Hello.

455
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
Welcome.

456
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,311
As you requested,
I didn't tell them in advance.

457
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:27,023
When they hear a sponsor is visiting,
they usually all come out and say hello.

458
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,691
No, I don't want that.

459
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,278
That's what I thought.
You can take your time to look around.

460
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,489
You can talk to the kids later.

461
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,617
Since you're here,
if you're up for any volunteer work,

462
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,245
we have more than enough to give you.
You can get as much work as you want.

463
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,914
We must give back as much as we received.

464
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,794
Did that sound weird?

465
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,546
I was joking. I'm sorry.

466
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,924
-No, it was funny.
-Right?

467
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,886
Do you want to take a photo
with the kids later?

468
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,055
Is it not allowed?

469
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:02,934
No, it's not that.
Our kids are used to taking group photos.

470
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,562
It's just that we also look after
disabled kids here.

471
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,107
A while ago, an assemblywoman came here.

472
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,653
She insisted on giving a bath
to one of the kids. Damn her.

473
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,614
She took a photo of that
and posted it on her social media,

474
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,658
which made its way on the news, too.

475
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:25,123
Although we know it wasn't intentional,
we tend to stay away from taking photos.

476
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,666
I won't take any photos.

477
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:30,169
No, you can take photos.
Just be careful when you do.

478
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,922
-Okay.
-Okay. Shall we go in?

479
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,520
-Aren't they beautiful?
-Yes.

480
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,521
Goodness.

481
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,482
-Stop it.
-Did you guys eat?

482
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,484
-Yes.
-Okay. Don't go far.

483
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,735
-Okay.
-Okay.

484
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,030
-This is the cafeteria.
-Hey!

485
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,458
You're eating raccoons.

486
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,170
-Go away.
-Hey.

487
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,173
What's wrong? Are you leaving?

488
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,468
No. That guy in there...

489
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,680
-Do you know him?
-Is he doing some kind of

490
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,057
community service here
to make up his crimes?

491
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,894
Don't let him scare you.
He's not a criminal.

492
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:31,063
He's our angelic donor. He's Chairman Kim.

493
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,065
-Angelic?
-Yes.

494
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,776
We call him the Chairman.

495
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,404
Whenever he makes money,
he always makes a donation.

496
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,531
I wondered
how he was going to feed himself.

497
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,866
He comes here and eats.

498
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,493
When he's not on a project,
he practically lives here.

499
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,471
"Let's not get stressed out,

500
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,806
thinking we should've picked
a farther destination."

501
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,018
We were bold and came pretty far.
We're at Wolmido Island.

502
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,395
Wolmido is far enough.

503
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,398
There are over 20 subway stations
in between.

504
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,567
I like it. There's the ocean, too.

505
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,362
I like everything here.
The entertainment, food,

506
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,447
and the sights. I like it.

507
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,033
But we're here to work.

508
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,118
What do you mean?

509
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,039
Why did you choose a place in my script?

510
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,669
You came here to check out the location
for your shoot.

511
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,462
Location scouting.

512
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,591
Wolmido Island is an awesome place.

513
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,551
Look over there.

514
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,054
Look how much fun they're having.

515
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,060
Let's go somewhere farther away next time.

516
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,437
Let's walk a lot.

517
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,899
Let's think and feel a lot of things.

518
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,445
What's happening?

519
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,240
Why are you exaggeratingly
covering up your front

520
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:07,618
and looking at me like I'm a pervert,
but smiling at the same time?

521
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,037
A trip? Just the two of us?

522
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,790
Gosh, you're such a dog.

523
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,793
Excuse me. What are you thinking?

524
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,336
You want to go on a trip.

525
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,005
Just the two of us and somewhere far.

526
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,090
You want to experience a lot.

527
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,847
Hey. Why are you contaminating

528
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,683
such an innocent word like "trip"
with dirty thoughts?

529
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,811
Whatever.

530
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,689
What was that?
Why are you acting all flirty?

531
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,573
What's wrong with you, Ms. Lim?

532
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,575
Why are you acting like that?

533
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,163
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

534
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,415
Hey, mister.

535
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:57,376
Come on. I have a title, you know.

536
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,502
You keep calling me mister.

537
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,463
Let me introduce you to our guest.

538
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,593
Hey.

539
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,763
The cursing grandma.

540
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:12,183
I get the first part,
but why are you calling me a grandma?

541
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,977
-Do you know each other?
-I saved her.

542
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,563
That was very righteous of me.

543
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,067
Wasn't it more like cleaning up
what was in your way?

544
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,902
What do you mean?

545
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:26,739
She's a donor. Her name is Lee Eun-jeong.
Do you know her?

546
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:27,990
Donor?

547
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:31,952
Yes. We actually talked
about her not long ago.

548
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,163
The documentary filmmaker
who donated her entire assets.

549
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:40,044
I see. That... I see.

550
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,922
She's her.

551
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,633
I didn't know.
You should have told me sooner.

552
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:49,720
But

553
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,931
are you nuts?

554
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,974
How can you donate everything you have?

555
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,021
What? Nuts?

556
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:01,148
If that makes her nuts,

557
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,860
I'm looking at two
of the biggest nuts out there.

558
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,196
Two of the biggest nuts.

559
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,573
It's an honor. What an honor.

560
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,076
-Mr. Son. Ms. Lim.
-Mr. Son.

561
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,786
-Have one.
-Thank you.

562
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,830
-Thank you.
-Sure.

563
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,289
This looks great.

564
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,586
When you're on a trip,

565
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,672
you should start it with a corn dog.

566
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,632
What do we do for fun
at a place like this?

567
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,884
Is this your first time here?

568
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,886
Yes, this is my first time here.

569
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,346
Don't people from the metropolitan area

570
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,640
usually visit Wolmido
before the age of 10?

571
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,267
I grew up in the South.

572
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,852
We have better oceans there.

573
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,148
You're having a good start
with the corn dog.

574
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:43,983
You can go on the amusement rides
if you want.

575
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:47,278
But there's something
we must think about in depth and plan.

576
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,239
Will we have grilled clams
and sashimi here?

577
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,740
Or will we not have a meal here

578
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,660
and go to Chinatown nearby
and have dumplings?

579
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:55,911
That's an important decision.

580
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,247
But isn't jjajangmyeon
famous at Chinatown?

581
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,457
Yes,

582
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,584
but I know a great dumpling restaurant.

583
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,210
Oven-baked dumplings.

584
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,963
That's a serious decision.
What should we do, Mr. Son?

585
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,923
That's what we need
to figure out together.

586
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,929
Jjajangmyeon? Dumplings?

587
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,681
Why do we need to think about this?

588
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,809
-We're supposed to eat all of them.
-Yes.

589
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,144
I'll eat all of it.

590
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,270
Of course.

591
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:23,230
We'll eat for an hour
and digest for an hour.

592
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,024
We'll eat for an hour
and digest for an hour.

593
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,902
I didn't think about that. I love it.

594
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,654
Then, let's split into teams
and play games.

595
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,865
And the losing team will pay for the food.

596
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,241
-I'm in.
-Count me in.

597
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,160
-How should we do this?
-Okay.

598
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:37,828
Will we divide by gender?

599
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,663
Or will we divide by our roles?

600
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,789
We'll do hand-flips.

601
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,666
-Sure.
-Okay.

602
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,003
-Flip or don't flip
-Flip or don't flip

603
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,756
-Flip or don't flip
-Flip or don't flip

604
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,841
-Gosh. Nice.
-Yes!

605
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,010
-Let's go.
-Don't go easy on them.

606
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,887
-Take this seriously.
-Let's take this seriously.

607
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,639
-No joking around.
-No smiling now.

608
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,890
Don't joke around.

609
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,282
It looks like you hate washing dishes,

610
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,910
but you seem very experienced at it.

611
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,204
I don't want to do it.

612
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,457
Then, why are you doing it?

613
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,710
Because I have to.

614
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:50,025
You should try to look normal at least.

615
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,195
Why are you volunteering here
with the look that you hate this work?

616
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,572
It doesn't suit you.

617
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:56,907
What should I do
to suit this volunteer work?

618
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,493
It's your facial expression
and the way you talk.

619
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,955
Do exactly the opposite,
and it'll suit you.

620
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,167
That's lame.

621
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,297
What happened to the honorifics?

622
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,841
Who would speak with honorifics
when they talk to themselves?

623
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:18,971
I see. You've been talking
to yourself this whole time.

624
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,139
Balance.

625
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,976
-Pardon?
-If I only work, it gets boring.

626
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:27,855
If I only play, it gets boring,
so balance.

627
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:29,815
What's he talking about?

628
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,443
Let's see if I understood you correctly.

629
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,903
Are you doing this because you're bored?

630
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,780
To me,

631
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,325
this is having fun.

632
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,954
Having fun is important

633
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,456
for the sake of balance.

634
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,376
Do you know what happens
if there's no balance?

635
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,838
What happens?

636
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,346
You fall.

637
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,312
Do you know what happens if you fall?

638
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,688
It will hurt.

639
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,069
You got it right.

640
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,405
Come on.

641
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,908
You keep dropping your honorifics.

642
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:24,036
No one speaks with honorifics
when they talk to themselves.

643
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,771
Wait, no. Not the wall.
Try to hit the balloons.

644
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,483
Gosh. I don't think
I can zero in on the balloons.

645
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,361
We're throwing darts.
There's no zeroing in.

646
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:09,248
Let's take turns.

647
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,042
-Wait. What was that?
-Gosh.

648
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,044
-Stop.
-Goodness.

649
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,963
-Hold on.
-Wait, this... This is...

650
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,423
-We can't throw at the same time.
-Hey.

651
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,299
We're supposed to take turns to shoot.

652
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,427
-It's because we're rushing.
-Come on.

653
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,346
-Goodness.
-We can't throw at the same time.

654
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,597
-What is this?
-Gosh.

655
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,559
You can't hit my ball.

656
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,520
Gosh.

657
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,063
I said we can't throw at the same time.

658
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:54,084
That's it. Stop it. I'll pay for the food.

659
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,211
Nice try. Let's go.

660
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,966
Wait up for me.

661
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,722
It's ripped.

662
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,141
It looks good though.

663
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,437
I won! I won!

664
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,482
I'm proud of you.

665
00:46:59,441 --> 00:47:00,442
Well done.

666
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,445
You should eat that. Dip it in the sauce.

667
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,158
-Well done.
-Yes.

668
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,036
-Great job.
-It came out completely.

669
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,246
Yes.

670
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,418
Look at you go.

671
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,046
You did well.

672
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:26,760
-Potato chips
-Potato chips

673
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:29,054
-Potato chips
-Potato chips

674
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:30,138
What?

675
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,476
Do you have some kind of a story?

676
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,189
Something heartrending
and tragic, perhaps?

677
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,901
People always think I have a sad story

678
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,736
for spending my time here
when I'm perfectly fine.

679
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,823
I asked because
you don't seem perfectly fine.

680
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:53,412
I do have a story.

681
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,500
I was born into a middle-class family.

682
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:02,629
Our family wasn't filthy rich,
but we weren't poor.

683
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,173
And I had a happy childhood.

684
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:08,302
I studied hard and went to college.

685
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,887
And I became successful.

686
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,558
Is that it?

687
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,476
Yes.

688
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,856
You think that's heartrending and tragic?

689
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,316
Yes.

690
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,737
Shall we listen to these kids' stories?

691
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,864
Do you know how heartrending and tragic

692
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,907
that this is the only story I have?

693
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:33,785
Seriously.

694
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:39,207
We ought to round up all those people
and make spaghetti sauce out of them.

695
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,137
Can I give you a hug?

696
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,515
What's your problem?

697
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,017
Why would you hug me?

698
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,895
-Because you're sad.
-Did I tell you that?

699
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,439
Even if that's true, why would you hug me?

700
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,565
A hug...

701
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:07,569
is cozy.

702
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,864
Damn it.

703
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,325
Why do you talk like that?

704
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:15,327
"When someone hugs you,
it's cozy." Say it at once.

705
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,871
Why do you pause
in the middle of the sentence?

706
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,791
Do I do that?

707
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,606
It's cozy.

708
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,533
Get off me now.

709
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,829
Get off of me.

710
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,917
Get off. Come on.

711
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:06,211
Hey, get off.

712
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,296
-Us, too.
-Us, too.

713
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,674
-Darn it.
-Give us a lift, too.

714
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,260
-Get lost.
-Give us a lift, too.

715
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,595
-Get off.
-We won't get lost.

716
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,306
-Come on, give us a lift, too.
-Don't touch me there.

717
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,474
Stop it.

718
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,979
Perhaps, we should've skipped the noodles.

719
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:28,024
-Wicked gluten.
-We should eat dumplings.

720
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:32,571
Is it true that in Incheon, they add
a fried egg on top of jajangmyeon?

721
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,739
Yes, it's true.

722
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:36,491
Deep-fried in oil.

723
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:40,746
-I can't eat that.
-Damn it. I agree.

724
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,623
But still, we came all the way here.

725
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,541
Shouldn't we drink soju

726
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,294
with grilled mackerel
at the Mackerel Street?

727
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,671
When you're full,
go for light food like grilled fish.

728
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,467
Yes. Since it's fish, it won't be heavy.

729
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,302
Okay. Let's do that.

730
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:58,805
You managed to pull out the conch.
I shall grant your wish.

731
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,894
Gosh, there's an abundance of food
in this city.

732
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,942
Did you drive here?

733
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:13,653
No.

734
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:16,823
Do you want a ride?

735
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,661
Well...

736
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,792
JANGEUNG CHURCH

737
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,961
When people take the bus,

738
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:33,590
they use the expression "take the bus
together," not "give someone a ride."

739
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,802
Is that so?

740
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,892
Do you not have a car?

741
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,564
Public transportation...

742
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,693
is fascinating.

743
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,614
Since transfers...

744
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:03,036
are free.

745
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,632
You can just stand there.
Are you trying to catch a cab?

746
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:18,426
One bus just passed by me last time.

747
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,102
For two, please.

748
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:39,531
Ma'am, one grilled mackerel,
gochujang stew,

749
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,782
one braised pot,

750
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,117
and rolled omelet, please.

751
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:46,371
This is different from what you said.
How many dishes did you order?

752
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,706
It's only one dish for each person.

753
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,669
-Let's finish all of it.
-That looks great.

754
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,686
Gosh, you deboned it nicely.

755
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,617
We can eat it with our spoon.

756
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,536
-All right.
-Thank you.

757
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,788
-Thank you. Let's dig in.
-Thank you for the food.

758
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,831
Dig in.

759
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:43,053
This calls for soju.

760
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,097
-Let's drink.
-Let's drink.

761
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,934
-Cheers.
-Cheers. I'll only clink my glass.

762
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:56,608
-This is so good.
-I'm so happy.

763
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,205
Jae-hun.

764
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,249
Have some rolled omelet, too.

765
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,760
I'm getting off at this stop.

766
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,472
Okay. Do you live in this neighborhood?

767
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,641
No. I need to transfer.

768
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,852
-Transfers are...
-Free.

769
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:41,152
The journey you took today is priceless.

770
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:44,072
Go home and get a present at home.

771
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,075
-A present?
-You'll find it at home.

772
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,538
To do that, what do you need to do?

773
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,793
Beep.

774
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,758
How do you keep his job as a director?

775
00:55:04,175 --> 00:55:06,344
Can you lead a normal life like this?

776
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:22,569
-Bye.
-Take care.

777
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:35,832
I want to be happy even if I'm exhausted.

778
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,669
I'm exhausted, but I'm happy.

779
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:44,132
At least today was a complete success.

780
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,969
Isn't it more tiring to play?

781
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,221
Not really.

782
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:52,515
Right. It's just something people say.

783
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,310
Right. I prefer playing
to working. Always.

784
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,605
It's time for us to go back home.

785
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,107
It's time to find something
we wanted to find during the trip.

786
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,777
Well, it was a short trip.

787
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,779
Don't be disappointed
even if you don't find anything.

788
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,113
What?

789
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,823
But I've already found it.

790
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,158
-Really?
-Yes.

791
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:15,246
Here's the back I was looking for.

792
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,292
You definitely found it.

793
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,169
This is free, right?

794
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,046
-The back you're hugging?
-Yes.

795
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,882
It's not free.

796
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,718
I can actually pay you a premium for it.

797
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,180
Don't change.

798
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,182
I won't.

799
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,143
Promise me.

800
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:41,022
I found something, too.
I saw a different side of you.

801
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,398
Promise me.

802
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:43,858
I'll do it,

803
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,194
but I didn't know
you believed in these promises.

804
00:56:46,736 --> 00:56:49,864
I want to believe it just for today.
Stop talking and promise me.

805
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,245
Stamp and seal.

806
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:05,255
Gosh, it's really okay.

807
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,091
It's late. Besides, you worked hard today.

808
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:09,259
Work hard?

809
00:57:09,425 --> 00:57:11,052
I had so much fun today.

810
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,262
Is that so?

811
00:57:13,054 --> 00:57:14,722
I'll drop you off at the main road.

812
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,975
Ha-yun might see me dropping you off.

813
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,229
I'm sorry
about the text message that night.

814
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,730
Gosh, don't even say that.

815
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,275
Actually,
I even thought about apologizing to you.

816
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,985
Gosh, don't even say that.

817
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,822
That's my point.
Something felt weird about that.

818
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,825
Never blame Ha-yun for it.

819
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,618
Women might feel insure about that.

820
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,912
She doesn't need
to feel insure now, anyway.

821
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,166
Ha-yun was sorry about
what she did to you.

822
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,127
She's not that...

823
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,672
I want to say she's not that rude,

824
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,718
but she had already been so rude to you.
So this is a bit...

825
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,225
You hate her, right?

826
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:01,728
Pardon?

827
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,188
I'm talking about Ha-yun.

828
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,151
You'll still be upset
even if she apologizes to you.

829
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,280
She behaved in a way
you couldn't understand.

830
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,158
And as you still don't understand
why she behaved that way,

831
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,743
how could you not be angry?

832
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,330
That's everyone.

833
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,500
You hate it.
Of course, that's only natural.

834
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,712
You should pluck up your courage
at a time like that.

835
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,423
The courage not to hate.

836
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,300
"The courage not to hate"?

837
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:35,929
It turns out you need nothing
but courage to achieve that.

838
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,347
Try it.

839
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,310
Love is more valuable than hatred.

840
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,327
Who were you with?

841
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,374
Never mind. I'm sorry.

842
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,608
What did you do today?

843
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,238
I waited for you.

844
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,334
I'm sorry.

845
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,670
I'm late.

846
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,014
You must be tired.

847
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,408
When you say yes.

848
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:06,079
I've been recording us very diligently.

849
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,081
I take photos and write things.

850
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,165
Look.

851
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:10,249
This is

852
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,336
an app where I can take photos
and leave short memos.

853
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,421
It's in private for now,

854
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:18,299
but I'll open it when we get married.

855
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,385
When you say "Yes, I will."

856
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,419
ONE-LINE JOURNAL

857
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,598
EUN-JEONG, HONG-DAE

858
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:12,019
This is the first photo we took together,
but you don't like this photo.

859
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:13,813
I'm sorry.

860
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,607
I'll put my head closer
to the camera next time.

861
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,986
As it's our first photo,
it gives me butterflies.

862
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:23,197
As time passes by
and reaches our exciting future,

863
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,867
let's look at these photos while smiling.

864
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,454
Well... Let's just say that I want

865
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,831
a taste of being cool, too.

866
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,337
They say no.

867
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:40,089
Let's go.

868
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:41,591
Get lost!

869
01:02:45,928 --> 01:02:47,054
They're over there.

870
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:51,601
It was like that from the start.

871
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,188
"I want to stay with this girl a bit more.

872
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:57,064
I want to talk to her a bit more."

873
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,609
That's how I felt today as always.

874
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:03,112
I felt really crappy, but I held it in.

875
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,949
Gosh. I shouldn't have.

876
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,333
Don't you think
something is going to happen?

877
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,045
Like what?

878
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,215
I don't know.

879
01:03:29,263 --> 01:03:30,431
Do you want to know?

880
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:37,355
We kissed for the first time.

881
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:42,068
I'll remember everything else.
You just remember this.

882
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:45,488
You kissed me first.

883
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,169
Today was the first time I saw you upset.

884
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:03,756
I thought about being upset at you, too
for a brief moment,

885
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,758
but I couldn't.

886
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:08,177
Because you were too beautiful.

887
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:12,598
What am I going to do?
I guess looks matter for me.

888
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,282
I went to the hospital.

889
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:33,286
I

890
01:04:35,162 --> 01:04:36,247
miss you.

891
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,422
I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL

892
01:04:44,505 --> 01:04:45,840
I... MISS YOU

893
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,728
The more I observe you,
the more reliable you are.

894
01:04:59,478 --> 01:05:01,063
I have no doubt

895
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,233
that you will be brave even without me

896
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,282
because you are the love of my life.

897
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,368
I trust you. I do.

898
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:18,748
I really do, but...

899
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,670
Gosh, no. I don't.

900
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,478
Please

901
01:05:42,104 --> 01:05:43,272
take care

902
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,524
of yourself

903
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,736
for me.

904
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,909
I will.

905
01:05:56,702 --> 01:05:57,870
I'll do it.

906
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,292
I'll make sure I do.

907
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,796
I love you.

908
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,900
I told you not to come to my work.

909
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:11,610
Had you told me to come,
I wouldn't have come.

910
01:07:11,694 --> 01:07:13,529
You still don't know me.

911
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:16,323
-Ms. Hwang!
-You want to take In-guk?

912
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,200
How about we live together?

913
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,369
To tell you the truth, I am...

914
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:21,787
I can't let you go.

915
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:24,498
-Delete them.
-What are you doing?

916
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,250
Say, "Please delete them."

917
01:07:26,333 --> 01:07:28,210
-Come in.
-Just be nice to me.

918
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,378
I don't need you to be shy.

919
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,338
Why is he exchanging these photos
with you?

920
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:33,674
Those photos were no big deal.
They were cute.

921
01:07:33,758 --> 01:07:35,217
Damn it.

922
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,678
Do you know
that being nice actually suits you?

923
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,513
-Thanks.
-For what?

924
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,640
I don't know. Just thank you.

925
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,642
Hey, it's not your fault.

926
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:44,810
What are you talking about?

927
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,813
I just want to switch the order
of Hwan-dong and your drama.

928
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,190
It's your fault.

929
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,192
You made her break her leg!
It's all your fault.

930
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,568
I want to see you.

931
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,278
But what can I do? It's our project.

932
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:55,863
Does he think I have nothing to do?

933
01:07:55,946 --> 01:07:58,491
Damn it. That fool.

934
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,284
I was crazy busy.

935
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,786
That's an excuse.

936
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:05,706
Gosh, you know that both of us are busy.
Why do you let this upset you?

937
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:09,251
I'm going to be disappointed in you today.

938
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:12,546
