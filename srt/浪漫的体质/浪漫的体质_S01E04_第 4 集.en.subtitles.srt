1
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,458
Even if it doesn't involve alcohol,

2
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,878
everyone makes a mistake
that leads to something

3
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,256
that should have never happened
once in a while.

4
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,426
To me, it happened that day.

5
00:00:58,892 --> 00:00:59,893
Okay!

6
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,687
One more glass.

7
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,106
I'm getting tipsy.

8
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,379
You know what?

9
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,051
No. I know nothing.

10
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,427
Right now,

11
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,473
drinks are drinking themselves.

12
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:41,267
Drinks should drink too.

13
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,353
We shouldn't be the ones
drinking all the time.

14
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:45,980
You philanthropist.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,401
We did nothing wrong.

16
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,570
They shouldn't have produced alcohol.

17
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,073
You can't tell us to not have something
that's already there!

18
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,616
This is like

19
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,369
a loathsome and unholy presence

20
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,081
meddling with the relationship

21
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,791
between God and humans.

22
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,417
Then God should have stopped us.

23
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,838
How can humans stop something
that's beyond their power?

24
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,216
There's no point in resenting others.

25
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:17,095
You can't change the world with resent.

26
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,224
We just need to understand
and accept it as is.

27
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:25,186
Neither of us did anything wrong.

28
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,108
You philanthropist.

29
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,660
We're out of drinks!

30
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,537
Where did it all go?

31
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,207
Stop lying.

32
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,459
That's a sin.

33
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:51,087
We should refrain from lying.

34
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,465
That's something humans can control,
isn't it?

35
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,635
Oh, no.

36
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,762
You caught me.

37
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,307
You want some wine?

38
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,601
Or do you want to switch to hard liquor?

39
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,108
Bring them both.

40
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,738
You philanthropist.

41
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,522
We've gone past our threshold.

42
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,109
We could die at this rate.

43
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,277
Let's sleep.

44
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,947
We won't die if we sleep.

45
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
Okay.

46
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,537
Thanks for the drinks.

47
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,666
Stay here for the night.

48
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,292
It's late.

49
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,585
Hey, I know...

50
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,964
that I'm hammered,
but how could I ever sleep at your place?

51
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,424
Make yourself at home.

52
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,428
Just think of this as your own.
Sleep here.

53
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,638
That's a bit...

54
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,682
rude.

55
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,686
I said it's fine. Why is that rude?

56
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,062
Are you scared or what?

57
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,564
No way. I'm a reserve soldier!

58
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,234
That's impressive.

59
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:39,445
Isn't a military force enough
to protect a nation?

60
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,031
Why would they have someone like you
as a reserve?

61
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,449
Then...

62
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,703
-sleep here.
-Fine, I'll sleep here.

63
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,288
Sleep here.

64
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:52,125
Sleep here. Which way is the room?

65
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:57,338
-It's that way!
-How do you know that?

66
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,716
Why do I know this?
I don't know. This place is familiar.

67
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,051
-Sleep here.
-Fine.

68
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,509
It's a terrible day to die.

69
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,485
You crazy jerk.

70
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,155
-You crazy bitch.
-Fuckface.

71
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,740
-Fucking twat.
-Son of a bitch.

72
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,743
Okay. No, this isn't working.

73
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,578
No matter how much we swear--

74
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:56,165
It's still awkward.
It just makes me feel like crap.

75
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,043
How about we try dirty talk
instead of cursing?

76
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,963
No, I'd hate that. I'm too good at it.

77
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,215
Or how about

78
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,008
we degrade each other?

79
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,301
Like each other's looks.

80
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,388
Looks? But there's nothing
to degrade when it comes to my looks.

81
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,142
What is this then?
I see something to degrade.

82
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:15,810
Whatever. Take responsibility.

83
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,770
Why would you say "responsibility"?

84
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,106
This isn't a man-made disaster.

85
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,650
-You think this is a natural disaster?
-Why are you talking down to me?

86
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,570
You should take responsibility.

87
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,740
Fine, then. Well.

88
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,742
Is today our first day together?

89
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,244
Fine then.

90
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,122
Let's do that.

91
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,292
Today is our first day.

92
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,669
First day? Are you going out with him?

93
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,422
No. The first day of us being
awkward with each other.

94
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,216
-And today's the second day.
-That's interesting.

95
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,719
Why didn't you decide to take
responsibility by becoming a couple?

96
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,345
They did nothing
to take responsibility for.

97
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,680
That could happen if you get drunk.

98
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:55,308
She said she got undressed.
That's so gross.

99
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:58,603
It'd be too much of a loss for me
to date him.

100
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,898
In what ways?
I can't seem to agree with that.

101
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,194
-You can't agree?
-Well, no.

102
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,654
Why, though?

103
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,364
Do you think so, too?

104
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,370
Even if you brought Park Bo-gum,
I'd say he doesn't deserve you.

105
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,247
I can't agree with that now.

106
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,751
He's the kind of a guy
that we'd say has everything.

107
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,003
He's a loser who has everything.

108
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,797
So what? I don't have any less.

109
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,967
Well, you barely function
as a human being.

110
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:33,387
Now, that's something to get mad
at you for, but I can't refute that.

111
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,974
Hey. Well...

112
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,685
This is kind of
embarrassing to ask, but...

113
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,354
You did it, didn't you?

114
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,398
-That was my question.
-No way.

115
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,068
We just got totally wasted.

116
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:48,736
That's so gross.

117
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,155
What's so gross? I said we got drunk.

118
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:55,243
Wait. What if he's rattling on this
to his friends?

119
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,203
No way.

120
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,914
He'd know how fast words spread
in the broadcasting industry.

121
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,124
He has a lot to lose.
I'm sure he's fretting now.

122
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,335
Right? He has everything after all.

123
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,670
You acknowledge that now?

124
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,921
Nope.

125
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,883
Regardless of the status,
age, or nationality,

126
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,886
guys are bound to be losers
regarding such issues. No exceptions.

127
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,267
-It can't be.
-Are you out of your mind? Why would I?

128
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,436
Don't tell me you've been talking.

129
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,231
Are you crazy? I'm a promising writer.

130
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,692
Right.
Let's not make a big deal out of this.

131
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,778
Did you call me at this hour
to check that?

132
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:34,031
That's a bit out of order.
We're awkward, remember?

133
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,867
All right. I got worried for nothing.

134
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,328
Goodnight, Mr. Son.

135
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,722
-What did she say?
-Don't even ask.

136
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,642
Why are you so worried?

137
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,519
You slept together. That's all.

138
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,149
Get it straight.
All we did was sleep together.

139
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,401
Fine. Naked...

140
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,403
All you did was sleep together naked.

141
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,993
Why do you always drink at my place
without ever bringing any?

142
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,371
Just go away, asshole. You smell of trash.

143
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,789
You're bringing down the house value.

144
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:24,915
All right.

145
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,001
But,

146
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,377
tell me the truth.

147
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,716
Did you do it?

148
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,268
You did it.

149
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,024
Well, well.

150
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,235
Save thinking about
your awkward relationship for later.

151
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,947
-Let's watch the show.
-I can't wait to watch it.

152
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,700
Don't get excited.
We were at each other's throats.

153
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,535
That's why we're excited.

154
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,913
Scary ladies got into a fight.

155
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:06,248
Right. Real-life can get more dramatic
than dramas.

156
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,084
-Shush. It's starting now.
-I Heard A Rumor.

157
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,711
Our new host, Lee So-min is

158
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,171
sitting next to me here.

159
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,259
Hello, I'm an actress, Lee So-min.

160
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,179
I heard the rumor that
the atmosphere is great

161
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:23,099
at the studio of I Heard A Rumor.

162
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,434
That was witty.

163
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,856
I'll try my best to get
all the rumors that are out there.

164
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,527
All right. It's great to see you.
And we have one more person.

165
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,862
We have a new panelist.

166
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,614
It's great news!

167
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,699
We know who you are,

168
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:44,203
but can you please introduce yourself
for those who don't know you?

169
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,748
She's my friend.
We went to college together.

170
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,751
I bet you two are very close.

171
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,255
-The love of my life.
-I love even more.

172
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,633
You love her?

173
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,432
What do you mean? It's not like
house chores are only for women.

174
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,184
He just gives his wife a dishwasher
when he's diagnosed with terminal cancer?

175
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,728
I know, right?
That's what I'm talking about.

176
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,107
I thought you were
at each other's throats.

177
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,942
Did you mean kissing?

178
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,694
Hey, no way.

179
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,824
It's understandable.
Alcohol makes you think.

180
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:25,244
I think you should quit drinking too.
Do you still like drinking?

181
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,495
All of a sudden?

182
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,749
-Did you get drunk even yesterday?
-Come on. Stop it.

183
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,544
-Calamansi.
-That's so funny.

184
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:37,089
I can't believe how they edited this.

185
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,384
The producer did a good job, didn't he?

186
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,972
This is what people call
"edited by the devil".

187
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,516
It looks like it's done by an angel.

188
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,935
Whoever did this

189
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,646
got rid of the 10-year bad blood
between them.

190
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,565
Nice.

191
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:02,740
Fine. Be nasty all you want.

192
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,075
You can't beat me.

193
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,537
I won.

194
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,165
Hwang In-guk.

195
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,375
I want it! Get me the cards!

196
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,002
I want Dino Cards!

197
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:18,464
We don't need an alarm clock
in this house.

198
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,550
It's ironic that we don't need to wake up
in the morning.

199
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,637
Are you going to buy
all the dinosaur cards that are out there?

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,473
But you can't. We can't afford it.

201
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,392
You must get used to
giving up on things to survive.

202
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:34,188
Must you give me a hard time
because of some dinosaur cards?

203
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,608
They turn into dinosaurs
when you step on the cards,

204
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,486
but if I can't pay off my card debt,
I'll turn into a loser.

205
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,321
Then I won't be able to raise you.

206
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,865
We can't afford to have
everything we want.

207
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,825
I don't even get to have a dad!

208
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,497
He's growing fast. It's scary.

209
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,718
You don't need to walk me anymore.

210
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:07,179
I'm on my way to work.

211
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm not taking a detour.
This is my way to work.

212
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,394
Then I'll leave ten minutes earlier.

213
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,980
Or you can take the other path.

214
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,024
What's wrong with you?
You're making me upset.

215
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,109
Do I embarrass you?

216
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,735
I'm a second-grader now.

217
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,696
It'd embarrass me
if first-graders saw this.

218
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,202
Gosh.

219
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,622
You're only a little kid
who throws a tantrum over toys.

220
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,875
You're a mom who doesn't have a husband.

221
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,633
The swaying flowers

222
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:48,178
Smelled like your shampoo

223
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:51,557
In case you went past me

224
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,601
I look around

225
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,062
But all I see are other people

226
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,565
You know those lyrics
don't suit you, right?

227
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:00,900
You're scaring me.

228
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,485
It'd be scarier
to suit this cheesy love song.

229
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,864
So what's gotten into you?
You may not realize,

230
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,283
but this scene scares the spectator.

231
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,951
I think the director

232
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,330
must have had the milk of
a mentally ill cow when he was young.

233
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,291
-What?
-He's crazy. He's the worst show-off.

234
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,792
And that always annoys me.

235
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,794
And what does that have to do
with this love song?

236
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,422
He gets depressed
whenever he hears this song.

237
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,300
-Why?
-There's a reason.

238
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,178
He becomes depressed
the moment he hears this song.

239
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,513
He looks like
he'll kill himself any minute.

240
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,683
Whenever he annoys me,
I'm going to sing this song until he dies.

241
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,687
A love song that's played every spring
can become a deadly weapon to someone.

242
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,649
Sol-bi did a great job
in writing those lyrics.

243
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,819
-Sol-bi?
-She's in my band.

244
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:47,488
She wrote the lyrics.

245
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,535
What is it? What just made you happy?

246
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,250
I love this.

247
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,586
Why? Tell me.

248
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,421
What about this song?

249
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,717
-It sounds like some fun. Tell me.
-No, I'm going to keep it to myself.

250
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,594
Come on, tell me.

251
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,930
Tell me already.

252
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,991
Mr. Son!

253
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,826
Why are you so happy to hear from me?

254
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,871
Of course I'd be happy to hear from you.
Who else would be?

255
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,415
A lot of other people.

256
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,874
Be yourself. You're making me anxious.

257
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,876
Then tell me what you called me for.

258
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,546
I'd like to discuss the script.

259
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,841
I'd love it.

260
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,093
What is this now? Why do you love it?

261
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:55,055
Of course I'd love to discuss my script.

262
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,932
You don't need to love it.

263
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,643
You're making me anxious.

264
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,228
See you later.

265
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,905
Here. They kiss again?

266
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,615
Out of nowhere? Again?

267
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,285
There are steps to take.

268
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,704
There's no emotion involved here.
Why would they suddenly kiss?

269
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,749
You could kiss if your eyes met.
Why would you waste time?

270
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,168
You're a writer.
How could you be so vulgar?

271
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,919
What's the rush?

272
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,589
Things should happen naturally
as they develop feelings for each other.

273
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,382
If I don't do anything, someone else will.

274
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,092
There's no time to wait for
things to happen.

275
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,677
They are going to kiss no matter what.

276
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:36,722
They need to kiss in this scene.
Only then I'd be at ease.

277
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,557
A screenwriter writes to make

278
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,100
the viewers feel at ease, not herself.

279
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,102
Why are you so obsessed with kisses?

280
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,021
Were you dumped
because you were a bad kisser?

281
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,942
-In 11th grade.
-No, this can't be.

282
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,819
We haven't got our time slot yet.

283
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,322
I'm a top director,
but the quality of the first two episodes

284
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,782
isn't enough to get a time slot

285
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,533
or cast actors.

286
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,119
The third episode is crucial for us.

287
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,247
This will be my fifth drama series,
and I've never failed in any.

288
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,332
What made it possible?

289
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,667
Was it because the scripts were great? No.

290
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,419
I'm not that lucky.

291
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,755
It's because I did a great job.

292
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,758
The data proves it.

293
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,675
I...

294
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,304
The swaying flowers

295
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:21,642
-What is this?
-Smelled like your shampoo

296
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:25,979
In case you went past me
I look around

297
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,941
But all I see are other

298
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,486
People

299
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,615
Look here. It's here.

300
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,450
It's a kiss this time.

301
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,452
Fine. Let's say they can kiss.

302
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,371
All right. They kiss.

303
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,455
They can simply kiss.

304
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,041
Why do they need such a set-up?

305
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,544
I know foam kisses and candy kisses

306
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,087
were trendy at some point.

307
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,922
But jelly snack kisses? Seriously?

308
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:53,632
It's gummy worms. Listen.

309
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,717
They both pick the longest gummy worm
at the same time.

310
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,512
Then they hold each end with their lips
and play a game.

311
00:18:58,595 --> 00:18:59,471
Isn't it adorable?

312
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,181
Gummy worms aren't like spaghetti.

313
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,601
Why would two grown-ups

314
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,437
put gummy worms on a plate to eat them?
With a fork?

315
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,233
Around your house

316
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:15,487
I fiddle with my phone

317
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,700
I muster up my courage to call you

318
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:25,164
But it only makes me sad

319
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:28,959
When I walk around

320
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:31,170
I want to tell you

321
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,881
That I always wait for you

322
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,759
Okay. I get it.

323
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,846
Let's discuss the details later.

324
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,556
Let's talk about the plot then.

325
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,849
In the first two episodes,

326
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,226
you need to depict the world
the characters live in

327
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,644
and what the characters are like.

328
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,314
I understand it can be chitty-chatty.

329
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,565
The story can develop slowly.

330
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,275
But in the third episode,

331
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,944
you should add an emotional conflict.

332
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,405
-Do you agree with me?
-Yes.

333
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,323
Then...

334
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,951
Around your house

335
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,080
I fiddle with my phone

336
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,957
-I muster up my courage
-What is it now?

337
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,626
-To call you
-You agreed. Why are you singing?

338
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,211
I wasn't complaining.

339
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,714
I don't know. It's become a habit.

340
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:18,926
When I walk around

341
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,345
-I want to tell you
-Stop being like this.

342
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,306
That I always wait for you

343
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,851
I'm still by your house

344
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,229
-I want to tell you I called you
-Where's that guitar coming from?

345
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,397
Because I missed you

346
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,776
-I'm still by your house
-Why does it keep popping up?

347
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,903
I want to tell you

348
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,947
-Darn this.
-That I always wait for you

349
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,950
Beom-su isn't the only director
in this TV station.

350
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,203
Why would you move to another channel
just because of that insolent punk?

351
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,665
You're way too successful
to care about what he says.

352
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,375
Just ignore him.

353
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,335
That's what kids these days are like.

354
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,587
They are all self-centered and rude.

355
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,799
No. I gave it a lot of thought.

356
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,510
I can't always learn from the superiors.

357
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,263
The younger ones lead the trend.

358
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,557
The response of the kids these days

359
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,851
have broadened my perspective
that had been stagnant.

360
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:12,521
I was actually excited to hear it.

361
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,403
Shall we go to another place?

362
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,155
What is he doing with that girl?

363
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,491
Why? Do you know her?

364
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,244
I heard he's fixated on
a work by a rookie writer

365
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:29,079
and is developing the script.

366
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:30,998
I guess she's the writer.

367
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,500
What is she doing with a guitar?

368
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,380
So those two are working on a drama?

369
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,965
Yes.

370
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,931
Are you upset?

371
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,393
I told you to simply ignore him.
That's the easy way.

372
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:54,980
No. He's making me think about
a lot of things.

373
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,024
No matter what they do
to change the trend,

374
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,650
it won't become the trend.

375
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,486
It's crude and vulgar.

376
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,447
What a great combination!

377
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,574
It doesn't apply anymore that
those in their 20s and 30s

378
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,409
are the largest consumers
in the culture industry.

379
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,329
Why must we lower ourselves
to level with the shallow youngsters?

380
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,456
Just give them the minimum wage

381
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,291
and make them do miscellaneous work.

382
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,502
Gosh, you are one progressive woman,
aren't you?

383
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,214
Oh, and I've just decided
what to do with my next piece.

384
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,133
Okay. Do whatever you want.

385
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,635
If you air her drama in this station,

386
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,013
I won't work here.

387
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,223
And I know you're about to call my name.

388
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,769
Don't call me.
I said, do not call my name.

389
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:37,189
Hye-jeong. Ms. Jung, come on.

390
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,024
Are you telling me to put this on my face?

391
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,193
Yes.

392
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,695
This has ears to fit those
who have a receding hairline.

393
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,155
It's called the M mask.

394
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,157
I see. The M mask.

395
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,701
Is that a joke?

396
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,204
It's good for your wrinkles

397
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,665
and sensitive skin.
It'll make your skin brighter.

398
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,167
Are you saying I'm wrinkly and dull?

399
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,627
That's not what I meant.

400
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,879
It's for you to experience the anti-aging

401
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:03,006
and whitening effect while you act.

402
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,425
So you're saying my skin is aged and dull.

403
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,470
No. So...

404
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,264
When you watch a drama

405
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,642
and the actor cries in it,

406
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:16,686
you see his tears are beige colored
because of the foundation.

407
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,438
Did you hear me? Beige tears.

408
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,565
You're right. It's a disaster.

409
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,650
Now,

410
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,820
you're telling me to put this
on my face then take it off.

411
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,696
What do you think will happen?

412
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,784
My whole face will be covered
in beige tears.

413
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,953
What do you think?

414
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,038
-That's a catastrophe.
-So you know.

415
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,790
Yet you're telling me to put this on.

416
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,875
Do you have malice against me?

417
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,383
Take this back!

418
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,146
-It's perfect--
-I'm not doing it!

419
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,566
-It'll fit perfectly.
-You punk.

420
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,862
Why you...

421
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,825
It's made to fit your receding hairline...

422
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,463
Weren't you going to give it to me?

423
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,427
Oh, this has gone cold, so...

424
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,096
I think cold coffee would be better now.

425
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,729
I didn't want to feel better,
but I feel better now.

426
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,109
I have a black belt in taekwondo.

427
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,069
-Did I mention this before?
-What?

428
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:52,073
But I don't have the sportsmanship.

429
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,910
I'm a fighter, not a sportsman.

430
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:56,411
I'm a great fighter at that.

431
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,456
Why would you bring that up now?

432
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,917
If whatever it is
that's giving you a hard time

433
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,502
is something
that can be fought off by force,

434
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:07,505
just tell me. I'll fight it off for you.

435
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,050
I'm a good fighter.

436
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,762
Tell me. Who is it?

437
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,096
In-guk.

438
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:20,477
Gosh, I already lost.

439
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,317
Did the actor put on the facial mask?

440
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,904
No.

441
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:45,877
You're a genius.

442
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,006
Good.

443
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,052
This is good.

444
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,441
I look beautiful.

445
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,652
My skin is bright.

446
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:12,654
The anti-aging effect.

447
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,579
Who is it?

448
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,164
Do you have something against me?

449
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,249
Whose is it?

450
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:28,211
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

451
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,842
I'm sorry, Ms. Hwang.

452
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,429
Well, you're a very young mother.

453
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,599
So-yeong, why did you hit In-guk?

454
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,563
Well, In-guk told So-yeong

455
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,773
that he wanted to end the relationship.

456
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,320
What? She's your classmate.

457
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,155
How would you end the relationship?

458
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,117
Kids these days mature early.

459
00:27:03,913 --> 00:27:07,250
So you just let her hit you?

460
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,669
No. I tried to fight but I lost.

461
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,297
I swung my fist but she ducked.

462
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,718
So-yeong is learning martial arts.

463
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,511
I'm sorry, Ms. Hwang.

464
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,059
In-guk.

465
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,853
You're bad at fighting.

466
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,481
I'm good at running. I can just run away.

467
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,865
I run for two hours every day.

468
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,534
I'm bad at fighting,
so I should always be ready

469
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,788
-to run away.
-Hey, you bastard!

470
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,289
Hey!

471
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,926
Why didn't you run away then?

472
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,177
I got caught.

473
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,806
Then you're not a fast runner.

474
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,891
No, So-yeong is just faster.

475
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,976
I'm not going to the academy today.

476
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,561
Why all of a sudden?

477
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,106
Kids will make fun of me
for getting beaten by So-yeong.

478
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,983
Is that what you're worried about?

479
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,946
Why did you take that after him?

480
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,281
You don't even get to see your dad
that often.

481
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,658
And are you proud of that?

482
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:52,939
Hey.

483
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,401
Do you miss Dad?

484
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,156
LEE EUN-JEONG APPEARS ON
I HEARD A RUMOR AS LEE SO-MIN'S FRIEND

485
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,618
"The unexpected friend of Lee So-min.

486
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:08,329
She's a close friend
of Director Lee Eun-jeong."

487
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,956
"You two have great chemistry.

488
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,125
I'll make sure to watch the show
live on air for you two."

489
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,254
People loved it.
Even more people are watching the re-runs.

490
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,006
I think you'll have to keep doing this.

491
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,467
Forget it. Go back to your place
if you're done with your thing.

492
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,303
-I'm not doing it.
-It's not up to you to decide.

493
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:27,015
The viewers are loving it.
The station won't let you go.

494
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,476
Gosh, what a headache.

495
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,229
You two look so close though.
I thought you cut ties.

496
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:36,983
It's nothing so grand.
She stopped contacting me,

497
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,818
and I lost her completely
once she made it big.

498
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,236
That's what happened.

499
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,406
That's what happens
when you have a lot to lose.

500
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,286
I still don't get her
after all those years.

501
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,163
We are both women,

502
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,831
but I can't tell what she's thinking

503
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,084
or what intention she has
behind her behavior or words.

504
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,048
You know, she sometimes seems harmless.

505
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,885
Eun-jeong, you're curious, aren't you?

506
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,762
What do you mean?

507
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,722
You said you wanted to work on people

508
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,766
instead of social issues this time.

509
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:13,061
Yes, I did. So what?

510
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,024
-Lee So-min?
-Yes. I like the idea.

511
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,359
As for the title...

512
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:21,486
A Woman, An Actress. How does that sound?

513
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:26,115
I like it. But think about it.

514
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,117
An actress is someone who acts.

515
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,411
When there's a camera in front of her,
it is her instinct to act

516
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,956
in order to entertain the public.

517
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,041
That'd be a variety show,
not a documentary.

518
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:38,753
You could just watch shows like
I Live Alone.

519
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,298
You've lost your touch.
Our job is to film what's real.

520
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,093
It is also our job to get
what's real out of them, isn't it?

521
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,098
I still can't get my head around it.

522
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,976
Since when did we work
only after we got our head around things?

523
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:56,062
Until when will you stay jobless?
It's time you start working.

524
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,148
I'll produce and cast So-min.

525
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,358
It's your call now.

526
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,404
Come on.

527
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,504
DRESSING ROOM
LEE SO-MIN

528
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,327
Pizza will get cold. Eat this too.

529
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,203
Eat up, Min-jun.

530
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,503
What is it? What's wrong?

531
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,132
-So-min.
-Yes, Min-jun.

532
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,635
There's no way you'd feel full
by watching others eat.

533
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,845
Yes. It is possible.

534
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,348
Look. I already feel full.

535
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,185
No.

536
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,896
It only works when your love
surpasses everything else.

537
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:24,025
For example, when parents
watch their children eat.

538
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,694
When farmers watch the field get watered.

539
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,989
When the actress watches her manager
eat carbohydrates.

540
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:34,619
I love you dearly. I'm so full right now.

541
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:40,291
Just eat if you're going to lose yourself.
You're too skinny now.

542
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:44,379
You're not shooting any dramas
these days anyway. Just eat.

543
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:47,382
Hey, stop burning your carbs
and eat already.

544
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,925
I said I'm full.

545
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,147
What do you say?
Shall I dip this in the sauce?

546
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,025
Oh, right. You should. Dip a lot.

547
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,112
I'll just cover the pizza with the sauce.

548
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,615
What about the chicken?

549
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,041
How about some sausage?

550
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,044
Okay.

551
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,722
I'm so full.

552
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,349
My stomach is about to burst.

553
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,732
What? Why?

554
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,610
-I am curious.
-Why? What?

555
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,447
Hello.

556
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,740
Right now, I'm...

557
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,033
-Is that so?
-Hello.

558
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,119
-Hey, you're here.
-Hi.

559
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,373
Did you take a good rest?
Let's not take any breaks today.

560
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,167
Why would you worry about such things?

561
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,670
-How can I not?
-You're so cute.

562
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,005
-You're scary.
-Hello.

563
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,382
-Hey, you're here.
-Hello.

564
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,426
-He's so handsome.
-Thank you.

565
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,678
-Hi, Il-jung.
-Hello.

566
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,013
Can I call you by your name?

567
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,098
Sure.

568
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,977
Why are you blushing? You must be happy.

569
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:29,358
-Am I blushing?
-No. You're just dull.

570
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,570
You seem tired.

571
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,655
-I know.
-Not all actresses are like her.

572
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,616
She's just extraordinary, right?

573
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,242
She sure seems interesting.

574
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,995
Wouldn't it look too much like
a commercial approach though?

575
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,998
It's fine as long as
you don't approach it that way.

576
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,085
Even if I manage to film reality,
it'll still look fake.

577
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,669
You haven't said you'd do it yet.

578
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,964
Right.
I can say no if I don't want to do it.

579
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,093
Ms. Lee, I'll put your mic on you.

580
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:57,428
-Oh, okay.
-Please do us a favor.

581
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,305
Look at the director's face.

582
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,975
His heart failed while he was editing
last week's episode.

583
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:05,520
He now looks like a zombie, doesn't he?

584
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:08,147
Oh, okay. Don't worry.

585
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:09,732
Thank you in advance.

586
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,869
All the panelists are ready.
You can start when you are.

587
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,881
Okay. Good job!

588
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:38,010
-Good job.
-Good job.

589
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,390
Good job, sir.

590
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,225
Ms. Kim, when did you get here?

591
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,562
I came to say hello.
I got here earlier and watched.

592
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,150
Oh, we didn't leave you out on purpose.
You know that, right?

593
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,610
We wanted to have both you and Ms. Lee
on the program.

594
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,572
I had to leave for my situation.
Don't worry.

595
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,073
Did it go well today?

596
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,324
Well, yes.

597
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,411
I'm not sure if the two made a deal.

598
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,955
It's kind of awkward
because they didn't argue.

599
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,375
Hey.

600
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,298
-Why are you so nice to me today?
-Is that a problem?

601
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,757
Why didn't you get aggressive?

602
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,719
I'm not aggressive. I'm defensive.

603
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:21,512
You kept nitpicking me last time.

604
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:24,849
I didn't. I corrected your mistakes.

605
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,144
You think everything is crooked
except for yourself.

606
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,855
No. Just you.

607
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:34,525
Gosh, my actress. It's getting late.
Let's go.

608
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,403
We're not late. I have nothing else to do.

609
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,198
The traffic will get worse now.

610
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,784
Eun-jeong, I'm going to talk
to the writers.

611
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,412
-Okay, I'll be in the green room.
-Okay.

612
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,957
So-min doesn't have a temper.

613
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,251
She's just like a little kid
who throws a tantrum.

614
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,171
It's kind of funny to play along with her.

615
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,218
Aren't you going to talk to the writers?

616
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,385
I'm done.

617
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,678
That was quick.

618
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,347
You could've texted them instead.

619
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,905
There are so many cars already.

620
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,824
Do you know why the Olympic-daero
is always jammed?

621
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,743
I don't think I'll guess it right.

622
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,497
Because the Olympics is a festival.

623
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,124
I knew it. I couldn't have got that.

624
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,294
-What do you want me to do? Laugh?
-No.

625
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,129
Thanks for putting up with me.

626
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,714
What is it? What's gotten into you?

627
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,883
-What do you mean?
-Why are you cheering me up?

628
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,468
It's making me more anxious.
Don't do that.

629
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,137
I feel like I bullied you
with food earlier.

630
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,598
Don't realize your faults.
That's weird. It makes me more anxious.

631
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,934
I know you always sacrifice yourself.

632
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,769
I'll just be aware of it.

633
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,564
Will you sacrifice yourself for once?

634
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,026
What do you want? I'll do it just once.

635
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,030
I want to go to a Korean restaurant

636
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,033
and eat a meal with you.

637
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,412
Not just me. With you.

638
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,180
Let's see how we go.

639
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,765
Okay. I'll start.

640
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:30,850
One.

641
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,398
I'm sorry.

642
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:38,733
A-RANG

643
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,443
Who is it? Is it a guy?

644
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,403
-No, it's a woman.
-Answer it then.

645
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,449
I think I'll have to take this. I'm sorry.

646
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,375
-Hello?
-It's been a while, Hyo-bong.

647
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,294
Hi, A-rang. What's up?

648
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:03,174
Well, it's about Eun-jeong.

649
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,134
Is she still the same?

650
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,636
Oh, you mean...

651
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,642
-Yes. I'm keeping my eyes on her.
-Okay.

652
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,937
It must be hard for you. I'm just worried.

653
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,689
I'm thinking about what to do.

654
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,024
Okay.

655
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:21,859
All right, then.

656
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,236
I'll think about it too.

657
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,947
Okay. Thanks, A-rang.

658
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,533
All right, let's talk in person
another time.

659
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,743
Okay.

660
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,334
Let's take a ten-minute break.

661
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,961
No, it's fine.

662
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,302
Hyo-bong, why do you look so down?

663
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,679
Is it from a girl you like?

664
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,640
Do you like girls now?

665
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,479
My sister's friend is a screenwriter.

666
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,357
And she's working
with Director Son Beom-su.

667
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,567
I don't know why,

668
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,403
but she says whenever he hears
the song you wrote,

669
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,113
he becomes extremely depressed.

670
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,322
Oh, right.

671
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,410
It's been really long
since you dated someone, right?

672
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,621
Let's play.

673
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,415
One, two.

674
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:32,680
So,

675
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,015
where will the guitar pop up from
this time?

676
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,018
I won't play it while I eat.
I'll have to use my mouth and hands.

677
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,104
Then we should talk while we eat.

678
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,398
Go on. I'll sing the whole song
after we're done eating.

679
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,732
I heard enough.

680
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,278
Are things better now
that you've teased me enough?

681
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,863
Let's not be...

682
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,116
so awkward anymore, okay?

683
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,326
Okay.

684
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,787
Hello.

685
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,172
Hello, Ms. Lim.

686
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,549
Hi.

687
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,096
Hello.

688
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,558
-Hello, Mr. Son.
-Hi.

689
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,359
-Da-mi.
-Yes?

690
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,236
I thought my mom came up
with this week's menu.

691
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,782
Your mom must have fed you good food.
That's why you've become so upright.

692
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,619
You think so?

693
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,372
So I'm an upright man.

694
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,750
Am I that upright?

695
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,669
Yes, you are.

696
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,632
You're so upright, Mr. Kim.

697
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,302
You would've made a great teacher.

698
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,559
Yes, sir.

699
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,189
Pardon?

700
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:09,401
No, I'll go to your office.
Give me a moment.

701
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,071
I'm downstairs. Yes.

702
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,073
-Did something bad happen?
-No.

703
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,075
Ms. Lim, I'll have to go upstairs
for a minute.

704
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,078
Can you stay with Hwan-dong?
I'll be quick.

705
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:24,166
This is so awkward.

706
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,628
Well...

707
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,971
So Ms. Jung won't work here
if we air Ms. Lim's work?

708
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,850
Come on. It's so childish
that I don't even know what to say.

709
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,853
Hey, I heard Ms. Lim was
Ms. Jung's assistant.

710
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,565
Even I'd feel like shit.

711
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,025
It must be like

712
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:52,653
her boyfriend having an affair
with her daughter and leaving home.

713
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,155
That's some twisted analogy.

714
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,615
We had different thoughts,

715
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,867
and I only came across with
Ms. Lim's work after that.

716
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:01,287
Whether that's the fact or not,

717
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,373
it'd be hard for Ms. Jung
to see it the same way.

718
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,834
Just work on something else.

719
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,378
It didn't win an award
at our writing contest.

720
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,255
We have no reason to produce it.

721
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,923
I'm the reason, sir.

722
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,300
I'm Son Beom-su.

723
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,884
And I'm Sung In-jong.

724
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,220
And we work at JBC.

725
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,808
The organization does not follow
the decision made for an individual.

726
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,144
You're saying you'll follow
Ms. Jung's decision though.

727
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,606
Ms. Jung will become a free agent
after this drama.

728
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,942
A lot of companies are offering her
long-term contracts.

729
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:35,654
It'll have been for nothing
if we let others take her.

730
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,156
What about me?

731
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,367
Will you trample on me
for the sake of her pride?

732
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,703
No matter how competent a writer is,

733
00:43:42,911 --> 00:43:45,664
a writer is an outsider
but you're our staff.

734
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,208
Do you think an organization would
ditch our staff

735
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,793
just to hold onto a profitable outsider?

736
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:50,961
Yes.

737
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,422
Well, it's true.

738
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,051
Gosh, what should we do then?

739
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:00,804
Let's have a meeting.

740
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,848
The revised script for episode three
will be ready soon.

741
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,183
Ms. Lim and I will

742
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,477
go to the meeting
with the decision-makers.

743
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,811
We'll do a presentation.

744
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,855
We'll show you how competitive
this piece can be

745
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,982
and why we must air it on JBC.

746
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,692
You can decide then and there.

747
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,071
A meaningful work can't be
rejected by a TV station

748
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:18,656
because of a silly battle of pride.

749
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:21,784
JBC can do better than that.

750
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,663
I'll think you got what I mean.

751
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,639
You like this.

752
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,641
Don't act like you know.

753
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,559
I only pretended to like it.

754
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,437
In fact, I pretended to be okay with it.

755
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:54,274
I've always liked the one
where you have 31 flavors to choose from.

756
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,321
You pretended to be okay for seven years?

757
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:03,200
Yes. That's why I don't think about you.
It only gives me wrinkles.

758
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,119
Do you see the wrinkles on my neck now?

759
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,662
This will get me more.

760
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,039
You had wrinkles even when you were young.

761
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,833
I said, don't act like you know me.

762
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,127
What do you know about my neck wrinkles?

763
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,882
Right, I don't.

764
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:24,346
Anyway, thanks for deciding
to work with me nevertheless.

765
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,933
It's about my survival.
You don't need to thank me.

766
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,437
It's not like you'll support me
financially. You never did.

767
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,826
Do you still hate me?

768
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,786
I heard that means you're not over me.

769
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:51,957
I hate you because
we broke up while I hated you.

770
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,667
We are over

771
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:55,169
because I'm not going to date you again.

772
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,962
Where did you even hear that?

773
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,634
Why must you always talk so harshly?

774
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:06,054
You started it first.

775
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,057
You haven't changed.
You always have reasons

776
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,976
for talking so harshly. That's so petty.

777
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,228
What? Did you call me petty?

778
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:15,772
Yes. You always said this.

779
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,525
"You started it."

780
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:20,777
You always managed to remember
the mistakes I made

781
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,779
and used it to protect yourself.

782
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,198
It's so petty.

783
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:26,492
You haven't changed either.

784
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,494
You laugh when a woman laughs.

785
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,871
You can't help laughing
at the slightest compliment.

786
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,873
I heard you're not even dating Da-mi.

787
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,792
I'm close.
Am I not allowed to be close to her?

788
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,419
Of course you can be.

789
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,881
You can laugh, joke, and be sweet.

790
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:44,343
But the problem is that you did it
even when you had a girlfriend.

791
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,470
Always. With everyone.

792
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,556
And? Did I ever do anything wrong though?

793
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,185
That in itself is a wrong thing to do.
You don't even know what's the issue here.

794
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,853
You just don't get what's wrong.

795
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,482
Forget it. I'm still arguing about
the same thing

796
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:01,360
I argued with you for seven years.
I'm the crazy one.

797
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,322
There are more bad things
than good things about a relationship.

798
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,911
Gosh, you and your talk.

799
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,874
Fine. As you said,
we dated for seven years.

800
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,293
Couldn't you just be polite?

801
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,921
What do the seven years mean though?

802
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,465
I wasn't happy for five years.

803
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:26,885
So you were happy for two years.

804
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,640
You were in the army for two years.

805
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,476
Seriously.

806
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,963
Well.

807
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,592
The viewer rating you got at this station
must add up to like 50,000 percent.

808
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,677
Why do they care so much
about that writer?

809
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,014
I know. It makes you feel like crap.

810
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,317
Do people live

811
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,402
so that they can fight?

812
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,489
Our every day is
like a battlefield already.

813
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,991
Must you be like this now?

814
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,704
You fight with your shoulders
in the subway.

815
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,540
You fight with your words at work.

816
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:40,834
You fight with your comments
on the internet.

817
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,087
The earth is one big battlefield.

818
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,258
Why did we have to choose to fight
when we were in love?

819
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,718
Is it because of our everyday life?

820
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:53,388
Was it like a habit because we are always
ready to fight in our everyday life?

821
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,445
You're driving me crazy!

822
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,906
You told me to throw a fit.
Did you think I couldn't do it?

823
00:49:10,989 --> 00:49:13,033
Don't you know me already?

824
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,743
Stop it!

825
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,747
How dare you break up with me?

826
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,375
Everyone thinks you're nice, right?

827
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,336
No one knows that you toy with women
and ditch them.

828
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,800
-Let go.
-Stop it. Let's talk outside.

829
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,259
Let go!

830
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:33,428
Let go!

831
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,535
I understand.

832
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,580
I can just understand.

833
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,584
When we're done cleaning this up,

834
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,128
pretend like nothing happened.

835
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,296
Okay.

836
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:21,893
You're not a good fighter.

837
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,482
Why are the guys I like

838
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,235
all poor at fighting?

839
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:39,619
You don't need to feel bad or embarrassed.

840
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,623
Ms. Lee told us to pretend
like nothing happened.

841
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,501
Thank you.

842
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,569
-What?
-You know I used to be a girl scout.

843
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,362
-Yes.
-It's an oath.

844
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,656
Oh, an oath.

845
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,700
I swear on my honor

846
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,661
to keep the following promises.

847
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,498
One. I will give my all

848
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,208
for God and Jae-hun.

849
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,462
Two. I'll always be there to help Jae-hun.

850
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:31,463
Three.

851
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:35,884
I will always keep the rule we made.

852
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,098
Okay. I'll do the same.

853
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:45,393
And our rule

854
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,355
-is to respect each other.
-Yes.

855
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:52,359
-But...
-What?

856
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:54,110
Aren't you supposed to use three fingers?

857
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,954
-I swear!
-Hey.

858
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,249
What is this, a crab?
I swear on my honor...

859
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,501
-I'm a crab.
-Quit it.

860
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,135
Jin-joo.

861
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,181
He's my boyfriend, Jeong-hwan.

862
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,892
Hello, miss.

863
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,185
Let's go inside.

864
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,324
Drink some coke too.

865
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,834
You're poor, aren't you?

866
00:53:35,837 --> 00:53:36,671
Well...

867
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:39,215
Yes, but not completely broke.

868
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,093
What a question to throw
at your sister's boyfriend.

869
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,637
How long have you guys dated for?

870
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,846
For about 20 days.

871
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,140
-Do you like Ji-yeong?
-I love her.

872
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,100
How much money do you have
in your pocket right now?

873
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,021
-3,000 won.
-Can you give it all to her?

874
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,940
-Of course.
-What if you had three million?

875
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:57,192
I can give it to her too.

876
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,404
She wouldn't even ask for it.
It's fine as long as you feel that way.

877
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:04,240
If you feel like she doesn't know,
then do your best to let her know.

878
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,409
Try in all sorts of ways.
Don't get frustrated.

879
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,954
Don't get anxious. She won't run away.

880
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,164
She could pretend not to know
even when she does.

881
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,707
You might not get why.

882
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,627
Don't try to understand her.
Guys can't possibly understand girls.

883
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,672
Just do what's expected of you.
Do your best.

884
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,802
Don't be ashamed that you've no money
and don't try to hide it.

885
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,262
She'd know how you must feel as a guy.

886
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:29,182
Even if you try to hide it,
it won't save your face.

887
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,935
Don't feel bad about only being
able to afford a 1,000-won popsicle.

888
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:34,479
It's much better to think about
how to make her laugh

889
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,272
with the 1,000-won popsicle.

890
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,732
It'd still be cute even if you fail.

891
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,025
It'd be cool if you pull it off.

892
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,986
That's it. Don't be too logical.

893
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,529
Be understanding even if she brings up

894
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,823
your mistakes from the past
and uses it to cover her faults.

895
00:54:44,906 --> 00:54:47,200
How could lovers try to win
in a logical argument?

896
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:48,368
Everyone knows who's right.

897
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,161
What if it doesn't make sense?

898
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,413
Must you always win?

899
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,124
Just say sorry and be understanding.

900
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,167
A hug will do. You love her.

901
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:59,170
Jin-joo, please stop.

902
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,423
I think my ears are about to bleed.

903
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,719
Even if you get angry and you hate her,

904
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,429
and even if she doesn't apologize...

905
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:10,849
If you must hear her apology,
then you don't love her.

906
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,517
Girls always want to look pretty.

907
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,853
But saying "I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I won't do it again"

908
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,313
doesn't make her look pretty.

909
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,399
Don't say you'll still find her pretty.

910
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,901
She'll get scared in case
what you're saying isn't true.

911
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,029
Why would you make your girlfriend scared?

912
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,156
That's what you should know.

913
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,658
Don't be ignorant
unless you're going to break up.

914
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,331
Unless you're going to break up...

915
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,420
Unless you're determined to break up...

916
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,090
Please...

917
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,218
don't be ignorant.

918
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,655
You don't need to finish everything.

919
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:08,865
You know me.

920
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,159
I can starve but I can't stop
in the middle of eating.

921
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,839
Goodness.

922
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:28,885
My Little Mermaid has a huge appetite.

923
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,388
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes. Now I want to do something.

924
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,932
-What is it?
-Burping.

925
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,229
But you burp loudly.

926
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:40,772
Are you going to do it as usual?

927
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,816
Yes. I want to burp all I want.

928
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,653
But there are many people here.

929
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,157
Then, do it on the count of three.

930
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,242
Okay.

931
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:57,163
One, two, three.

932
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,841
-What's going on?
-What's wrong with him?

933
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,218
I'm sorry.

934
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,263
I thought it was a bug, but it was a bean.

935
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,472
I'm sorry.

936
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:33,741
Mother.

937
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,703
You have two daughters.

938
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,705
Yes, I do.

939
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:41,291
Unfortunately,

940
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,377
one of them seems to be insane.

941
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,129
I know that.

942
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,339
And that you're not the insane one.

943
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,937
We are having a lot of
speechless nights these days.

944
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:11,154
I'm not going to ask.
I don't want to be shocked.

945
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,805
IN-GUK'S DAD

946
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,124
Hey, just answer my question.

947
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:48,960
-Right now? I was sleeping.
-Yes.

948
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:52,171
Are you still on about Ms. Jung?

949
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:55,133
Why would a couple that broke up

950
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,051
-over two years ago meet and quarrel?
-What?

951
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,761
It's been two years after they broke up.

952
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,513
But why would they fight again?

953
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,016
I guess they are not over each other.
Why am I even answering?

954
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,100
Right?

955
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,770
-They still have feelings for each other.
-What did they argue about?

956
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:09,856
I don't know that.

957
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,482
It could be a different case.

958
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:12,483
It could be a money issue

959
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,319
or they got drunk and
glared at each other.

960
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,864
They should've taken it to court
if it's a money issue.

961
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,699
They would've fought at a bar
if they got drunk.

962
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,326
Why would they fight at work, you lunatic?

963
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,869
Why are you getting angry at me?

964
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,203
I'm hanging up, you asshole.

965
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,663
You crazy--

966
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,674
How are you doing?
Are you still a dickhead?

967
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:48,102
SOL-BI

968
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,273
I'm not answering your text.

969
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,824
I'm still by your house

970
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,996
I want to tell you

971
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:10,958
That I always wait for you

972
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:14,837
What are you doing?

973
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:22,679
The swaying flowers

974
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:28,226
Smelled like your shampoo

975
01:01:29,769 --> 01:01:32,230
In case you went past me

976
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,274
I look around

977
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,195
But all I see are other people

978
01:01:41,656 --> 01:01:45,034
Around your house

979
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:50,623
I fiddle with my phone

980
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:57,672
I muster up my courage to call you

981
01:01:57,755 --> 01:02:02,510
But it only makes me sad

982
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:07,432
When I walk around

983
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:10,268
I want to tell you

984
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:13,730
That I always wait for you

985
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:18,609
I'm still by your house

986
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,404
I want to tell you I called

987
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:24,824
Because I missed you

988
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:45,428
Love changes, but the truth doesn't.

989
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,889
It hurts so much.

990
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:52,977
It's a huge opportunity
to have met someone you love.

991
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,146
And when you lose the opportunity,

992
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,606
it hurts.

993
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:58,274
Your bones ache.

994
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:04,322
How can you tease me with this?

995
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,995
Let's go eat.

996
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,055
DO YOU STILL HATE ME?

997
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,181
THAT MEANS YOU'RE NOT OVER ME

998
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,557
I HATE YOU
BECAUSE WE BROKE UP WHILE I HATED YOU

999
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:32,683
WE'RE OVER
BECAUSE I WON'T DATE YOU AGAIN

1000
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,976
WHERE DID YOU EVEN HEAR THAT?

1001
01:03:37,855 --> 01:03:42,026
WHY ARE THE GUYS I LIKE
ALL POOR AT FIGHTING?

1002
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,613
IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY
TO HAVE MET SOMEONE YOU LOVE

1003
01:03:45,696 --> 01:03:47,031
AND WHEN YOU LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY,

1004
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:48,699
IT HURTS, YOUR BONES ACHE

1005
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,409
HOW CAN YOU TEASE ME WITH THIS?

1006
01:03:52,119 --> 01:03:55,039
Did you see Ha-yun a few days ago?
She said she saw you.

1007
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:57,166
She could go to clubs.
Why are you being so petty?

1008
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,085
But she was kissing some guy.

1009
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,128
It's understandable.

1010
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,422
I saw her going into a hotel
with that man.

1011
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:06,759
When your loved one is having a hard time,

1012
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,429
and if your hug doesn't help her,
what else could I do?

1013
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,848
Thank you.

1014
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,559
It's not because I'm not over him.

1015
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:16,310
I like you.

1016
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,272
It's that I can't forget my heartaches.

1017
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,816
Surprisingly, we have no time
to be shocked.

1018
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:25,444
It won't be easy, but it'll be fun.
Let's do this.

1019
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:27,238
Ms. Lim, are you strong?

1020
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,826
I'm Son Beom-su.
Did you just ask her if she's strong?

1021
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,995
-She's freaking strong.
-Hey.

1022
01:04:34,078 --> 01:04:36,706
She downs 12 glasses of
draft beer in one sitting.

1023
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:38,249
-Hey.
-She prefers soju with beer.

1024
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:39,584
She starts making soju bombs.

1025
01:04:39,667 --> 01:04:42,545
Twelve glasses of beer were
just to warm her up.

1026
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,464
