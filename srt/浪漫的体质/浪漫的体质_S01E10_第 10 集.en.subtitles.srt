1
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,261
-Hello, sir.
-So you signed the contract.

2
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:54,846
I heard the news. Congratulations.

3
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,890
Gosh, it's all thanks to you.

4
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,308
Which brings me to my question.

5
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,894
Before you get too busy,
can you write a short drama for me?

6
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,937
It's really short. It's a web-drama.

7
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,608
I'm really grateful for your offer.

8
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,068
The premier date will be set soon,

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,278
but I haven't gotten far
with the scripts yet.

10
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,031
You have offered me a great opportunity,
but I just don't have the time.

11
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,574
I'm really sorry, sir.

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,118
Well, okay.

13
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,662
It's nothing for you to be sorry about.

14
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,456
By the way, Ms. Lim,

15
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,834
you've gotten quite arrogant now.
You know that?

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,633
I was polite to him unlike before.

17
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,430
-Hi.
-Are you sleeping?

18
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,973
Then, just listen.

19
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,850
I'm going to film a web-drama soon.

20
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,352
And I need a story as soon as possible.

21
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,103
It's a short drama.
Treat it as a part-time gig.

22
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,816
I'm working my butt off to get signed
by an agency right now.

23
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,527
You know the situation I am in.
I don't have time for a gig.

24
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,946
Are you hinting me no one will sign me?

25
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,281
Gosh, no. I didn't say that.

26
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,326
I asked just in case.
You are indeed a professional.

27
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:59,828
Oaky, I got it. Keep your chin up.

28
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,496
Get some more sleep. Good luck!

29
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,082
When I was being pathetic,

30
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:07,210
he pitied me
no matter how rude I was to him.

31
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,387
In your recent drama, albeit discreetly,

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,514
you did talk about the refugee problem.

33
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,392
What do you think about people who argue

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,518
that refugees are bad?

35
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,271
"Refugees are bad?"

36
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,067
How can someone say such a thing?

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,028
People who do bad things
should be considered bad.

38
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,698
Well, we do have different opinions.

39
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,825
I cannot criticize someone
for having different opinions.

40
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,828
But if the problems include
our opinions of ethics,

41
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,413
we must be more careful...

42
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,540
THE MIRACLE OF 1 SECOND
KIM DAE-HYEON

43
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,049
DIRECTOR SON BEOM-SU SAYS,
"REFUGEES ARE BAD!"

44
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,134
Look.

45
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,512
How could you change
my question into an exclamation?

46
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,016
When did I make a statement
that they are bad?

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,143
"Are they bad?"

48
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,520
"Refugees are bad?"

49
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,105
See? The tone goes up.

50
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,024
It was definitely a question.

51
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,277
No, your tone sounded like
an exclamation to me.

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,321
I recorded the interview.
Do you want me to send it?

53
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,031
It was definitely an exclamation.

54
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,284
Damn it.

55
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,579
It's more frustrating

56
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:27,081
as we could never know
if the misrepresentation was intentional

57
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:30,001
or was just an error of failing
to read the situation correctly.

58
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,128
Our reality prevents us to make

59
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,213
a documentary,
anticipating profits at the theaters.

60
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,924
As there are more platforms of mass media,

61
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,010
we should do everything we can
in order to promote the documentary

62
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:40,553
to the point we planned in the beginning.

63
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,141
Since you hit it big
with a documentary before,

64
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,226
platforms line up for you?

65
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,019
No. That's not what I said at all.

66
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,234
No, that's not what I said. It's
completely different from what I said.

67
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,568
I'm saying it'll be hard to make--

68
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,778
That's not important.

69
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,446
They are trying to invest
in your documentary.

70
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,243
Please read Article Four once again.

71
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,662
Okay.

72
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,955
Hey.

73
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,458
I told you it was scheduled in spring.
I never said it'd air in April.

74
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,210
Is April spring?

75
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:13,836
Why don't you go to the field?

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,838
People still wear winter jackets in April.

77
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,632
No.

78
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,512
No. Why won't you understand it as it is?

79
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,014
Don't read between the lines.

80
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,725
You just have to take
whatever I say as it is!

81
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,319
Look at the meeting log.

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,406
I told you the main character
has to drive an import.

83
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:44,575
When you said it, you didn't seem happy.

84
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,244
We were trying to be considerate.

85
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,871
Why would you decide something like that
based on the look on my face?

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,208
I clearly stated what I wanted,
and it was recorded right here.

87
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,132
We always face a situation like this
almost every day.

88
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:03,344
And we must go through a painful
transformation of becoming someone else.

89
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,848
Come on. How can't you tell
spinach and water celery apart?

90
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,182
Are you serious?

91
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,979
Just because they are both green,
it doesn't mean they are the same.

92
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,230
They have different names.

93
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,940
One is called spinach.
The other, water celery.

94
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,859
Send me the right vegetables now.

95
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,287
Listen.

96
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,040
They only talk at such predictable places.

97
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,916
I was trying to take a different approach.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,961
I said, "For example,
they could go to a swimming pool

99
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,380
or a dry sauna. Can't they?"

100
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,467
I didn't say they should go
to these places. I was making an example.

101
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,219
But how could you make them go to

102
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,347
the swimming pool and sauna? How?

103
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,933
They get out of bed,
and now they're at a sauna.

104
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,352
But from the bed to a swimming pool?

105
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,521
How would the Creator look

106
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,066
while looking down upon all of us
and our situations?

107
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:01,110
Could it be similar to the look
of the go-player who missed his chance?

108
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,197
Or the look of the mathematician
who just solved a hard question?

109
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,075
Or the look of a swindler
who just nailed a scam?

110
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,786
Is it a mistake, a calculated move,

111
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,704
or a trap?

112
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:31,140
Trap. It was a trap.

113
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,398
Or I might have planned it.

114
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,655
My bad. It won't smell.

115
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,785
Hold on.

116
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,121
We have an error.

117
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,086
This round is a bust.

118
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,473
Stop. Freeze.

119
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,101
Hyo-bong, hands above your head.

120
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,110
Bottoms on the floor, stop shifting.

121
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,529
Do you take me for a doofus?

122
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,574
A bystander lifting his bottom
and farting during the game?

123
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,914
When he lifted his bottom,

124
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,335
you slid a card
under his bottom, didn't you?

125
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,759
Do you have proof?

126
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,053
Proof?

127
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,140
I'll bet all of my money and my wrist
that this bastard has an April card

128
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,226
hidden between his ass
and the laminate floor.

129
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,852
What will you bet?

130
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,274
Get your wrist ready.

131
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,237
Hyo-bong. Arms up, roll backward.

132
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,331
How many times have I told you
not to be crafty like this

133
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,666
while pretending to be innocent?

134
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,669
Get moving. Bring me the hammer.

135
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,698
Don't just stand there.
Go ahead. Strike it.

136
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,991
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,162
You're doing all sorts of bad stuff
when you have a child in the house.

138
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,958
You like my sister, don't you?

139
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,420
My sister suggested getting
another hobby other than drinking.

140
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,630
And everyone totally got on board,
you know.

141
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,302
Is that why you're gambling?

142
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,350
This is a board game like Halli Galli
you play with your friends.

143
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,729
This is called Go-Stop, as in "Should we
go or stop?" Go-Stop. Halli Galli.

144
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,772
Halli Galli. Go-Stop.
Don't they sound similar?

145
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,983
Gamblers bet money on games, you know.

146
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,831
I love you.

147
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,124
Pee before you go to sleep.

148
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,004
Do it!

149
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,762
This isn't fun, either.

150
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,809
I want to be miserable comfortably.

151
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:48,022
Could you get off me now? Please?

152
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,358
Do you want to sleep together?

153
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:51,942
No.

154
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,071
Okay. Let's sleep together.

155
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,823
Do you want me to breastfeed you?

156
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,494
You crazy bitch, you.

157
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,248
You.

158
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,834
Why do you keep playing guitar at night?

159
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,128
This song has a calming effect.

160
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,635
I have

161
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,888
so much support in my life.

162
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,517
I have a human jukebox.

163
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,229
And I have someone to sleep with.

164
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,564
And someone to breastfeed me.

165
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,778
MY PARENTS WON'T LET ME EAT JUNK FOOD

166
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,280
SO MY CHEF MAKES ORGANIC INSTANT NOODLES

167
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:02,448
I'M NOT SURE IF I'LL LIKE THIS

168
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,130
Isn't it nice to read webtoons

169
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,216
during working hours
now that you're in the Planning Team?

170
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:24,220
Yes. I wouldn't mind
getting paid less for this.

171
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,555
You should probably get paid more.

172
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,392
You need to read hundreds
of webtoons and online novels

173
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,686
just to make one of them into a drama.

174
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,606
You'll have to write a proposal,
check scripts, and look for typos.

175
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,108
You'll have to keep checking
and write up all sorts of documents.

176
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,781
You'll end up spending all of
your paycheck for the medical bills

177
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,825
after your eyes get bad
and you get round shoulders.

178
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,453
Who would...

179
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,289
Do you remember Bo-mi from SD?

180
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,376
She's so young and only 32 years old.

181
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:59,713
But her hip joint gave out,
so she quit her job last month.

182
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,591
I should have been nicer to her.

183
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,011
Make sure you stretch every 20 minutes

184
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,056
-and stay hydrated.
-Okay.

185
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,183
That's the only way to survive for us.

186
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,604
-How's the webtoon?
-Pardon?

187
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,649
This one? It's really fun to read.

188
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,317
I bet someone already bought the right.

189
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,610
No. Not yet.

190
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,363
I've been checking it every day.

191
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,074
Before we get too busy,
let's buy the publication right.

192
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,201
And get started on the proposal.

193
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,662
Please put it on the agenda
for Monday's meeting.

194
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,414
Okay. I'm sure Ms. Lee will like it, too.

195
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,046
Right. And one more thing.

196
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,673
Here you go.

197
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,052
We got free tickets.

198
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,389
I remembered that Ha-yun liked musicals
when we met the other day.

199
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,017
You guys should watch it together.

200
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:55,060
Okay. Thank you.

201
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,124
Aren't you happy to film a commercial?

202
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,585
I'm feeling good. You look worse than me.

203
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,003
I'm feeling good.

204
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,172
Both of you aren't feeling good, right?

205
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,341
Did you get permission for us to film?

206
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,009
Yes. I asked the agency to check it.

207
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,719
We're good, right?

208
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,804
Yes. Right. So...

209
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,851
Well... Is it okay for them to film?

210
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,192
You can't ask me that.

211
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,110
I'll check on it now.

212
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,490
Forget it.

213
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:54,286
-I already told the director. It's fine.
-Okay.

214
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,876
It's a refreshing morning
With a smooth feeling

215
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,672
Feel your body getting light

216
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:08,384
Say goodbye to your constipation forever

217
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,683
Bye, constipation

218
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,412
Is something wrong
or are you just bad at acting?

219
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,082
Or is it both, by any chance?

220
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,795
What kind of actress shows her feelings
in front of a camera?

221
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,171
How?

222
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,341
An actress should know
how to act on camera!

223
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,886
Hey, if you want to work only
when you feel good, run an online channel.

224
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,138
If you want this, smile!

225
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,390
Smile as if you're over the moon
not to be constipated!

226
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,896
Hey!

227
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,524
You son of a bitch. Don't film me.

228
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,901
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,154
Fucking hell.

230
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,198
Bringing a cameraman to my set?
What kind of foul move is that?

231
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,161
Get ready, will you?

232
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,402
You were a delinquent in school,
but you can't even ride a motorcycle.

233
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,905
So for how long are you on a break?

234
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,033
I don't know.

235
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,785
My dream got squashed.

236
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,996
What if I became a delinquent again?

237
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,414
You know,

238
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,459
I've been one for 12 years
from elementary school to high school.

239
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,252
I really gave it my all to be one.

240
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,379
Now I don't know why I gave my all
for that crazy stuff.

241
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,259
When I was young, I thought
I could steal from people all my life.

242
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,346
Let's put our heads on the floor
once a day and reflect on it.

243
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,098
On the floor now.

244
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,122
-Enjoy your meals.
-Okay.

245
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,957
-Hello, Director Kim.
-Hi.

246
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,169
Right. We have our script
for the fourth episode.

247
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,089
-I emailed it to you.
-Already?

248
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,259
Things are moving fast
with you on the team.

249
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,760
What about yours?

250
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,471
We just gave you episode six.

251
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,057
If this is about speed, we're faster.
They started first.

252
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,394
Well, Ms. Lim did submit
her scripts to the contest.

253
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,187
So you guys already had
two episodes ready.

254
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,064
And we have a lot of research
to do for our project.

255
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,567
Well, speed-wise, it's about the same.

256
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,946
So you're saying
we have nothing to research on?

257
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,197
Well, not really

258
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,366
compared to us.

259
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,827
By the way,

260
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,412
I don't see Da-mi.

261
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,167
Why are you talking to me about her?

262
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,085
I heard you and Da-mi
watched a movie together.

263
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,253
People are talking about it.

264
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,132
She had a free movie ticket.

265
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,342
You know, I never miss out on freebies.

266
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,429
I thought Da-mi liked you, Beom-su.

267
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:43,765
There are two types of women in the world.

268
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,934
Women who claim to like me,

269
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,477
and women who like me but can't say so.

270
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,771
It's nothing to worry about.

271
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,358
I feel bad for you
when you say things like that.

272
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,323
Oh, my.

273
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,825
I dropped an egg.

274
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,539
You came all the way here to drop that?

275
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,832
She used a spoon.

276
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,256
You're disgusting.

277
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,475
What?

278
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,992
Things Will Be Fine Once You Turn Thirty

279
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,960
YOU'RE REALLY NOT GOING TO EAT?
I DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE

280
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:10,519
Hey, guys.
You all read Jin-joo's script, right?

281
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,105
-I read it. You did, too, right?
-Yes.

282
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,161
-Coffee!
-Yes.

283
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,500
What's happening?
Words are just falling out of my hands!

284
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,836
This is amazing. I can't stop.
Words are just spilling out!

285
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,463
This has never happened to me before.
Why is this happening?

286
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,299
It's because this is trash.

287
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,142
Yes? What?

288
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,270
What?

289
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,730
My script?

290
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,941
What are you talking about?

291
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,901
Send me the script now.

292
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,489
We've been getting drinks
together a lot lately.

293
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,616
-It's not like before.
-How?

294
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,410
She keeps reacting to my jokes.

295
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,495
She didn't laugh at them. She didn't.

296
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,874
But she keeps acknowledging me

297
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,084
for my consistency

298
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,253
and that I'm persistent.

299
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,176
"Gosh, he's crying."

300
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,262
This is what I'm talking about.

301
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,557
How could you think about impersonating
Kim Heung-gook right now?

302
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,768
You're something else.

303
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,895
You're definitely stubborn.

304
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,355
Let's go for the third round. Okay?

305
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,107
It's on Hwan-dong.

306
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,152
Come on. I just paid for that round.

307
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,278
Really?

308
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,489
Then, we should go home.

309
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,408
I'm sleepy. I'm going home.

310
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,536
Da-mi, where do you live?

311
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,288
I live in Sadang.

312
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:57,667
Then, the National Assembly
must take good care of your neighborhood.

313
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,212
Why?

314
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,922
It belongs to the Assembly.

315
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,590
What?

316
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,301
Gukhoeeui "Sadang". National Assembly.

317
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,805
See?

318
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,891
I almost laughed at that one.

319
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:17,646
If I get used to this somehow,
I may laugh at your joke one day.

320
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,315
My stomach. Gosh, my stomach hurts.

321
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,653
She's interested in my potentials.

322
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,781
I don't think she meant
that you'll be funny one day.

323
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,616
You'll continue to be lame,

324
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,409
but there's a possibility
that she might change.

325
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,203
That's what she thought about.

326
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:37,082
I see. In a way,
she's respecting my consistency.

327
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:37,999
Right.

328
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,001
Good for you, consistent boy.

329
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,504
Sure. That's how
I ended up with this beautiful outcome.

330
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:43,588
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

331
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,549
-You're right.
-Yes.

332
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,634
Don't you have work to do?

333
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:48,760
What work?

334
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,804
What's the definition
of this "work" you speak of?

335
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,347
I'm working right now.

336
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,685
Read the script of Beom-su's drama.
Just read it.

337
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,936
What about you then?

338
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,771
I gave you my script. Read it

339
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,398
if you want to join my drama in any way.

340
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,607
I read it already.

341
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,823
Do you want to go see a temple together?

342
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,077
-Temple? Not stars?
-Yes.

343
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,788
A temple.

344
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,904
Don't you get jealous of the birds
when you see them fly?

345
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,573
Birds

346
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,950
poop and pee at the same time.

347
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,786
That's why bird poop is white.

348
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,790
Are you jealous of them
not because they can fly freely

349
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,585
but because they can poop and pee
at the same time?

350
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,670
It's a busy world.

351
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,632
I want to find small things
to feel special about.

352
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,676
But that's a dirty thing you found.

353
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,631
Did something happen?

354
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,344
The older I get, the harder it becomes
to communicate with people.

355
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,141
Your job is to meet people.
Do you expect that to be easy?

356
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,018
There's bound to be a problem

357
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,646
when people meet
regardless of how big or small it is.

358
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,314
That's only natural.

359
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,817
At our age, there's a problem
even when you're alone.

360
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,820
When I was young,

361
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,074
I thought that
everyone had a personality disorder.

362
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,536
But if that was the case with everyone,
it means that it's not a disorder.

363
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,997
It just means everyone is different.

364
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,501
If problems arise
because of people's differences,

365
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:30,255
it means that I am responsible
for one half of the problem.

366
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,925
I try not to do that,
but before I realize it,

367
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,011
I was imposing my ideas on people.

368
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:40,056
If you can behave based
on your realizations, you'd be Buddha.

369
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:43,893
I alter and distort what people say
however I please,

370
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:47,188
everything's either imposing or coercing.

371
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,317
You see, the higher I climb the ladder,

372
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,527
coercion keeps winning.

373
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,031
But I know that's not really winning.

374
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:00,702
I try to keep my mouth shut
not to pressure people,

375
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,746
but I end up revealing my idea

376
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,707
through my facial expressions or my vibe.

377
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,046
I'm becoming very uncool as I get older.

378
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,548
You don't need to worry
about becoming uncool.

379
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,344
You weren't cool
when you were young, either.

380
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,390
Whoop-de-doo.
One less problem to worry about.

381
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,894
Is that your problem of the day?

382
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,773
Ms. Jung, it's about your scripts.

383
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,524
What?

384
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:36,696
I found a few episodes
similar to Ms. Lim's episode.

385
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,075
Even the nuance of the lines

386
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:43,161
was similar, you know.

387
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,085
Are you saying she plagiarized mine?

388
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,921
Ms. Lim plagiarized yours? No way.

389
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,637
Hey!

390
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,060
Please keep silent.

391
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,080
So you're saying I plagiarized
one of my pupils' work?

392
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,749
That I'm becoming pathetic as I get older?

393
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,918
Let's be honest.

394
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:34,963
We're in great spots
to be the villain, you know.

395
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,885
Did you bring me here
so I can't yell at you?

396
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,555
That's one reason.

397
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,811
Don't call me.

398
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,896
Don't you dare call my name.

399
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,485
Let's hang around here a bit more.

400
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,989
Don't call me.
Don't you dare call my name!

401
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,576
Things Will Be Fine Once You Turn Thirty

402
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,393
Mr. Son.

403
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,980
Yes?

404
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,568
What is it?

405
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,118
Ms. Lim!

406
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,872
Ms. Lim!

407
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,921
Damn it.

408
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,568
I'm just caught in the trap

409
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,153
that I set up myself.

410
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,781
I'm caught in a trap

411
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:28,117
that I've worked on
so passionately for seven years.

412
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,245
But I'm sure you were happy at that time.

413
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,496
If you call it a trap,

414
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,082
you're downplaying your memories.

415
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:38,002
How could he sell our memories
to other people?

416
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:41,631
Come on, directors are like creators.
I'm offended as a director.

417
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,466
Reflecting one's memories

418
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,802
into one's work
can't count as selling them.

419
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,305
How could he use our memories together
in his drama without asking?

420
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,515
Didn't you do the same?

421
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,363
All right. Here's how we'll look at this.

422
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,614
Right now,

423
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,700
we're in the middle of cooking.

424
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:13,037
Look at that. It's steaming.
It's getting fine dust everywhere.

425
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,707
What choice do we have?
We should just buy food, then.

426
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,835
Otherwise, we don't have a choice.

427
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,967
I'll add soy sauce.

428
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,179
One, two...

429
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,765
Goodness.

430
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,227
I wanted to add four spoons of soy sauce,
but I spilled a bit more.

431
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,147
What should I do? What do you think?

432
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,316
It'll just be salty.

433
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,612
Actually, as it so happens,
I don't have the broth or minced garlic.

434
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,114
What should I do?
The soup won't taste rich.

435
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,784
What do you think? I need to fix it.

436
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,953
I should add the liquid seasoning.

437
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,873
One spoonful of that.

438
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,126
Great. It's almost ready.

439
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,088
You might think it's a bit salty,
but we're far from completing the dish.

440
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,134
You can't complain because the process
to make a beautiful outcome is rough.

441
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,804
If you're going to make noodles,

442
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,224
the soup has to be salty.

443
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,980
Ta-da.

444
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,691
Our beautiful outcome.

445
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,711
People have to consume seaweed.

446
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,296
How is it?

447
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,175
It's not that good.

448
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,971
It can't be beautiful all the time.

449
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,639
Let's have coffee outside.

450
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,065
Wait, that episode

451
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,109
contains the universal sentiment of...

452
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,988
Of course, adding a universal sentiment
is important, but I want to add something

453
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,198
more original and new.

454
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,830
HOW FAR TEENAGERS HAVE GONE
FOR THEIR CRUSHES

455
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,671
So this is what happened. Mr. Son
and Ms. Jung couldn't work together,

456
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,506
so he scouted Jin-joo
who was Ms. Jung's assistant,

457
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,718
and Ms. Jung scouted Mr. Kim
who used to be Mr. Son's assistant.

458
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,637
But it turns out that Mr. Kim
and Jin-joo used to be in a relationship.

459
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:37,348
Isn't this a love rectangle?
This is a killer story.

460
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,101
I can't even write this for a drama
even if someone asked me to.

461
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:51,779
I wouldn't write it.

462
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,532
Why not?

463
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,035
Not there.

464
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,747
-That's the group chatroom for assistants.
-What?

465
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,666
-That's not our group chatroom.
-What are you talking about?

466
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,668
ASSISTANT WRITERS IN KOREA

467
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,299
-See? I knew it.
-What a story.

468
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,468
I heard Mr. Son likes Jin-joo.

469
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,678
Jin-joo got kicked out
and seduced Mr. Son.

470
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,181
-That's a skill.
-Mr. Kim left because he was pissed.

471
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,475
Of course, he'd be pissed.
His ex was working with his boss.

472
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,851
How could he stay in his team?

473
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,270
Mi-yeong, didn't Mr. Kim ask
Ms. Jung to work with him first?

474
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,772
-It's so messed up.
-The Boss' Seduction.

475
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,483
Mr. Son and Ms. Lim are dating, right?

476
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:30,026
Yes. I'm telling you!

477
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,453
I'm sure they'll fix their scripts.

478
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:45,291
We can fix it or keep it.
It's all up to you.

479
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,965
Let's talk about something else.
How about casting?

480
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:54,801
You have the most fun
when we talk about the cast.

481
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,843
Although it is

482
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,054
the least fun if we can't actually do it.

483
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,060
Why are you suddenly so nice?

484
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,687
You weren't nice before.

485
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,822
I'm kind of drawn to bad guys.

486
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,300
What is this?

487
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,057
That's acting like a thug. Pick it up.

488
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,684
Okay.

489
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,778
KIM HWAN-DONG

490
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,080
OVERWRITE, SAVE

491
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,919
All right.

492
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,011
I want to work for a long time.
You should stretch, too.

493
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,987
Everyone, stretch.

494
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,578
MAJOR CLIENTS OF HONEY FOOD

495
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,917
MUSICAL
COMPLIMENTARY TICKET

496
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,183
-Ms. Hwang.
-Yes?

497
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:10,603
I have a favor to ask you.

498
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,980
Okay. Tell me.

499
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,610
Well, do you want--

500
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,780
MOTHER-IN-LAW

501
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:23,282
I'm sorry. Give me a moment.

502
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,867
Okay.

503
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,666
Yes, Mother. Have you been well?

504
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,211
Do you think I could be well
when I can't see my grandson?

505
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,004
I'm sorry.

506
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:41,092
You never say you'll come and visit
even as an empty formality.

507
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,094
I'm sorry.

508
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,887
I don't want your apology.

509
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,974
Let's have dinner with In-guk tomorrow.
Empty your schedule.

510
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,475
Is there a problem?

511
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,228
Not being able
to see my grandson is my problem.

512
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:53,854
See you tomorrow.

513
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,190
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

514
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,116
Sorry. What were you saying? A favor?

515
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,538
Well,

516
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,749
tomorrow...

517
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,045
Be healthy.

518
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,353
I'm sorry.

519
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,400
-No.
-What?

520
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,110
I don't want your apology.

521
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,404
Then, I have to apologize, too.

522
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,157
Is that so?

523
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,827
Let's just say that we both don't have to
apologize to each other.

524
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,121
We just borrowed

525
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,248
a few words from our diary.

526
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,001
We can do that because

527
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,378
we don't mean anything to each other now.

528
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,091
Then,

529
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,302
thank you.

530
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,970
No. I don't want to thank you, either.

531
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,723
I'll be the only thankful one.

532
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,684
It sounds like you want me
to be the bitch here.

533
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,606
I can't ever win an argument against you.

534
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,568
You can't win anything against me.

535
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,867
I said it to upset you. Don't smile.

536
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,537
All right.

537
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,539
Let's call it even.

538
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,249
Are we done now?

539
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,092
Don't fix it. Just keep it as it is.

540
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,719
Your script was really fun to read.

541
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,138
You're sharp-tongued.

542
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,724
But you are warmhearted.

543
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,394
I could still see that in your writing.

544
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,481
Thank you for your kind words.

545
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:09,907
How odd.

546
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,369
I kept telling myself

547
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:17,415
not to feed my greed and not to want more.

548
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,376
We broke up because I couldn't do that.

549
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,754
Now that I'm having drinks with you here,

550
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,257
I'm beginning to want something.

551
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,883
For example,

552
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,470
I hope one day,
I could direct a drama you...

553
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,765
It seems

554
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,684
there was a tail on me.

555
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:56,036
First, you steal my staff and actors.
Now, you're trying to steal my writer?

556
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,998
Well, let me explain.

557
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,418
I was going to switch to another director.
He got me red-handed.

558
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,753
I won't lose you. I'm going to guard you.

559
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,297
Why are you so clingy?

560
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,885
Goodness, look at you smiling.

561
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,386
I hate that. Seriously.

562
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,846
Goodness.

563
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,684
-You'll follow me to the restroom, too?
-I won't lose you.

564
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,644
-I'll guard you.
-I'll call the cops.

565
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,355
Did you hide another director
in the restroom?

566
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,274
Damn it. You caught me again.

567
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,028
I'll just take care of my business.
Sit down.

568
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,112
I trust you.

569
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,577
Right.

570
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,997
I'm sorry. I was just
trying to do my best.

571
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,540
I should've talked to you first.

572
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,585
Come on, man. I was just joking.
Don't take it literally.

573
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,796
Getting the right staff
for your first drama is important.

574
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,131
I'm sure you know.

575
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,718
Good job. I'm sure you'll do a great job.

576
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,345
Thank you.

577
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,180
I have other staff to work with.

578
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,307
Luckily, I managed to
secure my writer today.

579
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,437
You guys seem to have a lot of fun
working together.

580
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:04,855
Yes.

581
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,358
It's fun.

582
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,542
Did you decide to change the script?

583
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,168
I don't know. I'll follow her decision.

584
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,546
Well, I hope she decides to fix it.

585
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,885
Filming the memories of you and Ms. Lim

586
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,390
would make me feel jealous, won't it?

587
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,737
-Mr. Son.
-Yes?

588
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,200
-Are you done?
-Bye.

589
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,160
Bye.

590
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:17,303
Bye, bye, bye, goodbye

591
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:19,680
Bye, bye, bye, goodbye

592
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,765
Bye, constipation

593
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,232
Hey, So-min.

594
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,985
You're looking down on us, aren't you?

595
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,903
I'm sorry. I'll do it again.

596
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,739
Don't make us film this again!

597
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,742
I mean, that's your job!

598
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,952
You think you did okay, right?

599
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,122
The camera won't lie for you.
You sucked and it'll show.

600
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:46,665
I don't care how you feel.

601
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,001
And for fuck's sake,
life is hard for everyone in here.

602
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,128
But they still do their job, don't they?

603
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,256
You selfish bitch.

604
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,967
Do what you're supposed to do, too.

605
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,844
Okay.

606
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,805
Gosh. You son of a bitch.

607
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,974
How many times did I tell you?

608
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,226
Come over here.

609
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,728
The camera is turned off.

610
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,813
Stop getting in the way.

611
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,566
-Should I break that for you?
-It's turned off.

612
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,194
Is that so? Let me check. Bring it here.

613
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,780
Bring it here, you son of a bitch.

614
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,948
That's enough.

615
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,369
You're being noisy.

616
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,008
Are you guys making a triangle? You too?

617
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:40,594
Were you talking to me?

618
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,596
You're the only loud one here.

619
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:43,722
Yes.

620
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:46,892
You're right.

621
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,895
I see. Who are you? Are you a crazy bitch?

622
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:51,980
So you know. Why are you asking me that?

623
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:54,066
Yes, I'm a crazy bitch.
You son of a bitch.

624
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,150
"Son of a bitch"?

625
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:57,903
You called him a son of a bitch.

626
00:44:57,986 --> 00:45:00,114
I thought you are a son of a bitch too.
Are you different?

627
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,449
Is your mother a badder bitch than his?

628
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,285
What did we do, sneak into your set?

629
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,913
We got our permission
and are rightfully working here.

630
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,332
You are the one getting in our way!

631
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,168
How dare you curse at him?
He's someone's beloved son!

632
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,380
How dare you call his mother a bitch?

633
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,133
She's a human being.
A cherished human being.

634
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,218
Who the fuck are you to bully him?

635
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:26,807
-You fucking--
-Fucking what? What?

636
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,518
-Ass--
-Asshole what?

637
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,111
What?

638
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,073
You won.

639
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,290
Get ready!

640
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:55,669
-Let's get started.
-Get ready now.

641
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,635
But it turns out that Mr. Kim
and Jin-joo used to be in a relationship.

642
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:06,180
Isn't this a love rectangle?
This is a killer story.

643
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,017
This is

644
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,103
what I wrote in the group chatroom.

645
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,230
As it was a chatroom
for assistant writers,

646
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,316
dramas in many genres will be created.

647
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,442
For romance,

648
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:21,069
you'll be carrying Mr. Son's child...

649
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,697
Is that for romance?

650
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,073
For comedy,

651
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,994
you'll be a gold-digging writer
who seduces Mr. Son to help your career.

652
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,246
Is that for comedy?

653
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,457
Jin-joo, what should I do?

654
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,250
Why are you saying that line?

655
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,294
You're going to curse at me

656
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:38,879
and slap my face.

657
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,715
I'm really not sure if I can handle it.

658
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:50,724
Jin-joo, that's scarier.

659
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,267
Just hit me with a stick.

660
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,228
The bullets are being fired at me.

661
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:01,276
What can I do to these flying bullets?

662
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,195
I should just get down.

663
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,199
Let's go.

664
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,867
If she gets through that alive,

665
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,661
she'll have me killed.

666
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:56,081
I'll stop them.

667
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,178
You should write lying on your stomach.

668
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:12,514
You should still work.

669
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,476
You're

670
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,896
cruel in a warmhearted way.

671
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:52,888
Isn't he

672
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,057
a bit slow on his growth?

673
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,933
It's above average.

674
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,602
A boy can't be just above average.

675
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:04,107
He's not eating on his own.
His habit is wrong.

676
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,068
It's because he usually eats well.

677
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:12,074
Don't hide from us
if you're having problems.

678
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,494
It's not like
his dad doesn't love his son.

679
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,038
Can't you tell by the money
he sends you every month?

680
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:23,085
We're still young. We're more
than capable of bringing him up.

681
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:25,420
Please don't say that, Mother.

682
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:29,299
Why not? Why can't I say this?

683
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,010
He'll still be my grandson
even if he takes your last name.

684
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,805
If a dad gives up his parental rights,
is he no longer the son's dad?

685
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,725
He's my grandson.
Of course, I can say these things.

686
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,482
Whenever I say things out of worry,
you always look so upset.

687
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,442
No wonder...

688
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:57,369
My son asked you to get back together,
but you said no to that.

689
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,040
Is that what he told you?

690
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,626
You shouldn't think about anything else.

691
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,295
For your child's sake,
you should be grateful and say yes.

692
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,426
When he doesn't have a girlfriend

693
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,053
and comes to see In-guk,

694
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,305
he says something like that as a joke.

695
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,933
I didn't want to fight, so I told him
there should be other steps

696
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:20,934
before he asked that.

697
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:24,688
Goodness. You're making stuff up again.

698
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,108
-Mother.
-Let's just eat.

699
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,197
No wonder. If you're this disagreeable...

700
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,625
Thank you for causing a scene.

701
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,795
I don't usually just let him
talk to me that way.

702
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,590
But he often casts me.

703
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,384
Really? You should have told me.

704
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:56,970
I would've tried to hold it
in one more time.

705
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:57,929
It's all right.

706
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,182
He's a jerk only when he works.

707
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,351
People call him Janus
because he's two-faced.

708
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,437
He always yells, "Hey."

709
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,397
People also call him Director Hey.

710
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:09,274
But as for today,

711
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,818
Director Hey had a point back there.

712
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,320
It was my fault.

713
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,363
That doesn't mean he can curse at you.

714
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,074
He can't do that.

715
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,703
Want to go freshen up?

716
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,581
-What?
-Without the camera.

717
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,345
Do you need a solution
from a third-person's point of view?

718
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,138
What?

719
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,642
You probably want to hear other
people's opinion even if it's useless.

720
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,104
And I'm that third person
who can think and speak whatever I want.

721
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,193
Go ahead. Tell me what you think
from your perspective.

722
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,530
Why do you try so hard
to complicate your life? Stop it.

723
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:59,366
Stop keeping your distance
from the person you love.

724
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:02,369
Forget about your positions
as the actor and the manager.

725
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,704
You can't pick and choose
who are considered better

726
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,665
and who are lacking in the world.

727
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,793
Actually, from my point of view,
Min-jun is more impressive than you.

728
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,672
He's cool, witty, and reliable.

729
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,508
Don't think about whether your love

730
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:18,009
will last a day or forever.

731
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,345
Even if your heart
is ready to last forever,

732
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,181
humans are mortal beings.

733
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,724
Stop wasting your time.

734
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:33,441
It felt great to hear that.

735
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,361
That's what a third person is for.

736
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,489
-I'm leaving.
-Okay.

737
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,621
Eun-jeong,
of all the things you said today,

738
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,249
my favorite one was
when you said Min-jun impressive.

739
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,251
-Go already.
-Okay.

740
00:52:57,173 --> 00:52:59,467
-Dong-gu, let's go.
-Okay.

741
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,116
So-min. So-min!

742
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:33,186
What? Are you going to rob my house?

743
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,119
Why the hell did you turn off your phone?

744
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:52,539
That's what you do
when you go off the grid.

745
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,292
Stay there. I have something to say.

746
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,924
-I know that you like me.
-That's a load of crap.

747
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,384
I know. I know everything.

748
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:07,095
I know!

749
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:13,685
I don't know if you're confident or not.
I don't care about that.

750
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,270
I'm about to lose my mind.

751
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,981
I miss you like crazy.

752
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,483
I'm dying to know what you're up to,
if you're fooling around,

753
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,860
or if you're thinking about me.

754
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:23,987
If you're not, I'm going to kill you.

755
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,947
All sorts of thoughts cross my mind.

756
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:28,199
But in the end,
I know I'm crazy about you.

757
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:31,745
I don't know if this feeling
will last a day or forever.

758
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,039
But who starts a relationship
knowing how long it will last?

759
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,505
Just say something,

760
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,966
and I'll take care of the rest.

761
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,219
Come here.

762
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:31,679
What was that?

763
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,848
Why did you stop in the middle?

764
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,725
I'm not wearing any makeup.

765
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,821
This is only for my eyes from now on.

766
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,116
Do I look pretty?

767
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,660
You're so damn pretty.

768
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,677
I'll walk you home.

769
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,137
No.

770
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:15,890
-Let me walk you home.
-It's okay.

771
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,685
-It was a hard day. Let me--
-I said no.

772
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,256
Do you want ice pops?

773
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,930
You don't have to worry
about those rumors.

774
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,099
They are not true.
They don't hold any power.

775
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,813
When those rumors come together,

776
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,316
they create a huge idiot.

777
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,694
And when that idiot tries to show off,
someone gets hurt.

778
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,154
In some cases, they die.

779
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,285
You had dinner with In-guk's grandmother.

780
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,287
Let him see her without you.

781
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,789
He's old enough.

782
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,002
They were eating out after a long while.

783
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,838
It's fun when they have someone to bully.

784
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,715
They call me
because they need to talk to me,

785
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,634
but they always say the same thing.

786
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,346
They'll do that until you agree.

787
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:21,391
You should say no now. You did enough.

788
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,769
But why did you buy ice pops
all of a sudden?

789
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:26,437
Nevertheless,

790
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,523
I got to taste a bit of happiness

791
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,733
at the end of my day
which I didn't expect.

792
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,244
Ma'am, please wake up.

793
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:45,957
It's still cold outside.

794
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,376
You should wake up.

795
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,844
It's dangerous for you
to sleep on the street like this.

796
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:05,935
Thank you.

797
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:23,745
Thank you.

798
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,377
Ma'am!

799
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,758
You need to pay for them.

800
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,429
Okay

801
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:45,224
-How much?
-It's 2,000 won.

802
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,687
It's sweet.

803
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,817
-It's sweet.
-It's sweet.

804
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:46,911
Mr. Son.

805
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,246
Yes?

806
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,332
Do you like

807
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,543
Jin-joo?

808
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,548
You didn't call her Ms. Lim.

809
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:01,342
"Jin-joo"?

810
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,136
Yes.

811
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:05,805
Jin-joo.

812
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,485
Yes.

813
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,991
She keeps making me laugh.

814
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,244
She keeps

815
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:31,497
making me want to be a nice guy.

816
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,003
Yes.

817
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:52,226
LET'S JUST SAY THAT WE BOTH DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER

818
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:53,978
WE JUST BORROWED A FEW WORDS
FROM OUR DIARY

819
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,397
WE CAN DO THAT BECAUSE

820
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,358
WE DON'T MEAN ANYTHING TO EACH OTHER NOW

821
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:02,737
WELL

822
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,449
FILMING THE MEMORIES OF YOU AND MS. LIM

823
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,452
WOULD MAKE ME JEALOUS, WON'T IT?

824
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:13,247
WHY DO YOU TRY SO HARD
TO COMPLICATE YOUR LIFE? STOP IT

825
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,459
YOU STAYING AWAY FROM THE PERSON YOU LOVE

826
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,379
FORGET ABOUT YOUR POSITIONS
AS THE ACTOR AND THE MANAGER

827
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,757
YOU CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE
WHO ARE CONSIDERED BETTER

828
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,218
AND WHO ARE CONSIDERED LACKING
IN THE WORLD

829
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,473
DON'T THINK ABOUT WHETHER YOUR LOVE

830
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:33,017
WILL LAST A DAY OR FOREVER

831
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:37,313
EVEN IF YOUR HEART
IS READY TO LAST FOREVER

832
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:42,485
HUMANS ARE MORTAL BEINGS

833
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,153
STOP WASTING YOUR TIME

834
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,491
Among us,

835
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:51,118
it's called persistent complex
bereavement disorder.

836
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,537
You're the only person I have.

837
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:54,831
I'm worried. And I feel bad.

838
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,166
The space they shared is gone.

839
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,252
And I don't know where I am anymore.

840
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:03,047
I don't feel good. Can you help me up?

841
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,799
I saved that woman.

842
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,176
Will Mr. Son and Ms. Lim get married?

843
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,719
That's why she's avoiding me?

844
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,889
It's not just a rumor.
You do like Ms. Lim.

845
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:13,850
Listen. Why are you hiding your feelings?

846
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,976
Shut your mouth now.

847
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,186
Aren't you more worried about Mr. Son
than yourself?

848
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,521
Do you like him?

849
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:19,981
Until when will you avoid me?

850
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,649
I'm shy around people by nature.

851
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,401
And there's something else
we need to deal with.

852
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,528
What is it? Selling the drama overseas?
The second season?

853
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:27,738
My feelings for you.

854
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,116
