MENTAL MASSAGE
CHOOSE AND ENTER

2
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,842
EFFECTS OF MENTAL MASSAGE
INCREASED SELF-ESTEEM

3
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,203
The green onion.

4
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,371
It's good.

5
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,132
Flop!

6
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:35,345
The bag just flopped out of nowhere.
Flop! Did you see that?

7
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,640
Oh, no. What do we do? This is bad.

8
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:48,942
Aren't you going home?

9
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,403
I'm trying to pull myself together
and read the script.

10
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,738
It's been hours.

11
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,990
I can do it for hours or for days
if I want to.

12
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:58,076
I have no one to drink with.

13
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,577
You've never had anyone to drink with.

14
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,331
-I guess the script is good.
-That's why I'm doing this.

15
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,499
I see.

16
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,585
Then why did you tell me
not to work on it when I asked?

17
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,087
Because you would ruin it.

18
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,966
-You said it wasn't good.
-It's not good when it's done by you.

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,968
I'm the only one
who can pull off this script.

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,761
When will you stop looking down on me?

21
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,972
I'll do it as long as you are alive
by my side.

22
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,474
You're my true friend.

23
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,143
That doesn't make me a true friend.

24
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,686
Forget it. Let's go and have some beer.

25
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,396
Forget it. You should go alone.

26
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,691
That's enough. Let's just go.

27
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,109
That's enough. Get out.

28
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:35,029
You punk. Let's just go. Hurry.

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,957
Why are you depressed again?

30
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,709
Don't even ask.

31
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,295
What is it? Is it because of So-yeong?

32
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,381
My gosh. It's just a boy-girl problem.

33
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,465
Don't ask.

34
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,135
My gosh.

35
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:07,520
In-guk, how did you tell her
your feelings?

36
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,230
So-yeong told me her feelings first.

37
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,107
Whatever. How did she do that?

38
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,692
I'm not telling you.

39
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,324
Is there anything you want to eat?

40
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,534
I want a corn dog. Have it delivered.

41
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,577
All right.

42
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,954
Hey. You picked at your food earlier.

43
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,873
But you want to eat a corn dog
when you're depressed?

44
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,374
I want it because I'm depressed.

45
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,377
He's right. You can eat it.
I'll buy it all.

46
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,254
-Okay?
-My gosh.

47
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,341
I guess it's here.

48
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,303
-Hyo-bong is here.
-What?

49
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,679
Your corn dog is here.

50
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,974
-My gosh.
-It's here.

51
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,019
It must be delicious.

52
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,316
-My gosh.
-It looks amazing.

53
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,610
-Let me see.
-This one?

54
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,445
-I want the thin one.
-The thin one?

55
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,781
-Goodness.
-Do you want some ketchup?

56
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,617
Here. Do you like it?

57
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,785
That's enough.

58
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,496
Here? Okay.

59
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:10,333
My gosh. It has a lot of cheese in it.

60
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,505
There you go.

61
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,757
All right. Tell me now.

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,592
We talked on an instant messenger.

63
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,970
An instant messenger?

64
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,054
Yes.

65
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,266
-Is that it?
-Then what?

66
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,811
So you ask someone out
on an instant messenger?

67
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,314
If you like it, you start dating.
And if you don't, it's just over?

68
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:34,857
Then what?

69
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,152
-Isn't there anything else?
-Like what?

70
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,241
All right. Eat up, schoolkid.

71
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,999
In-guk, I told you not to sigh like that.

72
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,418
Kids can sigh too.

73
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,836
Why would you say that?

74
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,462
I know.

75
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,895
You wanted to eat a corn dog with beer.
Why aren't you drinking?

76
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,274
I have an important meeting tomorrow.

77
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,152
I will go to persuade a rookie writer.

78
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,862
I should look good.

79
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,822
Why do you need to look good
to persuade a writer?

80
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,616
If I think that I look pretty good,

81
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,118
it makes me more confident.

82
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,335
You want to look good
while eating a corn dog.

83
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,379
I think you're confident enough.

84
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,801
You'll see tomorrow.

85
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,556
What? Tomorrow?

86
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,978
See you. I should get going.

87
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,855
-Why are you going that way?
-What?

88
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,232
-I'm working away from the office.
-What do you mean?

89
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,193
I work outside today.
I should go this way.

90
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,236
Then you should've just gone there.
Why did you come?

91
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,405
You said you were walking me
to school on your way to work.

92
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,158
Just stop nagging me and get in there.

93
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,160
Don't fight with So-yeong.

94
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,788
I never fought with her. She just hit me.

95
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,474
Why are you all dressed up like that?

96
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,353
You look better
when you're not dressed up.

97
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,069
You're staring at the wall.

98
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,695
Do you want to go out with me?

99
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,118
Are you saying that to the wall?

100
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,994
I really wanted to say this,

101
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,914
but I just couldn't do it
looking into your eyes.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,542
Why not?

103
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,672
This is crazy. What's wrong with me?

104
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,928
Was it the first time I saw you?

105
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,139
I guess it was around that time.

106
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,768
-What do you mean?
-That's when I fell for you.

107
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,651
Undoubtedly, my feelings...

108
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,281
What?

109
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,242
It's weird.

110
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,994
It's so lame.

111
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,209
What's so undoubted?

112
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,086
"Will you go on a date with me?"

113
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,629
"A date?"

114
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,883
"Date." It sounds somewhat old-fashioned.

115
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,303
Should he just give her a gift
all of a sudden?

116
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,615
I already have a watch.

117
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,659
It's Santa Claus who gives you
something you don't have.

118
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,287
Did you not feel that way as a kid?

119
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,747
How would Santa Clause know

120
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,125
what I really need right now every time?

121
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,376
I did.

122
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,712
What I wanted a doll,

123
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,298
but he would always give me new shoes

124
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,093
or new clothes which I actually needed
at the moment.

125
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,097
I thought to myself when I found out
my parents were actually Santa Claus.

126
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,432
A gift should be

127
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,269
something you don't actually need
but that makes you happy.

128
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,481
But today isn't a special day.

129
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,399
For me, it's the day
when I should give you a gift.

130
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:48,319
What day is it?

131
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:50,196
It's the day when I confess
my feelings for you.

132
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:54,158
For the rest of my life...

133
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,078
Gosh, just delete it.

134
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,080
Should I make him look cool?

135
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,010
Well...

136
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,097
This is my workplace.

137
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,185
Eat this first.

138
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,313
Why are you talking to me like that?

139
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,108
-Don't I look cool?
-You look like a fool.

140
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:31,279
That fool loves you. The fool...

141
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,076
Whatever, you fool.

142
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,300
-Why are you back?
-I'm working outside. I'll get some rest.

143
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,969
That doesn't sound like you.

144
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,389
My gosh.

145
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:06,105
Gosh, Ms. Lim.
I didn't know you were here.

146
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,901
It's so nice to see you.

147
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,487
I guess you were working.

148
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,407
Well... Yes.

149
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,328
Actually, I read your script.

150
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,371
-How?
-You submitted it to a contest,

151
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,124
so I got it from the broadcasting company.
I'm sorry.

152
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,835
It's okay. I wrote it for people to read.

153
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,879
Speaking of which,

154
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:35,009
I heard you're still looking
for a production company.

155
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,763
I hope I'm not interrupting your work.

156
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,349
Of course you are. I'm being interrupted.

157
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,933
I'll see you around then.

158
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,936
My goodness. It's my bad.

159
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,064
You look really worn out

160
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:52,109
as you're so busy with your work.

161
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,778
I shouldn't have bothered you.

162
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,781
Make sure to take this regularly.

163
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,033
Thank you. You can leave it there.

164
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,127
Gosh, I'm disappointed.

165
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,048
Hey, don't get disappointed
with something like this.

166
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,134
I know what you mean,
but let me be disappointed all I want.

167
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,053
Just stay lying down there
and get some rest.

168
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,938
I hope to see you again
on a formal occasion next time.

169
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,606
I'll pay you a visit.

170
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,818
Thank you. I'll see you later.

171
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,125
I'm hungry.

172
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,392
Hello, Ms. Lim.

173
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,352
I'm here to meet you.

174
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,938
Hello.

175
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,817
So this is how Hwang Han-ju ends up.

176
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,372
I should have light breakfasts
from now on.

177
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,042
Even when I have a heavy meal,
I become hungry anyway. Why is that?

178
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,504
Whether you work your brains or your body,

179
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:39,550
I heard the amount of labor that
contributes to your hunger is similar.

180
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,927
I appreciate your hard work.

181
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,348
Why?

182
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,058
How much can you offer?

183
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:51,020
Well... That's not what I can...

184
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,522
You know how much
rookie writers usually get, right?

185
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,523
Of course I do.

186
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,525
But your case is different.

187
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,486
We are well aware of that too.

188
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,906
You worked on the project proposal
and wrote four episodes all by yourself.

189
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,783
You even have a director to work on it.

190
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,412
We will consider the initial cost
for planning and development,

191
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,248
and it will be added to your pay.

192
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:14,668
You can trust our company on that.

193
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,504
Our CEO, Ms. Lee is
very precise about that part.

194
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,298
I don't need you to be precise.
I hope to get more than that.

195
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,307
Why should I get paid less
just because I'm a rookie writer?

196
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,644
It's not like people wouldn't watch
my drama just because I'm new.

197
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,562
I totally agree with you.

198
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,273
That's why you should sign
a contract with our company.

199
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,358
Why?

200
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,154
Me?

201
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,115
You just said that, didn't you?

202
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,451
Yes.

203
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,871
I'm just a salaried employee.

204
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,584
I guess writers should take turns

205
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,336
to become a producer.

206
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,548
I just don't understand
the revenue system.

207
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,468
A producer like me is
more quick and precise

208
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,719
in the field.

209
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,889
You might need emotions
when you finish your writing,

210
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,434
but we need rationality to visualize it
at the film site.

211
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,150
I can't believe this.

212
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,445
-I just sounded very articulate, right?
-Yes.

213
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,283
My gosh. I just can do it
when I'm cornered.

214
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,203
I should've recorded it.
Do you remember what I just said?

215
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,122
My goodness.

216
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,375
You are really cute.

217
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,503
I almost kissed you just now.

218
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,756
How would you feel
if a guy asked you out saying that?

219
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,509
"You are really cute.

220
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,928
I almost kissed you just now."

221
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,264
What?

222
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,349
I'm writing a scene
where a guy asks a girl out.

223
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,393
Yes, Ms. Lim.

224
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,439
It sounds really weird.

225
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,358
-The actor is Gang Dong-won.
-Then I'd ask him out first.

226
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,321
I don't think
I can have him play this part.

227
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,075
Jae-hun, what did you say
when you asked your girlfriend out?

228
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,955
I just used an instant messenger.

229
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,375
Gosh, should I make it
an instant messenger?

230
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,544
It's a drama. It sounds too lame.

231
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,050
It would sound new though.

232
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,802
Has anyone asked you out recently?

233
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,431
You know that better.
Who would ask me out?

234
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,641
That's right.

235
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,728
Oh, right. There was someone.

236
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,855
Was it two years ago?

237
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,192
Hey, it's not like he asked me out.

238
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,613
Thank you for the dinner tonight.

239
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,494
And thank you for walking me home.

240
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,581
I'll treat you next time.

241
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:58,791
Han-ju.

242
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,672
I have a daughter who's in middle school.

243
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,174
I have a family of two.

244
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,929
And I want it to become a family of four.

245
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,937
You want a family of four.

246
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,774
You can laugh. It's okay.

247
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,236
So what did you say?

248
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,446
I did what Jin-joo told me to do.

249
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:34,660
I gave him the number of a dog shelter
so he could adopt two dogs.

250
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,206
-Did he?
-He got only one dog.

251
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,670
So it became a family of three.
That's so funny.

252
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,882
Tell me about your story.
It's unfair that I only shared mine.

253
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,097
Actually, before I asked her out
using an instant messenger,

254
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,099
-I got caught.
-What?

255
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,934
All right.

256
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,602
-Jae-hun's favorite
-Jae-hun's favorite

257
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:01,937
-random game!
-random game!

258
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,440
-What game? What game?
-What game? What game?

259
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,277
Let's go this way.

260
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,945
-One to five.
-Five to seven.

261
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,948
-Seven to eleven.
-Eleven to nine.

262
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,705
-Drink it up. Bottoms up.
-Drink it up. Bottoms up.

263
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:22,458
-Here comes the drink.
-Here comes the drink.

264
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,544
-How long will you keep us dancing?
-How long will you keep us dancing?

265
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,506
-You have no time to...
-You have no time to...

266
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,428
You got caught. I can tell you like me.

267
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,105
Well... It's not like...

268
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,776
Text me if you're embarrassed. It's okay.

269
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,198
Text me in three hours.
I'm going to sleep.

270
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,867
I should get going. Bye.

271
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,100
Ha-yun. I love you...

272
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,685
I think I love...

273
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,859
Shall we start dating today...

274
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:41,453
I hope you will have a sweet dream...

275
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,508
Will you hurry?

276
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,977
Wait for me, okay? Gosh.

277
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,145
Darn it.

278
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,701
HA-YUN

279
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,330
Wait. Hang on...

280
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,793
Hello?

281
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,378
Ha-yun!

282
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,629
What?

283
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,511
What are you doing?

284
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,597
Well... I'm lying down.

285
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,891
Gosh. Good for you.

286
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:46,226
-Okay. Good night.
-Wait. It's...

287
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,604
I like you!

288
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,481
Ha-yun, I like you.
Ha-yun, do you hear me?

289
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:53,692
I really like you, Ha-yun.

290
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,194
Ha-yun?

291
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,698
I like you! Ha-yun!

292
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,784
I do like you.

293
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,706
That's so cute.

294
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,377
By the way, people in the industry
will soon find out

295
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,087
that Ms. Lim's script is good.

296
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,840
She might get better offers
from major production companies.

297
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,550
Do you think she will sign
a contract with us?

298
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:22,095
She wouldn't break her friend's heart
and sign with someone else--

299
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,015
Who knows? She's very precise.

300
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,184
I guess you're right.

301
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,396
Actually you should be precise
when it comes to work.

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,315
No. It's not about work.

303
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,775
She's very precise when it comes

304
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,860
to breaking her friend's heart
and then mending it.

305
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,906
This time, I will never let it happen.

306
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,659
I won't let you go, Lim Jin-joo.

307
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,830
That's so cute.

308
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,506
The male and female protagonists
of a drama

309
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,716
are about to start a relationship.

310
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,804
One asks the other out.

311
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,013
Asking someone out.

312
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,268
Now that I did something,
it's your turn to make a move.

313
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:19,486
I like you.

314
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,446
Asking someone out.

315
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,325
Even when someone cold
suddenly becomes so warm,

316
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,203
or someone sweet
suddenly becomes so bland,

317
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,664
nothing's strange
if it's followed by a confession.

318
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,918
That's right.
Whatever happens, it's not strange.

319
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,005
It doesn't matter even if it's a fantasy.
Just write it.

320
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,715
Just confess one's feelings.

321
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:56,398
Whether it's fantasy or reality,
asking someone out is so hard.

322
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,109
What's the big deal? Damn it.

323
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
Let's eat.

324
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,916
I'm hungry.

325
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,086
Are you shooting a show today?

326
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,214
No. A-rang will be in the show.

327
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,801
That was the first condition
for me to work on this documentary.

328
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,053
I see.

329
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,307
Anyway, let's do this right today.

330
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,100
Okay. Let's make it look pretty.

331
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,562
Pretty? That's
what you do for your girlfriend.

332
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,147
My mistake.

333
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,400
I'll make sure not to miss good points.

334
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,861
-And be honest.
-Okay. Let's keep it honest.

335
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,280
What is So-min going to do?

336
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,740
What?

337
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:48,408
It's just hard.

338
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,869
No, it's okay.

339
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,789
You've been in this field for quite long.

340
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:56,374
You can't deal with So-min.

341
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,585
You're the boss. How can you say that?

342
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,378
Just go to Haenaem ENT.

343
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,965
We shot this by mistake
without their consent, right?

344
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:05,884
Yes.

345
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,720
-Go and delete it.
-What?

346
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,473
It was shot without their consent.
We're not supposed to watch it.

347
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,933
Be honest.

348
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,935
Okay.

349
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,356
You know what I mean.

350
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,608
This is what I think you should do.

351
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:24,194
In this situation...

352
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,905
What are you doing?
I told you to delete it.

353
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:32,327
COLD BEVERAGE

354
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,840
I know it's just a vending machine.

355
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,925
But 1,200 won for a bottle of water?

356
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,553
You know the bakery around here

357
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,179
increased the prices of their products?

358
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,766
A sandwich that used to cost 5,000 won
came clean with me today.

359
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:57,602
"Actually I'm worth 6,000 won."

360
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,149
I don't have
enough production cost for this.

361
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,650
This is quite nice.

362
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:05,777
What?

363
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,488
When we first met,
you were working on your project.

364
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,532
This reminds me of the time.

365
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,493
I know.

366
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:19,291
But I feel like I'm not as strong
as I was back then

367
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,960
when it comes to the shortage of money.

368
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,879
You mean your physical strength?

369
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,213
Yes.

370
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:26,590
You took a long break,

371
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,425
so it's taking you a long time
to get warmed up.

372
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,342
Don't worry.

373
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,307
Actually I invested the money
I made from the previous project

374
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,350
in the project I'm working on now.

375
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,020
I must say it's a reasonable investment.

376
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,355
But the amount of money is so small.

377
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,568
Do you think I gave
too much money to the charity?

378
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,403
What?

379
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,823
-What is that? Are you regretting it?
-What?

380
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,076
No.

381
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:00,207
Gosh, it's not like that.

382
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,295
-Hello.
-Hi, So-min. Did you have a good rest?

383
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,005
-Yes.
-Good.

384
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,425
"Have a good rest?"

385
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,220
Was he making fun of me
because I'm not busy enough?

386
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,805
Gosh, it was nothing like that.

387
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,057
Really?

388
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:18,808
Does he like me then?

389
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,560
My goodness.

390
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,562
I'm sure he doesn't.

391
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,147
Are you serious?

392
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,399
I swear it was nothing like that.

393
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,277
-Really?
-Yes.

394
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,113
You can't be too sure about things.

395
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,157
But this is so obvious.

396
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,374
I know it can't be helped.

397
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,000
But what about the money?

398
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,794
Why is she talking to herself?

399
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,921
I've seen her
talking to herself a few times.

400
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,464
Why would she do that?

401
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:51,633
Is she talking on the phone?

402
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,636
Do you have any good ideas?

403
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,890
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

404
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,230
An RC car? I didn't know
you had a hobby like that.

405
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,439
It's fun.

406
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,567
I can connect it to a wagon
and give my kids a ride.

407
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,154
Things Will Be Fine Once You Turn Thirty?

408
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,906
Isn't the title a little weird?

409
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,658
I picked it because I liked the title.

410
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,953
"Things will get better
once you grow older."

411
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,454
It's somewhat depressing.

412
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,456
I think it's encouraging and comforting.

413
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,875
Fine. Whatever.

414
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,545
Young people seem to like it.

415
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,922
I guess it will be
an unprecedented project.

416
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,591
It will be aired
because of the regular employees,

417
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,968
not the executives.

418
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,636
It's about time to reform things.

419
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,056
You know what?

420
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,977
I had a drink with Hwan-dong and Dong-gi
a few days ago.

421
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,603
I see.

422
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:47,897
I'm not jealous.

423
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,692
And Ms. Jung Hye-jeong was there.

424
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:52,444
I'm sorry to hear that.

425
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,487
And Ms. Jung asked Hwan-dong

426
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,614
to direct her drama there.

427
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,244
Oh, right. He used to work on her dramas.

428
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,497
And Hwan-dong rejected it right away.

429
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,749
He did.

430
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,001
I taught him well.
That's what he should do.

431
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,129
He just thought Ms. Jung was joking.

432
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,131
If it was a joke, that's just mean.

433
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,384
I'm not sure
if she's trying not to be mean.

434
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,428
But the next day,

435
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,556
he got an official offer
from the production company.

436
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:25,393
I knew it. She's so good
at ruining people's relationships.

437
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,811
And...

438
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,315
do you know what Hwan-dong said

439
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,317
to the official offer?

440
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:37,364
Since he didn't consult me,
I bet he rejected it.

441
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,990
Right.

442
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,250
Mr. Son. Did you eat?

443
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,336
Hey, Hwan-dong. Let's eat.

444
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,671
The weather is... Gosh, what's that?

445
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,299
Nothing. I'm just dumbfounded.

446
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,968
Did you review Ms. Jung's script?

447
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,932
How dare you review it?
You should've said yes right away.

448
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,351
I will just make this short.

449
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,728
You haven't given
the company your feedback yet.

450
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,688
Just read the script first.

451
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,981
Just do it if you like it by half.

452
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,442
I mean, just do it
even if you don't like it.

453
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,945
-Even if I don't like it?
-Hey.

454
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,572
Making a debut with something you like?

455
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,659
It's not going to happen
unless you write your own script.

456
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,203
Making a debut with the script
of a writer who guarantees good ratings?

457
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,789
It never happens
unless the writer is crazy.

458
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,165
And the writer is crazy.

459
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,000
Something impossible is happening.

460
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,460
Just take the offer and do it.

461
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:34,254
And show them what you can do.

462
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,507
Then you'll be offered more choices.

463
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,009
That's how you start things, okay?

464
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,761
But my duty as an assistant director--

465
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:45,181
You're not here as my assistant,
but as a director of JBC.

466
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,976
You can't blow your own chances like that.

467
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,769
That's just a dereliction of duty.

468
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,442
Please stop being so naive, okay?

469
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,278
You will only end up becoming a pushover.

470
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,823
I'll review it.

471
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,701
No, just accept it.

472
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,245
Eat alone, you brat.

473
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,331
Hello, Ms. Lim.

474
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,959
I like you, Mr. Son.

475
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,380
I said I like you.

476
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,424
You must be depressed.

477
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:24,429
Yes. I've been staying still,

478
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:28,266
but now I want to move a little.

479
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,478
-Get up then.
-No, I should stay still.

480
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,688
I want the sofa to move.

481
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,026
Do you want a flying carpet or something?

482
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,444
Exactly.

483
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,197
You're so smart.

484
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,534
I can't get you a carpet.

485
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:09,766
Asking someone out?

486
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:11,851
You have to do it.

487
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,771
I like something simple.

488
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,356
A simple confession?

489
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,235
My mom is quite simple.

490
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,070
She asked my dad out first.

491
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,030
Back in those days?

492
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:27,617
She thought he was cool
to run his own business at a young age.

493
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,410
-His own business?
-The laundry.

494
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,246
That's not common.

495
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,623
A young owner of the laundry.

496
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:55,228
Mom was the daughter of the Chinese
restaurant across the street.

497
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,031
I didn't order tangsuyuk.

498
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,743
My daughter says she likes you.

499
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,890
She asked her dad to say it.

500
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,643
It's not simple. It's rather unique.

501
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,232
-Just cut it.
-Okay.

502
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,029
Eat some more.

503
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,947
Just eat it.

504
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,164
-It's good, isn't it?
-Yes.

505
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,875
-Here.
-Put it here.

506
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,545
What's the big deal
about a confession scene?

507
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:04,130
It's not like you're doing it.

508
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,966
I'm doing it. I'm writing the scene.

509
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:10,511
You should use your skills as a writer.

510
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:15,850
I wish it was
about some wrestling technique.

511
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,519
That way I can be trained.
It would've been easier.

512
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,647
This is either one of the two cases.

513
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,231
What?

514
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,317
First, you're so into the drama

515
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,861
that you believe you're
the protagonist of the story.

516
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,029
You mean I'm crazy.

517
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:30,698
Second, this is about the fairness
of the story.

518
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,785
It means the story
has a probability issue.

519
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,870
You might not be able
to find it out right away,

520
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,998
but you just can't accept
this situation as the writer.

521
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,420
You're the type of person
who gives women a hard time.

522
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,505
All of a sudden?

523
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,590
When a woman struggles with a problem,

524
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,386
you don't have to analyze everything
to suggest a solution.

525
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,846
That doesn't apply only to couples.

526
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,724
Then why wouldn't women put themselves
in others' shoes to be cautious?

527
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,103
Look at you. You're hopeless.

528
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,565
Don't date anyone
until the last day of your life.

529
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,109
Okay. Thank you.

530
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:18,746
Will you go a little faster or slower?

531
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,182
Thank you.

532
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,902
What?

533
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,407
-Today is the confession day.
-So?

534
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:57,410
Confession day? Isn't it in September?

535
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,328
If you start dating that day,

536
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,414
Christmas will mark
your 100th day anniversary.

537
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,375
If we start dating today,
my birthday will mark

538
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,752
our 100th day anniversary.

539
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,383
I think this cafeteria offers

540
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,469
the best nutritionally balanced menu.

541
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,304
And it's all thanks to you.

542
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,431
To repay you,

543
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:22,101
I'll give you a chance
to confess your feelings for me.

544
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,395
All right. Go ahead.

545
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,609
Well... Mr. Seo.

546
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:32,862
I really hate you.

547
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,532
Okay.

548
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,912
So it's a confession.

549
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,039
Gosh, I hate you so much.

550
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,334
-I like you though.
-Okay.

551
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,044
Gosh, that's amazing.

552
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,214
So your ex-girlfriend is the writer.

553
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:54,550
And the director whom I assumed
to have feelings for her is Mr. Son.

554
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,803
And you are his assistant.

555
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,888
And the writer whom your ex-girlfriend
used to work for

556
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,640
asked you to direct her drama.

557
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:03,101
And Mr. Son who cares about you

558
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:05,186
told you to accept the offer.

559
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,779
So which part is it that surprised you?

560
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,532
First of all, the fact
that the writer is your ex-girlfriend.

561
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,743
I just want to watch it from up close.

562
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:27,291
I understand that Mr. Son wants me to go.

563
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,628
And Mr. Son seems
to have feelings for Ms. Lim?

564
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,839
"Gosh, no way.

565
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,008
That's impossible."
That's what you thought.

566
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,636
"But what if it's true?

567
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:42,932
He might feel bothered by me.

568
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:45,977
Now that he has a good excuse,

569
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,604
he's just sending me like that?"

570
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,606
Is that what you're thinking?

571
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:55,278
I know Mr. Son isn't that kind of person.

572
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,406
But I can't stop
having those pathetic thoughts.

573
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,244
Why do I even care?

574
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,662
It's okay.

575
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,165
If you ever loved someone,

576
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,459
you will be bothered by the person
for the rest of your life.

577
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,462
-Is that true?
-Sure.

578
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,257
You just don't like it
whether she becomes happy or unhappy.

579
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,219
And you really hate it if she becomes
happy with someone you know.

580
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,431
All right then.

581
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,021
Gosh, I'm really bothered.

582
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,447
Will you try to confess your feelings?

583
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,992
Me? To you?

584
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,912
Yes. As the male protagonist.

585
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,461
You're impressive.

586
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,965
-Is that a confession?
-Yes.

587
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,593
-Is it?
-Sure.

588
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,306
It just sounds like a lukewarm commentary.

589
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,726
What matters is my feelings,
not the words I say.

590
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,666
You're impressive.

591
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,589
Something like that. What do you think?

592
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,759
Isn't it simple and nice?

593
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,596
I like it. It's good.

594
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,681
I knew it.

595
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,733
Can I kiss you?

596
00:37:58,317 --> 00:37:59,318
What?

597
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,076
Just a kiss.

598
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,000
Something like this. What do you think?

599
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,877
Oh, something like that?

600
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,340
That's what it is.

601
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,802
My gosh.

602
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:05,176
-Something like this.
-Something like this.

603
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:12,350
Gently.

604
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:17,063
What?

605
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:21,108
It's not sudden.
It's just slow and gentle.

606
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,528
Gently?

607
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,449
Sometimes you fall in love suddenly
and sometimes gently.

608
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,617
You've been there.

609
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,704
Well... For me,

610
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,374
it wasn't so sudden or too slow.

611
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,000
-Then what?
-It's just...

612
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,295
Stealthily sudden?

613
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,965
Fine. It's stealthily sudden and slow.

614
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:51,347
Anyway, I guess they're
falling in love slowly and gently.

615
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,225
Gosh. By the way,

616
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,770
why do we always talk about them?

617
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,237
Let's start over then.

618
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,697
We introduce each other, eat together,

619
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,241
go to a movie, and stuff like that.

620
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,828
It's a little awkward
that we start with a confession.

621
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,538
A date?

622
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,249
Okay. Let's begin.

623
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,294
What do you do for a living?

624
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,005
I'm a writer. What about you?

625
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,006
I'm a director.

626
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,634
You're a writer,
so you must not have a boyfriend.

627
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,678
-Why?
-Because you're sensitive.

628
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,098
You're a director,
so you must not have a girlfriend.

629
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,891
-Why?
-Because you're condescending.

630
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,650
All right then. Now we should go and eat.

631
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,903
What do you like, Jin-joo?

632
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,408
I want to eat your favorite food.

633
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,034
What do you like?

634
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,292
JINI PYONGYANG NAENGMYEON

635
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,922
-We will have two naengmyeon.
-Okay.

636
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,179
I guess you like naengmyeon.

637
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,763
I like all kinds of noodles.

638
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,682
-Do you not like noodles?
-I do.

639
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,768
I like ramyeon, jjajangmyeon,
and everything.

640
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,562
But I've never had
Pyongyang naengmyeon before.

641
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,814
I like ramyeon and jjajangmyeon too.

642
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,067
But I can't live in Japan or China
for a long time.

643
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,278
Because they don't have
Pyongyang naengmyeon there.

644
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,245
So you've never tried it before?
You've wasted 30 years.

645
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,997
You should try
to eat it often from now on.

646
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,973
I think something's wrong.

647
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:18,827
Did you pay?

648
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,454
I did.

649
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:22,998
So you do pay money for this?

650
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,667
I mean, it tasted of nothing.

651
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,835
Now that you ate it today,

652
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:28,462
we should wait and see how it goes.

653
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,006
It's not like we had herbal medicine.

654
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,508
What do you want to see?

655
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,343
This is what this dish is about.

656
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:35,886
You might think, "What is this?"

657
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,513
But you will suddenly crave it
the next day.

658
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,723
Then you just can't get away from it.

659
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,102
You might feel that way tonight
before going to sleep.

660
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,603
"What is this?

661
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,814
I want to eat Pyongyang naengmyeon."

662
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,607
You'd be like that.

663
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:03,539
I'm not trying to be fussy.
I'm just curious.

664
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,749
Why do you eat a cake after having a meal?

665
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,170
Because I had a meal.

666
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:13,257
I mean, you just had a meal.

667
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,842
I can't eat it before having a meal.

668
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,176
I mean, why would you eat food

669
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,553
after a meal?

670
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,222
It's not just food. It's a cake.

671
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,058
I mean... Okay. You're right.

672
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:26,478
Eat up. I was wrong.

673
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,064
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

674
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,297
Do you like comedy movies?

675
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,425
I like a movie
that's showing when I can watch it.

676
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,972
Do you want some popcorn?

677
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,351
Am I supposed to touch your hand
trying to get some popcorn?

678
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,477
Right.

679
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,271
Gosh, I touched your hand.

680
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,815
Gosh, my heart is fluttering.

681
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,948
Why?

682
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,373
Ki-yong.

683
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,752
Look. I have some toilet paper.

684
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:34,296
Jun-gi.

685
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:37,132
I just pooped.

686
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,224
-Thank you.
-Good work.

687
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,934
-Good work.
-So-min.

688
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,686
I'll go and talk about your schedule.

689
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,270
Go and get changed.

690
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,439
Thank you.

691
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,650
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

692
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,362
-How's Lee So-min?
-She's unique.

693
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,073
She's so unique
that I feel like I set it up.

694
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,158
That might be more popular that way.

695
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,953
I will just follow her in an honest way.

696
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,455
Okay. I like that attitude.

697
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,416
-I should get going. See you.
-Okay.

698
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,500
Bye.

699
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,336
-I'll go to the restroom.
-Okay.

700
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,089
LEE SO-MIN

701
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,052
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. Let's go in.

702
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,684
What?

703
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,228
Min-jun got a job offer
from a big company?

704
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,230
-What?
-How did you know that?

705
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,358
It was on the footage.

706
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,277
I told you not to shoot it
without their consent.

707
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,779
Right. I'm sorry.

708
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,323
Which company?

709
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:45,325
So is he going to quit his job
as So-min's manager?

710
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:47,786
What happens then?

711
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,038
I don't know.

712
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:26,325
I don't know. I really don't.

713
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,744
But I did something wrong, right?

714
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,293
-Do you want me to lower my body?
-I love you.

715
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:40,756
What...

716
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,176
What did I do wrong?

717
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,472
Let's go.

718
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:52,267
Hey, what...

719
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,311
So-min, I'm scared.

720
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:58,106
You are very honest.

721
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,735
Let's go.

722
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,991
What is a confession?

723
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,660
What?

724
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:13,330
I just want to ask a fundamental question.

725
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,250
Now you're having an identity crisis.

726
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,544
I'm just asking about your thought.

727
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,048
It's not just about how you confess
your feelings.

728
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,261
What's more important is the fact itself
that you have those feelings

729
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:30,681
and what made you fall for the person.

730
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,935
When people watch a drama,

731
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,187
they relate to the characters.

732
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,025
Then it would be more than enough
if you just say, "I like you."

733
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,993
Why?

734
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:53,662
What now?

735
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:56,039
What is it?

736
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,420
So you're saying

737
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:06,216
I failed to express those feelings.

738
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,511
It means I didn't write it well.

739
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,722
It's my fault.

740
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:15,934
Gosh, so this is how it goes.

741
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,773
Fine. I'm a terrible writer.

742
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,859
I'm a writer who's bad at writing.

743
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:27,070
I barely read Korean
but call myself a writer.

744
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,657
-All right. I'm sorry. It's my fault.
-My gosh.

745
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:32,993
So...

746
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,538
After you revealed your feelings so well

747
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,375
to your ex-girlfriend,

748
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,086
what did you say to actually ask her out?

749
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,012
Why are you blushing?

750
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,435
Because I drank.

751
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,278
Gosh.

752
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:12,449
You keep blushing. Your face is so red.

753
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:15,911
My gosh.

754
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,372
Did you put balloons
in your car trunk or something?

755
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:19,706
What's the big deal?

756
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,580
-Do you feel better now?
-I'm good.

757
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,711
-It was my first car, so...
-Just drink it.

758
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:06,795
Okay.

759
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:18,098
We ate a meal, had dessert,

760
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:21,184
watched a movie, and drank together.

761
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,564
I think going on a date
results in high calories.

762
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,608
Shall we walk home then?

763
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,569
I'll take you home.

764
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:32,988
Okay.

765
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,992
I think this is your first time
to say yes so easily.

766
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,661
Because I like it.

767
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,308
Gosh, look at those flowers.

768
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,477
There are a lot of flowers we don't know.

769
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,022
They're pretty.

770
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,901
If you look at them for a while,

771
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,111
you will feel better.

772
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,988
I'm fine.

773
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,911
Thank you.

774
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:37,344
Let me see. Which one is prettier?

775
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:45,894
I just picked the best one,
but you beat it completely.

776
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,607
Hang on a second.

777
00:51:58,949 --> 00:51:59,991
Ha-yun.

778
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,710
This is nice.
I'm so happy to see you smile.

779
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,088
Everything will be fine, okay?

780
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,049
Okay. Good.

781
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,885
-Let's go.
-Thank you.

782
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,258
HA-YUN

783
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,321
I'm meeting my friends.

784
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,407
-Are you drinking?
-Yes.

785
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:26,119
-Are you coming home late?
-Go to bed first.

786
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:34,669
My whole family liked dramas,
but we had different tastes.

787
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,672
My dad and my sister
like historical dramas.

788
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,257
My mom and I like romance dramas.

789
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,512
When Heo Jun was aired on MBC,

790
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:49,684
KBS aired Autumn in My Heart
at the same time.

791
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:52,020
I remember that.

792
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,898
We were like a divided family back then.

793
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,733
She watched a historical drama
at such a young age?

794
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,527
Yes. Because it was Heo Jun.

795
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:02,697
She liked Lady Ye-jin and dreamed
of becoming a traditional Chinese doctor.

796
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,907
I understand.

797
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,661
When Moon Geun-young said
she wanted to be a tree in her next life,

798
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,621
I dreamed of becoming a tree.

799
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,500
-So you watched Autumn in My Heart.
-Right.

800
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:18,213
Anyway, I thought my family would
watch the same drama

801
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,341
without fighting once I become a writer.

802
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,469
I thought they would
watch my drama altogether.

803
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,430
"Fine. I should make one."

804
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:31,101
So it's like the great union.
You did it for peace.

805
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,312
It's quite surprising though.

806
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,023
That you liked Autumn in My Heart.

807
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,402
I was going through puberty back then.

808
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:45,323
I must say I'm quite melodramatic.

809
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,492
You don't know anything about women.

810
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,744
Do you have fantasies about men?

811
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,997
Did you try to mimic Won Bin?

812
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:56,543
"Love? Don't be ridiculous.

813
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,254
I'll buy it with money.
How much do you need?

814
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,505
How much do you want?"

815
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,883
"How much can you give me?"

816
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,804
I did this at a snack bar.

817
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,223
"Dumplings? Don't be ridiculous."

818
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:14,227
"I'll buy it with money."
And the store owner asked

819
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:16,896
if I'd stolen dumplings before.

820
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,941
I did it a lot.

821
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,986
"Don't be ridiculous." You know it, right?

822
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,460
Thank you. I should go in now.

823
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,253
Okay. Bye, Jin-joo.

824
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:46,176
Aren't you going to ask me out?

825
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,262
Anyway,

826
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,724
I'll see you tomorrow.

827
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,060
Is it Misaeng now?

828
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,271
That's what Kang Ha-neul
said to Im Si-wan.

829
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:17,791
Something like this?

830
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,960
That's trite.

831
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:28,134
-We didn't do it.
-We didn't.

832
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:32,222
Have you ever seen anyone kiss?

833
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,474
-Sure.
-At Sinchon.

834
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,977
-We didn't do it.
-We didn't.

835
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:39,521
We didn't do it.

836
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,564
We didn't.

837
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,359
We didn't kiss.

838
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,458
What about we propose

839
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,877
to make a kiss zone
at the neighborhood meeting?

840
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,212
If you don't drive,

841
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,964
there's no place for you to kiss.

842
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,259
It isn't unfamiliar to see people kiss
on the street in Korea now.

843
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:10,844
Do you really need it?

844
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,805
There are a lot of elderly people
in an apartment complex.

845
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,889
Hey!

846
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,854
All we need is a booth

847
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:22,689
which two people can fit in.

848
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,482
There should be a mood light.

849
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:27,735
Then they should pay
for the electric charges.

850
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:31,698
I guess our apartment will be selected
as a good complex for romances.

851
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,893
Don't you feel like
something might happen?

852
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,313
Like what?

853
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,566
I don't know.

854
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,866
Do you want to know?

855
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,624
Who asked whom out first?

856
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,003
Both you and me, half and half.

857
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,730
Then make me laugh.

858
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,848
Damn it.

859
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:26,372
I am craving Pyongyang naengmyeon.

860
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,958
JIN-JOO

861
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:37,884
Yes?

862
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:50,229
Today,

863
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,316
I get to hear a lot of my favorite sounds.

864
01:00:53,524 --> 01:00:54,567
What do you mean?

865
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,951
It's Saturday morning
when I catch up on my sleep.

866
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,208
I do the laundry,

867
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:15,588
and go back to bed.

868
01:01:16,297 --> 01:01:18,383
I roll in the bed for a long time.

869
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:22,637
I read some books in bed.

870
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:28,226
Once the clouds move away,
the sunshine touches my face.

871
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,520
It feels good.

872
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,731
At that moment,

873
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:37,443
The Trout by Schubert plays
from the washing machine.

874
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,489
I like the sound.

875
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:44,742
Now I should hang out the laundry.

876
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:49,455
And my blanket feels so dry and soft
under the sunshine.

877
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:53,042
I feel so good
that I don't want to get up.

878
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,585
Mr. Son Beom-su?

879
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:56,003
"Package delivery."

880
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,464
-I...
-Thank you.

881
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,882
like the sound.

882
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:09,350
The shirt I ordered online
fits me perfectly.

883
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,980
I feel even better,
so I decide to hang out the laundry.

884
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,442
By the time I finish it,

885
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,694
my stomach growls.

886
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:21,946
I...

887
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:24,073
like the sound.

888
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,243
"What shall I eat?

889
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:30,079
I'm too tired to cook,
but I don't want to order delivery food.

890
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,125
What the heck.
I'll just cook instant noodles."

891
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:41,674
Hello?

892
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,051
-Did you eat?
-"Did you eat?"

893
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,804
The voice. I really...

894
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,726
I really liked it.

895
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,019
What?

896
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:55,229
What?

897
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,856
What favorite sound?

898
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,316
Nothing.

899
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,276
What?

900
01:03:00,943 --> 01:03:02,069
Nothing.

901
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,781
I mean the sound of you eating naengmyeon.

902
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,949
I like the sound. The slurping sound.

903
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,453
You're just like Pyongyang naengmyeon.
You're so bland.

904
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,246
Eat up.

905
01:03:28,095 --> 01:03:31,474
So do I really have to ask you out?

906
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:00,628
IF YOU EVER LOVED SOMEONE,

907
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:05,216
YOU WILL BE BOTHERED BY THE PERSON
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

908
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,427
TODAY IS CONFESSION DAY

909
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:09,637
IF WE START DATING TODAY

910
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,140
MY BIRTHDAY WILL MARK
OUR 100TH DAY ANNIVERSARY

911
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:15,434
PLEASE

912
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,811
STOP BEING SO NAIVE, OKAY?

913
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,188
YOU WILL ONLY END UP BECOMING A PUSHOVER

914
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,735
SO DO I REALLY HAVE TO ASK YOU OUT?

915
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:28,906
The big production company wants me?

916
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:30,491
Then, what about Han-ju?

917
01:04:30,575 --> 01:04:33,494
We're sitting face to face
with a contract in between us.

918
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,412
This is exciting.

919
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:36,497
Tonight's dinner
will be the last favor I get

920
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,374
for the sake of your friendship
with Ms. Hwang.

921
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,794
Meeting a senior like that isn't easy.

922
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:45,256
What does Ms. Lim like?

923
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,633
Korean beef is too expensive.

924
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:50,177
I hate Korean beef.

925
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:52,179
JUST BUY AMERICAN BEEF

926
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,265
Haven't we met before?

927
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:56,350
You two look great together.

928
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:58,477
You seemed very sweet when you saw her.

929
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,479
You used to be like that
when you saw me before.

930
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,732
How do you feel about living a life
where you can't be honest?

931
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,400
I can't be honest.

932
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:05,818
I have to say what I'm supposed to.

933
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,362
So-min can be naughty sometimes.

934
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:09,614
I'm a pervert,

935
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,073
so I like a girl being naughty.

936
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:12,408
Quit working as my manager.

937
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:14,118
You got a better job offer.

938
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,494
I HAVE A NEW DREAM
BECOMING A MANAGER

939
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,914
I can't talk now. Talk about yourself.

940
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,582
-What?
-Just tell me about you.

941
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:22,585
I don't remember how I used to be.

942
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,503
Why can't I remember it?

943
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,716
WHAT WAS I LIKE WHEN I DATED YOU?

944
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,719
