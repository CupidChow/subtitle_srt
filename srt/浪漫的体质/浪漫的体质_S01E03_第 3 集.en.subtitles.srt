1
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,558
-I won't do it.
-Why not?

2
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,269
It's a great opportunity for your debut.

3
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,854
I can't interact with him emotionally.

4
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,606
Interact, my foot.

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:07,192
I guess you really hit it off
with poverty then.

6
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,279
Jin-joo, this isn't just right.

7
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,239
This is about survival.

8
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,616
But he's just rude.

9
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,037
I guess you don't know much about people.

10
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:20,955
It sounds too shallow.

11
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,540
Everything sounds like a joke.

12
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,667
I can't make a drama
out of a script that's not insightful.

13
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,878
Am I supposed to film some landscapes?

14
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,880
This is about filming a TV drama.

15
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,799
It's not like posting some video
on social media.

16
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,884
You don't have to elaborate on
your criticism though.

17
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,761
It's just mean. Can't you even
beat around the bush?

18
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,222
Why would I beat around the bush?
It just takes more time.

19
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,556
You should try to take some time.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,767
Human relationships are
all about taking time.

21
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,477
You should be more considerate of others.

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,604
I'm criticizing you
because I'm being considerate.

23
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,106
-Then you should beat around the bush.
-It just takes more time.

24
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,568
Fine. You're a famous director,

25
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:52,362
and I'm just a budding writer.

26
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,571
But put yourself in my shoes.

27
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,824
Why would I? I like my shoes better.

28
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,700
I think that's just hilarious.

29
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,953
So I made you laugh.

30
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,162
I'm so proud.

31
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:05,083
So you'll keep being like this?
You won't compromise?

32
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,793
Of course. I'm very successful, you know.

33
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm competent. That's good enough already.

34
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,421
And my family is rich as well.

35
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,466
My dad is an executive of a big company,
and my mom is a university president.

36
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,927
It would be strange
if I wanted to compromise.

37
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,436
I won't do it.

38
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,356
What do you think is the point
of this conversation?

39
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,733
His dad works at a big company,
and his mom works at a university.

40
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,528
He's a successful director
from a rich family.

41
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,489
You snobbish punks.

42
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,367
Hyo-bong, change the music.

43
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:41,786
About human greed and fall.

44
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,997
Like the original soundtrack
of Behind the White Tower.

45
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,299
Jin-joo, don't be silly.

46
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:55,967
That can't be a reason.

47
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,594
So...

48
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,845
I won't do it.

49
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,359
-Why aren't you stopping me?
-Pardon?

50
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,073
I can't reach you.

51
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,452
Do you want me to stop you?

52
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:28,750
All right. Fine.

53
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,544
Why do you want to work with a writer
who doesn't know much about people?

54
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,004
Because I know people.

55
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,798
If you do, you must know
how upset I am now.

56
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,258
And I know you still want to do this.

57
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,468
I don't.

58
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,387
-That's stupid.
-Totally stupid.

59
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:43,848
So...

60
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,153
Why?

61
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,407
Why did you call me?

62
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,117
I didn't call you.

63
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,286
Yes, you did. That's why I turned around.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,038
Why would I turn around otherwise?

65
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,668
I guess you're right.

66
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,337
It wouldn't matter even if you answer
first and then I call you.

67
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,631
What's so important about the order?
I can call you now.

68
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,466
-It's okay.
-Hey.

69
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,010
-Jin-joo. Ms. Lim.
-Just forget it.

70
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,220
Look.

71
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:23,888
Wait.

72
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,723
Gosh.

73
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:27,600
You're a good actor.

74
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,728
Good. All right then.

75
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,188
Beg me, just once.

76
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,065
And say something good about me.

77
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,608
Then I will cave in.

78
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,527
They say compliments
can make a whale dance.

79
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,904
Why would I want to see a whale dance?

80
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,824
All right, okay.

81
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,416
You're impressive.

82
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,920
That's it?

83
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,839
Yes.

84
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,301
You're impressive.

85
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:06,222
You're really ungenerous.

86
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,265
Totally ungenerous.

87
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,018
I can't do this because he's ungenerous.

88
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,072
Tell us the truth.

89
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,254
I may sound blunt,
but I'm good at my work.

90
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,051
I like to receive packages,

91
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,846
and I like to study
the menu in a restaurant.

92
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,683
But I like my work
incomparably better than those things.

93
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,061
This is more precious than anything else.

94
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,646
And I want to do it with you.

95
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,359
Not just do it, either.
I want to do it right.

96
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,655
Why don't you count on me this once?

97
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,783
So he likes his work

98
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,826
more than packages and menus.

99
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:14,791
He sounds like a decent guy.
That's not something easy.

100
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:15,958
But why?

101
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,881
There will be 16 episodes...
Hey, over here.

102
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,967
He's my assistant director. He's smart.

103
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,012
He will take care of all the chores.
You should say hello to him.

104
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,723
It'd be better to tell him
about your temper beforehand.

105
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,810
She's our writer. She has a nasty temper.

106
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,103
Hello.

107
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,778
Hello. I'm Kim Hwan-dong
majoring in mass communication.

108
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,539
Hello.

109
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,583
My name is Lim Jin-joo.
You don't have to take a seat.

110
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:03,047
What?

111
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,467
Why are you frozen like that?

112
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,428
What's going on?

113
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,056
Does he look like your ex-boyfriend?

114
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:16,644
I'm not doing this.

115
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,772
What?

116
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,317
I won't do it.

117
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,404
Why not?

118
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,744
Fine. Don't do it!

119
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,621
Damn it.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,210
Hey, why are you

121
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,880
still frozen like that?

122
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,299
What are you trying to pull off?

123
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,009
What are you watching?

124
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:56,684
It's not embarrassing that you can't
be cool about your past love.

125
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,146
You have the right to be like that

126
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,231
since you passed through the hard times.

127
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,318
Right. Everyone has their own situation.

128
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,819
But,

129
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:10,948
we should be more careful
when we reject something at our age.

130
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,326
It's about an opportunity.

131
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,369
Wrinkles take it away from us.

132
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:18,706
We get less opportunities
as we grow older.

133
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,750
That's how society works.

134
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,297
Come to think of it, I can't remember

135
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,424
the last time I rejected something.

136
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,427
I just can't afford to say it.

137
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,055
It's sad.

138
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,599
But once I reject something,

139
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:40,603
there are a million people
who are willing to take the opportunity.

140
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,316
You're right.

141
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,110
I'm just a mere budding writer.

142
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,282
Why did I reject the offer so easily?

143
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,828
Why is she calling me at this hour? Hello?

144
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,121
Hey, Eun-jeong.

145
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,623
I need your help.

146
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,041
What?

147
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,252
I'm a panelist in the show
called I Heard a Rumor.

148
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,004
And I should go abroad on a shoot,
so we need a stand-in.

149
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,339
Why would I be on the show?

150
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,091
You're a documentary director too.

151
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:12,760
The director was excited
to hear your name.

152
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,886
So what?

153
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,137
Come on.

154
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,640
Who knows? They might make you a regular.
This is a good opportunity.

155
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:21,185
Why would I go on a TV show
where people just gossip?

156
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,272
-Hey, I'm asking you a favor--
-I'm not doing it.

157
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,493
Gosh, they are drinking again.

158
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,537
I'm so sick of this.

159
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,914
Mom, aren't you on a diet?

160
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,749
I'm not!

161
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:51,924
Let's go to sleep.

162
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,193
Sir, it's not like the drama ends
after only one episode.

163
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,321
She's an idol artist,
so she's sensitive about her weight.

164
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,364
I'll make sure she eats the chicken.

165
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,991
You can count on me.

166
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,244
I'm sorry, but I'll call you back.

167
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,830
Wait.

168
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,043
The new semester is starting.
Make sure to get along with your friends.

169
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,796
Don't fight with your friends.

170
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,549
-Isn't that the same thing?
-What?

171
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,718
Why would I fight with them
if I get along with them?

172
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,013
That's what I meant.

173
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,149
Is he going through puberty already?

174
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,787
Ms. Hwang, how long have you worked here?

175
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,874
It's been 6 years, 7 months, and 23 days.

176
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,251
Besides the legal holidays
and paid leaves,

177
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:12,338
you've never taken a day off
or been late for work.

178
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,715
-That's true.
-Are you smiling?

179
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:19,095
Okay. You can smile or frown
with your own face.

180
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,596
Let's move on.

181
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,891
All right. Now, look at my face.

182
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,813
Do you think I'm giving you the prize
for perfect attendance?

183
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,359
Now that you've worked hard,
I want you to show a good performance.

184
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,443
Why did you come to work?

185
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:35,861
Pardon?

186
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,780
Why did you come all the way here?

187
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,117
Because this is where the company is...

188
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,537
What will you do with the chicken case?

189
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,498
When the actress doesn't eat it,
are you just supposed to say,

190
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,542
"I understand you're on a diet?"

191
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,669
Then you should go become her manager.

192
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,505
You should go to her place and ask her
on your knees until she eats.

193
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,132
Why did you come to the office?

194
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,676
I'm sorry.

195
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,637
Will you just do what I tell you to do?

196
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,431
Then why would I need you?

197
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,101
If I needed an avatar, I would've found
someone stronger than you.

198
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,729
What is it you got having worked so hard?
It's your experience, right?

199
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:13,566
Yes.

200
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,827
She's being sensitive
because of the drama project these days.

201
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:28,372
She's not a bad person.
Don't take it so seriously.

202
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,752
You're the one who should be comforted,
but you're comforting me

203
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,087
with the words you need to hear.

204
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,755
You think?

205
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,592
It's true that she's cold-hearted.

206
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,469
But she's always precise.

207
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:45,264
She doesn't even ask me for coffee
if it's not part of my job.

208
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:46,849
It's just normal.

209
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,934
It's really hard to do something normal.

210
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:52,771
These days, I even think
people being precise are nice.

211
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,486
It feels kind of bitter.
Thank you for the coffee.

212
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,365
Stay seated.

213
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:09,288
Why would you make this look like a place
where employees don't even get to rest?

214
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,425
She is nice. She's fussy but nice.

215
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,900
As our nice boss said, I'll go
to her place and ask her on my knees.

216
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,859
I'll do it.

217
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,028
I think it's too rude.

218
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,572
You're right.
She can't make me kneel down.

219
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,698
I mean, we're rude.

220
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,495
We can't go to her place to see her
when she doesn't want it.

221
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,830
Oh, you think?

222
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,335
But we still have to do something. Then...

223
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
we should bother her
in a less annoying way.

224
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,089
Bother her in a less annoying way?

225
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,675
The word combination is a little...

226
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,469
Is it strange? Then we should
bother her in a pleasant way.

227
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,972
Bother her in a pleasant way?
Do you think it makes sense?

228
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,974
We should keep bothering her
to make her feel good.

229
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,809
Like how?

230
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,153
It's not that I hate it.

231
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,364
I just feel uncomfortable.

232
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,951
Who would like to feel uncomfortable?
It means you hate it.

233
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,664
I'm sorry again.

234
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,126
Please make a decision
from a broad point of view.

235
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,838
I believe I should step down

236
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,507
in order not to ruin the project.

237
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,050
I guess you're right.

238
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,387
There are a lot
of assistant directors out there.

239
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,975
But I like you
out of all those assistant directors.

240
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,273
Let me check this script again

241
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,317
to see how sad it makes me
to miss this chance.

242
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,737
Then I'll make a decision.
You may leave now.

243
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:32,890
Morning.

244
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,516
It's morning again.

245
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,145
What about it? I'm unemployed anyway.

246
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,359
So cowardly.

247
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,945
It's just cowardly of me.

248
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,073
I'm sleeping all day in a bed
because I'm unemployed? It's so cowardly.

249
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:51,075
Being unemployed
isn't something to be proud of.

250
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,125
So what if I'm cowardly?

251
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,337
Human beings spend their whole lives
being self-conscious.

252
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:06,840
But I'm in here all alone.
Lying in bed is just amazing.

253
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,261
I have no conscience.

254
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,017
I feel so devoid of conscience.

255
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,228
I'm destroying myself now.

256
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,235
So what? What can I do?

257
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,237
I need some time to think.

258
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,748
I should give myself some time to think
while saving my conscience.

259
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,292
All right. I should go to another place.

260
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,718
Mom, I'll be sleeping here
for the next few days.

261
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,887
If you want to nag at me,
just leave me a voice message.

262
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,305
I'll listen to it all at once later.

263
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,142
Eat before you sleep.
It will take a while.

264
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,528
Are you hungry?

265
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,281
I just ate two servings of gimbap
ten minutes ago.

266
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,783
If it was from my belly,
it must've been poop.

267
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,326
But I don't feel like taking a dump now.

268
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,745
Gosh, I'm hungry.

269
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,580
Hello.

270
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,792
Today, we're going to make avocado
and chicken breast salad.

271
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,671
Jae-hun, I heard
the recipe is very simple.

272
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,381
Yes. It is really simple.

273
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,967
I'll prepare the vegetables.
Can you please slice

274
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,470
-the smoked chicken breast and avocado?
-Sure.

275
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,225
It's simple to prepare the vegetables.
Just open the bag...

276
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,105
and put them on a plate.
These are pre-washed.

277
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,818
You're working hard to slice them.

278
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,945
Ta-da. It sounds like a lie,

279
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,740
but it's prepared perfectly in an instant.

280
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,326
But it feels like something's missing.

281
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,495
Then we should

282
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,872
slice the boiled egg we prepared.

283
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,124
Here. Please spice it again.

284
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:06,376
Again, like a lie,

285
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,962
the sliced egg is placed
beautifully on the salad.

286
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:11,131
Gosh, it really adds to the color!

287
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,259
I didn't know a boiled egg was
such beautiful protein.

288
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,803
It's nutritionally complete food.

289
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:19,473
Now we will sprinkle
this complete balsamic vinegar

290
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,726
on this complete salad.

291
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,853
And there's olive oil.

292
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,398
We will add just a little of it.

293
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:33,112
It must be really delicious.

294
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,743
We will leave it here.

295
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,294
KIM DO-YEON

296
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,172
KIM DO-YEON

297
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,883
Do-yeon! Do-yeon!

298
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,969
Go, Do-yeon!

299
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,763
This is the purpose of the question.

300
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,558
Understanding the nature of parabola.

301
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:49,980
On the parabola, y squared equals 8x,

302
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,982
the focus is point f.

303
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:58,030
So the straight line passes
point P and point Q.

304
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:02,326
And there are point a and point b
on the x-coordinate.

305
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,829
A plus b equals 14.

306
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:11,627
What you need now, Do-yeon,
is straight line PQ's function.

307
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,171
And the parabola y squared

308
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,256
equals 4ax...

309
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,135
I'd like to thank you again.

310
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,638
I really like your work.

311
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,390
-I'm still not sure if this is right.
-You'll do a good job.

312
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,475
You're doing a good job.

313
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,435
What if I make blunt remarks again?

314
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,354
That's what we want.

315
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,148
I think you look smart
even when you make blunt remarks.

316
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,191
What if I swear?

317
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,736
I can edit it out.
Just make yourself comfortable.

318
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,696
Would you like some snacks?

319
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,370
You can say some fruit names
when you feel like swear.

320
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,123
"That damn apple."
"What the hell is the grape?"

321
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,876
I need tropical fruits when I'm pissed.

322
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:55,504
What about calamansi?

323
00:20:55,712 --> 00:21:00,175
-Calamansi? I like that.
-I'm not sure if I can find calamansi.

324
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,220
-This is your waiting room.
-Okay.

325
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,264
-Here's the script.
-Thanks.

326
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,393
Gosh, I feel like I'm talking to myself.

327
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,727
Excuse me.

328
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,272
Why did the host change?

329
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,818
It just happened that way.
I thought you knew it.

330
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,486
Is there a problem?

331
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,407
Not really. It's a little annoying though.

332
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,257
Why are you being so annoying?

333
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,969
I didn't say a word today.

334
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:45,637
Why aren't you saying anything?

335
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,264
Do you know how annoying that is?

336
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,516
I wouldn't have been like that if I knew.

337
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,185
Gosh, you must've been really annoyed.

338
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,353
You look down on me

339
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,272
because I'm hosting
some cable channel talk show.

340
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,357
Is that what you want?
Does it make you feel better?

341
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,817
Don't feel so upset about it.

342
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,319
How can I not be upset when I am?

343
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,695
Are you looking down on me?

344
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,364
Is that what you want?
Does it make you feel better?

345
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,534
Do you want me to look down on you?
If that's the case, just tell me.

346
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,494
I will try to look down on you.

347
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,290
You're really annoying.

348
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,710
I shouldn't have talked back to you.

349
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,026
The script has only two episodes.

350
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,195
But he's been reading it for two days.

351
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,531
Once he gets a script
from a writer he works with,

352
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,949
he even memorizes action descriptions.

353
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,453
Is that even possible?

354
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,499
I heard writers are sometimes confused
about whether to finish a sentence

355
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,043
with a period or a question mark.

356
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:01,254
And it's the director who comes up
with a new symbol for such a situation.

357
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,925
In order to do so, he must read
the script over and over again.

358
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,470
He may sound blunt,

359
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,514
but writers want to work
with him for good reason.

360
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,308
That's how cool your boss is.

361
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,103
-Are you proud?
-Yes. I'm very proud.

362
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,187
Me too.

363
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:21,691
She's become a writer whom a successful
director like him wants to work with.

364
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,782
I'm really sad to give up on this.

365
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,494
I should annoy her.

366
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,721
Who are you?

367
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,349
Well...

368
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,601
I'm supposed to ask the question.

369
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,395
Oh, you're right.

370
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,021
Go ahead.

371
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:01,898
Who are you?

372
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,527
You say you're famous,
but I haven't watched any of your dramas.

373
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,905
That doesn't happen a lot.
What do you usually like?

374
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:09,990
Goblin.

375
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,909
Every moment with Goblin was brilliant.

376
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,203
"Because the weather was good,
because the weather was bad,

377
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,413
because the weather was okay,

378
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:19,249
every moment was brilliant." She's up.

379
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,211
That was such a long nap.

380
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,089
She has always liked to loaf around
at home since she was young.

381
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:28,592
Kids usually get some rest at home

382
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,468
-after frolicking outside for long.
-Right.

383
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,097
But she only went outside after she got
sick of loafing around at home.

384
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,349
But she still came home to eat, right?

385
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,310
It's not like she only eats
at certain times of day.

386
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,729
I guess she just keeps
her stomach full all the time.

387
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,063
How did you know that?

388
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,773
I guess you're very close with her.

389
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,650
He seems very close with you.

390
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,111
Right. We've become friends.
He's really funny.

391
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,654
Gosh, I'm not.

392
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,906
Can I call you by your name?

393
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,824
-No, you can't.
-I knew it.

394
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,462
Aren't you following her?

395
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,132
I guess I'll see her again.
I just can't leave food.

396
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,302
I like your attitude.
I'll watch your drama.

397
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,974
I'll visit you again.

398
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,270
Slow down.

399
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,855
I'll see you again.

400
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,567
They just got here.

401
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:30,487
-Hello.
-Hello.

402
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,322
Hello.

403
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,740
-Hello.
-Hello.

404
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,575
You had your hair dyed.

405
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,077
How did you know that?

406
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,080
-I also said hi.
-This is the script.

407
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,456
Thank you.

408
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:43,500
-Hello.
-Hello.

409
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,418
-Hello.
-Hello.

410
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,421
-Hello.
-Hello.

411
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,048
How have you been? Hello.

412
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,341
-Hello.
-Hello.

413
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,177
-Gosh, it's Il-jung.
-Hello.

414
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,222
-It's you.
-Long time no see.

415
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,556
-Hello.
-Hey.

416
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,599
Hello, Ms. Lee.

417
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,017
-Hello.
-Hello.

418
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,978
Thank you for coming today.

419
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,813
I really appreciate it.

420
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,523
Thank you for saying that.

421
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,733
All right. Let's begin then.

422
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,027
-Hello.
-Hello.

423
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:13,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

424
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:14,531
Hello.

425
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,033
-Hello.
-Hello.

426
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:20,996
It's so nice to see you. I just found out
when I got here. How long has it been?

427
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,372
It's been a few days.

428
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:25,875
I saw you, and you saw me.
I heard that from Hyo-bong.

429
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,085
I guess you have poor eyesight.

430
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,087
I have good eyesight, but poor hearing.

431
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,131
I can't hear a word you're saying.

432
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,133
-Gosh, hello.
-Hey.

433
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,719
Let's start the rehearsal.
Please get ready.

434
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,138
We know who you are,

435
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:42,142
but can you please introduce yourself
for those who don't know you?

436
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,061
-Hello, I'm--
-She's my friend.

437
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,772
We went to college together.

438
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,399
-Really?
-I see.

439
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,985
-You went to the same college.
-That's not what I want to introduce.

440
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,073
She swears a lot and drinks a lot.

441
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:00,660
So she was very popular among friends.

442
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,287
Among female friends.

443
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,210
I guess you asked So-min to introduce me.

444
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,339
Is that how close you two are?

445
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,512
I bet you two are very close.

446
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,848
-Right.
-Anyway, I stopped swearing last year.

447
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,018
When I'm pissed off
I say fruit names instead of swear words.

448
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,061
You guys should try it.

449
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,438
Think about refreshing fruits
when you're upset.

450
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,774
It will help you calm down.

451
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,442
I think you should quit drinking too.

452
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,195
Do you still like drinking?

453
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,030
It's the love of my life.

454
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,657
Are you drunk right now?

455
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,035
That damn calamansi.

456
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:45,413
Gosh, you're honest.
Did you get drunk even yesterday?

457
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,457
No. I said calamansi.

458
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,666
What? Cala?

459
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,543
I HEARD A RUMOR

460
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,420
Gosh, this doesn't feel right.

461
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:57,592
-It's a tropical fruit.
-I see.

462
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:01,513
-Oh, the green lemon.
-Wow.

463
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,767
I think they are very close.

464
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,186
So please introduce yourself.

465
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,687
We're still doing it.

466
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:12,315
-Okay. Hello, I'm--
-You swore.

467
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,319
Is it that hard to tell?

468
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,987
I feel like I just got punched.

469
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,824
Since it's a tropical fruit, why not
just say you got fruit punched?

470
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,492
That darn...

471
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,124
All right. They must be really close.

472
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,918
If you say that one more time,
they might become best friends.

473
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,796
Let's take a break.

474
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,384
It's been only five minutes.

475
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,179
This will go on until tomorrow.

476
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,983
I can't believe I cast a lunatic.

477
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,026
You cast one and got one free.

478
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,908
Why are you bothering me?

479
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,744
You're a successful director
who's got everything.

480
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,288
Come close to me. Then I'll tell you why.

481
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:10,790
I'm walking ahead.
You should catch up with me.

482
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,125
It's not like I'm walking backward.

483
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,461
I must say this is my last bit of pride.

484
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,421
I came to your house to see you.

485
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:19,382
Then you should slow down
to come next to me.

486
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:22,635
Gosh, I'll slow down
because that sounds new.

487
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,890
All right. Good.

488
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,642
I think you're kind of nice.

489
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,355
-So Hwan-dong told me.
-It's just the past puppy love.

490
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,650
"Puppy love"?
Is it like two puppies in love?

491
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,110
I almost laughed.

492
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,782
I don't care
if they were puppies or kittens.

493
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,950
The past is the past.

494
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,577
Please don't be so unprofessional.

495
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,206
Ordinary people would say those
silly things in a situation like this.

496
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,333
But I won't. Because I'm special.

497
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:56,211
Is there anything special
that sounds silly too? I'm excited.

498
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,839
-How about fried chicken?
-All of a sudden?

499
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,383
Is this something
like preference research?

500
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:06,429
I was asking if you'd like to go eat it.
Is it bad timing?

501
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:10,892
Fried chicken? It's something
I'd want to eat even before I die.

502
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,612
Are you seriously
not interested in TV commercials?

503
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,824
Of course I'm kidding.
Why would you take it so seriously?

504
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,993
In fact,

505
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,120
I love TV commercials.

506
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,665
I see. Anyway,

507
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,959
dramas these days are
making viewers uncomfortable

508
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,336
with immoderate PPL.

509
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,755
In the last episode of The Last Husband,

510
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,884
the day the fourth husband was diagnosed
with terminal cancer,

511
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,594
he gave his wife a dishwasher.

512
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:30,305
And the logo of the brand was right there.

513
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,640
I watched it too. Isn't it fun?

514
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,767
I was really moved by the scene.

515
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,479
A guy who's worried about his wife
doing house chores even before he dies.

516
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:43,401
What do you mean? It's not like
house chores are only for women.

517
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,570
And what? After loafing around
the house his whole life,

518
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,406
he just gives his wife a dishwasher
when he's diagnosed with terminal cancer?

519
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,286
I think the placement
overshadowed the very term.

520
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,123
We're talking about PPL right now.

521
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,225
Let's take a break.

522
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,313
Again?

523
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,106
Another break?

524
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,734
This will never end.

525
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:30,114
Can't celebrities live in a fancy mansion?

526
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,033
That's not the point.

527
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,119
What's being criticized is
that they are speaking out

528
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,373
against unpleasant facilities
to be built in their neighborhood.

529
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:41,334
Who would want unpleasant facilities
to be built in front of their house?

530
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,504
Then where would they be built?
In front of other people's houses.

531
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,006
The regional self-centeredness
of the privileged class

532
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,051
should be regarded
as ill-natured and shameless NIMBY

533
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,928
in the sense
that it's against the lower class.

534
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,638
Did you say "nymph"?

535
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,807
Nymph...

536
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,143
I was talking about the NIMBY syndrome.

537
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,728
"NIMBY"?

538
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,772
What's "NIMBY"?

539
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,322
I must say you two have
such nice chemistry.

540
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,532
All of a sudden?

541
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,866
-Right.
-Let's take a break.

542
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:16,661
Sure.

543
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,330
It's about time. We need a break.

544
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,499
Why don't you go on a vacation?

545
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,334
Let's take a break.

546
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,293
Let's take a break.

547
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:27,714
Let's take a break.

548
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,675
Let's take a break.

549
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,645
Can't we just stick to the script?

550
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,984
It says, "You can simply give
a piece of your mind."

551
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,402
Do you want me to read the line?

552
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:52,196
Why is everything so complicated?
Just say something understandable.

553
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,366
You're the only one who doesn't
understand it. Just nod along.

554
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,327
You don't have to make a comeback.
I don't expect you to understand it.

555
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,913
If you don't understand,
just try to hide that you don't.

556
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,709
-Let's take a break.
-Okay. Let's do that.

557
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,936
-Thank you.
-What?

558
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,273
-For letting me have fun at work.
-What do you mean?

559
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,902
I'm shy of strangers,
so I never step out in public.

560
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,154
I don't think so.

561
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,782
I just could do it when you were around.

562
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,367
That's what I should be saying.

563
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,750
Do-yeon, thank you for your hard work.

564
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,502
Thank you.

565
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,796
I guess you come
to the filming site every time.

566
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,298
Yes. We're in charge of marketing,

567
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,717
but our company
is the co-producer of this project.

568
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,803
I don't know about stuff like that.

569
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,891
About the chicken today.
Thank you so much.

570
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:05,394
And we are sorry
that we've been bothering you.

571
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,562
I'm sorry.

572
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,191
It's okay. I wasn't bothered.

573
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,694
-Thank you for saying that.
-I was scared.

574
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,365
We had one more member in our band.

575
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,492
I know. She went abroad to study.

576
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,701
That's not why she quit.

577
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,289
She was my best friend.

578
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,292
She had a hard time
because of some crazy fans and stalkers.

579
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,796
She even got death threats.

580
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,091
She received psychotherapy,

581
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,802
but ended up giving up on her dream.

582
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,932
We liked to sing and dance
ever since we were young.

583
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,977
I like my job.

584
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,855
But I'm scared of it.

585
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,109
I'm scared

586
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,903
that those who I thought
were just nice to me

587
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,864
could suddenly turn into a murderer.

588
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,533
I saw it happen.

589
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,412
I guess that's the problem.

590
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,471
Why are you about to cry?

591
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,726
I feel really bad for her.

592
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,789
Is it that you like fried chicken
or you like beer?

593
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,750
Let's not set priorities.

594
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,335
They both are sacred.

595
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,629
One more draft beer, please.

596
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,548
Why aren't you drinking?

597
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,800
I quit drinking.

598
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,594
I want to live without making mistakes.

599
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,888
Start drinking again.

600
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,514
You're too young to quit drinking.

601
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,434
I want to listen to your stories, Ms. Lim.

602
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,938
-What stories?
-I think you have lots of tales to tell.

603
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,106
It can be about your work
or your past love.

604
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,858
Come on, I'm a good listener.

605
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,402
That's surprising.

606
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,281
But I can't say anything
when I'm the only one who's drunk.

607
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,033
It will only embarrass me.

608
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,344
We're done. Thank you.

609
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:45,471
-Thank you.
-Well done.

610
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,848
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

611
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:51,519
-Thank you.
-It took us nine hours.

612
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,146
Are you sure we didn't shoot two episodes?

613
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,692
It took a very long time.

614
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,443
-What was that?
-My gosh.

615
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,987
Thank you.

616
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,989
-Good work.
-Thank you.

617
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,199
My gosh. This is serious.

618
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:07,618
-Let's just go.
-Bye.

619
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,495
-Good work.
-Thank you.

620
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,165
My gosh.

621
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,209
-Thank you.
-Well done.

622
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,336
-Good work.
-You people, seriously...

623
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,839
That was very good.

624
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:25,011
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Thank you.

625
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,979
-Thank you for the good work.
-Thank you.

626
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,355
Excuse me.

627
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,320
I'd like to tell you something
if you don't mind.

628
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,322
Okay. Please go ahead.

629
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,824
You see, So-min

630
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,576
is a smart person.

631
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,998
She just has different interests
and ways of thinking.

632
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,336
I don't know what made
you two have a falling-out,

633
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,339
but I guess it was
probably So-min's fault.

634
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,882
She has a nasty temper.

635
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,386
But I'm still not sure

636
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,431
what she did to you to be humiliated

637
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,141
in front of so many people.

638
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,061
Well... I see.

639
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,979
I'm sorry if I crossed the line.

640
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,565
She still means a lot to me though.

641
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,359
I was a little upset.

642
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,985
I'm sorry.

643
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,905
Please don't hate her.

644
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,741
She may seem a little grumpy,
but she's quite soft-hearted.

645
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,165
Damn it! Why are you just watching me?

646
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,920
Maybe she's not.

647
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:41,921
Goodbye.

648
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,133
If you fell down, you should stand up.

649
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,260
What are you doing there?
Are you a mermaid or what?

650
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:50,221
I'm not even the Little Mermaid?

651
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,555
Why did you not call me a princess?

652
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,682
Do you want to be a princess
even at a time like this?

653
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,934
What's wrong about that?

654
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,477
Only Gianna Jun can be one, is that it?

655
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,437
Then just go work
for Gianna Jun, you jerk.

656
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,148
-I can't go to her right now.
-Why? Because I got hurt?

657
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,441
I'm getting my bonus this month.

658
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,361
You got your knees skinned.

659
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,460
Are you upset?

660
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,421
Should I teach him a lesson?

661
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,882
No. I just couldn't argue with that.

662
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,717
I'm a little embarrassed.

663
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:32,304
He just embarrassed you.
I can't let it slide.

664
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,723
You have a lot to argue with. Wait.

665
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,016
Just come here.

666
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,272
By the way,

667
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,233
what happened between you two?

668
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,777
I don't know.

669
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,238
That's what I don't remember.

670
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,365
I really don't know why I got dumped.

671
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:54,201
I can't date her when I'm too busy.

672
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,829
But I still made some time
to eat with her.

673
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:00,749
I even ate some desserts
that I just don't understand

674
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,126
why they should exist in this world.

675
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:03,627
I watched movies and did everything.

676
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,005
Do you know what she said
when I took her home?

677
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,091
"You don't like me, do you?"

678
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:13,179
Gosh, the moment I thought
the day went really well,

679
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,889
another day just began.

680
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,099
You said you'd listen to my stories.

681
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:18,851
Why are you telling me
a full story of yourself?

682
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:20,936
Why did you make me drink? Just listen.

683
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,271
I also had my puppy love.

684
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,065
You said love doesn't exist.
Why are you changing your words?

685
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,443
I thought it did. It's not like

686
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:30,613
I denied the existence of love
from the moment I was born.

687
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,491
You said you dated her for two years.

688
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,868
You're a fool who made her say,
"You don't like me, do you?"

689
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:38,621
You don't know anything about women.
I mean, you don't know her.

690
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:41,707
-Did you break up because you knew him?
-I did. I'm glad I did.

691
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,096
-Excuse me. Here.
-Yes.

692
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,975
Please play another song.

693
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,727
-What are you doing?
-The song...

694
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,312
What's wrong with the lyrics?

695
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,565
"Smelling shampoo in some flowers?"

696
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,235
Isn't it cheap shampoo
that's used in an inn or something?

697
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,362
I'm sorry. We have other customers here.

698
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,906
I'm sorry. Never mind.

699
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:18,369
Getting upset at a love song
talking about your past love?

700
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:19,578
It's just a cliché.

701
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,330
I just hate this song.

702
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,415
Why are you yelling at me?

703
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,584
Did you get dumped
by the one who wrote the lyrics?

704
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,324
Excuse me. Please change the music.

705
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,993
Do you want to kill this guy?

706
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,042
Another glass of beer, please.

707
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,553
So it's not like I deny
the existence of love.

708
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,016
I just that I'm in pain
because I know it does exist.

709
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,767
If you know that ,

710
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,812
don't take it so lightly
when someone likes you.

711
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:29,106
Did I?

712
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,737
-Do you mean Da-mi, the dietitian?
-Yes.

713
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,822
She's kind of cute.

714
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,116
I didn't try to be mean to her.

715
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,744
That's because
she just said it all of a sudden--

716
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:43,454
You're using her as an excuse again.

717
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,122
There's no light confession of love.

718
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:48,834
Just because you don't like her,
you can't say that you're not responsible.

719
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:52,546
After all, you're the one
who moved her heart.

720
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,633
-Do you think she's still suffering?
-Sure.

721
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:58,010
Something unfulfilled lasts forever.

722
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,598
Is Hwan-dong

723
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,559
your unfulfilled love, Ms. Lim?

724
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,443
I went through all sorts of things
with him.

725
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,695
He's just

726
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,157
someone I feel bad for.

727
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,369
Then let's just

728
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,247
work together.

729
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,417
You should be fine
if you feel bad for him.

730
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,216
Do you think he's still suffering?

731
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,386
I'm not sure, but you two shouldn't
feel bad for each other...

732
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,721
Well...

733
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,453
The beer is too bland.

734
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,080
Do you want to order soju?

735
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:10,290
Excuse me.

736
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,669
Can we get a bottle of soju?
Please make it quick.

737
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,879
You didn't change
the music earlier, right?

738
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,965
And one more beer.

739
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,478
I mean, you're so tender-hearted.

740
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:33,897
How would you even do
your job properly at work?

741
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:36,316
If you can do it, I can.

742
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:46,076
Don't cry like you did earlier.

743
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,790
It's not like I cried.

744
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,420
It's just a sob of self-reflection.

745
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,049
It sounds just appropriate.

746
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,051
You did that too.

747
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,637
That's true.

748
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,849
I was just thankful to Do-yeon.

749
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,559
What?

750
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,145
I did feel bad for her,

751
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,688
but I also felt grateful

752
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:19,902
that she told us the truth
so we could think more.

753
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,322
What actually made me feel bad

754
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,700
is you.

755
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,077
I was too...

756
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,626
What is it?

757
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,463
I feel like I made you cry

758
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,591
because I did something wrong.

759
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:45,552
That's not true. Never.

760
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,013
I wanted to do a good job.

761
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:49,973
Because

762
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,102
it will make you smile.

763
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,217
I'm sorry.

764
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,272
Excuse me. The kitchen is closing soon.

765
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,940
Is there anything you need...

766
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,942
-No. We're okay.
-No. We're okay.

767
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,193
Okay.

768
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:54,955
They are closing.

769
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,874
-All right then...
-Shall we go?

770
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:01,086
In-guk is having
an extracurricular activity tomorrow.

771
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:04,631
-It's late.
-Right. It's important.

772
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,646
We are closing now.

773
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:22,524
I see. You're closing.

774
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,110
Then we can't eat. We can't stay here.

775
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:26,987
We should go then.

776
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,281
We should another round.

777
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:32,117
Let's another round.

778
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,244
Let's go home.

779
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,956
Let's go home.
It's more comfortable at home.

780
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,127
-Let's drink at home.
-Let's go home.

781
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:44,546
Let's go.

782
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,504
-Did you sleep well?
-Did you?

783
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:09,089
Why didn't you use the blackout curtains?

784
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,757
Because I didn't want to oversleep.

785
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,678
You are one hardworking man.

786
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,431
Well... Take your time.

787
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,683
You seem flustered.

788
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,477
You're wearing the shirt backwards.

789
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,192
-Have some breakfast here.
-I don't eat breakfast.

790
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,195
I can't do that to a guest.
Do you feel uncomfortable?

791
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,739
Why would I feel uncomfortable?

792
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,699
I just have sensitive intestines.

793
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,952
-Make some breakfast then.
-Okay.

794
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,168
Will you wait outside
if you're done getting changed?

795
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,636
I guess you like cherry tomatoes.

796
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,765
People should eat tomatoes.

797
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,480
Some side dishes you got
for someone who lives alone...

798
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,731
My mom made them...

799
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,693
I'm not quite independent.

800
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,780
Gosh, the president cooks well.

801
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:18,909
A university president
does have a negative image on news,

802
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,745
but she's very sophisticated and upright.

803
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,998
I know. It's not like anyone can
become a university president.

804
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,836
Do you want some cherry tomatoes?

805
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:32,589
Sure.

806
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,219
I should do the dishes.

807
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,679
You don't have to. I'll do it.

808
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,182
I had a lovely meal.

809
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:44,810
Maybe I should pay
management expenses this month.

810
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,062
Hey, don't be ridiculous.

811
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,023
-I should get going then.
-Here.

812
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:53,985
Gosh, when did you pick them?

813
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,403
I just did.

814
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,498
It's a terrible day to die.

815
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,890
Hello?

816
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,516
Yes. I'm on the first floor.

817
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,312
-Hello.
-Hello.

818
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:11,396
This way, please.

819
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,067
Please.

820
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,119
This is the office
of the children's foundation.

821
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,165
This way, please.

822
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,426
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

823
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:00,236
Did you relieve your hangover?

824
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,282
Come on, we didn't drink that much.

825
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,952
You shouldn't drink today.

826
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,413
Okay.

827
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,348
Cave. I need a cave.

828
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,234
Day and time.

829
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,195
Please hurry and pass by.

830
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,531
And don't stay in my memory.

831
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,471
Why isn't anyone talking?

832
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,098
I'm scared.

833
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:13,143
And why is there no beer on this table?

834
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,728
We should save money.

835
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,771
You guys only drink expensive beer.

836
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,398
Why do you talk about money all the time?

837
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,859
You even started to appear in TV shows.

838
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,278
-I should make money.
-Excuse me, Ms. Parvenu.

839
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,032
What is going on?

840
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,491
Hey, you go first.

841
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,744
I'm sure your thing is the most trivial.

842
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,207
This time,

843
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,293
it's pretty huge.

844
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,669
It makes me nervous.

845
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,004
I...

846
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:44,549
I held hands with a guy.

847
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,343
I can't believe I got nervous for that.

848
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,181
I mean, he held my hand like this.

849
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,141
Is that it? Next.

850
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,562
I slept with a guy.

851
00:55:58,938 --> 00:55:59,939
My gosh.

852
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,941
You crazy... Is it Hwan-dong?

853
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:04,527
-No.
-Yes! I'm nervous.

854
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:05,779
Son Beom-su.

855
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:07,947
-You crazy...
-You crazy...

856
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,866
Gosh, totally worth it.

857
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:11,868
It was worth getting nervous for.

858
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,620
Did you do it?

859
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,039
No. I just slept.

860
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,083
I took off my clothes, but--

861
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:21,044
-Let's talk about it later.
-What?

862
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:23,046
We will get back to you. Next.

863
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,094
Me?

864
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:32,388
That was just huge. What's the rush?

865
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,183
Just say it. Let's get this over with
and get back to Jin-joo.

866
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,726
There can't be anything bigger than this.

867
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:38,561
-I donated.
-Nice.

868
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:44,400
-You donated?
-Yes.

869
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:47,195
Like giving out money to charity

870
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:48,905
or for public works?

871
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,281
Yes. That's it.

872
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,910
I didn't quite hear what she said.

873
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:56,746
She made a donation.

874
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,581
She can do that. How much?

875
00:56:58,665 --> 00:56:59,999
-Everything.
-How much is it?

876
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,126
All of it.

877
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,836
That doesn't sound right.

878
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,379
-All you've got?
-Yes.

879
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,756
All my money.

880
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,637
-Why?
-Because I wanted to.

881
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,099
Without consulting us?

882
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,476
You just gave out all your money
because you wanted to?

883
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:19,769
Yes.

884
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:22,689
If I consulted you guys,
we wouldn't have reached an agreement.

885
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,566
I knew what would happen.

886
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,401
So I took care of it.

887
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,029
I see.

888
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,084
Why? What now?

889
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,461
In-guk,

890
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:47,589
just give me a hug
without saying anything.

891
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:50,550
Gosh, I'm so sick of this.

892
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,054
It can't be everything.

893
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,307
Why did you do that?

894
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:59,726
Just go and sleep with a guy, you punk.

895
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,561
Let me finish my meal first.

896
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,659
There are things I might be
able to understand over time.

897
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,453
Right.

898
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:22,457
But, gosh...

899
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,293
This will take a very long time.

900
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,399
I knew you were up.

901
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:50,610
Did you go to a club?

902
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,779
I told you I'd go.

903
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,699
Don't drink too much though.

904
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,743
I drank only a little.

905
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,578
I can't hold my liquor well.

906
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:06,376
You don't get drunk
even if you drink ten bottles of soju.

907
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:07,919
Right?

908
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,046
I can't drink that much.

909
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,464
I know.

910
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,550
So you shouldn't have drunk.

911
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:40,868
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM DO-YEON OF WEKI MEKI

912
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,454
I LIKE TO RECEIVE PACKAGES

913
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,291
AND I LIKE TO STUDY
THE MENU IN A RESTAURANT

914
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:49,335
BUT I LIKE MY WORK
INCOMPARABLY BETTER THAN THOSE THINGS

915
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:53,131
AND I WANT TO DO IT WITH YOU
I WANT TO DO IT RIGHT

916
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,259
WE SHOULD BE MORE CAREFUL

917
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,760
WHEN WE REJECT SOMETHING AT OUR AGE

918
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,345
IT'S ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY

919
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:02,932
WRINKLES TAKE IT AWAY FROM US

920
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,769
JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE HER,

921
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,772
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE

922
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,649
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE THE ONE

923
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:14,694
WHO MOVED HER HEART

924
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:17,780
Until when will you stay jobless?

925
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,449
-Lee So-min?
-Yes. I like the idea.

926
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:21,784
You could just watch shows

927
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,119
like I Live Alone.

928
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,330
You think everything is crooked
except for yourself.

929
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,498
You're bad at fighting.

930
01:00:27,582 --> 01:00:29,959
I'm good at running. I can just run away.

931
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,336
I have a black belt in taekwondo.

932
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,588
But I don't have the sportsmanship.

933
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,173
Stop it!

934
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,884
Why are the guys I like

935
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,969
all poor at fighting?

936
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:41,638
Do you still hate me?

937
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,431
I've heard that means you're not over me.

938
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:44,974
You haven't changed either.

939
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:46,726
It's been two years after they broke up.

940
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,978
But why would they fight again?

941
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,647
They still have feelings for each other.

942
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,858
Do you want to switch?

943
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:55,401
Bring them both.

944
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:57,820
You philanthropist.

945
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,200
