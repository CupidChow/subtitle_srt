1
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:48,214
An aspiring drama screenwriter.

2
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,385
To be exact, an aspiring drama
screenwriter who wants to write a story

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,846
and make a fun drama,
puts effort into her writing.

4
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:57,474
She finishes a proposal that includes

5
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,727
a purpose and subject of the drama,
a synopsis that summarizes 16 episodes

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,146
and character introduction,

7
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,774
and screenplays
for the first two episodes.

8
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,651
THE END OF EPISODE 2

9
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,579
FIND

10
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,540
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY
EPISODE 2

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,087
And she submits her yet-to-be-finished
work to the TV writing contest.

12
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,005
YES

13
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,513
And she sends it
to the production company she wants

14
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,139
and asks them if they want it.

15
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,974
Hello, producer.

16
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,811
Hi, I'm screenwriter, Lim Jin-joo.

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,357
Oh, you don't know me.

18
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,275
Yes, sir. Hello.

19
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,821
I said hello to you when you came to teach
at the writer training institute.

20
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:55,156
Why is it so hard to reach you?

21
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,535
I've finished the script.
Please have a read.

22
00:01:58,618 --> 00:01:59,994
Yes, I've already sent it.

23
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,122
Hello, Mr. Shin.

24
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:06,668
Isn't this Mr. Shin Sang-hyeon?

25
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:13,341
Oh, you're Mr. Ahn Jae-hyeon.

26
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:14,509
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,554
To be exact, she begs them
to consider producing her work,

28
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,430
desperately hoping that they like it.

29
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,559
Right. It's not something
I should ask about.

30
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,310
Here.

31
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,854
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

32
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,273
Another script.

33
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,775
I read this when I was a judge
of a writing contest a while ago.

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,152
How should I explain this?

35
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,279
-It's a little surprising.
-"Surprising"?

36
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,613
Yes.

37
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,366
It's all over the place and raw,

38
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,951
but it's a good read altogether.

39
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:41,035
Did this win an award?

40
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:44,122
I supported it, but the elders
didn't approve.

41
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,749
Hearing that makes me interested.

42
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,210
"Things Will Be Fine
Once You Turn Thirty."

43
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,587
LIM JIN-JOO

44
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,339
The piece the aspiring writer submitted

45
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,635
to the writing contest, unfortunately,
doesn't suit the elders' taste and fails.

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,727
But it ends up getting noticed
by a successful director.

47
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,855
A little but dramatic miracle happens.

48
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,733
I found it interesting.

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,234
My heart...

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,194
It hopped.

51
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,823
Do you want to work on it with me?

52
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,826
The director's offer was sincere.

53
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,121
I may sound blunt,
but I'm good at my work.

54
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,792
I like to receive packages,

55
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,671
and I like to study
the menu in a restaurant.

56
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:37,550
But I like my work
incomparably better than those things.

57
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,220
This is more precious than anything else.

58
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,305
And I want to do it with you.

59
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,058
Not just do it, either.
I want to do it right.

60
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,980
Why don't you count on me this once?

61
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,192
And his attitude toward work
was sincere too.

62
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,444
He's my assistant director.
She's our writer.

63
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,613
Hello.

64
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,991
And the crisis came right away.

65
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,243
Why did you make me drink?

66
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,411
Just listen. I also had my puppy love.

67
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:08,248
You said love doesn't exist.
Why are you changing your words?

68
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,291
I thought it did. It's not like

69
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,045
I denied the existence of love
from the moment I was born.

70
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,673
Let's go home.
It's more comfortable at home.

71
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,132
Let's drink at home.

72
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,094
Let's go home.

73
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,262
Let's go.

74
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,290
-You crazy jerk.
-You crazy bitch.

75
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,666
-Fuckface.
-Fucking twat.

76
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:52,583
Son of a bitch.

77
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,170
It won't be easy to make a miniseries

78
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,589
with new stories for each episode.

79
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,634
As you can see from the synopsis,

80
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,013
we already have enough stories
to make 16 episodes.

81
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,682
We also have some extra stories
for replacement in case they are not fun.

82
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,518
If we get favorable reviews,
we can also consider

83
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,312
making a sequel.

84
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,064
I believe that's the biggest advantage
of this drama.

85
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,276
A drama is supposed to make viewers
curious about the next episode.

86
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,528
It's not a 20-minute-long sitcom
that airs 5 days a week.

87
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,697
The viewers should wait five days
for the next episode.

88
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:27,118
But this is a drama where viewers can skip
one episode without being curious.

89
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,704
Aren't you worried about that?

90
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,374
The goal of our drama is somewhat similar,
but a little different.

91
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,335
It's not just about a bait,
but about empathy and sympathy.

92
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,171
And the power of characters.

93
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,089
Do you think they have the power?

94
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,508
Don't you think it's too focused on women?

95
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,136
-Time slot.
-Female characters aren't strong enough.

96
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:47,013
The script that hasn't earned a time slot

97
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:50,641
simply remains as letters
that almost got made into a drama.

98
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,144
The script of the aspiring screenwriter,
along with her dream,

99
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,022
ends up taking a long sleep

100
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,316
somewhere deep inside her external drive.

101
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,611
The only thing she can do
during her crisis

102
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,446
is to wait for the decision-makers.

103
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:07,533
To be more exact, the decision of
the elderly who don't like my writing.

104
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,368
All I can do is wait for them.

105
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,579
Making a drama isn't that easy.

106
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,928
You're staying still for too long.

107
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,764
-Yes, I'm on my diet.
-You call staying still a diet?

108
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,599
Yes, eating less and moving less
is more efficient

109
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:33,476
than eating a lot and moving a lot.

110
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,353
Shouldn't you eat less and move more--

111
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:38,064
Why do you even care?

112
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,526
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

113
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,028
Okay, you're far from all right.
Can I help with anything?

114
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,321
Give me like ten billion won.

115
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,448
Will that be enough to have you?

116
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,159
No, you can't have me with that money.

117
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,994
Why not?

118
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,121
If you had that money,

119
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:55,123
you would've given it to
a younger and hotter guy.

120
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,793
Just what do you want me to do?

121
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,003
Give me ten billion won,
no strings attached, or forget it.

122
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,090
Okay. I'll get going. Jin-joo.

123
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,508
I love you ten billion.

124
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,468
-Just go.
-Okay.

125
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,524
To solve the situation,
I need to put in more effort.

126
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,860
The logical saying

127
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:27,196
that effort will not betray you
sometimes sounds too abstract.

128
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,199
It's natural to work hard.

129
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,909
But when it's hard to do
the natural thing,

130
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,245
I start thinking it may not be
a natural thing after all.

131
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,539
When I start to wonder
if someone who was born with it

132
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,500
said such thing, pretending to
know it all,

133
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,836
I just stay still.

134
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:48,009
This may be my instinct telling me
to reserve the energy while I can.

135
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,388
Let's not eat.

136
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,515
"If a man will not work,
he shall not eat."

137
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,059
This saying that sounds like
an unfair labor law

138
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,604
sometimes feels like
it's the standard labor law.

139
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,606
This life isn't worth living.

140
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,650
My soul is instinctively refusing

141
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,403
to live this life with fat.

142
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,572
I will not eat.

143
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,291
-Hello?
-Let's eat.

144
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,376
-Who is this?
-I'll come to you.

145
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,378
You got the wrong number.

146
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,880
Are there any good restaurants near you?

147
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:40,311
I'd have invited you out to a meal
if you had been starving yourself,

148
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,771
but I see that you've been eating well.

149
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,773
I haven't been eating, you punk.

150
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,361
Ta-da.

151
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,613
-Take it.
-What is this?

152
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,490
Green onions.

153
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,454
I mean, why are you giving it to me
as if this was a bouquet?

154
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,540
There's no specific way
of giving green onions.

155
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,085
Will you keep me standing here?

156
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,766
We need to keep up our strength.

157
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,059
I know

158
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,104
you're already doing fine
but we're going to need more energy.

159
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,105
So let's eat green onions.

160
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,732
-Why green onions?
-It will energize you.

161
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,777
-I know you've had your breakfast.
-I haven't, you punk.

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,154
You should eat more even if you're full.
That's love for humanity.

163
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,033
Do you know it tastes great
to add green onions to tteokbokki?

164
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,953
-You hate tteokbokki?
-Yes.

165
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,248
Why are you telling me that now?
I've been cooking at yours.

166
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,333
You told me to eat green onions.
I'll eat that.

167
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,462
Right. You're right.
Let's eat green onions.

168
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,569
It's tasty.

169
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,905
The green onion stole the thunder.

170
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,376
This green onion is tasty.

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,755
Right? You may hate tteokbokki, but
you have to give the sauce some credit.

172
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:33,924
Gochujang is the best ingredient
for a sauce. I love that about Korea.

173
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,804
Eat up.

174
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,934
Why are you doing this to me?
You're being too nice.

175
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,606
My grandfather used to say

176
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,484
"If a man did not eat, he shall not work."

177
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,527
So you want me to work now?

178
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,113
Yes. Not working

179
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,823
makes me feel guilty.

180
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,035
Let's eat up and work hard.

181
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,747
Don't feel guilty.

182
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,459
It may seem like we're doing nothing
on the outside,

183
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,545
but it's different on the inside.

184
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,425
Our organs are working hard
to digest the food we ate.

185
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:21,347
We are in the middle of doing
something absolutely sacred.

186
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,141
This kind of feels like simple labor.

187
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,478
A human body isn't so simple, is it?

188
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,272
No, it's not.

189
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,528
Stay still. Just stay still.

190
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:37,822
Okay.

191
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,075
By the way...

192
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,536
You know we should find
a production company, right?

193
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:44,870
Let's talk about it.

194
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:06,809
Hi, So-min.

195
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,228
-Min-jun.
-Yes?

196
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,523
-What's my schedule for today?
-Documentary.

197
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,775
-They film me every day.
-Nothing else.

198
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:18,320
-I have no work?
-No. Nothing.

199
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,738
I see.

200
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,199
That means we'll be really busy today.

201
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,285
Yes. I got ready anyway.

202
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,246
-Okay, don't be late.
-Okay.

203
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,459
It's dangerous.

204
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,754
-What do you mean?
-Too straightforward.

205
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,797
-That's a good thing.
-Her acting natural

206
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,674
seems like she's conscious of the camera.

207
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,052
Are you sure that's not a prejudice?

208
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,472
My approach was that being self-conscious
is also a part of her as well,

209
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,432
-but...
-Were you wrong about that?

210
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,683
Yes.

211
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,561
It's ironic that her acting natural
seems unnatural.

212
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:35,689
What should we do?

213
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,735
So-min seems comfortable
when she's around you.

214
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,905
-Did she?
-She hates you but likes you.

215
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:46,367
-What do you mean?
-You two have different interests,

216
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,410
but So-min is actually quite smart.

217
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,246
Because she's always been a pretty girl,

218
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,373
she's pretending not to be smart
to protect herself.

219
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,500
A smart person

220
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,461
likes someone whom they can get
jealous of and respect at the same time.

221
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,884
-I'm sorry.
-What did you do wrong?

222
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,052
I commented

223
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,805
on another woman's beauty in front of you.

224
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,265
Just don't do it too often.

225
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,683
Okay.

226
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,393
Go on. What were you going to say?

227
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,769
So I think

228
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,940
-you should be in the documentary too.
-What?

229
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,735
It could weaken the aura of a celebrity.

230
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,321
You could ask her questions too.

231
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,949
You could start something unexpected
or control her.

232
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,159
And the arguments you may have
regarding those moments

233
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,245
can be filmed in a natural way.

234
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,956
But I'll have to change the format.

235
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,000
Isn't it too much of an adventure?

236
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,418
Adventurous people are sexy.

237
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,754
That makes me want to do it.

238
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,179
Have I not been sexy all along?

239
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:51,348
I like you because you're sexy.

240
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,645
Hey, get your camera.

241
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,606
Let's go to work.

242
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,732
Okay.

243
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:44,568
How many times will she ride this?
She might die.

244
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,861
Let's stop filming this.

245
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,116
FOUR SEASON SLEDDING SLOPE

246
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,915
-You know what?
-No.

247
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,793
Your facial expressions and emotions
change so dramatically.

248
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,836
It's hard to edit.
It doesn't look natural.

249
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,214
I kept the timeline
so that it looks natural,

250
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:08,467
but people might think
I've deleted a scene in the middle.

251
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,136
Aren't people in this industry the same?

252
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,305
Including writers or directors.

253
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,349
They are, more or less,

254
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,893
but I don't know which version of you
I should like.

255
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,354
When you're on the sled,
you're like a 20-year-old.

256
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:22,398
But now, you're like an 80-year-old.

257
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,275
I think I saw that in a toothpaste ad.
"Keep your 20-year-old teeth to 80."

258
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,820
Do you like sledding?

259
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,074
When I used to be really busy,
I sometimes didn't want to work.

260
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,283
On days like those,

261
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,079
I'd ask Min-jun to take me sledding
before we go to work.

262
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,082
After I had a few fun rides
and time passed,

263
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,709
I would sense the crisis.

264
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:45,504
After feeling guilty,
I have the urge to work.

265
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,756
"I had fun,

266
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,134
so I should go and work now."

267
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,428
You make your guilt motivate you.

268
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,306
Yes. That's what I used to do.

269
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,559
But I have nowhere to go now.

270
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,729
I have no work on my schedule.

271
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,399
Min-jun.

272
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,485
What do you do when you feel like
you're in a crisis?

273
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,821
Well...

274
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,825
Most of my crises...

275
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,371
come from you, so I lower myself
as much as possible.

276
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:22,708
But when I get caught,
I pretend to be bad at fights.

277
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,169
I'd smile at her. That's what I do.

278
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,629
What about you, cameraman?

279
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,132
Similar to you. I'm a salaryman too.

280
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:34,136
I get really anxious, but I hold it in.

281
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,638
Then I'd get some orders.

282
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,516
Then I do my work. That's it.

283
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,642
What about you?

284
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,314
I'm not any different.

285
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,026
I do something to take care
of the situation.

286
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:50,694
It's the same.

287
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,406
What should I do?

288
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,201
What is it that you want to do?

289
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,746
Acting.

290
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,876
Should I go around giving out
my portfolio like I used to?

291
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,558
Gosh, this is depressing.
I can't stay like this.

292
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,937
Min-jun, one more round.

293
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,730
You're like the toothpaste ad.

294
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,942
Ride it a hundred times.

295
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,653
Ride it until it turns your teeth white.

296
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,968
I thought she was bipolar,
but she's actually normal.

297
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:58,679
When she gets energetic,
she finds a way to be depressed.

298
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,764
When she gets depressed,
she makes herself elevated.

299
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,225
She doesn't look for the ways.
She avoids them.

300
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,103
It must be tough to be so normal.

301
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:07,855
Min-jun,

302
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,482
since we're in Paju,
can we go to the outlet stores?

303
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,568
Why do you even ask?
You'll do as you please anyway.

304
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,158
Our crises find us
at the exact same time every day.

305
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,077
We are given time
to prepare ourselves for the crisis.

306
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,538
We stretch our bodies
to be at the utmost condition

307
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,166
to face the crisis.

308
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,051
There comes the crisis.

309
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,722
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

310
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,308
She doesn't say hello back.

311
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:53,025
Today will be one tough day.

312
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,715
Sometimes, the crisis ends early.

313
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,384
I'm going home early.
Go home when you're done.

314
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,512
-Bye, ma'am.
-Bye, ma'am.

315
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,484
But our captain is surprisingly diligent.

316
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,866
We don't do anything special
to get away from this crisis.

317
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,618
We just...

318
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,288
-wait until it's over.
-Wait until it's over.

319
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,594
Ma'am!

320
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,304
My gosh, you startled me.

321
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,473
Goodness, it's you, Mr. Son.

322
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,225
Hello. Hi.

323
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,602
Gosh, why am I so happy to see you?

324
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,854
Ms. Lim!

325
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,649
How can you sit still
when your mother is here?

326
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,401
Get up and be polite.

327
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:20,696
No, I love her the most
when she stays still.

328
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,449
I feel like I've done a good job
raising her

329
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,951
when she stays still.

330
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,244
Please let her be.

331
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,666
A grown man and a woman

332
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,043
alone in an empty house?

333
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,548
I'm worried nothing will happen.

334
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,174
I'll get going soon.

335
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,013
That was a joke.

336
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,976
What are you doing? Go and stay still.

337
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,602
Go and sit back down.

338
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,589
What? You want me to talk about

339
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,799
how great the wet mop is
when my wife is having an affair?

340
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,469
And you want me to be moved by it too?

341
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,179
Are you two out of your minds?

342
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,183
Don't come closer. Stay back.

343
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,435
Don't come close to me.

344
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,021
Don't try to persuade me!

345
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,026
He should've refused to do it then.

346
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,736
Why does he do this when he agreed to it?

347
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,405
It's because he can't memorize the lines.

348
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,573
Right?

349
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,454
Whatever. Don't come to me.

350
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,732
GUIDELINES FOR THE GREEN ROOM

351
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:30,700
It stings.

352
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,499
I said it stings!

353
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,056
He's a nasty guy who buys his own food.

354
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:57,144
Why won't big eaters
get to advertise food?

355
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,690
How will we overcome this crisis,
Ms. General Manager?

356
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,069
You used to call me Ms. Hwang.

357
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,655
Now that you've become a general manager,

358
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,574
you seem like one in a drama series.

359
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,409
It's just that

360
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,704
I feel like I'll be the protagonist who
gets in a romantic relationship with you.

361
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,084
Isn't that what people call
a modern-day Cinderella?

362
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,881
Cinderella doesn't necessarily
have to be a woman.

363
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:31,553
I feel like a cool general manager.

364
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,513
Let's go out then.

365
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,856
-Broth only.
-Broth only.

366
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:43,940
Okay.

367
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,068
-Jinx.
-Jinx.

368
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,040
This is a cup of icy cold Americano,

369
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:02,209
your favorite kind of coffee, sir.

370
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,585
And here's one for you, too.

371
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:06,755
Sir?

372
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,760
All right. I wouldn't dare
ask for your response.

373
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,638
This happens over and over
but we must do this.

374
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,848
I'm on a break, so let me rest.

375
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,934
I'm doing this because I want a break too.

376
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,352
But how can I when my job isn't done?

377
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,104
Go and finish your job.
Don't pester me when I'm on my break.

378
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,898
Well, my job was done.

379
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,275
I got the PPL deal,
everything has been agreed,

380
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,069
and I got the investment.

381
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,404
But if the product isn't promoted
as per the deal,

382
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,200
it's a breach of contract,
not a matter of pestering.

383
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:37,953
What do you expect me to do?
The actor refuses to do it.

384
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,204
This happens all the time.

385
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,290
But this shouldn't have happened at all.

386
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,335
I mean, we all agreed to this deal.

387
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,088
But now the actor is ignoring it,
you're ignoring it,

388
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,465
the director of photography
and the manager are ignoring it.

389
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,510
So what can I do?

390
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,099
Say "sweetie."

391
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,061
The actor is a guy, I'm a guy,

392
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,063
the director is a guy,
and so is the manager.

393
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,315
All of us here are guys.
None of us are women.

394
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,235
Call us "sweetie" and act all cute.

395
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:11,319
Who would say no to that?

396
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,779
Can anyone

397
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,699
rip his balls off for me?

398
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:18,285
Why won't you take the easy way as a woman

399
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,620
and stop complaining?

400
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,540
Wait for me, sweetie.

401
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,717
Shit. I can't believe there are
still people like him.

402
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,261
Pick your ears. You just heard
something very filthy.

403
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,562
I didn't hear a thing.

404
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,611
Someone's here.

405
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,782
You must be In-guk.

406
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,076
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

407
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,703
You should wash your hands first.

408
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,540
Did you eat anything?
I doubt the school food was good.

409
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,208
Did something bad happen, In-guk?

410
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,919
Wait. Where are you going?

411
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,464
I just want to talk to you.

412
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,715
In-guk, wait.

413
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,592
Don't go.

414
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,790
Why do you keep eating late lunches
when you're not busy?

415
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:49,626
I was waiting for Mr. Son.

416
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,630
He doesn't come here often these days.

417
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,423
Did he find a good restaurant?

418
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,509
He went to Ms. Lim in the morning.

419
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,345
Things are tough for us
because of the time slot.

420
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,430
The two met in the morning?

421
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,974
What is it?

422
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:06,976
Are you still bothered by Mr. Son?

423
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,688
I'm not bothered by him, but I love him.

424
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:16,528
That's what I decided to do.
I'll love him but not be bothered.

425
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,784
That's unique.

426
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,080
Do you know that he likes Ms. Lim?

427
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,916
-What?
-I can tell right away.

428
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,919
Tell by what?

429
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:36,631
His eyes. He's a confident and honest man,

430
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,634
so he looks straight into the eyes
when he talks to someone.

431
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,344
It's kind of businesslike.

432
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,681
But when he talks to Ms. Lim,
he can't seem to look at her for long.

433
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,272
You're looking at me.

434
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,650
You're wasting too much energy.

435
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,111
-Why is that?
-Your heart must be fluttering.

436
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,612
Look somewhere meaningless.

437
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,948
You're wasting your energy
on talking nonsense.

438
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,491
Ms. Lim.

439
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,536
I understand

440
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,831
that we are doing a sacred task
known as digesting food,

441
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,499
but the realm of organs

442
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,376
is a whole other realm.

443
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,212
Have you ever seen your organs
with your eyes?

444
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,341
If you have a polyp in your stomach,

445
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:23,094
can you get rid of it
with tweezers yourself?

446
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:27,766
We have work to do in the realm
that we perceive with our eyes.

447
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,227
You need a good reason
to stay still like that.

448
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,775
Bring what's on the third shelf
on your left in the room.

449
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,331
I like designer bags.

450
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,167
But I only have one.

451
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,461
And what about it?

452
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,921
There's a gap

453
00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:00,381
between wanting one and owning one.

454
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,008
To reduce the gap,

455
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:05,220
I worked hard using that desire
as my motivation.

456
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,514
But that's all I have now.

457
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:09,766
What are you trying to say?

458
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,434
The world is so weird.

459
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,147
I'll stay still this time.

460
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,774
Is that why you'll stay still?

461
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,735
That's weirder.

462
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,572
Just as how I didn't expect
this is all I'd have after hard work,

463
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,158
a designer bag might drop out of nowhere

464
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,618
if I stay still like this.

465
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,370
It's a weird world anyway,

466
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:34,249
so I'll count on the lowest possibility.

467
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:37,585
That is a good enough reason for me
to stay still today.

468
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,671
I don't think that's possible at all.

469
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,426
A designer bag will drop out of nowhere
when you're doing nothing? Like this?

470
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,554
Drop or flop. I don't care how it happens.

471
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:48,721
"Flop"?

472
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,564
Gosh, my legs.

473
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,528
At least I got to talk a little.

474
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,823
Why am I happy about this?

475
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:20,169
He usually slouches,
but he sits straight around her.

476
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,130
He usually likes to make nasty jokes--

477
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,132
He makes jokes to Ms. Lim too.

478
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,466
I know he does,

479
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,220
but his jokes to Ms. Lim
are sophisticated.

480
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,763
"Sophisticated"?

481
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,644
He's trying to look cool
but won't risk losing trust.

482
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,439
I'm saying he won't act too immature.

483
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,193
Flop!

484
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,779
The bag just flopped out of nowhere.

485
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,489
Flop! Did you see that?

486
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,910
Oh, no. What do we do? This is bad.

487
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,537
You got what you already have.

488
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,581
It's okay.

489
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,542
Next time, your heart will fall.

490
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,422
Flop!

491
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:27,362
Did you read this in a magazine?
About men's psychology?

492
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,738
What's wrong with magazines?

493
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,199
It's made by very smart people.

494
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,660
I'm not sure though.

495
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,789
An ordinary man who changes his behavior
around a girl he likes.

496
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,457
That's all he is for now.

497
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,586
Once you get used to liking someone,

498
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:48,216
you tend to gaze on the person
without any reason.

499
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,676
You wouldn't care about being rude.

500
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,719
And you'd make jokes like a kid
to laugh together.

501
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,306
Once he gets
the slightest reaction from her

502
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,517
such as a giggle,

503
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:00,311
his love hormones will explode

504
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,689
and start flowing like crazy.

505
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,550
Gosh, seriously.

506
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,763
What is this smell? The green onions?

507
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,932
Gross.

508
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:44,605
Is that what the magazine said?

509
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,025
Yes. It's like an academic journal.

510
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,490
They want Sunwoo Resort to appear twice

511
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,200
in episode 15 and 16.

512
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,911
And we are allowed to shoot
inside the restaurant

513
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,538
on a weekday afternoon for free.

514
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:05,460
We'll be saving around
five to six million won a day.

515
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,670
Pass it over to the marketing team.

516
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,714
You should focus more on production.

517
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,674
Writer Kim Gyeong-jin broke off
his agreement.

518
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,010
Sorry? We worked so hard on it though.

519
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,096
I don't get why writers are so nasty.

520
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,266
It's like they are competing to see
who's the nastiest of them all.

521
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:22,685
Will they score points
to get a reward for being nasty or what?

522
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,481
We've already received the investment.

523
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,649
It's so hard to find a piece to work on.

524
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,943
Right.

525
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,613
Also, big agencies
are being territorial these days.

526
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,532
What about the rookie writer?

527
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,367
The script is a mess.

528
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,747
She can't even write
but she has the pride of a master.

529
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,541
Is that what they teach
at the writer training institute?

530
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,713
Once I handle the wet mop case,

531
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:52,715
I'll start meeting with writers.

532
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,676
I'll also check the works by newbies.

533
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,844
What about the wet mop?

534
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,306
Oh, that damn jerk?

535
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,433
That son of a bitch
always causes a problem.

536
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,241
Here are the documents.

537
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,619
Gosh, thank you.

538
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,206
What did Ms. Lee say?

539
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,417
I never heard her swear before.

540
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:30,294
-To you?
-No.

541
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:35,758
As if the seam of your tight pants
suddenly ripped

542
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:37,343
because they are too small for you,

543
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,930
the stress was too much for her,
so she popped a seam and swore.

544
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,433
Let's try our best not to do that.

545
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,853
I think you'll be cute if you swear.

546
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,479
I'm good at swearing.

547
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,858
-Come on. Try it then.
-I'm really good.

548
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,776
No way. Try it.

549
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,697
Jae-hun, I didn't know
you could taunt like this.

550
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,742
Swear if you can. I know you can't.

551
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,203
I said I'm good at it, you son of a bitch.

552
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,583
Right, you are good.

553
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,677
-I like them.
-Shoes?

554
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,137
What do you think?

555
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:25,183
-I like these better.
-Why?

556
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,476
All right.

557
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,445
Are you allowed to link arms with him?

558
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,739
We have you and the cameraman.

559
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,490
And even if we get caught,
he's just my manager.

560
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,285
Do you always go out with Min-jun?

561
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,953
We went to the same high school.

562
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,664
Isn't it uncomfortable to work
with your friend?

563
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,790
We're not close.

564
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,170
He's close to you as a manager
but not as a high school friend.

565
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,671
I can't do anything without him.

566
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,508
That's surprising. That sentence
itself is full of affection,

567
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,385
but it didn't sound affectionate at all.

568
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,762
Because she has no affection.

569
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:06,390
What?

570
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,602
-Don't do that.
-Okay.

571
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,405
Does she really walk around so much
on her day off?

572
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,699
That is 100 percent her natural self.

573
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,079
That's why she never gains any weight.

574
00:37:28,537 --> 00:37:29,705
She doesn't eat either.

575
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,500
We shouldn't have filmed a documentary.

576
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,086
We should've taken her
to a hospital to do a CT scan.

577
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,421
She's superhuman.

578
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,549
Seriously.

579
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,849
-Kill this for me.
-Get down here.

580
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,085
They kind of make a cute couple.

581
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,230
Intellectual nourishment.

582
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,317
Do you like reading books?

583
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,027
No, I like buying books.

584
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,654
-I'm glad to hear that.
-Why?

585
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,366
It's time we need physical nourishment
more than intellectual nourishment now.

586
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,659
Don't you read a lot?

587
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,786
I do. After I eat.

588
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,123
Are you aware we walked
more than 20,000 steps today?

589
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,084
Hey, you got a call from the agency.

590
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,294
He's asking if you can drop by.

591
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,962
-What?
-He has a script for you.

592
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,380
Really?

593
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,473
Lee So-min the woman and actress.

594
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,100
She's a woman and an actress,
but she may not be human.

595
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,852
How can she say "Let's go party"

596
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,771
when she walked for 20,000 steps
without eating?

597
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,107
But the thing is...

598
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,569
She's so energetic in her free time,

599
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,572
but why does she always lack energy
on camera as an actress?

600
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,742
-Because she doesn't want to work?
-No.

601
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,953
When she's on camera
and is unaware of how she looks,

602
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,246
the psychological pressure

603
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,374
must be dragging her down
like heavy sandbags.

604
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,626
Cameras are like sandbags?

605
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,546
Actors and actresses must have
incredible energy after all.

606
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,303
Even I feel exhausted
to be on camera right now.

607
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,727
This isn't a TV show,
so you can be yourself.

608
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,188
So you want me to talk about So-min?

609
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,107
Yes. Say a few words.

610
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:02,775
You can say it now.

611
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,320
You're so pretty, So-min.

612
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,411
Is that it? Anything else?

613
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,789
You're so pretty, So-min.

614
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:20,709
Well, anything else?

615
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,546
You're so cute, So-min.

616
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,548
You're not a robot.

617
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,551
Just say whatever you wanted to say.

618
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,053
You're so cute, So-min.

619
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,480
A weekend drama?

620
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,399
The director came to us

621
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,192
to ask if you're available.

622
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,486
First a web drama,
and now a weekend drama?

623
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,240
I don't want a weekend drama.
I want a weekday drama.

624
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:53,576
Two episodes will be aired on Saturday.

625
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,036
Not just on Saturday. I want weekdays.

626
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,205
It's a Saturday-Saturday drama.

627
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,292
This sounds better than a weekday drama.

628
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,461
It's like a lottery. You'll hit a jackpot
if you get lucky.

629
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,962
What are the odds of winning a lottery?

630
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,547
It depends on the game.

631
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,216
The higher the losing chances are,
the higher the dividend rate is.

632
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,720
So you're betting me on a team
with high losing chances

633
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:13,762
to hit a jackpot.

634
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,055
We're betting on a team

635
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,183
with a high dividend rate for your honor.

636
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,270
And this writer has been hitting
over ten percent ratings on weekends.

637
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,730
Just have a look at the script.

638
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,899
I'm only reading the first episode.

639
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,609
It gets fun from the second episode.

640
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:31,780
Let's talk, Min-jun.

641
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,827
You're so pretty, So-min.

642
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,455
Aren't you going to follow her?

643
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,665
I'm not shooting.

644
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,751
No matter what she does,

645
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,669
I will not stop in the middle of a meal.

646
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,296
That's a new rule.

647
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,511
You can stop working with So-min now.

648
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,430
-Sorry?
-I know it's hard.

649
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,432
No, it's not. I'm fine.

650
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,518
You've been working for so long now.

651
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:02,686
You can do better than her road agent.

652
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,189
Well, you're the boss.

653
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,815
Go to Haenaem ENT.

654
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,567
You'll be a team manager.

655
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,486
Why? Are you firing me now?

656
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,489
What? I don't want you to leave.

657
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,367
But we already have
four team managers at this agency.

658
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,619
You have enough experience
but I can't give you a title here.

659
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,829
Haenaem is a big agency,

660
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,207
and the CEO keeps things clean.

661
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,000
But this is too sudden.

662
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,253
I don't want you to go either.

663
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:31,549
What?

664
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,968
Why do you look sad all of a sudden?

665
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,719
They've been thinking hard

666
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,763
because they have no one with experience.

667
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,848
They asked me to send you over.

668
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:43,143
This is a great chance.
Do your best there.

669
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,478
I never said I'll go.

670
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,355
I know you're a loyal one.

671
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,191
I know you care about me.

672
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,859
It's fine.

673
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,571
What are you saying?

674
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:57,241
What? Why are you crying?

675
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,743
I'm not crying, you punk.

676
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,662
Why do you keep acting these days?

677
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,872
You're actually good, you know.

678
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,208
Gosh.

679
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,282
It's so weird.

680
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:43,203
My ex-girlfriend
as my senior's girlfriend.

681
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:44,997
That's not right.

682
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,166
Are you shooting a drama?
Why are you talking to yourself?

683
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,461
When did you get here?

684
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,713
We're in an elevator.

685
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,507
Did your ex-girlfriend become
your senior's girlfriend?

686
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:58,052
No. It's about a drama script.

687
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,429
You're too old for a messy relationship.

688
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,264
Beom-su is regretting it too.

689
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,225
Let's talk about the rest over a beer.

690
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,394
Oh, it's fine.

691
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,606
Okay. Let's eat assorted sashimi
with konowata and dried laver.

692
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,524
Well, I'm fine.

693
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,610
Okay, it's across the road. It's close.

694
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,172
This is what I get off work for.

695
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,678
So? Will you air Mr. Son's drama?

696
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,471
No production company will work on it.

697
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,349
We can take time. It's by a newbie writer.

698
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,059
Will Mr. Son stay still for that?

699
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,061
He should have stayed still.

700
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,313
-What do you mean?
-Nothing.

701
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,776
You know, you're actually helping it.

702
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:59,279
-Am I?
-Your condition

703
00:44:59,363 --> 00:45:01,657
was to not air Ms. Lim's work.

704
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,159
-Yes.
-But Mr. Son is working on it.

705
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,246
The station can't refuse to air it

706
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,164
even if they don't like her work now.

707
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:12,292
They can't make it look like
they are being controlled by you

708
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,837
and ditching the most competent director.

709
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:20,551
That's right.

710
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,680
I was only joking though. This is fun.

711
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,181
So?

712
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,518
Are you saying Jin-joo's work
isn't worth airing?

713
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,270
No. There's no problem.

714
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,773
They just need some time. That's all.

715
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:46,201
Staying still like this
at a moment of crisis.

716
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,203
This is my first time.

717
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:51,165
It kind of makes me feel good.

718
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:52,875
Thank you.

719
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:56,044
Forget it. I don't even want to
feel proud of myself.

720
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,922
The designer bag
never dropped out of the sky.

721
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:05,053
I can't believe the only thing
I can get by sitting still is air.

722
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:09,558
Fine dust.

723
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:10,893
God...

724
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,688
must be looking at us
as if we're chess pieces.

725
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,065
The pieces on the board

726
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,193
are put in a crisis from the moment
they are on.

727
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,487
"Hey, why are you thinking?

728
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:24,406
You're just pieces that need to run
until you die. Run."

729
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:29,244
But while I was looking at you,
fighting head-on with God,

730
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,329
I thought,

731
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,749
I should leave you alone.

732
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:35,250
What?

733
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,795
She's fighting in a realm
that's beyond my reach.

734
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,465
But don't do this too often.

735
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,508
It makes me worried.

736
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,136
-About what?
-If you defeat God, you'll be God.

737
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,805
-But what if you lose?
-I'd die.

738
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,098
That's why I'm worried.

739
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:54,186
So you want me to finish 16 episodes
before I die?

740
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:55,354
Is that what you want to say?

741
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,688
I've grown attached to you.

742
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:01,777
That's it.

743
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,374
Hello!

744
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,834
I'm Son Beom-su.

745
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:26,426
Hello.

746
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,303
Hi.

747
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,597
Let's mooch off them.

748
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,267
-I'm fine.
-Take a seat.

749
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:34,810
Well.

750
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,772
You know Ms. Jung, right?

751
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,607
Hello, ma'am.

752
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,859
-May we join you?
-Sure.

753
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,487
It's been a while, Mr. Kim.

754
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,613
Hello, Ms. Jung.

755
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,699
What? Do you know Hwan-dong?

756
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,951
He was the director of B team
of my drama last year.

757
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:52,869
Oh, you were the B team director?

758
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:55,622
Director Yang got hurt,
so I filled in for him.

759
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,165
But he worked longer than Director Yang.

760
00:47:57,249 --> 00:48:00,210
-I see. This is great. Order some beers.
-Okay.

761
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,629
Excuse me. Beers, please.

762
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,597
Gosh, eat first.

763
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,016
Him and his dinosaurs.

764
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,936
It's like the age of dinosaurs is back.

765
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,399
I went to watch Jurassic Park once,

766
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:25,277
and a schoolkid sitting behind me

767
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,362
told me all the names of the dinosaurs.

768
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,072
Eat some green onions.

769
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:33,410
Water parsley goes better with pork belly.

770
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,753
You're right about that.

771
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,617
Konowata.

772
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,870
So will you be an assistant director
in this drama too?

773
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,499
Hwan-dong just loves Beom-su.

774
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,918
-You should make your own show.
-He's only 30.

775
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,671
Mr. Son did his own when he was 30.

776
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,091
-Did he?
-He was 28, actually. He's a genius.

777
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,510
Mr. Kim does a great job too.

778
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,178
He can do it too, right?

779
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,559
You can direct my project.

780
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,692
Well, this conversation is going so...

781
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,778
You should air our projects
around the same time.

782
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,448
I don't know how unique her work may be,

783
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,950
but I'm sure it won't get
high viewer ratings.

784
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:41,288
It's completely different from mine,
so it'll balance out.

785
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,458
My work is like well-cooked meat.

786
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:47,502
And Jin-joo's is raw.

787
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,685
The station hasn't made the decision yet.

788
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,146
But her work is unique.

789
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,316
And I'll be working on it, so don't worry.

790
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,235
All the directors say, "It'll work out."

791
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:13,987
I heard you're a director yourself.

792
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:18,283
We'll find a production company first
then a workspace.

793
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,036
My gosh, our company is looking
for a show to produce.

794
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:23,580
You're working on two shows.

795
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:26,458
One of the writers broke off the contract.

796
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,211
And the newbie writer isn't good.

797
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,470
I'm Director Son Beom-su of JBC.

798
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,681
I know you very well. I'm Hwang Han-ju.

799
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,974
Will you be casting actors soon?

800
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,769
Casting is everything,
so we'll start soon.

801
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,896
I'm producing a documentary
on this actress,

802
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,606
and she's looking for a project.

803
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,566
I need to film her acting too.

804
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,734
What's her name?

805
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,653
Lee So-min.
She used to be a household name.

806
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,446
So-min? Used to? No, she's still

807
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,031
capable of doing a lead in a miniseries.

808
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,408
-Is that so?
-I hope it works out.

809
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,577
-I hope it works out too.
-I hope it works out.

810
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:03,995
No, I should be saying that.

811
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,248
Ms. Lim, say hello.

812
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,667
This is Ms. Hwang Han-ju
of Heungmeyubal Entertainment.

813
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,879
Hello, I'm a screenwriter.

814
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,048
May I visit you at the station?

815
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,758
If it's not too far--

816
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:19,094
I'll consider it's close by
no matter how far it is.

817
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,389
Please come by as often as you can.

818
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,890
Sure.

819
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:27,936
Well, I'd like to treat you and Ms. Lim
to a meal.

820
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:29,604
What do you like?

821
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,439
Let's eat what you like.

822
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,109
What do you like, Ms. Lim?

823
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:40,365
I'd like to have some lobster
at a tent bar in Haeundae.

824
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,285
So Haeundae it is. Let's drink to that.

825
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,881
They will have an inexperienced
production company,

826
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:59,134
-and B-listers as their cast.
-I agree.

827
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,636
I know you're competent,

828
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,889
but you need a competent director
to make it work.

829
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:04,806
Right.

830
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,683
And Hwan-dong is working as an assistant

831
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,435
because he's fond of Beom-su.

832
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,813
Is that right?
This seems like an opportunity.

833
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:12,981
Come on.

834
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:15,650
Well, I can do it.

835
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:18,236
Right?

836
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,289
You're not drinking much, Ms. Jung.

837
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:34,711
I'm containing myself
since I have bad drinking habits.

838
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,559
Gosh, I keep getting calls. Who is this?

839
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,812
I admire your self-control.
I'm going to the restroom.

840
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,359
Sweetie.

841
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,658
Was this cute? Do you like it?

842
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,784
I hate it.

843
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,328
Is that what he told you to do?

844
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,456
I mean, where did this concept
even come from, anyway?

845
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,334
What is aegyo in English? Tell me.

846
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:23,385
They just mean what they mean.

847
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:24,761
Say it in French.

848
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:28,598
-"Le charme"?
-But that means "charm."

849
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:29,933
Say it in Persian.

850
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,144
I mean,

851
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,813
tell us a word

852
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:36,856
in another language

853
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,901
that means to act in order to be perceived
as cute, lovely, and charming.

854
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,197
I didn't make that word up.
Why are you taking it out on me?

855
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:47,701
My joints are numb
from sitting down all day.

856
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,536
"Aikyo".

857
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:53,415
-"Aikyo"?
-So Japanese is the only one?

858
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,500
Well, I mean

859
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,711
it's not just the director
who's like that.

860
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,338
A supervisor from a TV station also said

861
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:03,508
that "sweetie" is the magic word.

862
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,094
And that supervisor was a woman.

863
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,637
What? That's crazy.

864
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,473
-Just do it, then.
-What?

865
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,352
Just let them have their way.

866
00:55:21,568 --> 00:55:23,778
Sweetie!

867
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:26,948
Sweetie, sweetie.

868
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,285
Sweetie, look at this.
If you step on it like this...

869
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,745
Sweetie, sweetie.

870
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,330
Isn't this so cool, sweetie?
Don't you want to try it, sweetie?

871
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:36,416
Sweetie.

872
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,043
Don't look away, sweetie.
Look here, sweetie.

873
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,880
If you don't look here,
you'll make me sad. Han-ju is sad.

874
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,798
You'll make Han-ju sad.

875
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,550
Sweetie.

876
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,511
Sweetie, I just turned this off.

877
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,223
Wait here, sweetie.
I'll be back soon, sweetie.

878
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,019
Mr. Manager, sweetie!

879
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,939
Sweetie, you know what this is all about.

880
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,316
Could you please stop--

881
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:03,860
Sweetie, you said you'll talk to him.

882
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,236
But you never did, sweetie.

883
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,614
What does that make me look like?
It makes me look like a fool.

884
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:10,700
You made a fool out of me, sweetie.
I hate you, sweetie.

885
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,037
What will you do now, sweetie?
Be responsible, sweetie.

886
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:15,997
Sweetie?

887
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,001
Sweetie.

888
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:21,377
Sweetie, sweetie.

889
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,297
Sweetie, sweetie!

890
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,508
Sweetie, sweetie...

891
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,013
Sweetie, sweetie.

892
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:34,015
The writer did her work,

893
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,434
so if you ignore it,
you'll be a bad boy, sweetie.

894
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,853
Take responsibility, sweetie.

895
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,356
What will you do?
Take responsibility, sweetie.

896
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,149
Responsibility.

897
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,692
It's in the script all right,

898
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,402
so if you won't film it...

899
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,866
That makes you a bad sweetie.

900
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,369
Sweetie, why won't you film it?

901
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,871
Where are you going, sweetie?

902
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,207
Wait for me. Why are you walking away?

903
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,626
Honey!

904
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,337
You're one picky eater, sweetie.

905
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:06,756
-You should eat everything.
-I will.

906
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,383
All right.

907
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,552
Sweetie, you know what?

908
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,763
I bet that water mop can clean
food waste, too. Don't you think?

909
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:14,806
Right, sweetie?

910
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,648
-Is the food good, sweetie?
-Don't talk to me.

911
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:25,400
Don't come near me.

912
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,819
Enjoy your meal.

913
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,532
-Enjoy your meal, sweetie.
-Thanks for the food.

914
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,117
Sweetie, where are you going?

915
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,702
Take the food waste with you.

916
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,545
Well,

917
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,255
yesterday...

918
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:48,465
What?

919
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,216
What about yesterday?

920
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:53,178
Well, that's...

921
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,347
Never mind.

922
00:57:57,974 --> 00:58:01,269
I heard you stayed at Ms. Lim's
all day yesterday.

923
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,770
All day.

924
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,148
-We stayed still all day.
-You stayed still?

925
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,733
Yes, we stayed still,

926
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,487
-And?
-but I looked.

927
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,571
-Look at what?
-What?

928
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:12,697
The script?

929
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,922
-Just...
-What?

930
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,722
Sweetie, the writer worked so hard
to edit this scene already.

931
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,016
If you do this again, I'll get killed.

932
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,520
Sweetie, sweetie.

933
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,730
Well, I think

934
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,900
I made a mistake.

935
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,276
Sweetie!

936
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:58,076
Sweetie!

937
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,371
Step aside, sweetie.
It's not your turn yet.

938
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,789
I'm really sorry.

939
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,208
My gosh, did you just touch me?

940
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,085
Well, that's not what I...

941
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,462
Sweetie?

942
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,381
Hey, I'll do it. Bring it over.

943
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,049
Right now.

944
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:15,927
Sweetie, I can tell you how.

945
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,720
I know how to!

946
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,889
I know it. I'll do it.

947
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,267
Sweetie. Look, it worked.

948
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,269
I can work hard.

949
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,520
I can do this.

950
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:28,731
Aren't I good?

951
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:34,362
Thank you, sweetie.

952
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:15,945
Honey, did you have a tough day?

953
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,489
Honey, honey.

954
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,450
Your shoulders must be stiff.

955
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,119
Honey, honey.

956
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:26,331
Honey, your shoulders are so stiff.

957
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:27,999
Honey.

958
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,550
-Look at what?
-What?

959
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,093
-The script?
-Just...

960
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,219
What?

961
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,180
Nothing.

962
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,434
Dancing.

963
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,353
"Dancing"?

964
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,067
Dancing like this?

965
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,194
Flapping.

966
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,614
Like this?

967
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:01,949
My heart skipped a beat.

968
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,912
What? Did your heart go skippity?

969
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:10,208
Gosh, the script must be looking good.

970
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,542
Gosh.

971
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,376
NOW THAT YOU'VE BECOME A GENERAL MANAGER,

972
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,711
I FEEL LIKE I'LL BE

973
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,879
THE PROTAGONIST WHO GETS IN
A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

974
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,631
ISN'T THAT WHAT PEOPLE CALL

975
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,259
A MODERN-DAY CINDERELLA?

976
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,262
CINDERELLA DOESN'T NECESSARILY
HAVE TO BE A WOMAN

977
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:08,808
ADVENTUROUS PEOPLE ARE SEXY

978
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,769
JUST AS HOW I DIDN'T EXPECT
THIS IS ALL I'D HAVE

979
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,146
AFTER HARD WORK,

980
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,605
A DESIGNER BAG

981
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,858
MIGHT DROP OUT OF NOWHERE
IF I STAY STILL LIKE THIS

982
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,234
IT'S A WEIRD WORLD ANYWAY,

983
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,487
SO I'LL COUNT ON THE LOWEST POSSIBILITY

984
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,824
THAT IS A GOOD ENOUGH REASON FOR ME
TO STAY STILL TODAY

985
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:28,161
I'VE GROWN ATTACHED TO YOU

986
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,787
THAT'S IT

987
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,583
We shot this by mistake
without their consent, right?

988
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,042
Do you have any good ideas?

989
01:02:35,251 --> 01:02:37,003
Why is she talking to herself?

990
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,505
Min-jun got a job offer
from a big company?

991
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:41,340
So is he going to quit his job
as So-min's manager?

992
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,926
How did you know that? I told you
not to shoot it without their consent.

993
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,219
Right. I'm sorry.

994
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,764
But I did something wrong, right?

995
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,141
What did you say
when you asked your girlfriend out?

996
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,477
Before I asked her out using
an instant messenger, I got caught.

997
01:02:54,353 --> 01:02:56,272
I like you!

998
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:57,732
Let's start over then.

999
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,358
A date? Okay. Let's begin.

1000
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:01,736
Why are you all dressed up like that?

1001
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,738
You look better
when you're not dressed up.

1002
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,114
You're staring at the wall.

1003
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,617
Can I kiss you? Just a kiss.

1004
01:03:07,950 --> 01:03:08,951
You're impressive.

1005
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:10,244
Why are you blushing?

1006
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,459
Will you try to confess your feelings?

1007
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:19,462
Will you go a little faster or slower?

1008
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:22,089
So do I really have to ask you out?

1009
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,300
