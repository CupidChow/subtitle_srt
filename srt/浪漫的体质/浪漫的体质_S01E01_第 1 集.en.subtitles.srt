1
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,177
I thought I'd never be able to walk
on this road with you again.

2
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,263
But we're walking together like this.

3
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,143
I believe that we are meant
to get back together again,

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:05,148
and we could take courage
to start things over during that time.

5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,400
During my time of ignorance,

6
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:10,070
I lost a lot of things.

7
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,450
But they are only physical things.

8
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,172
All I had

9
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:32,300
was my love for you.

10
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,887
There was no light in my life.

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,100
All I need is your love.

12
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,064
That's the only truth
that I learned from my time of ignorance

13
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,441
I've gone through.

14
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,404
Even if your life is full of dark clouds,

15
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,574
I will still love you.

16
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,952
Is it possible to love dark clouds?

17
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:01,037
-How dark are they?
-There's no sun.

18
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,081
And there won't be?

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,918
No, it will continuously be dark.
The whole time.

20
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,837
Lack of sun is a cause for depression.

21
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,213
Your immune system gets weak

22
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,840
and you pass out from vitamin deficiency.

23
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:12,757
Exactly.

24
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,760
Taking antidepressants and vitamins
would work only for a year or two.

25
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,929
Don't you think the power of love
would make things better?

26
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,097
Human beings are weak.

27
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,516
The power of their love
would be just as weak.

28
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,559
Right?

29
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,354
Don't you think
their love will end in disaster?

30
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:37,198
So this is a sad ending
with time-limited love.

31
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,117
Why would you ruin a beautiful love story

32
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,327
with an unnecessary after-story?

33
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,497
He's right. That's why
every drama has an ending.

34
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,041
It's only beautiful up to this point.

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,295
But do you think it's a happy ending
just because it ends with "I love you"?

36
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,088
Even if it ends with "Let's break up,"

37
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,257
it could still be a happy ending

38
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,134
because they wouldn't
have to see the ugly end.

39
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,427
Isn't it a kind of happy ending?

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,803
Don't be too pessimistic.

41
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,013
No matter what reality is like,

42
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,932
things should end with "I love you"
in a drama. It sounds more beautiful.

43
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,642
Then why don't we do it all at once?

44
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,477
-Good.
-I love you.

45
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,604
-I love you.
-I love you.

46
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,522
I love you.

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,860
Just once? Now that we're at it,
we should do it a few more times.

48
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,195
-I love you.
-I love you.

49
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,238
-I love you.
-I love you.

50
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,281
-I love you.
-I love you.

51
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,824
-I love you.
-I love you.

52
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,326
-I love you.
-I love you.

53
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,952
-I love you.
-I love you.

54
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,746
-I love you.
-I love you.

55
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,039
-I love you.
-I love you.

56
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,957
-I love you.
-I love you.

57
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,667
-I love you.
-I love you.

58
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,294
-I love you.
-I love you.

59
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,087
-I love you.
-I love you.

60
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,380
-I love you.
-I love you.

61
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,465
-I love you.
-Love, love...

62
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,300
-I love you.
-Love, my foot.

63
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:41,054
All right. I like dramas
that are all about love.

64
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,931
Because I won't fall in love for real.

65
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,684
Saying you won't fall in love
means you want to be in love.

66
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,186
It's just what you say

67
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,855
after ending a long haul
of your tiring relationship.

68
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,773
But the resolution

69
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,025
has no power.

70
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,277
That's what schoolchildren
of these days say. "I won't love."

71
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,530
Still, Jin-joo had some meaningful time
after her breakup.

72
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,283
She worked hard on her writing
after she broke up.

73
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:08,998
Let's break up.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,961
-Why?
-Because I hate you.

75
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,837
I'm asking why you hate me.

76
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,673
Can you tell me more details?

77
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,384
Why would I elaborate on
the reasons I hate you?

78
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,512
Why would I look into things
that I don't even want to see?

79
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,305
Don't be so clingy.

80
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,975
Let's just be cool
and end things here. Okay?

81
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,938
What? Cool?

82
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,357
Be cool?

83
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:38,695
What made him upset was
the word "cool", not "clingy."

84
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,822
I even hated that about him.

85
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,954
I broke up with him
because I hated everything.

86
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,124
I really hated everything about him.

87
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,929
You got drunk and called me first.

88
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:08,808
I wasn't even interested in you,
but I happened to be drunk at the moment.

89
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,101
Hey,

90
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,270
you're the one who wanted
to go to the motel first.

91
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:14,272
What?

92
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:15,940
Are you kidding me?

93
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:19,068
I was just walking by,
but you suddenly stopped there

94
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,280
and said, "There's a themed motel.
I wonder what the theme is."

95
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,823
Weren't you the one who said that?

96
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,327
I just wanted to figure out
what the theme is.

97
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,622
What the...

98
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,041
Did you just smile?

99
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,335
It's my fault.

100
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,342
You should've said that sooner.

101
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:47,013
Who are you with? I heard a woman's voice.

102
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,932
Don't pretend to be drunk again. Hey!

103
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,394
Damn it.

104
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,939
This crazy nonsense
has become my weekly routine.

105
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,191
I'm never seeing that jerk again.

106
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,360
It's over. It's really over. Totally over.

107
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:04,489
I don't even have any regrets.
I don't have any feelings left.

108
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,492
I don't! I really don't! Damn it!

109
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,332
You want to break up?

110
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,417
How dare you?

111
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,463
What do you think you are?
How dare you want to break up with me?

112
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,424
How dare you say
something like that to me?

113
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,179
For days, a dozen times a day,

114
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,016
I wondered
if my text message would bother you

115
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,727
or if you'd feel annoyed to eat with me.

116
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,106
That's how I felt about the guy
I dated for seven years.

117
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,943
Even now,

118
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,071
you only talk about yourself.

119
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,411
Two nights ago,

120
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,040
my friend saw you...

121
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,002
at a motel.

122
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,804
Well, I was feeling okay.

123
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,231
You cried day and night for three days.

124
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:23,484
After crying day and night for three days,
she was fine for a couple of days.

125
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,153
Then she cried again
for another three days.

126
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,114
I did? Didn't I cry watching a drama?

127
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,324
The Reply series was on.

128
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,870
Was the drama sad enough to make you cry
for five days after two episodes a week?

129
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,204
I watched the reruns every day.

130
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,416
When a woman's tears stop,
a man's tears of blood begin.

131
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,126
You won.

132
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,963
Who wins or loses is not worth discussing.
I was too young back then.

133
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,507
We all end up meeting good friends

134
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,718
after going through all that.

135
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:04,442
It's strange, isn't it?

136
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,360
I didn't even care about it before.

137
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,780
I mean, it was too far
from things I was interested in.

138
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,949
But, surprisingly, at the speed of light,

139
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,827
it came into my mind and whispered to me.

140
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,038
You've been fooled too, right?

141
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,791
It's not that you're
heartbroken over a breakup.

142
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,336
It's love that breaks your heart.

143
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,964
You begin to get hurt
the second you fall in love.

144
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,717
And it subsides as you break up.

145
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,429
You fiddle with the scab on your wound.

146
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,932
And once the scab comes off,

147
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,100
you just feel empty, and that's it.

148
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,978
I didn't feel hurt when fell in love

149
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,396
and got wounded at first.

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,981
That's why you were fooled.

151
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:47,568
Love? Is it something you can see?

152
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,945
Do you think it's everlasting?

153
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,738
I guess it's not.

154
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,949
Trust what you can see.

155
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,784
Believe what lasts forever.

156
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,995
Love? It's just a fraud.

157
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,206
Don't let the illusion fool you.

158
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,792
And just take me.

159
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,091
Did you break up
with your boyfriend recently?

160
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,887
It has been over a year.
Can I say it's recent?

161
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,516
Did you stop dating
and focus on your writing?

162
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,813
-Can you read fortune?
-I just read writings. It says everything.

163
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,857
-You got dumped.
-Not really.

164
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,193
-And you're completely over him.
-You're right about that.

165
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,945
How did you get over him?

166
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,948
I had something I wanted to achieve.

167
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,829
Something to achieve?

168
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,747
I had to find out

169
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,959
if what that bag whispered to me
back then was true.

170
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,211
I decided to find out if it was true.

171
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,260
Please transfer it to my checking account.

172
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,644
-If you close the installment--
-I am aware of the terms.

173
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:07,023
It's not that much anyway.
I don't care about the interest.

174
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,818
I was so determined

175
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,862
that I even committed theft.

176
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,409
Mom.

177
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,622
You know my coin bank
that I've filled up with 500 won coins?

178
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,373
My entire fortune
that I've saved up for life.

179
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,959
The little rascal
isn't lying where it used to lay

180
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,587
and has hidden itself from my presence,
nowhere to be found.

181
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,381
Could it be

182
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,342
that my older sister
who recently stopped by

183
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,218
has something to do with this?

184
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,846
Forget about it.

185
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,143
That poor thing...

186
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,067
Please transfer it to my checking account.

187
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,194
She's now studying
to become a police officer

188
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,988
to throw people like me in jail.

189
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,542
And everything turned out

190
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,795
to be true.

191
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,765
My new relationship with the bag

192
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,767
made me reflect on myself.

193
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,103
And I began to look back on my dreams too.

194
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,980
I realized how precious they are.

195
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,567
And that my dreams will bring me

196
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,321
to more those great friends

197
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:41,033
who have taught me the real value of life.

198
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,036
So I just focused on my writing.

199
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:46,497
You pass.

200
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:47,706
What?

201
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,921
Your enlightenment isn't
out of touch with your goal.

202
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:59,510
And your goal bears resemblance

203
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,803
to what I'm still trying to reach.

204
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,766
It made me become curious.

205
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,478
I must say your writing
isn't good enough though.

206
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,648
Do not get smart with me.
Make sure to obey me.

207
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,067
There's no way
what you say to me is right.

208
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,236
And your writing will
never be better than mine.

209
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,655
Lower yourself before me. Can you do that?

210
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,158
I will never be compromising your name

211
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,076
the Great Jung Hye-jeong.

212
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:25,536
Good.

213
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,621
You can start working tomorrow.

214
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,834
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I will do my best.

215
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,801
It's Writer Jung Hye-jeong.
I'm Ms. Jung's assistant now?

216
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
The omnidirectional renovation
of my life has begun

217
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,765
by getting over my ex-boyfriend.

218
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,976
It's like clearing off
the deep-rooted evil of my life.

219
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,479
I'm finally on my way to success!

220
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,874
I put in some 500 won coins.
Let's start over.

221
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,545
I swear I will put you in jail someday.

222
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,844
Mother, Father.

223
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,347
The precious drumsticks
are all yours from now on.

224
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:28,974
But we like chicken breast.

225
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,560
-I know you've craved the drumsticks.
-No.

226
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,312
We really like chicken breast.

227
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,106
-Just eat it.
-Okay.

228
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,901
So are you saying

229
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,695
that this writer lady is very famous?

230
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,030
-Yes.
-What did she write?

231
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,951
The Passionate Lion, I'm Dr. Lee Sa-bu,
and Ping-pong King, Kim Je-bbang.

232
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,119
-Do you know those?
-Yes.

233
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,330
-Do you?
-Yes.

234
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,123
I know them too.

235
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,668
You're right, she is famous.

236
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,754
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

237
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:01,674
Cheers.

238
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,306
I'll be respected.

239
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,559
I'll be someone great.

240
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,062
I'll pave my path to success
and have flowers thrown at my feet.

241
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:17,439
And I shall walk on no other path.

242
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,692
I'll walk only on the flowery path!

243
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,906
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

244
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,616
Cheers.

245
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,967
Right, a flowery path is
actually an unpaved road.

246
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,095
I can do this.

247
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,973
I can do it, but I might die on the way.

248
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,741
Okay. I must hold out.

249
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,077
We have the star director
who has never failed his drama.

250
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,706
-He joined JBC at the age of 28.
-I was 26.

251
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:17,499
He debuted as a drama director
at the age of 30.

252
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,751
I was 28.

253
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,085
His first drama exceeded 15 percent

254
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,879
-of the ratings.
-It was 16 percent.

255
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,548
And all his four other dramas
made biggest hits.

256
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,633
A huge hit.

257
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,636
Was there anyone who hit
five consecutive home runs before?

258
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,390
I must say one of them was a two-base hit.

259
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,018
And the Chuseok special was
more like getting to first base on balls.

260
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,062
All right. This is Today's Figure.

261
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,439
For today, we have
Director Son Beom-su of JBC

262
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,650
who has been producing dramas continuously

263
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,444
without failure, ups and downs,
or a hitch.

264
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,528
Welcome.

265
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,784
Is this your first time in our office?

266
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:52,826
Well...

267
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,995
It is, but it doesn't feel that way.

268
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,622
Offices are all the same.

269
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:03,379
What matters is that there's
a scriptwriter who isn't the same.

270
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,717
-Horse bean tea?
-Okay.

271
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,472
Say hello to him.
You know Director Son Beom-su, right?

272
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,849
-Hello.
-Hello.

273
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,602
It's a privilege to work with him.
Try your best.

274
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,522
-It's an honor.
-It's an honor.

275
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,565
-Me too.
-Right.

276
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:27,361
Can I just try my best?
Without having to work myself to death.

277
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,988
Jin-joo, you may get off work.

278
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,280
Okay.

279
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,744
It's nice welfare for employees.
She's leaving already.

280
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,579
I came to work yesterday.

281
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,457
I'm getting off work already. Bye.

282
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,525
-Almost got hurt.
-Me?

283
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,160
Am I hating this guy right now

284
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,495
because that's how
a successful man behaves?

285
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,499
Or is it that I'm just jealous
because I'm not?

286
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,211
You should become successful first.

287
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,589
If you still hate him, you can say
that he's just annoying.

288
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,383
I want to be annoying too.

289
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,011
I'm sick of being bossed around.

290
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,431
Don't you feel nervous
when you're not bossed around?

291
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:39,850
Right. I'm afraid
because I feel nervous about it.

292
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,936
I just walk feebly
after being bossed around all day.

293
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,481
But people tell me not to walk like that

294
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,815
because I might run into a pervert.

295
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,650
-What? Who says that?
-A news report.

296
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,111
Why can't I walk feebly whenever I want to

297
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,113
just because of some pervert?

298
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:54,114
This is crazy.

299
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,992
It's upsetting that I'm not successful,
but do I have to care about perverts?

300
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,621
You're successful.
What are you getting mad for?

301
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,545
I should become rich and hire a chauffeur.

302
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,089
So I won't have to care about how I walk.

303
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,716
Right. Just stay away from nut rage
or yelling at people.

304
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,967
That's all you need to remember.

305
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,386
Han-ju used to be successful though.

306
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,515
-Very successful.
-Right.

307
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,267
A schoolchild is asleep.

308
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,687
Why do you always drink and chat away
in the house when you raise a kid?

309
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,315
What's the use of having a soundproof home

310
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,484
when the noise is coming
from the living room?

311
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,195
I'm sorry. It's our fault.

312
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,080
Sorry. It's not that you were successful.
You still are.

313
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,541
He looks like he'll make big money soon.

314
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,134
Han-ju was smart and popular
back in college.

315
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,261
Even when she didn't try to smile,

316
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,556
she had a lovely and bashful smile.

317
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,849
That wasn't all.

318
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,613
Guys asked her out to play badminton.

319
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,869
They asked her out to have some coffee.

320
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,787
Let me get something for your birthday.

321
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,622
Han-ju, do you like dogs or cats?

322
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,709
Dogs.

323
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,503
-Dogs are the best.
-You know, I raise dogs myself.

324
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,191
They even asked her out
to take a walk around the lake.

325
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,650
And Han-ju has

326
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,111
never rejected them.

327
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,659
But Han-ju was known to be impervious.

328
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,869
Well...

329
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,248
She was so skilled
in refusing someone's love.

330
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,834
How she used soft maneuvers
to dominate over the advances made at her

331
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,253
resembled the graceful movements
of Wu Tang tai chi chuan.

332
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,095
Han-ju liked to study.

333
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,680
And she preferred her female friends.

334
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,563
But one day...

335
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,484
Days like this always come
without forewarning.

336
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,118
What do you like?

337
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:50,958
What do you mean?

338
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,626
What is it that you like?

339
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,171
Who are you?

340
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,176
NO SEUNG-HYO

341
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,053
I wonder what you like.

342
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,097
I mean, what kind of man you like.

343
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,848
I'll leave once you tell me that.

344
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,560
A man who doesn't do things like this.

345
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,448
I kept thinking of a way not to do this,

346
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,242
but I couldn't think of any.

347
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,872
A funny guy.

348
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,051
THE FUNNY, THE HANDSOME, THE WEIRD

349
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,637
I've joined a comedy troupe.

350
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:46,847
Come watch it.

351
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,100
I don't play in it yet,

352
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:51,601
but come watch anyway.

353
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:00,861
Why did you not come?

354
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,365
I didn't think it'd be funny.

355
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,659
THE FUNNY, THE HANDSOME, THE WEIRD

356
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,495
I'm starring this time,
so make sure to come.

357
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,080
Wait.

358
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,126
You're being too unilateral,
so I feel offended...

359
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,467
Well... Maybe not offended,

360
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,677
but I feel uncomfortable.

361
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,847
Don't you study?

362
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,057
What's your major?

363
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,226
I don't go to this college.
I'm not good at studying.

364
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,063
Then how did you...

365
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,523
I just saw you on the street
and followed you here.

366
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,365
Hey. Give me that brat's number.

367
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,825
He's a pervert.

368
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,911
I don't have his number.

369
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,412
He just left like that.

370
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,207
I can't let this happen.
We should call the police.

371
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,336
No, he stopped coming
after I said I didn't like it.

372
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,839
That pervert might be watching you
from somewhere even now.

373
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,260
I don't think he's that kind of guy.

374
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,641
What? What is going on?

375
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,727
Are you actually curious about that jerk?

376
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:18,647
That's not true.

377
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,150
My gosh.

378
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,321
Why? What?

379
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,991
We would carry around a backpack
back in school, right?

380
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,203
But the important thing is
that you always had

381
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,913
a recorder in your bag like this.

382
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,041
You always had it stick out
of your bag like this, right?

383
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,417
I'm sure you did.

384
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:42,629
And that's not all.
If you take out the recorder,

385
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,299
-your spit came out of it like this.
-My gosh!

386
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,304
-Some kids even fell down.
-Right. It happened. I did see them.

387
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,306
-There's more.
-When you're walking...

388
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,475
-Your shoelaces are undone.
-Me?

389
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,854
-It did happen.
-Did this happen or not?

390
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,440
-This definitely happened to you.
-What is this? What's going on?

391
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:03,692
The shoe bag.

392
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:09,322
-Did you ever do this or not?
-I'm sure you did this.

393
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,907
All right. On our way home.

394
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:14,619
Hey, do a fall.
Fall down like you just did, I said!

395
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,749
Does this look funny to you?

396
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,627
-Tae-hun, show him.
-That doesn't make sense.

397
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,920
Take out the recorder.

398
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,506
-My gosh!
-Was that so hard for you to do?

399
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,136
-Darn it.
-You're still not getting it.

400
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,764
Do you get scolded like that
when you don't do things right?

401
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,226
-I wasn't scolded.
-You weren't?

402
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,478
They were asking me for advice.

403
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,983
I guess they yell at you
when they ask for advice.

404
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,444
So what was troubling them?

405
00:24:48,486 --> 00:24:51,198
Some guy with no experience in acting
suddenly showed up

406
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,242
and begged them to join their troupe.

407
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,952
So they gave him a part,

408
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,954
but he turned out to be a bad actor.

409
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,665
And the bad actor is...

410
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,792
Yes, it's me.

411
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:11,509
Did you always want to be a comedian?

412
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,510
Of course not.

413
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,054
Why would I do such a thing?

414
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,098
I don't want to give them stupid advice.

415
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,394
What I wanted to do was
travel around the world

416
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,523
and go back to the place
I hate the most and die.

417
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,901
To the place you hate,
not the one you like?

418
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,403
Because I want to keep my good memories
about the place I like.

419
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,658
I think I'll be happy to die
in a place that I'm not fond of.

420
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,701
But

421
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,496
a woman I've fallen for says

422
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,581
she likes funny guys.

423
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,251
Now I want to die while making her laugh.

424
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,420
Isn't it true?

425
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,215
Then I'll quit it immediately.

426
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,008
It is true.

427
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,427
Then I'll do my best.

428
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,680
Hey.

429
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,808
Yes?

430
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,351
Go ahead

431
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:03,812
and try to make me laugh.

432
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,983
He didn't even ask, "Here?"

433
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,819
The guy began to make her laugh like that,

434
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,821
and Han-ju laughed all night long.

435
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,248
It's not like
she just laugh all night long.

436
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:25,917
That night,

437
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,171
the two people found out

438
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,466
condoms are only 85 percent effective
for birth control.

439
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,845
But they decided not to think
that they're victims of the 15 percent.

440
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:40,515
They ended up giving birth to a child
next year and getting married.

441
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,560
And they even got divorced.

442
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:48,148
He lacked everything,
but he confidently asked for a divorce.

443
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,693
You want to get divorced to be happy?

444
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,320
Yes.

445
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,324
Come to think of it,
I drink and smoke too much.

446
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:58,867
So I won't live for that long.

447
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,494
This isn't the life I wanted.

448
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,372
Why don't you quit smoking and drinking

449
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,916
and try to live a bit longer?

450
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,127
I don't want to live long in hell.

451
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,297
I can say I'm already in hell,

452
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,842
but I still need to live on
now that I'm in this world.

453
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,763
I want to be happy to some degree.

454
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,183
Then...

455
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,519
what about my happiness?

456
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,606
Han-ju.

457
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,234
Why are you asking me

458
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,445
about your happiness?

459
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,410
Hey!

460
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:52,921
Hey!

461
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,593
Hey, you bastard!

462
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,929
Hey!

463
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:06,726
Eun-jeong wanted to give up her life
to catch him and kill him.

464
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:10,647
But men like him are really fast
so they don't get caught.

465
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,072
I run for two hours every day.

466
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,825
I'm bad at fighting,
so I should always be ready

467
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,451
to run away.

468
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,751
Hello.

469
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,504
I have different-sized flat feet.

470
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,714
So I can't wear just any sneakers.

471
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,176
So I'm picky when it comes to sneakers.
But when I put these on...

472
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,596
Before long, his lame skit became popular

473
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,350
going along the current trends,
and he even got on TV commercials.

474
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,394
It's not like he even tried hard.

475
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:51,855
He was born lame to begin with.

476
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,692
She was just left alone
with the pain of childrearing.

477
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,945
And hardships of life.

478
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,629
This is aggressively bad.

479
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:21,718
Grow up quickly and drink
beer with me, No In-guk.

480
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,137
He's not No In-guk. He's Hwang In-guk.

481
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,724
I changed his last name to mine.
We didn't register our marriage.

482
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:28,975
Right?

483
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,936
You're right. That's good.

484
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:34,272
No In-guk doesn't sound right.

485
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,232
It means "country for old men." Right?

486
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:41,321
My son, Hwang In-guk.
I'm sorry for the confusion.

487
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,448
I'll take better care of you.

488
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:48,244
Look at you.
This is one happy family, isn't it?

489
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:49,662
Of course we're happy.

490
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,749
How can I not be happy when I have him?

491
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,587
Stop smiling when things are tough.
You should swear and curse at him.

492
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,382
I'm too busy for that.
I should make money to buy milk.

493
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,305
I guess I should transfer
to a correspondence college

494
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,225
and start working.
Is there any job opening?

495
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,519
What? What did you say? In-guk.

496
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,650
I'm not late. I'm really not.

497
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:23,154
Nice meeting you. Good morning.

498
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,447
I'm not late.

499
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,702
Come right on time.
Don't even be close to being late.

500
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,870
I am aware of that.

501
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,706
Don't show that you have a kid.
Don't even reek of a baby.

502
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,707
Yes, ma'am.

503
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:37,335
Take the prop for the PPL
and go to the scene immediately.

504
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,545
By myself?

505
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,382
Go ahead first. You know how it's done.

506
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,675
Yes, I am aware.

507
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,391
It's a cut.

508
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,443
You son of a bitch!

509
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:46,279
You're no better than barley sprouts
in midsummer.

510
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,489
You damn idiot.

511
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,623
I told you to get rid of it.
I threw it away earlier, right?

512
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,499
That's what I remember.

513
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,627
Gosh, I'm so proud that you remember it.

514
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,504
Well, we have to put in
this product placement,

515
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,341
but you didn't do it last time.
And this is our final scene.

516
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:08,134
Yes, you're right.

517
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,846
I guess while the main character
was blasting off his guns like this,

518
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,640
he somehow had time for jelly snacks.

519
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,225
According to what my boss said,

520
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:20,521
a worker who used to work here
could have dropped it when he had some.

521
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,358
That could be
a reasonable scene-setting...

522
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,527
So an employee from a planing mill
dropped a jelly snack while working.

523
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,822
And it happened to be placed
gently and neatly on the spot

524
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:33,117
where the main character would die,
years after he quit the job.

525
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,328
-Is that it?
-Yes, that's true.

526
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,121
True? You fucking bitch!

527
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,583
You fucking twat. God damn it!
Hold that bitch down.

528
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,628
Why don't we change the title
to Jellypo? Why the fuck not?

529
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:48,132
Sir, I'm sorry to interrupt you
while you're swearing.

530
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,635
But I keep getting calls
that say my kid is sick.

531
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,929
And my boss isn't coming.

532
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:56,557
So I'm afraid I have to

533
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,018
go home right now.

534
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,148
You fucking bitch!

535
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,734
You're one selfish bitch, you know that?

536
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:10,405
So your kid is sick? I'm fucking sick too.

537
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,991
I'm so going to kill you
and eat this fucking jelly snack

538
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,284
as I condemn myself to hell.

539
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,511
In-guk.

540
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,638
In-guk.

541
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,727
What took you so long?

542
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,186
He had a terrible fever.

543
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,730
It just broke after he got an injection.

544
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,441
Thank you. Thank you so much.

545
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,192
Thank you.

546
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:04,959
Speaking of which, when did you
decide to become a comedian?

547
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,673
It was when I met her.

548
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:13,176
What? What are you talking about?

549
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,304
-It's so romantic.
-She said she liked funny guys,

550
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,639
so I joined a comedy troupe right away.

551
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,309
Really?

552
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,227
It just doesn't make sense.

553
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,645
It sounds like a lie.

554
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,607
You just joined
a comedy troupe just because

555
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,276
a woman you loved said
she liked funny guys?

556
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,028
That's ridiculous.

557
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,614
It's true. I just went there right away.

558
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,116
I asked them to teach me some skills
so I can make her laugh.

559
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,160
I remember this clearly.

560
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,371
Some handsome guy just showed up

561
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,415
begged us to take him in with tears.

562
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,666
He begged us on his knees.

563
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,627
That's how he came up
with his catchphrase.

564
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,587
Right. I think I heard it before.

565
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:53,591
I admit that he's a romanticist.

566
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,221
What about you two?
When you first saw him,

567
00:34:58,304 --> 00:34:59,806
did you think he'd be successful?

568
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,433
I can't say I was sure about that.

569
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:06,437
Actually there are
various types of comedians.

570
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,438
Like this guy right here.

571
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,566
Seo Dong-hun and guys like him
are the "Inspiration "type.

572
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,485
And then you got
your "Perspiration" type...

573
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,571
I should've killed that jerk back then.

574
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,448
Then you wouldn't have
been able to meet me.

575
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,413
I guess you're right.

576
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:06,998
I'm sorry.

577
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,763
Eun-jeong has loved documentaries
since she was little.

578
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,099
And her dream has never changed even once.

579
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:28,519
She got to join
a famous documentary production company.

580
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,282
Her superiors deemed
violence to be their religion.

581
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:45,203
And the company didn't even know
about employment laws.

582
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,121
Eun-jeong.

583
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,708
Isn't it hard to do your research all day?

584
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,629
If so, you should go
make some coffee for us.

585
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,756
Staying in your seat will
only make your buttocks bigger.

586
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,174
Right? Go!

587
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,310
Coffee mix will do.

588
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,195
You idiot.

589
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,405
I just told you to edit it by order.

590
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,909
How dare you cut scenes off?
What do you think you are?

591
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,369
You arrogant idiot!

592
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,205
Was it something hard to do?

593
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,917
Why can't you do something
everyone else can?

594
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,878
Why did I hire you in the first place?

595
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,588
You're driving me crazy.

596
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,465
It was really tough...

597
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,509
But I'll put up with it.

598
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:45,429
You jerks are just mere employees.

599
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,975
And all you can do is
shit with your mouth.

600
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:52,561
-That's how pathetic you are.
-She held out thinking that way.

601
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,482
Damn it. I can't believe this.

602
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:57,817
Why did I hire that bitch?

603
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,325
Company dinner, tonight.

604
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,248
I have plans tonight.

605
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,216
Actually I was joking.

606
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,593
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,642
Good work, guys. Cheers.

608
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,561
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

609
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,105
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Thank you.

610
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,440
-Good work.
-Well done.

611
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,652
What's that brat doing?

612
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,613
Why aren't you drinking?

613
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:46,866
To stay healthy.

614
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,409
I want to live a long life,

615
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,244
or something like that.

616
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,204
Are you crazy?

617
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,748
That's it.

618
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,334
You don't have to drink then.

619
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,753
Just drive me home later.
How's that sound?

620
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,590
See? I knew she'd like it.

621
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,717
Gosh, I had no idea.

622
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,095
This is what I respect about you.

623
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,847
Those who last win.

624
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,599
She held out thinking that way.

625
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,184
But...

626
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,234
-Eun-jeong.
-Yes, we're here.

627
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:34,663
-Why don't you...
-Yes?

628
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,584
call me sweetheart?

629
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,928
What did you say, you son of a bitch?

630
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:50,846
What?

631
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,723
What are you doing?

632
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,483
Hey, Eun-jeong.

633
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,486
Hey. What are you doing?

634
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,114
Eun-jeong. Wait.

635
00:40:18,457 --> 00:40:21,961
This place is surrounded by offices,
so people are very nice.

636
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,004
And it's far from the roadside,
so it's quiet.

637
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,548
How much is the rent?

638
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,509
It's 4.5 million won a month
with a deposit of 20 million won.

639
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,222
-Liar.
-Pardon?

640
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,314
This one is a lot cheaper
than other places in the neighborhood.

641
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,524
And it has no flaw.

642
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,151
How much is it?

643
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,986
It's 1.5 million won
with a deposit of 10 million.

644
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:50,865
Liar.

645
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,909
You want an office.
You can't say it's expensive.

646
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,787
Just tell me the price you want.

647
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,541
I will make my own documentary.

648
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,168
Lee Eun-jeong will become successful.

649
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,087
My beginnings will seem humble,

650
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,589
so prosperous will my future--

651
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:09,425
So trifling will your future be.

652
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,929
This office will be gone too.

653
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,600
Han-ju, do you agree with her?

654
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,645
No. I'm a little worried though.

655
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:23,564
Good luck.

656
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,278
It's an open bathroom. Chinese-style.

657
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,989
You know there are open bathrooms
like this in China, right?

658
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,785
It still has a ceiling. That's good.

659
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,247
My gosh.

660
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,751
Have you tried pooping
with an umbrella on a rainy day?

661
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,837
I have.

662
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,380
Sounds lovely.

663
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,802
Interviewing pro-Japanese people?

664
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,016
It sounds interesting.

665
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:01,602
Right. That's what they say at first.

666
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,146
But they end up
splashing water on your face

667
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,898
or overturning a table.

668
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,026
"Interview pro-Japanese
and their descendants,

669
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,653
talk about the traces of their past,

670
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,488
and track how they've
accumulated their fortunes"?

671
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,490
I like it.

672
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,326
Hong-dae, you're a high school graduate.

673
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:20,496
You wouldn't have been able to run a cafe
like this without your family's support.

674
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,123
I'm just assuming with prejudice.

675
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,084
Just tell me if it's not true--

676
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:26,335
It's true.

677
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,337
That's how

678
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,673
my family accumulated the fortune.

679
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,508
But not this cafe.

680
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:36,762
I dropped out of high school, moved out,
and passed a GED myself.

681
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,890
I started my business from scratch
at Dongdaemun to have come this far.

682
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,017
I'm serious.

683
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:44,603
It's true.

684
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,606
Well, it's true
that I moved out of the house

685
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:50,025
because I hated my parents' personality.

686
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,443
Anyway,

687
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,905
I'll give my full cooperation
as a descendant of the pro-Japanese.

688
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,449
I guess I can help you with many things.

689
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,538
Now that something unexpected happens,

690
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,498
I don't even know how to react.

691
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,916
I think you're cool, Eun-jeong.

692
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,420
I'm not really interested
in social problems,

693
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,548
but I do know people like you are
really cool. I'll help you.

694
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,174
But

695
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,094
Since I'm a businessman,
I do have one condition.

696
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,722
I'm listening.

697
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,348
This documentary of yours.

698
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,642
Please let me invest in it.

699
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,106
Do you want to invest in this project
which will obviously fail?

700
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,151
Do you even know
the definition of "investment"?

701
00:43:32,234 --> 00:43:34,194
Of course I do. That's how I make money.

702
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,323
If you do, why would you want
to invest in something risky?

703
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,535
Well... Let's just say that I want

704
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,954
a taste of being cool, too.

705
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,922
Say hello to him. This is my uncle.

706
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,925
He's the only family member I talk to.

707
00:43:58,093 --> 00:43:59,720
He's totally pro-Japanese.

708
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:07,936
Hello.

709
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:11,190
We printed out a list of questions.
Please take a look at this.

710
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,150
THE PRO-JAPANESE,
THEIR LIVES AFTER INDEPENDENCE?

711
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:15,903
My family is pro-Japanese,

712
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:18,322
but his family is a lot worse.

713
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,282
The descendants
of the Five Eulsa Traitors.

714
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,745
-Well... Hong-dae.
-Yes?

715
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,555
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

716
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,477
Why are you limping?

717
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,062
Well...

718
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,815
They threw things
that could have killed me.

719
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,817
I sprained my ankle trying to avoid them.

720
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,610
But I'm okay.

721
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,321
I'm fine.

722
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:10,082
They say no. Let's go.

723
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,917
Get lost!

724
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,298
-They're over there.
-Hey! Stop right there!

725
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,466
Stop right there!

726
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,848
I brought together
the descendants of the pro-Japanese.

727
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,977
There are my friends, the friends
of my friends, and even cousins of them.

728
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:31,728
Hey.

729
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,022
-Did you quit it?
-What?

730
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:35,816
Make sure to quit.

731
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,903
Once you get to know them,
they aren't that bad.

732
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:43,407
They're just a little rude and reckless.

733
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,159
They are smart though.

734
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:48,287
You can't do something bad
when you're not smart.

735
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,707
Say hello to them.

736
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,712
Hello. I'm Director Lee Eun-jeong.

737
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:17,816
Why are you staring at me?

738
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,359
I was just thinking

739
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:26,116
about giving you more shares
in the documentary.

740
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,494
Why are you so excited
about giving me more shares?

741
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,204
Money is always exciting.

742
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,165
You're right.

743
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,416
But there's

744
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,710
one thing that's more exciting than money.

745
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:39,796
What is it?

746
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,508
There's just something.

747
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,303
Let's do this right.

748
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:51,934
Do you think it'll go well?

749
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:00,317
What is there to think about?

750
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,903
If it's sold out, we can just get a ticket
for the next show.

751
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,948
Eun-jeong's documentary
made with 100 million won

752
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,116
drew three million audiences.

753
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,869
And she literally became a billionaire.

754
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,162
What is going on?

755
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,793
Eun-jeong, let's go.
There's too much dust in here.

756
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,753
You don't deserve such lowly things.

757
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,381
All right.

758
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,467
Gosh, Eun-jeong. Wait.

759
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,303
Hey, get rid of this
dangerous thing right away.

760
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,098
How rude of that thing it is
to block our Eun-jeong's way.

761
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,309
I don't want popcorn to get stuck
on your precious soles.

762
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,228
They are just puffed corn.

763
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,854
Be careful.

764
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:52,244
Eun-jeong said
she realized for the first time

765
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,829
that the value of wealth and fame

766
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:56,748
stands way below the value of love.

767
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,127
She said what's more exciting
than money is love.

768
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:23,483
I know. I've seen movies and dramas,
so I know what you're doing.

769
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,695
Fortunately, I know
you were headed for the bed.

770
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,322
But your brother is here.

771
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,657
You can make it X-rated when you're alone,

772
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,035
but it will definitely be PG-13
when I'm around.

773
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,045
Let's not make this complicated.

774
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,397
I did it a few times
while you were asleep.

775
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,525
-You kissed me?
-Yes.

776
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,987
-While I was asleep with my mouth open?
-That's why I did it.

777
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,281
I thought I had a racy dream.

778
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:13,992
You did?

779
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,119
Tell me more about this dream.

780
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,497
I'll show you.

781
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,584
Is there a limit

782
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,961
to your heart for someone?

783
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,030
Do you want my hair?

784
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,616
No, it's okay.

785
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:57,703
Why not? I have a lot of hair.

786
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,498
There's something I didn't tell you.

787
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,166
Okay.

788
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:06,503
Your hair is kind of crunchy.

789
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,970
But it's okay. You have a pretty face.

790
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:22,477
You're pretty too.

791
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,063
So it's okay.

792
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,403
Gosh, you're so pretty.

793
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,240
I know.

794
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:48,295
It's salty.

795
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,219
It is.

796
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,141
Here. Try this.

797
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,061
Eun-jeong was always tougher than anyone.

798
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:10,025
Everyone was thankful that
Eun-jeong was holding out pretty well.

799
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:12,486
She did seem to be struggling,

800
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,321
but she also smiled every once in a while.

801
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,083
We thought she got better.

802
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,828
Eun-jeong. Eun-jeong!

803
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,274
I'm sorry.

804
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,280
I'm sorry.

805
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,216
Please help these children.

806
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,260
They are waiting for your donation.

807
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:04,222
Call 1477-1004.

808
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:12,439
PLEASE HELP THESE CHILDREN
THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOUR DONATION

809
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,778
No.

810
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,364
She did smile.

811
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,533
But the problem is

812
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,287
that she smiled at something
that wasn't supposed to be funny.

813
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,206
I should go to work though.

814
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,877
Yes.

815
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,683
Go ahead and sleep.

816
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,811
I'm hungry, so I'm cooking some noodles.
Do you want some?

817
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,730
No.

818
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:03,949
Gosh.

819
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,414
-In-guk.
-Auntie Eun-jeong.

820
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,636
I'm spending my vacation here.

821
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,974
In-guk, you're too heavy to do that.

822
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,266
Come on down.

823
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,579
Come here, In-guk.

824
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:54,624
Gosh, what was that?

825
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,045
Come here!

826
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,348
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

827
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:27,532
On the pretext
of taking care of Eun-jeong,

828
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:31,661
the three women and two men
started living together like this.

829
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,726
I know what you guys are up to.

830
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,895
The true purpose of us living together.

831
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,565
To reduce your rent,
to share your childrearing work,

832
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,108
and to share your domestic chores.

833
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,986
In-guk, I told you not to jump at night.

834
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,446
Go wash up now.

835
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,957
I'm right.

836
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:21,419
-It's true.
-Whatever the reason was,

837
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,922
we all were satisfied
with the idea of living together.

838
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,424
Eun-jeong got better over time,

839
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:28,384
and we realized the value

840
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,012
of having ordinary times with no trouble.

841
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:34,808
But there was a little problem.

842
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,356
We've been there before, right?

843
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,861
Why do I feel like I have?

844
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,407
You might have gone there.
I wasn't there though.

845
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,076
I see.

846
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,621
What's wrong with your memory?

847
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,832
You went there with me
saying you were nervous

848
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,500
the day before your movie was released.

849
00:57:02,418 --> 00:57:05,171
You could've just said that.

850
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,923
Why would you test me?

851
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:10,176
We just got used to it
without making a big deal about it.

852
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,013
Everything was the same
as before except that.

853
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,765
And there was no problem.

854
00:57:15,849 --> 00:57:18,143
Whatever. I love you.

855
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:21,896
To be more exact,
we didn't have the guts to deal with it.

856
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,859
A small change at the point that was
believed to be the maximum stability

857
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,236
was really frightening to these people

858
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,822
with this hopeless experience

859
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,615
where they almost lost their loved one.

860
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,330
So is this what life is all about?

861
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,417
With some happy memories,

862
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,670
we just put up with hard times of life.

863
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:50,216
I may sound a little pessimistic,
but it's too harsh.

864
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,053
It's harsh.

865
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,639
I can't deny it.

866
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,434
But I'm just happy that I'm making

867
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,144
some good memories now.

868
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,230
Chatting with you guys like this.

869
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,149
It makes me happy enough.

870
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:12,822
We're only 30.

871
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,200
Let's not be so sentimental
looking back upon the past.

872
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,453
I'm tired. I'll do that once I turn 40.

873
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,289
It's okay to do that.

874
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,791
I don't have to look back on the past.

875
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,377
And I don't have to worry
about the future.

876
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,297
Let us

877
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:31,633
just focus on the immediate crisis.

878
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,761
What kind of crisis?

879
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,930
Like me wanting to eat noodles.

880
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,474
My gosh. I won't.

881
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,268
-I'm not eating.
-Are you serious?

882
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:44,145
How could you say that?

883
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,064
You're not supposed to say that
at this hour.

884
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:50,318
Go to your room if you can't hold out.

885
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,239
Make three servings.

886
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:55,990
Do we have rice?

887
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,618
-We have some cold rice.
-Damn it.

888
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:03,414
We have rice here.

889
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,208
-Shall we eat rice?
-Yes.

890
00:59:05,291 --> 00:59:07,669
Take out some kimchi.

891
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:40,785
Waiting for the day when instant noodles
that are healthier at night are invented,

892
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,245
-we just
-Enjoy.

893
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:44,581
-wish to live a happy life
-Dig in.

894
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:47,834
where we feel excited from time to time

895
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:50,253
and sometimes feel threatened
going through crisis.

896
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,631
One ordinary night,

897
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,637
these thoughts come to mind
while we're having some noodles.

898
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:06,185
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN 30

899
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:09,606
SPECIAL THANKS
TO LEE HA-NUI AND JIN SEON-KYU

900
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,609
EVEN IF YOUR LIFE IS FULL OF DARK CLOUDS,
I WILL STILL LOVE YOU

901
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,655
I LIKE DRAMAS THAT ARE ALL ABOUT LOVE

902
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,367
BECAUSE I WON'T FALL IN LOVE FOR REAL

903
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,580
SAYING YOU WON'T FALL IN LOVE
MEANS YOU WANT TO BE IN LOVE

904
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,750
WHAT ABOUT MY HAPPINESS?

905
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:33,212
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
ABOUT YOUR HAPPINESS?

906
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,548
EUN-JEONG SAID
SHE REALIZED FOR THE FIRST TIME

907
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,051
THAT THE VALUE OF WEALTH AND FAME
STANDS WAY BELOW THE VALUE OF LOVE

908
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:42,013
SHE SAID WHAT'S MORE EXCITING
THAN MONEY IS LOVE

909
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,850
-I held hands with a man.
-I slept with a man.

910
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,560
I donated all my money.

911
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,313
Get out.

912
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,148
You're fired.

913
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:53,399
No, I'm not leaving.

914
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,817
Your life is so full of ups and downs.

915
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:56,819
-I like you.
-Why would you say that when I'm eating?

916
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,571
-I said it when you scooped rice.
-You did?

917
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,531
Then... We're in the cafeteria.

918
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,075
Tell me the truth. Did you do it?

919
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,534
Japchae rice.

920
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,411
Go get the jerk who just left.

921
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,538
Once he gets caught,
he'll eat getting beaten up.

922
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:08,956
Do you have malice against me?

923
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,668
Thank you for letting me have fun at work.

924
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:14,087
You're a scriptwriter,
so you must not have a boyfriend.

925
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:15,421
-Why?
-Because you're sensitive.

926
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,382
You're a director,
so you must not have a girlfriend.

927
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,050
-Why?
-Because you're condescending.

928
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,053
