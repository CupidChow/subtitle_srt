1
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,667
AND THE LORD GOD

2
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,295
COMMANDED THE MAN SAYING

3
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,589
OF EVERY TREE OF THE GARDEN

4
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,716
THOU MAYEST FREELY EAT

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,176
BUT OF THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE

6
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,011
OF GOOD AND EVIL,
THOU SHALT NOT EAT OF IT

7
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,721
FOR IN THE DAY THAT THOU EATEST THEREOF

8
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,931
THOU SHALT SURELY DIE

9
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,964
DRAW PATTERN TO UNLOCK

10
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,052
This is awful.

11
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,096
How can you say a script
for a romantic comedy is awful?

12
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,350
How could

13
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,061
she go through her boyfriend's phone
when he's asleep?

14
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,854
That's what's awful about it?

15
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:47,565
Their relationship is doomed.
Everyone will go down.

16
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,610
You're exaggerating it.
This happens often.

17
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,278
This shouldn't be happening often.

18
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,697
What does she want to check on his phone?

19
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,534
If you're dating a shady guy,

20
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,453
his true colors are bound
to come out without your effort.

21
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,997
Don't go around and start digging.

22
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,501
Did I do that?
Why are you taking it out on me?

23
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:09,420
Do you think it's beneficial to find out
someone's unfaithfulness in advance?

24
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,715
Because it's a waste of time to date
someone you shouldn't have dated?

25
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,093
Then, what about losing a guy
because you broke his trust

26
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,720
when he was a keeper?
And there's no shame in that?

27
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,180
I didn't go through his phone.

28
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,475
Don't touch it.

29
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,771
Please put it down. I'm begging you.

30
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,400
Are you copying the main character?

31
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,861
Why are you talking to the wall
all of a sudden?

32
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,406
Why are you so worked up about this?
What's wrong?

33
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,451
You've done it.

34
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,539
You've gone through
your girlfriend's phone before, right?

35
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,128
-Yes, you have.
-What should we eat?

36
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,881
I see how it is.
So you've been around a block or two.

37
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,216
-Do you want to get naengmyeon?
-I want something else.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,260
I need to use the restroom.

39
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,475
This guy knows more about you than I do.

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,813
And this guy also opens up
if I draw a simple pattern on him.

41
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,523
Is it that awful?

42
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,071
He doesn't even need to lock his phone.

43
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,077
How cute.

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,261
-Hwang In-guk!
-What?

45
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,764
If you don't finish your breakfast,
you're not going to school.

46
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,112
Yes.

47
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,991
Today might be the day
a new world opens up to me.

48
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:06,204
Let me start my day
in a more devout and mature attitude.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,752
How do mature women start their day?

50
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,754
Do they brush their teeth first?

51
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,924
I'm on the main road.
Where are you exactly?

52
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,468
You should be able to see me
if you're on the main road.

53
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,846
-Can't you see me?
-I told you to stay in one spot.

54
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,180
What do you see in front of you?

55
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,725
I see buildings.

56
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,019
Tall skyscrapers. A lot of them.

57
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,691
Do you think that counts as a description
of your location in the middle of Gangnam?

58
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,777
What happened? What is it?
Did you get hurt?

59
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,280
-I found it.
-Where are you? Do you see me?

60
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,408
No. I found Han-ju's production company.
I found the building.

61
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,492
Heungmeyubal ENT?

62
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,912
Yes. I found it quicker than you.
Hurry up.

63
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,292
Is this something to be that happy about?

64
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,797
Hello, sir.

65
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:42,592
Gosh, Mr. Son. Sorry for calling you late.

66
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,843
It's all right.

67
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:47,096
I was on a business trip in China.
And I just got back.

68
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,349
I see. You were in China.

69
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,026
I guess you guys didn't come together.

70
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,613
Whatever. I don't know why he's blaming me
for not being able to find this place.

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,949
He said I was bad with directions.
Am I bad with directions?

72
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,827
-I don't know.
-You're bad with directions.

73
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:11,913
I overcame that when I started to drive.

74
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,336
This is just a temporary contract.
Tell me if you need to revise anything.

75
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,254
You don't waste time, do you?

76
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,009
We'll provide you a workroom.

77
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,054
The copyright belongs to the writer.

78
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:31,682
The standard amount set by the association
for your scripts and the signing bonus.

79
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,269
And as for the additional clause about
the expenses for planning and development,

80
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,647
you can take a look
at this optional clause here.

81
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,649
By the way...

82
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,442
Yes?

83
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,610
This is exciting.

84
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:43,861
What is?

85
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,781
We're sitting face to face
with a contract in between us.

86
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,285
It would feel really awesome
once you sign it with your seal.

87
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,829
I'm nervous.

88
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:57,291
-Please take your time, Ms. Lim.
-Okay.

89
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,293
-Coffee?
-Sure.

90
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,104
You still haven't found the place?
Just turn on the GPS.

91
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,900
What?

92
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:25,236
SD?

93
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,239
The big production company wants me?

94
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:34,162
Their writer management is well-organized,
so there are many new screenwriters.

95
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:36,080
Since the company has a lot of influence,

96
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,332
they'll be good at shielding you
from the station, too.

97
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,338
Then, what about Han-ju?
What about Heungmeyubal Entertainment?

98
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,009
A novice writer
and a new production company.

99
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,511
You guys might get the short end
of the stick when things go south.

100
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,056
They haven't produced any dramas yet,

101
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,517
but the CEO of the company
didn't seem like a pushover.

102
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,480
Now it looks like
I'm pushing you to betray your friend.

103
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,442
But this is business.

104
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,446
I doubt that Han-ju
would be offended if SD scouted you.

105
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,948
Probably, right?

106
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,910
Han-ju is my friend.

107
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,246
And since she's my friend...

108
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,749
The CEO of the company called me himself.

109
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:23,252
Well, what happened has already happened.

110
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,796
I'll get you a few days
before the meeting, so think about it.

111
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,340
Okay.

112
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:34,430
Did Jin-joo sign the contract?
Did they assign the time slot for her?

113
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,349
Not yet for both.

114
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,562
By the way,
is Kim Hwan-dong's family well-off?

115
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,439
I don't know. Why do you ask?

116
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,608
Is it that he has nothing to lose?

117
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,403
Is it that he doesn't want to make
his debut or that he's not ambitious?

118
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,782
It's not just any screenwriter.
I, Jung Hye-jeong,

119
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,159
gave him a chance to direct my drama.
Why did he say no?

120
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,494
That's not true.

121
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,372
He's going to be a JBC director, anyway.

122
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,416
It's like a wine tasting.

123
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,294
As long as the wine isn't spoiled,
he'd drink it.

124
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,630
There's no way your wine is spoiled.

125
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,426
Then, did Beom-su not take my wine
because he thinks it's spoiled?

126
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,345
No. Something is wrong with his tongue.

127
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,725
Whenever I talk to you,

128
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,477
it just puts me in a bad mood.

129
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,689
Other people told me the same thing.

130
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,232
Does my breath stink?

131
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,282
Forget it. But why are you here today?

132
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,367
-Me?
-Yes.

133
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:38,995
Because I'm lonely.

134
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,454
Is that why you came here?

135
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:44,166
I feel less lonely
when I see someone lonelier than me.

136
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,586
Are you implying I'm that lonelier person?

137
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,879
-Yes.
-Get out.

138
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,673
-Let's get a glass of wine.
-It doesn't suit you.

139
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:51,591
Right?

140
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,720
There are so many typos here.

141
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,638
-What?
-There are so many typos here.

142
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,266
These stupid assistants.
Let me see. Where are they?

143
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,059
Did you type this yourself?

144
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,853
Did you seriously ask me that?

145
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,397
-Did your assistants type this up?
-I should do something about them.

146
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,858
They are not working at all these days.

147
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,986
How old are your assistants?

148
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,698
That's none of your business.
Mr. Sung, your breath stinks.

149
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,502
Mr. Seo, I like that
you are always consistent.

150
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,715
How am I consistent?

151
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,258
You consistently prove to be lame.

152
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,470
It looks like
you already know that about yourself.

153
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:40,139
But you keep playing that lame-guy angle.

154
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,516
I can sort of feel
your determination to be lame.

155
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,563
"Gosh, he's crying."

156
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,900
This is what I'm talking about.
Did you see that?

157
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,111
How could you think about impersonating
Kim Heung-gook right now?

158
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,615
You're something else.
You're definitely stubborn.

159
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,784
"Gosh, keep drinking."

160
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,788
Do you want a flying carpet or something?

161
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,668
I can't get you a carpet.
Wait there. I'll come to pick you up.

162
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,171
Why did he tell her that he'd pick her up?

163
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,173
What? Did you say something?

164
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,051
What? No, it's nothing.

165
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:19,178
What is it? Are you still bothered?

166
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:22,973
I told you I'm not. Gosh, as if.

167
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,810
What is it? What is this about? Tell me.

168
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:29,647
He's jealous because
Mr. Son and Ms. Lim are getting close.

169
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,273
Seriously?

170
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,443
I get why you're jealous.

171
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,362
You love Beom-su.

172
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,532
Wait, you were jealous of her?

173
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,201
Gosh, I have a lot of competition.

174
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,869
That's nonsense.

175
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,538
I'm going to use the restroom.

176
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,457
Don't ditch us.

177
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,335
Let's talk when he's here. He's here?

178
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,087
Hey, you're here.

179
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,755
We've met once before.

180
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,049
-Yes.
-Right? Take a seat.

181
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,760
It's nice to see you again.

182
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,264
I heard that you like tuna.

183
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,433
This restaurant serves good food. Dig in.

184
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,518
Gosh, that looks great.

185
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,228
Enjoy your food.

186
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,398
Min-jun still has a lot of energy left.

187
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,316
He's an energizer. He never gets tired.

188
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,402
It's nice.

189
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,530
-So you're 30 years old?
-Yes.

190
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,116
He's old enough to set up his own company,

191
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,826
but he's been So-min's manager
for eight years.

192
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,244
Well, that's his main task,

193
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,538
but he also took care of all the hard work
in the agency.

194
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,416
He's more than capable
of setting up his own company.

195
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:34,462
Gosh, you know
So-min can be naughty sometimes.

196
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,589
It must have been hard on you.

197
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,841
No. I'm a pervert,

198
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,384
so I like a girl being naughty.

199
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,430
He's a natural.
He totally belongs in this field.

200
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,765
You'll have to dazzle me
if you want to take him from me.

201
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,435
I definitely see the need
to dazzle you to scout him.

202
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,896
You got it. I'll do more than dazzle you.

203
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,023
Let me pour you a drink. Have a drink.

204
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,984
-Hey, this liquor is really expensive.
-Thank you.

205
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:59,945
That you deserve as you are so valuable.
Have a drink.

206
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,033
So how can you be sure?

207
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,243
I heard it.

208
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,704
You heard it? Heard what?

209
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,123
That Mr. Son likes Ms. Lim?

210
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,666
You bet.

211
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,587
-Something happened between them.
-Like what? What?

212
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,215
What happened?

213
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,426
What is it? What happened? What is it?

214
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,344
What happened?

215
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,847
I can't tell you. He only confided in me.

216
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:27,973
It's a secret.

217
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,352
We can keep it a secret
among ourselves too.

218
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,562
What is it?

219
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,274
Fine.

220
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,239
They...

221
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:44,907
"They"?

222
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,207
Beom-su and Ms. Lim...

223
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,753
So Beom-su...

224
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,214
And Ms. Lim...

225
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,011
Ms. Lim what?

226
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,098
He saw it.

227
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,520
-He saw it.
-Saw what?

228
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,189
What are you talking about?
Come on, be clear.

229
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,568
-He's so frustrating.
-We stayed still all day.

230
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:23,153
-You stayed still?
-Yes, we stayed still,

231
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,699
-And?
-but I looked.

232
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,701
-Look at what? The script?
-What?

233
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:33,747
"Just."

234
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,583
When he said that,

235
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,877
-In his eyes, there was...
-Go on.

236
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,421
-There was...
-He's so frustrating.

237
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:44,383
affection dripping from his eyes.
It was totally obvious.

238
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,180
Goodness.

239
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,224
Give me some, too.

240
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:53,601
-He's perfect.
-What?

241
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,768
He's great, isn't he?

242
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,896
I love him. Let me get this.

243
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,273
-No. Stop it.
-Come on.

244
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,442
-I know you're only pretending.
-Come on.

245
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,861
He's going to work for me.
I'll pay for this.

246
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,614
-How much is it?
-The bill has already been settled.

247
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,698
What?

248
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,873
Let me use the restroom.

249
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,378
Min-jun has a high tolerance for alcohol.

250
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,631
Let's go drink some hard liquor.

251
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,759
What do you say? Can you drink whiskey?

252
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,510
It's on me. Let's go.

253
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,095
Okay. You're buying.

254
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,598
I always treat you. What's wrong with you?

255
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,435
Mr. Sung.

256
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,520
I just wanted to ask something.

257
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,522
If you...

258
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,026
If you approve of me
taking on Ms. Jung's drama,

259
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,278
I'd like to give it a try.

260
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,821
Sure.

261
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:50,240
We have no reason to say no to that.

262
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,410
Go meet with her tomorrow
and talk to her yourself.

263
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,788
Okay. I will.

264
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,710
What is it?

265
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,380
What? It's nothing.

266
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,299
By the way,

267
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,177
don't you want to work with me?

268
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,681
-Like for a drama?
-Yes.

269
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,142
Do you want to get back to the field?
You're good where you are now.

270
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,896
It's just that I miss the field, you know.

271
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,358
This is how I felt
when my reserve training ended.

272
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,653
"Gosh, they won't give me a gun anymore.

273
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,321
I can still fight, though."

274
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,909
-Don't you want to do one with me?
-Later.

275
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,160
Later when?

276
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,913
Later in our next lives.

277
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,084
I'm lonely, you know.

278
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,462
You raise two dogs.

279
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,049
Right, my dogs. I need to feed them.

280
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,426
I'm leaving.

281
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,887
-You got no manners.
-Ma'am.

282
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,223
-How much is it?
-It's 56,000 won.

283
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,767
That's not right.
Did you not count the Coke?

284
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,062
You're right. It's 58,000 won.

285
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,231
You should bill people accurately.

286
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,524
Bye.

287
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,943
-Bye.
-Bye.

288
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,074
I'm lonely.

289
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,139
I took out the trash.

290
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,391
What?

291
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,351
It was my turn today.

292
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,644
I wanted to exercise.

293
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,296
I cleaned the bathroom.

294
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,632
I did it.

295
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,261
I know it was your turn,
but I did it to practice.

296
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,024
I washed him.

297
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,945
What? You washed a grown-up boy?

298
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:35,280
As a hobby.

299
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,284
What's going on? What is it?

300
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:40,494
Tell me the truth.

301
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,083
I unlocked my heart with a pattern.

302
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,252
Now, I'm an open book.

303
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,674
It's locked again. I won't check it out.

304
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,300
-Why not?
-Tomorrow.

305
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,219
I'm so tired right now.

306
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,471
Let's do this tomorrow.
If you need to be sorry,

307
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,348
be sorry one more day until tomorrow.

308
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,460
Red alert.

309
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,549
Ms. Lim might have something else in mind.

Wrap up your day on a good note
with a photo of fried chicken.

313
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,362
It's from a good fried chicken joint
in my area. Let's go there together.

314
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,949
Sure.

315
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,453
How about Friday?

316
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:07,831
Sounds great.

00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,638
I'LL BLEND ORANGES FOR YOU NEXT TIME

321
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:10,102
GOSH, THAT LOOKS DELICIOUS

322
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:12,688
WE GOT A BOX OF YAMS FROM THE DIRECTOR

323
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,415
Let's wrap up here.

324
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,334
-Good work.
-Good work.

325
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,880
I'll take that.

326
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,389
Is this information legit?

327
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,976
Okay. I got it.

328
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,686
JIN-JOO

329
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,314
I'll call you back.

330
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,692
-Hey, Jin-joo.
-Han-ju.

331
00:21:58,775 --> 00:22:00,235
I got a free voucher for a course-meal.

332
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,904
It expires today,
but Eun-jeong has a shoot today.

333
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,198
The two of us should go. Let's go.

334
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,868
Okay, I'm in. Where is the restaurant?

335
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,455
It's near your work.
I'll call you when I get there.

336
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,041
Okay. Hurry.

337
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,459
-Okay.
-Jin-joo.

338
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,587
What were you going to tell me yesterday?

339
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,298
The bus is here. See you later!

340
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,598
Right. I haven't decided yet.

341
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,850
I'm just asking my best friend
for her opinion

342
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,602
since she works in the industry.

343
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,897
She'll understand that a novice writer
ought to consider both options.

344
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,819
CEO LEE SO-JIN

345
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,874
Tell me who made you
put on a face like that.

346
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,211
It's Mr. Son Beom-su.

347
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,880
Why? Is he going to sign
with another production company?

348
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm friends with a producer
who works at SD.

349
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,805
I got a call from the producer.
I'm sorry, ma'am.

350
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,681
You have nothing to apologize for.

351
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,230
Let's have a meal though.
I haven't met him yet.

352
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,065
A simple meal just to get acquainted.

353
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,067
Okay. I'll set up an appointment.

354
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,292
Jin-joo.

355
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,671
You don't need to tell me
what you prepared.

356
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,755
What?

357
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,342
I already know your unlock pattern.

358
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,427
I already saw it.

359
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,932
You're not upset?

360
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,063
To be honest, I should be,
but I can't be upset.

361
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,942
To you, this must be
a really happy offer to think about.

362
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,902
How could I take that away from you?

363
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,948
Goodness, you're such a great friend.

364
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,034
But here's my one last favor.

365
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:17,414
Let me buy dinner. Let's have dinner
with Mr. Son and Ms. Lee.

366
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,501
It's just to get acquainted.
This is a standard thing people do.

367
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,753
Of course.

368
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:27,007
Let's eat.
We shouldn't let the food get cold.

369
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,383
Okay. Let's eat.

370
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,678
-Enjoy your food.
-Thank you for the food.

371
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,597
I want to get a facelift here.

372
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,098
No, you shouldn't.

373
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,350
Gosh. I should just get it today.

374
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,936
-Hey, isn't that Lee So-min?
-Forget it.

375
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,023
Yes, she is.
Gosh, she's prettier without her makeup.

376
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:48,236
I'm sorry. Our agency thinks
she doesn't look her best without makeup.

377
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,487
-Okay.
-What was that?

378
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,199
All right.

379
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,326
Look over here.

380
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,705
This is just a regular camera.

381
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,540
I know a great app.
I'll recommend it to you.

382
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,918
-Are you a celebrity?
-No, I'm not.

383
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,795
-I'll go in first.
-No, I'll take one with a celebrity.

384
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,549
Then, I'll be your selfie stick.
One, two, three.

385
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,889
Even Min-jun never saw me without makeup.

386
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,311
How do you feel about people
taking your photos without asking?

387
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,396
-Do you want an honest answer?
-A standard answer.

388
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,149
In that case, I can't be honest.

389
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,859
I have to say what I'm supposed to.

390
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,072
How do you feel about living a life
where you can't be honest?

391
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,491
Does it feel like it's part of your job?

392
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,369
If so, your working hours seem very long.

393
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,455
"If you can't take it,
you shouldn't be in this industry."

394
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,416
I've always hated that saying.

395
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,419
Things don't have to be
that harsh, do they?

396
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,297
I have to cover your face now.

397
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,012
What is it? What are you doing?

398
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,266
I can't talk now.

399
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,977
-Talk about yourself.
-What?

400
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,561
Just tell me about you.

401
00:26:10,568 --> 00:26:11,611
I'm...

402
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,573
Well, did I...

403
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,162
Here.

404
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,958
-Here. Okay.
-Okay.

405
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:32,841
The first half covers my opinion
about your proposal and scripts.

406
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,302
The second half is the revised summary
I came up with.

407
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,305
Was there anything to revise
about my proposal?

408
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,516
I checked the parts,
similar to your previous works

409
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,809
which could have a negative effect

410
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,769
and parts that need to be changed.

411
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,522
I summarized its direction, my opinion,
and my conclusion based on that.

412
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,399
It's only 50 pages.

413
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,819
You prepared this in a day?

414
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:54,404
Time is of the essence in dramas.

415
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,198
I can finish this within half a day.

416
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,910
But that's not important. The focus should
be how much of my opinion matches yours

417
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:04,331
and how much of it
can be revised into the new scripts.

418
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:08,084
I cannot guarantee that
the TV ratings will be high this time.

419
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,878
Don't forget who I am.

420
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,087
Yes, I'm well aware.

421
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:14,799
Everyone is looking forward
to the synergy effect

422
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,301
of my new ideas and your story.

423
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,346
Numbers are the only factor
for some parts.

424
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,849
I was hoping to help you bring up
the TV ratings with my new ideas

425
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:26,686
and that they would be materialized,
so I wrote my unadulterated opinions

426
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,313
for an accurate evaluation of the story.

427
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:31,733
So the truth is not novel anymore?
Is it getting old now?

428
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,194
No, I think you're talking
about popularity among the people.

429
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,071
I just want to add
a sense of originality in it.

430
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,033
So you're telling me
my story isn't original.

431
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,077
l like your stories, Ms. Jung.

432
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,460
I like you, Ms. Jung.

433
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,463
I like you, Ms. Jung.

434
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,673
I like you, Ms. Jung.

435
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,094
-Is Korean food okay?
-Yes, I like Korean food.

436
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,555
Actually, I heard
that they had Western food for lunch.

437
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,310
-Yes, we did.
-I'm glad.

438
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,688
-Do you drink?
-Yes, I like having drinks with food.

439
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,817
-The traditional drink here is great.
-Okay.

440
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,069
-Ma'am.
-Okay.

441
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,237
We'd like to order.

442
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,291
Ms. Lim. I really liked your story.

443
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,960
It was a page-turner.

444
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,003
-Thank you.
-Let me pour you a drink.

445
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:35,338
Thank you.

446
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:54,274
There were some unique parts.

447
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:57,736
There were parts that I found familiar
but felt new at the same time,

448
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,822
and parts I've never seen before
but felt familiar at the same time.

449
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,657
It has a lot of flaws, right?

450
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,201
Your strong points cover up the flaws,
so it's all right.

451
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,080
You seem to believe in her
and your assessment is accurate, too.

452
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,499
Instead of trying to cover up the flaws,

453
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,877
making your strong points stand out
is the right approach.

454
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,336
The lines were fun to read.

455
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,881
And it made me want to see
the characters in person.

456
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,758
The focus is on the characters,
not the story.

457
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:22,135
I'm sure it will be a unique drama.

458
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,096
That's why we wanted to sign you.

459
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,098
We thought that a young company like ours

460
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,143
would be able to keep your unique style

461
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,521
and provide you with good ideas.

462
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,398
That's what we thought.

463
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,858
But I do have to say

464
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,444
that our company does make you

465
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,196
hesitant to say yes.

466
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,614
No, it's not true.

467
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,409
Each production company
has its strong and weak points.

468
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,869
A new company like ours

469
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,914
might be able to offer you a better number

470
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:55,001
because we don't have a lot of cards
to play when scouting people.

471
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,505
But we do lack in experience

472
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,256
that a big production company has.

473
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,260
Well, this isn't always true.
But it all comes down to this.

474
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,472
Since you can't see the results
right away,

475
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,808
all we can say is that we'll do our best

476
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,351
and to ask you to believe in us.

477
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:14,187
That is all we can offer you.

478
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,773
I understand how hard this must be.

479
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,568
This is nothing
compared to what you guys go through.

480
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:25,448
Besides, because Ms. Hwang
and Ms. Lim are good friends,

481
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,408
I did have several advantages.

482
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,203
Tonight's dinner will be the last favor

483
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,456
I get for the sake of your friendship
with Ms. Hwang.

484
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,794
When you consider your offer,

485
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:41,089
please don't take your friendship
with Ms. Hwang into consideration.

486
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,424
Well, it's a bit too late to say this now,

487
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:47,220
but I feel bad for imposing
another burden on you to think about.

488
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:50,306
To be honest,
it'd be easier for us to work that way.

489
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,437
I hope I didn't offend you.

490
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,857
No. You couldn't possibly. Not at all.

491
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,984
Let me pour you another drink.

492
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:12,996
How was it?

493
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,263
Do you drink

494
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,641
whiskey?

495
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,186
Sometimes.

496
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,609
There are times
when I want to feel bitter liquor

497
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,652
going down my throat.

498
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,072
After swallowing that bitter liquor,

499
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,491
it makes me feel

500
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,578
as if I'm a bit stronger.

501
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,668
Does that actually make me look weak?

502
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:10,803
No.

503
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,062
When I met you for the first time,

504
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,897
I was a bit scared.

505
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,274
But you looked very strong.

506
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,653
After giving birth to my son,
I kept telling myself

507
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:29,948
that I should be strong.

508
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,617
After seeing you,

509
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,661
I just wanted to work for you.

510
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,537
And when I was learning from you,

511
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,958
your sharpness in handling business
scared me.

512
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,251
Tonight's dinner will be the last favor

513
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:45,296
I get for the sake of your friendship
with Ms. Hwang.

514
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,090
I realized

515
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,634
that it is sharpness
which makes me stronger.

516
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,427
That's what I learned.

517
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,513
I'm very lucky.

518
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:58,101
So far, I have never seen you falter.

519
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,146
And I continue to learn from you
without faltering.

520
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:07,986
Meeting a senior like that isn't easy.

521
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,700
When I joined the company,

522
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,244
you were

523
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,498
three years older than I am now.

524
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,169
I have three years left now.

525
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,634
It makes me wonder if I would be able

526
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:34,679
to be as strong

527
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,724
and sharp as you after three years.

528
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:44,272
Actually, looking forward to my future

529
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,357
makes my heart flutter and makes me happy.

530
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,569
Are you all right?

531
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:55,950
I'm not sharp.

532
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,244
I'm not strong.

533
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,539
Hey.

534
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,839
Hey.

535
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,383
What does Ms. Lim like?

536
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,762
What does Mr. Son like?

537
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,639
Should I buy them some Korean beef?

538
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,892
A Korean beef set.

539
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,105
What is it?

540
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:28,608
Korean beef is too expensive.

541
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,573
Korean beef is so expensive.

542
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:48,252
Bad Korean beef.

543
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,797
I hate Korean beef.

544
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,050
Just buy American beef.

545
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,490
Where are you going?

546
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,825
To the restroom.

547
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,203
You know what?

548
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,582
I managed to swallow more things
instead of throwing up.

549
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,628
My gosh. I'm so happy.

550
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,758
The restroom is so far away.

551
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,929
Tell the toilet to come over here.

552
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,395
-She seemed like a good person.
-Right.

553
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:52,150
She called the waitress ma'am.

554
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,735
When she poured the drink,
she poured one for her employee first.

555
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,737
And she analyzed my story thoroughly.

556
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,116
And she knows
how to objectively evaluate her company.

557
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,746
I get why Han-ju has been working
for her for a long time.

558
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,957
She's nice.

559
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:12,962
The decision is up to you.

560
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,089
I'm good with either one of them.

561
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,719
Well, I think I can sort of tell
which one you'll go with.

562
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,767
Gosh. I used MC to treat her to a meal

563
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,561
at a fancy restaurant.

564
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,606
-"MC"?
-My mom's card.

565
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,734
From now on, you'll use the CC more often.

566
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,986
-"CC"?
-Corporate card.

567
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,073
The dramaturgy doesn't add up here, then.

568
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,951
Look.
Since the main characters were brought up

569
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,995
in the opposite environment,
they won't get along.

570
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,205
but they meet by chance.

571
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,957
The heroine has a setback
in achieving her goal because of him.

572
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:54,086
If so, the connection between the man
and the woman constitutes as fate.

573
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,589
Then, they should be going through
all these crises together.

574
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,969
Listen.

575
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,223
When a man and a woman meet,
they should fall in love.

576
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,767
Viewers these days
don't have time to date,

577
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,810
so they live vicariously through dramas.

578
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,103
Life is already hard as it is.

579
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,648
You think they'll to watch a drama
where the main characters suffer?

580
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:16,192
They would rather watch
variety shows flooding with TMI.

581
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,527
People don't like
complicated stories these days.

582
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,949
Love was seen even during the Korean War.

583
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,659
Love that makes you desperate and yearn.

584
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,327
Love that faints and gives butterflies.

585
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,246
There's catharsis even on variety shows.

586
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,373
This story doesn't have catharsis.

587
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,086
Well, to elaborate--

588
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,046
I'm all for making it realistic,

589
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,465
but the male main character
is too pathetic.

590
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,802
Why don't we change the plot?

591
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,388
You were just talking about the character.
Why did--

592
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,348
I want to create better stories,
so I have options.

593
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,349
That's my point.

594
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,601
l like your stories, Ms. Jung.

595
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,023
I like you, Ms. Jung.

596
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,067
I like you, Ms. Jung.

597
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,028
I like you, Hye-jeong.

598
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,679
Well, we're here.

599
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,227
Do whatever you want.

600
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,814
-What?
-No, don't do whatever you want.

601
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,276
-What are you talking about?
-Quit.

602
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,986
-Quit what?
-Quit working as my manager.

603
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,863
You got a better job offer.

604
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,033
I'll deal with it.

605
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,659
There's nothing to deal with. Just quit.

606
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,870
This is a violation of labor law.
This is a power trip.

607
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:34,372
It's quite the opposite.

608
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,624
Are you stupid? Why are you
throwing away a good opportunity?

609
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:37,875
I don't want to.

610
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,795
-Go.
-No.

611
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,090
I spent a fortune to turn down the offer.
I won't work there.

612
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,466
I'll expense it.

613
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,974
TOTAL: 270,000 WON

614
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,566
I'm sure the drinks cost a lot.

615
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,278
-I'm paying for this. Okay?
-Yes, you get the tab.

616
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,239
I'm sure the bill came out
to one million won.

617
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,491
How much is it?

618
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,660
Your tab was already settled.

619
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,918
CREDIT CARD: 1,560,000 WON

620
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,504
You lunatic.

621
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,258
You said you'd expense it.

622
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:28,509
I can't expense drinks.

623
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:14,054
Drink this if you're going
to drink at home. Don't drink soju.

624
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,347
What?

625
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,141
What's this?

626
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,895
-Why?
-You look pathetic.

627
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,980
Can you tell I drink alone at home?

628
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,064
You little...

629
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,651
A bottle will be enough for you.

630
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,199
Drink this if you're going
to drink at home. Don't drink wine.

631
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,868
What? Are you provoking me?

632
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:02,538
You finish the bottle once you open it
because you don't want to waste it.

633
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:05,207
Soju's cheap. Have a few shots
and throw out the rest.

634
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,060
Hey, I heard you rule this school.

635
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:08,937
Yes.

636
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,649
What? Do you want to fight me for it?

637
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,151
-From now on, you'll protect me.
-What?

638
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,861
From now on, you'll protect me.

639
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,405
Why would I do that?

640
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,199
Because I'm the prettiest girl
in this school.

641
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,996
What is this? Are you crazy?

642
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,082
You rule this school.
You're supposed to do that.

643
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,668
-I am?
-Yes.

644
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:33,879
Is that so?

645
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:34,963
Yes.

646
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,139
Does it mean we're dating?

647
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,475
You have quite a big dream
for a troublemaker.

648
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,812
Right. That was too big of a dream.

649
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,814
Yes. Tell me a dream that suits you.

650
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,358
-A dream? I don't have one.
-Yes.

651
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:57,027
Really? Then, be my manager.

652
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,989
-Your manager?
-Yes, I'll be a celebrity.

653
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,826
That means you'll be protecting me
your whole life.

654
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,746
I see. Is that what's going to happen?

655
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:08,997
Yes.

656
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,798
Bye.

657
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,217
Have you gone mad? What's wrong with you?

658
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,970
I have a dream now.

659
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,097
You scared me for a second. What dream?

660
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,348
I'll be a manager.

661
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,185
Holy shit.

662
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,812
Bye, everyone.

663
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:33,939
Stop.

664
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,277
Min-jun, you can't just leave.

665
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,697
You think you can enter and quit
any time you want,

666
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,699
as if we're some charity group?

667
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,701
You'll lose one of your body parts.

668
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,538
You guys are going to be in trouble then.

669
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,793
I'm Lee Min-jun.

670
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,255
Do you think you can handle me?

671
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:08,974
Did you lose?

672
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,311
I won.

673
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,563
Is this how a winner looks?

674
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,484
I look like this because I won.

675
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,573
Say that deep down in someone's heart,
there's a beautiful gem.

676
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,075
Everyone can see it's beautiful,

677
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,662
but why do you think that person
won't show it? Why is that?

678
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,707
If you gain something,
that means you have something to lose.

679
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,167
That's what puzzles me.

680
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,044
How can you be scared
of having something to lose?

681
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,424
This is a bit different
from just owning properties or land.

682
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:27,177
When it comes to your heart, there's
no security measure you can fall back on

683
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,805
whether it's your partner's heart
or yours.

684
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,724
You can make an effort.
That's one way to protect it.

685
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:38,146
What you just said was only
the easiest thing to say in the world.

686
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,231
Right.

687
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,442
But if you know
how you feel about one another,

688
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:45,779
hiding your feelings you already know
by being calculative and so on

689
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,531
is such a foolish thing to do.

690
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:48,615
Of course.

691
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,164
Of course, that's true.

692
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,417
I mean, some people might do that.

693
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,210
Hiding it isn't a bad thing.

694
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,755
You know, it correlates to one's desire.

695
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,091
Right. If there's no desire,
there's no need to hide it.

696
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:09,678
Right. You ought to respect their desire
to keep the status quo

697
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,430
as long as it was earned dishonestly.

698
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,766
Right. If people don't hide themselves
to some extent,

699
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,477
-humanity cannot exist.
-Right.

700
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,979
A girlfriend would ask her boyfriend.

701
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,273
"Hey, you just

702
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:24,401
looked at the women walking past you.
Why did you do that?"

703
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,778
The boyfriend would say to her.

704
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,115
"I was so captivated by the glamorous body
they possess, while you don't.

705
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,409
It led me to have some dirty thoughts."

706
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:34,369
Right. The boyfriend would ask the girl.

707
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:37,456
"Hey, you're getting a lot of texts.
Did something happen?"

708
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,751
The girl would answer,
"He's just a close friend from my church.

709
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,211
He's very handsome, gentle,
and successful.

710
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,006
I need to give him full attention.
If things don't work out, I'll go to him."

711
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,300
-Right. She can't say that.
-Right.

712
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,472
That can't be.

713
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,230
But it's a bit sad.

714
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,148
What?

715
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:06,902
What you find
before you fall in love with that person

716
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:08,945
is the love that you possess.

717
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,908
But after you start your relationship,
all there is left to find

718
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,244
is hatred. Don't you agree?

719
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,503
Goodness, what a beautiful color.

720
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,340
You'll taste it soon,
but their draft beer here is good, too.

721
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,175
Cheers.

722
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,033
Recently, I dined

723
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:58,203
at expensive Western
and Korean restaurants.

724
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,872
But fried chicken is still my favorite.

725
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,375
The food tastes much better with you.

726
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,459
Why is that?

727
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,672
Does my face arouse your appetite?

728
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,091
Wait. Is that why?

729
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,805
Mr. Chu, you need to gain some weight.

730
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:18,640
You should look at me a lot.

731
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,767
I like that.

732
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,311
You like that?

733
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:34,906
Hello.

734
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,784
Hi.

735
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:41,955
You must be Ha-yun.
He told me a lot about you.

736
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,123
Is that so?

737
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,292
Haven't we met before?

738
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:53,258
Okay. So this is Ha-yun.

739
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,677
-And this is--
-I know. She's your general manager.

740
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,554
But he didn't tell me a lot about you.

741
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,682
Would you like to have a glass of beer?

742
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,808
No, it's okay.

743
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,603
Excuse me. A glass of draft beer, please.

744
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,774
How did you know I was here?

745
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,318
-I was just passing by.
-Did you drink?

746
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,987
Is that important?
I didn't even drink that much.

747
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,281
This is great.

748
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:18,950
It's nice to meet you.

749
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,620
The two of you make

750
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:25,332
a nice couple sitting down here together
side by side.

751
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,708
You two look great together.

752
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:27,793
Really?

753
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,381
This is nice.

754
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,593
How old are you?

755
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:38,428
Hey, Ha-yun.

756
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,056
Why? Am I not allowed to ask her
how old she is?

757
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,142
It's okay. I'm 30.

758
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,646
My gosh. You look young for your age.

759
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,940
You think so?

760
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,901
But I'm not as pretty as you, Ha-yun.

761
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,406
This is fun.

762
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,869
How did you two meet?

763
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,121
Are you really curious about that?

764
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,040
It wasn't that special.

765
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:09,125
Really?

766
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:13,588
Cheers.

767
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,913
You should take this one.

768
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,874
I'm drunk.

769
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,501
No, you should take this one.

770
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,044
I already called a taxi for myself.

771
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:56,131
Bye.

772
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:00,844
Bye.

773
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:38,924
Did you go through my cellphone?

774
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:40,675
You exchanged photos

775
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,969
and made plans to hang out Friday night.
Are you two that close?

776
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,852
What was that?

777
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,896
-I was drinking water.
-You pounded the glass.

778
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,857
-I don't want to talk.
-Then, don't make me bring this up.

779
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,945
How could you be so different around her?

780
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,781
Who is your girlfriend?

781
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,408
You seemed very sweet when you saw her.

782
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,079
You used to be like that
when you saw me before.

783
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,122
Back then,

784
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,459
you weren't so low to go through my phone.

785
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,129
Is that the problem?

786
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,548
You exchanged photos

787
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,092
-and made plans.
-Stop it.

788
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:41,319
Sit down.

789
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,904
Drink beer with me too.

790
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,656
-We already did.
-It wasn't with me.

791
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,755
Are you upset
that I ruined your hangout today?

792
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:06,052
No.

793
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,471
That wasn't a work dinner.

794
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,181
Right.

795
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:14,019
You exchange photos,

796
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,896
made plans Friday night,
and drank beer with her.

797
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:19,190
Why do you sound angry?

798
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,694
-I'm not angry.
-Yes, you are.

799
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,032
Fine. I'm sorry.

800
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,450
What are you sorry about?

801
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,617
You already said it.

802
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:31,703
Now that I said it,
you should say it, too.

803
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,872
-I'm sorry.
-What are you sorry about?

804
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:40,837
I don't want to fight.

805
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,387
We just started doing better.

806
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,142
We did?

807
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,316
Weren't we doing better?

808
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,277
-I didn't know.
-Is that an excuse for your behavior?

809
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,820
What did I do?

810
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,740
-What the heck did I do wrong?
-You said you were sorry.

811
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,201
"What the heck did I do wrong?"

812
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,619
How could you say that?

813
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,871
Okay. Stop it.

814
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,164
I don't want to fight.

815
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,294
Do you like that bitch?

816
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:22,629
What?

817
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,964
Why? Are you going to yell at me again?

818
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,258
Is she more important than me?

819
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,052
We worked together.

820
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,638
She didn't do anything wrong. Why...

821
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,098
Don't call her that.

822
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,725
Of course, she's at fault here.

823
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,560
So it's okay for her to drink with a man

824
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,521
who has a girlfriend until that late.

825
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,315
But it's wrong of me to follow
my boyfriend out of worry?

826
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:43,274
Please.

827
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:46,778
Stop it.
I told you that I didn't want to fight.

828
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,238
Are you doing this to break up with me?

829
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,406
If I want to, will you break up with me?

830
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,993
-What?
-You do whatever you want to do anyway.

831
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,204
Tell me. Do you want to break up with me?

832
00:56:56,913 --> 00:56:57,997
Ha-yun.

833
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,877
Do you really think

834
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,466
-this is a healthy relationship?
-Is this my fault?

835
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,764
It's my fault.

836
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,769
Everything is my fault.
I did everything wrong.

837
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:22,355
Everything is my fault.

838
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,149
I'm always at fault

839
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:26,568
whatever situation we're in
or whatever you did.

840
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,114
You'll stop this
only when I say it's my fault.

841
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:32,657
I got it. That's enough.

842
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,117
It's my fault.

843
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,162
Everything is my fault, so stop this!

844
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:47,380
Perhaps, not knowing myself
might feel more detrimental

845
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,757
than not knowing your significant other.

846
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,385
Right.

847
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,015
Including the fact that you know,
but can't do anything about it.

848
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,601
If you hide from yourself,

849
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:03,188
it means that you have no idea
where you should start looking.

850
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:06,107
It's like this. It's frustrating
because you don't even know yourself.

851
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,859
It includes all the typical situations
we face.

852
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:10,612
It's not an easy thing to do, but...

853
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,824
Well, some people might not
have this happen to them until they die.

854
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,829
But facing your hidden self
that you tucked away

855
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,082
can be a bit painful.

856
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,268
I...

857
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,230
Well, did I

858
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,609
like documentaries because they were

859
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,945
vivid?

860
00:58:57,283 --> 00:58:58,618
Things that flow by.

861
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,453
Animate creatures.

862
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:04,916
Did I think that capturing these things

863
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,170
with a camera
was the highlight of documentaries?

864
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,925
Why can't I remember
my old self in the past?

865
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,094
In the past? When?

866
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:17,679
You can't talk.

867
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,056
What?

868
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,936
The past.

869
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,855
When was that?

870
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:29,941
The past.

871
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:41,202
When we met, what kind of person was I?

872
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,453
What?

873
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,374
Me?

874
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,713
Is that so?

875
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,300
I don't remember

876
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:57,885
how I used to be.

877
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,055
When I made a decision about something,

878
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,391
I don't remember what had been on my mind.

879
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,226
Why can't I remember it?

880
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:09,897
It's scary.

881
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,831
When we met, what kind of person was I?

882
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,207
What?

883
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:32,712
Me?

884
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:48,353
Is that so?

885
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:52,190
I don't remember

886
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,151
how I used to be.

887
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:30,079
IS THAT WHY YOU CAME HERE?

888
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:34,167
I FEEL LESS LONELY
WHEN I SEE SOMEONE LONELIER THAN ME

889
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:37,879
ARE YOU DOING THIS TO BREAK UP WITH ME?

890
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:40,631
IF I WANT TO, WILL YOU BREAK UP WITH ME?

891
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,594
WHAT YOU FIND BEFORE YOU FALL IN LOVE
WITH THAT PERSON

892
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:45,803
IS THE LOVE THAT YOU POSSESS

893
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,181
BUT AFTER YOU START YOUR RELATIONSHIP,
ALL THERE IS LEFT TO FIND

894
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,558
IS HATRED
DON'T YOU AGREE?

895
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:54,687
Director Kim. Charisma.
I sense great power within you.

896
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,773
I heard he already scouted Mr. Yang.

897
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:59,066
Mr. Yang, the director of photography?
Mr. Cheon, the art director?

898
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,151
Even Mr. Kim, the music director?

899
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,945
I really didn't know you cared
about your junior that much.

900
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,030
Well?

901
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,491
Damn it!

902
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,785
Why are you happy that I'm gone?

903
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,745
Because our director is Son Beom-su.

904
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,414
Why would a director hesitate
to contact the writer?

905
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:14,916
Do you have butterflies or something?

906
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:17,960
I just want to enjoy this for now.

907
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:20,338
Gosh, this is nice.

908
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:23,508
I've been recording us very diligently.

909
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:25,510
I didn't know
that this could make me so happy.

910
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:27,929
Hey, you over there. I love you.

911
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,056
You used to come here often
with your boyfriend.

912
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:33,309
Please remember me.
Remember how I was happy with you.

913
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:36,938
If you're not here,
who would remember how happy I was, then?

914
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,273
I know that you're not here.

915
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,068
I'm exhausted. Hug me.

916
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:44,904
