1
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,219
Hwang In-guk, come on. Swallow it.
Aren't you going to go to school?

2
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:35,512
It'd be nice if I didn't.

3
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,889
Hey, you're a second-grader now.

4
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,682
What will you become when you grow up?

5
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:40,809
A third-grader.

6
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,271
I can't believe I gave birth to him.

7
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,272
Spank him.

8
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,399
You know we wake up early because of you.

9
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,111
Children have a strong presence indeed.

10
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,445
Eat your breakfast.

11
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,532
No. I'm going to sleep some more
after In-guk goes to school.

12
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,744
Open your mouth.

13
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:00,954
What is it now?

14
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,961
I don't want to become like you.

15
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,809
I'm going to go on a diet.

16
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,021
Stop eating meat first.

17
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,857
You're eating meat for breakfast.

18
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:30,692
Will that make me fat?

19
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,943
You eat meat for dinner too.

20
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,554
Raise your upper body as you touch
your knees with your fingertips.

21
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,055
Damn it.

22
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,641
No wonder we have belly fat.
We eat and sit all day.

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,059
-Jin-joo.
-One, two,

24
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,353
-Sit-ups...
-three, four,

25
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,815
five, six, seven,

26
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,818
-eight, nine, ten.
-Gosh.

27
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,446
Do people normally get exhausted
after three sit-ups?

28
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,323
You did that many?

29
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,950
You're like a Muscle Mania member.

30
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,243
Gosh.

31
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,038
I hate belly fat the most,
but I hate working on my abs too.

32
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:27,290
There are two kinds of exercises
in this world.

33
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,709
The one you hate the most
and the one you've always hated.

34
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,838
I should start working now.

35
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,673
You've been repeating yourself for a year.

36
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,175
Right?

37
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,220
Nothing goes my way. Neither work nor fat.

38
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,180
If I could have things my way,

39
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,933
I wouldn't be packing to go to work now.

40
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,060
Ask your boss to fix your working hours.

41
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,102
Why won't you fight for it?

42
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,855
We can't claim our rights as laborers

43
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,190
because we aren't laborers.

44
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,567
What are you then?

45
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,902
You're self-employed.

46
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,779
Self-employers are laborers too.

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,864
You work for yourselves.

48
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,283
You have opportunities
to earn as much as you work.

49
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,620
Self-employers work hard,
but it doesn't count as labor.

50
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:07,121
Do I earn as much as I work?

51
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:09,415
You get closer to your dream.
You're earning that.

52
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,376
Wait a minute.

53
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:12,835
Were you just

54
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,214
talking back to me?
It sounded like that to me.

55
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,590
No way.

56
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:19,509
I kept the conversation going
because I respect you.

57
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,220
Jin-joo.

58
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,722
You talk way too much.

59
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,183
You sometimes talk more than me.

60
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,935
Shut your mouth, and keep it shut.

61
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,354
When I was an assistant,
all I did was watch the writer's lips

62
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,647
so that I could copy everything.

63
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,942
I remembered every single thing
the writer said.

64
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,111
That's what made me what I am now.

65
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,030
I donate my blood
and try to lose weight all the time.

66
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:42,156
Hey!

67
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,241
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,412
Can't you please write
as much as you talk?

69
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,664
Why would you say unnecessary things
and ruin my morning

70
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,082
after my refreshing bowel movement?

71
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,711
It's lunchtime now.

72
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,130
You... Why you...

73
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,340
Get out. You get out now!

74
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,092
I'm sorry. I won't do it anymore.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,812
I think you're strangely impressive.

76
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,814
What does that mean?

77
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,899
You're strange to keep talking
back to her.

78
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,736
But impressive that you stay calm
even when she yells at you.

79
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,029
She doesn't get intimidated.

80
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,781
Right. Why won't I get intimidated?

81
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,908
Why am I not scared of her?

82
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,411
I'm not exactly the fearless type.

83
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,955
Whatever the reason is,
if you don't get intimidated,

84
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,832
it makes the one that yells feel awkward.

85
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,669
You're making the yeller awkward
every single day.

86
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,213
Am I twisted or what?

87
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,133
Let's eat first. We need some sugar.

88
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,970
This is why I'm getting fat.

89
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,139
We'd die if we lived this way
and didn't even have body fat.

90
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,059
-You're right. It's so sweet.
-I like it.

91
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,854
Hey, you're driving today.

92
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,566
By "Hey," did you mean me?

93
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,739
You're the only one who has
a driver's license here.

94
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,452
Is this why I went through
all that trouble for a driver's--

95
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,164
You. Stop talking. Stop talking right now!

96
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,920
Wasn't the shoot until tomorrow?

97
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,922
They won't be able to finish
the day scenes today,

98
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,882
so some of them will have to
be filmed tomorrow.

99
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,759
So day scenes after an overnight shoot?

100
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,594
Yes. That's what the staff agreed.

101
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,763
What about the chicken scene?

102
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,682
They'll shoot it tomorrow,
so we can deliver them then.

103
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,767
And the chicken boxes?

104
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,728
I'll make sure everyone can see
"olive oil" written on them.

105
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:39,273
Okay. Don't underestimate him
just because he's a budding director.

106
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,442
He's known for his stubbornness.

107
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,693
Okay.

108
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,988
I'm glad the lead actress
is an idol singer.

109
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:48,533
She'll be obedient.

110
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,369
Right,

111
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,162
we have a rookie.

112
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:56,749
I'll have him follow you, so train him.
He'll go to the set tomorrow.

113
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,876
Okay, ma'am.

114
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,965
Rookie. Come to my room.

115
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,883
Yes, ma'am.

116
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,432
How about cooking?

117
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,475
What?

118
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,520
We can't do nothing like this anymore.

119
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,980
Cooking.

120
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,857
Let's try cooking.

121
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,235
Cooking? Like chefs?

122
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,572
Yes. When you look at
how food researchers work,

123
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,908
something simple and Korean...

124
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:34,579
It should be about a Korean chef.

125
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,789
Shall I try it out first?

126
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,208
The Eun-jeong I know can do nothing
in the kitchen

127
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,043
other than adding milk to cereal.

128
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,921
That's what makes this fun.

129
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,058
I'll bring this to Hyo-bong.
Do you want to try it?

130
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,021
I think I already know
what it tastes like.

131
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,482
Like a battlefield.

132
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,409
Looks like this kitchen is done for.

133
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,536
Shall we move?

134
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,626
How can you be so lovely
in every single way?

135
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,584
Does Hyo-bong get to sing as well?

136
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,837
No. The actress wanted to sing
the theme song herself,

137
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,422
so we're recording a demo version.

138
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,007
It's for a web drama.

139
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,433
What brings you here?

140
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,062
What is that? A lunch box bomb?

141
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,480
It's lunchtime.

142
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,024
You cooked?

143
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,069
-Are you all right?
-Are they for us too?

144
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,320
I made enough.

145
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,376
I can't believe this.

146
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,675
It is a lunch box bomb.

147
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,386
This is for the Japanese emperor's
birthday.

148
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,471
The lunch box bomb was
to take his own life.

149
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,599
The bomb the activist threw
was a water bottle.

150
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,310
-So we'll drink the water...
-Come on. Just eat it.

151
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,228
This looks like japchae. Is it not?

152
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,814
The name doesn't matter.
Shove it in your face.

153
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,065
Why does it taste fishy though?

154
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:11,027
Because I put fish sauce
thinking it was soy sauce.

155
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,153
I can tell you put a lot.

156
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,864
Yet she didn't throw it away
and finished it.

157
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,365
Driven with perseverance.

158
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,659
You're more fit to become a politician.
Why cook?

159
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,954
Hey, stop it. It's not that bad.

160
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,916
We can eat it, Eun-jeong.
We've done worse things.

161
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,001
Finish it then.

162
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,004
You're dead if you leave any.

163
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,312
Go get the jerk who just left.

164
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,731
Once he gets caught,
he'll eat getting beaten up.

165
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,618
Well, I didn't mean to cook myself.

166
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,746
I had to know well about it to work on it.

167
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,582
You're right.
You don't have to be a good cook.

168
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,336
Just say what's on your mind. I'm fine.

169
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,339
Can I, really?
They can't even tell what's tasty.

170
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,383
They don't even gain weight.
They are barbarians.

171
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,213
I'm sure I met her eyes.

172
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,590
She ignored me.

173
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,969
Did she?

174
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,595
How brave.

175
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,597
I think she looks different.

176
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,392
Did she lose some weight or get a jaw-job?

177
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,520
Maybe she thought you wouldn't
recognize her.

178
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:11,981
Who is prettier?

179
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,066
Of course, it's you.

180
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,110
You are.

181
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,961
Hello. Hi.

182
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,380
-Hello.
-Hi.

183
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,257
Thank you.

184
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,968
Welcome to this humble place.

185
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,761
Don't say that.

186
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,013
You complete the mood.

187
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,515
You're always dressed
in the Provence style.

188
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,392
Where do you buy your clothes from?

189
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,602
Just anywhere.

190
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,230
It looks like you bought them
in a little and simple store

191
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,774
while you were traveling southern France.

192
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,943
I thought they're from Dongdaemun.

193
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,112
No, Namdaemun.

194
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,615
Do you remember me?

195
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,074
I knew you worked here.

196
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,202
-Do you two know each other?
-My sister...

197
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,078
Are you still friends with her?

198
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,873
Oh, Eun-jeong just left.

199
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,291
I know. We said hello.

200
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:15,628
How long has it been?

201
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,922
-You were in high school.
-About eight or nine years.

202
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,007
You were so cute and funny back then.

203
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,676
Now, you've got cool too.

204
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,845
I make money and I'm still single.

205
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,682
Well, the demo isn't ready,

206
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,268
so Hyo-bong will have to sing it for you.

207
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,524
-Jin-joo, come on.
-Okay.

208
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,150
-Are you doing this on purpose?
-Yes, ma'am.

209
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,443
It's locked now.

210
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:38,377
Although I'm an aspiring writer

211
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,754
who is currently driving
for another writer,

212
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,674
it doesn't mean I've forgotten my identity
as a writer.

213
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,718
A TV station. Look.

214
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,638
There are so many kinds of people
that I can observe.

215
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,434
He must be the youngest writer
of a variety show.

216
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:56,979
No matter how busy they are,
they need the time to badmouth the boss.

217
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,903
The toughest job ever.
A celebrity's manager.

218
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,448
Keep it up until they form
a labor union for managers.

219
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,122
-I'm so excited.
-Same here.

220
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,334
Gosh, they must be here to watch
Concert 7080.

221
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,585
They are here so early.

222
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,838
I guess you realized that there is no one
better than Choi Baek-ho.

223
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:29,386
But this is the guy I'll be observing
thoroughly today.

224
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,060
I guess you come to work diligently.

225
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,103
I like the food at the cafeteria.

226
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,521
Let's go and eat.

227
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,857
Oh, Ms. Lim.

228
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:43,776
You must have put on some weight.

229
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,402
See?

230
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,321
With that nice and sincere attitude,

231
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,075
he's saying something
to hurt the listener.

232
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,288
There are seasons where I gain weight
and seasons where I lose.

233
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,540
So this is the gaining season, then.

234
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,918
See?

235
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,671
He's purposely mocking me
with that naive smile.

236
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,839
He's no ordinary jerk.

237
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,057
It smells nice.

238
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,558
It tastes even better.

239
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,394
And the menu is amazing.

240
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,979
The dietitian here does a good job.

241
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,814
There.

242
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,191
She looks even uglier today.

243
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,609
I'm going to go tease her.

244
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,238
See? That's what he's like.

245
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,369
Did you drink last night?
Your eyes are puffy.

246
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,540
Oh, it's not that your eyes are puffy.

247
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,375
You're just ugly.

248
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,751
No, she's not.

249
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,549
Why do you have goggles over your mouth?

250
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,508
Mr. Son.

251
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,468
I like you.

252
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,013
-My gosh.
-I don't like you. You're ugly.

253
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,228
I mean it.

254
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,024
You've gotten smart.

255
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,277
I lost.

256
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,741
She sounded like she meant it.

257
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,325
Did you notice it?

258
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,412
What should I do?

259
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,456
What's going on?

260
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:25,252
I'm sure you noticed. I meant it.

261
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,130
Did you? So that's what happened.

262
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,716
-I meant it.
-Okay. Well, I'm eating now.

263
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,884
It was since--

264
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,343
Okay. I'll stop teasing you.

265
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,345
I shouldn't have made fun of your face.

266
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:38,140
It's since you started making fun of me.

267
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,809
I couldn't stop thinking about you
and missed you all day.

268
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,562
I can't do anything about how I feel.

269
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,731
It's beyond my control.

270
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,399
-I like you.
-I hate meat!

271
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,943
-You shouldn't have gotten it then.
-You put it on my plate.

272
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,695
Then you shouldn't have passed me
your plate.

273
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,073
And I saw you eating a lot of pork belly
at the team dinner.

274
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,449
Why do you suddenly hate meat?

275
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,201
I hate it now.
Do you have a problem with that?

276
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,702
And why were you at my team dinner?

277
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,204
-Why can't I?
-Who are you then, dummy?

278
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,246
Why are you swearing at me?

279
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,707
"Dummy" is not swearing, dummy.

280
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,958
Why call someone who likes you

281
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:05,918
a dummy?

282
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,336
Why would you say that when I eat?

283
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,629
I said it when you scooped rice.

284
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,507
You did?

285
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,717
Then... We're in the cafeteria.

286
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,804
I'm sorry. Look.

287
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,848
Why are you being so out of order?

288
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:20,974
Let's go outside then.

289
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,769
Do you want me to say it
on You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook?

290
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,356
-What a headache.
-This is interesting.

291
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:30,651
Why would a confession
turn into a quarrel?

292
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,237
I bought tickets to a movie.
Come to the lobby by 7 p.m.

293
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,696
I'm not going.

294
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,665
I like you.

295
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,583
Stop it, already.

296
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,463
What kind of place is this?

297
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,008
Clumsiness.

298
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,969
I guess what makes people like
this annoying punk

299
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,929
could be his clumsiness.

300
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:01,223
The clumsiness of a successful man

301
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,308
could make him seem more down to earth.

302
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,352
But...

303
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,362
He's way too clumsy.

304
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,579
Well.

305
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,331
I'm sure you didn't invite us

306
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,666
so we can have the cafeteria food.

307
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,334
Actually, I did.

308
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,004
The meal tickets here are expensive.

309
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,630
Okay. Fine.

310
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,549
We enjoyed the meal.

311
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,801
Did you read the script?

312
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,303
-I'm out.
-What?

313
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,221
-What is going on today?
-What are you talking about?

314
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,307
I'm dropping out of your drama.

315
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,933
Nothing is predictable.

316
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:48,604
That doesn't sound like a joke.

317
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,564
I wouldn't make such a lame joke.

318
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:56,445
It's common to get annoyed while I work,

319
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,364
so let me forget how I feel
and ask you what you mean.

320
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:01,617
-Why?
-The script doesn't read nicely.

321
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,495
It's common to ask for amendments.

322
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,539
Not that I'd make amendments though.

323
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,708
I'm sorry, but your script...

324
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,086
doesn't make my heart hop.

325
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,673
You mean "flutter."

326
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,550
Well, it could hop or dance.

327
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,385
Your heart dances?

328
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,346
Has your heart ever danced?

329
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,097
It flaps from time to time.

330
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,225
-Hey!
-I'm sorry.

331
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:31,855
I know you're getting a lot of offers
from cable TV channels.

332
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:32,940
I guess you'll be moving.

333
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,609
I'd have done so long ago
if I'd prioritized money.

334
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,320
Maybe the offer
got big enough to prioritize.

335
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,696
It's not that big yet.

336
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,490
Anyway, I've already told
the people in charge.

337
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,742
There are plenty of
other competent directors.

338
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,119
And it's written
by the Great Jung Hye-jeong,

339
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,454
so I'm not worried.

340
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,747
That's cute.

341
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,541
Let me give you a piece of advice

342
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,668
as a senior in this industry.

343
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,296
No, I'm not listening.

344
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,548
I'm not listening to your advice.

345
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,147
You win.

346
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,484
He's an idiot,

347
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,320
but I want to be like him.

348
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,156
What are you doing, you punk?

349
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,076
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,662
Are you here to mess around?
Get ready for the next scene.

351
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,875
We'll start with Scene 23.

352
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,711
Let's get moving faster.

353
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,087
Sir.

354
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,840
Scene 23 is where they eat chicken.

355
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,218
-Yes.
-You said it'll be filmed tomorrow.

356
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,054
The actress asked to change
the schedule all of a sudden.

357
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,264
You know idol singers. Please cooperate.

358
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:49,308
Well, I like idol singers too.

359
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,143
But the actors need to eat fried chicken.

360
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,519
Yes, they do.

361
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,981
But it's 5 a.m.
How will I get chicken now?

362
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,983
The schedule is messed up now.

363
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:58,900
Is that even relevant?

364
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,235
The promise must be kept.

365
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,279
The agency and the writer agreed to this.

366
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:03,739
What do you want me to do though?

367
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:05,240
Shooting is important.
The chicken doesn't mean--

368
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,284
Chicken means a lot!
It's all about sacrifice.

369
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,744
Decapitated, chopped, de-feathered,

370
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:10,704
battered, and fried in 170℃ oil...

371
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,748
Whatever. I don't even eat fried chicken.

372
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,585
Are you out of your mind?
You don't eat fried chicken?

373
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,173
Director.

374
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,552
It's partially our fault,
so I'll give you more time.

375
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,471
One hour. I can't give you more than that.

376
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,890
-Let's start with Scene 24.
-Yes, sir.

377
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:33,894
-We'll start with Scene 24.
-One hour? It's still early morning.

378
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,479
Why? Will it not be feasible?

379
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,898
No. Of course it's possible. Thank you.

380
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,693
Sir, this is an emergency.

381
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,320
Fry some chicken for us.

382
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,280
What are you talking about at this hour?

383
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,866
Well, the schedule has been muddled up,

384
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,368
so we need the fried chicken
for product placement right now.

385
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,995
I'm only an employee at the headquarters.

386
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,830
That's why I called you.

387
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,957
All you have to do is call
the owner of the store

388
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,001
that's closest to the TV station.

389
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,920
Stop being so ridiculous.

390
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,380
None of what we do ever made sense.

391
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,132
Please. I'm desperate.

392
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,302
I have an hour. No, 55 minutes.

393
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,179
This is just out of order.

394
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,555
And it's my day-off today.

395
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,182
-You're being too much.
-Sir.

396
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,767
Sir?

397
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,232
Oh, no...

398
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,991
It must be an emergency to call me
at this hour. What is it?

399
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,744
-Ma'am.
-What is it?

400
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,457
Fry some chicken for me.

401
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,042
Chicken?

402
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,815
Hello, sir.

403
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:07,821
Are you a part-timer?

404
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,157
Or a staff member?

405
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,913
-Hello, ma'am.
-What?

406
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,748
I'm the new recruit, Chu Jae-hun.

407
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,209
I came here upon the CEO's order.

408
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,711
I live right around here.

409
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,423
Why do you look so sad by the way?

410
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,467
I'm sorry.

411
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,431
This is my first proper job ever
and my first day.

412
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,141
And my first task was...

413
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,147
to smash the lock on the shutters.

414
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,732
I see.

415
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,861
Will I be going to jail
when I just joined the company?

416
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,238
-That's what worried me.
-I see.

417
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,283
Well, take the chicken out if it's cooked.

418
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:56,536
-Okay.
-Take them out.

419
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,540
It'll be pink if it's not fully cooked.

420
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,876
It's fine. We're running out of time,
so take it out.

421
00:25:04,502 --> 00:25:05,712
Okay.

422
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,340
Then I'll fry it once again,

423
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,300
-so they are crispy.
-Just take them out now!

424
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,222
Okay.

425
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,934
-Two minutes--
-Take them out!

426
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,855
Take them out!

427
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,201
-To where?
-To your right.

428
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,369
-Right.
-Right.

429
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,038
I'm not eating.

430
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,043
-Why not, Do-yeon?
-It'll make me gain weight.

431
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,213
Eating it in the morning won't.

432
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,631
I gained weight that way.

433
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,926
Right. I know that.

434
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,889
Then spit it out once
the director says "cut."

435
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,434
I've prepared a red-colored big bag

436
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:05,438
so you could spit out all you want.

437
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,650
Are you asking me to chew fried chicken
and spit it out when I'm on a diet?

438
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,902
Why don't you stab me
with a knife instead?

439
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,363
That'd be less painful.

440
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:16,366
Well, I know how painful that must be.

441
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,743
That's why I feel so sorry.

442
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,997
But even the director agreed on this.

443
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,873
But I never agreed on it.

444
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:37,053
Help me just once, please.

445
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,017
Help me just once, please.

446
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,812
We went through so much to fry this.

447
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:51,901
Hey!

448
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,697
What are you doing to our actress?

449
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,078
Get out. Now!

450
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,545
Get out. All of you!

451
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,391
Do you like chicken breast?

452
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,019
No. Chicken breast doesn't make you fat.

453
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,855
I don't see that much fat on you.

454
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:32,025
It's where somewhere guys can't notice,
so don't even look for it.

455
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:37,280
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to look.
No, I did mean to look.

456
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm sorry.

457
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,992
No, it's fine. Don't be like this.

458
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,418
Shall I get rid of the skin for you?

459
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,837
You lose the skin, you lose the chicken.

460
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,923
Oh, right.

461
00:27:56,674 --> 00:27:58,635
It's tasty. We're eating in the morning,

462
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,470
and it's chicken breast,
so we won't get fat.

463
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,139
Right. You're eating well.

464
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:06,059
I like chicken, you see.

465
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:10,105
I used to be a kitchen assistant at the
famous chicken place, Wang Galbi Tongdak.

466
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,315
No wonder you did a good job.

467
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,860
What a great day.

468
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:20,323
It is.
There isn't much fine dust in the air.

469
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,203
-It's cold but it's still tasty.
-It is.

470
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:38,967
Japchae rice.

471
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,808
Did you enjoy it?

472
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,938
It feels like I've eaten a whole plate
of the fishiest things in my life.

473
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:55,775
You made too much.

474
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,946
If I put up with it for two more meals,

475
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,531
it'll be taken care of.

476
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,035
Two meals?

477
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,205
Things will be fine after that.

478
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,541
What do you mean?

479
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,543
Whatever it is.

480
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,839
Looking for something you want to do
or pulling off what you're doing.

481
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:23,136
Fine. I guess you're right.

482
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,806
But I think my thoughts have become blunt.

483
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:30,977
Like my belly fat.

484
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,731
I think you're cool though.

485
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,901
What about me?

486
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,529
You don't hesitate
when you put your mind to it.

487
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,991
You take responsibility for your mistakes
and ponder on it seriously.

488
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,994
It's a really hard thing to do.

489
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:51,956
I think you're cool too.

490
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,875
What?

491
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,462
When I want someone to say
something to me,

492
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,839
it's always you who says it.

493
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,050
Right.

494
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:10,141
In that sense, I want to make a donation.

495
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,895
I have too much money.

496
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,189
It's making me lazy.

497
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,943
That conclusion is too simple.

498
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:23,321
Using my money for something meaningful
seems like an investment for myself.

499
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,908
Fine. I respect everything you do.

500
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:30,203
But others may oppose the idea.

501
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,000
That's why I won't discuss it with them.

502
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,229
"Runs away quickly to the room."

503
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,606
It's easier that way.

504
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,485
"Whooshed to the room"?
Do you call yourself a writer?

505
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,822
No one reads it like that.
You have to emphasize the whooshed part.

506
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,490
If you do, it means
"running away quickly."

507
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,409
So, "Whoosh"?

508
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,619
Not just "Whoosh." "Whoosh!"

509
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:13,997
Fine. "Whoosh,"

510
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,915
I mean, "Whoosh!"

511
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,209
But we are writers.

512
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,712
And what? "Whoosh"?

513
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,674
You should at least
make it understandable.

514
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,135
"Whooshed to the room" is
completely understandable.

515
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,305
It's easy and fun to understand.

516
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,975
As for you, you used the word...
What's this, "curmudgeonly"?

517
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,103
Who uses "curmudgeonly" nowadays?
No one even knows what this means.

518
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,230
Who says I can't use the word
young people don't know?

519
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,940
Are you looking down on old Korean words?

520
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:44,110
A writer should not take part in
destroying the Korean language.

521
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,612
But this is an action description.

522
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:49,073
If this was for a book to be published,
I would've also used "curmudgeonly."

523
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,492
I can't even pronounce it.
I would've used words like that.

524
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,662
But this is simply for the staff
and the actors to understand.

525
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,625
You...

526
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:03,129
-Get out. Whoosh out of here.
-What?

527
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,214
You're fired.

528
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,215
No.

529
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,300
This is not fair.

530
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,551
I'm not leaving.

531
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,262
-Is that so? Then I'll leave.
-What?

532
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,559
No, wait.

533
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,730
I'm not leaving,
and you're not leaving either.

534
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,231
If you insist,

535
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,027
walk over me. Walk over me softly.

536
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,451
Softly.

537
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,834
It was not an impulsive decision.

538
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,212
The employer that walked softly over

539
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,839
the poor employee

540
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:50,093
had more than enough reasons to do so.

541
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,221
The script doesn't read nicely.

542
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,848
I'm not listening.

543
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,308
I'm not listening to your advice.

544
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,188
Pride.

545
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,025
It's the dignity that protects the strong.

546
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,653
And some call it "petty" and neglect it

547
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,405
when the weak has it.

548
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,782
Hye-jeong is the one with power,

549
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:15,994
and the pride of the powerful
that has been through thick and thin

550
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:19,831
turns into two types.

551
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,459
Flexibility and obsession.

552
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,879
In this case, it's obsession.

553
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,923
That day,

554
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,926
the employee saw something
that she shouldn't have.

555
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:35,430
She saw how Hye-jeong's pride
was shattered to pieces.

556
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,057
Is that why she was fired?

557
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,893
Do you think this is too harsh?

558
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:45,398
No. It had started building up
long before this happened.

559
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,447
JIN-JOO'S VERSION

560
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,205
THE TALE OF GOLD MISS, JIN-JOO

561
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,416
SCENE 10, INSIDE DONGHWAJANG, EVENING

562
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:22,560
The pride of the powerful
has become an obsession.

563
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,480
She felt inferior so easily.

564
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:30,568
And it's impossible for her
to admit that it's the reality.

565
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:34,489
To be honest, I find Jin-joo's script
easier to read.

566
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:37,742
Right? She writes freestyle.

567
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:41,412
I grew up thinking online novels
are solid literature.

568
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:43,873
-What's so wrong with it?
-It's fun.

569
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,752
To be really honest,
isn't it hard to follow Ms. Jung's script?

570
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,587
She's a little old-fashioned.

571
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,965
Are you going to submit your piece
to the contest? Are you ready for it?

572
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,343
Don't we need Ms. Jung's permission
to do so?

573
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,887
Why? It's an individual's project.

574
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,517
Actually, I wrote a little here.

575
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:04,268
Obsession

576
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:08,231
gets rid of the ability
to look at oneself objectively.

577
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,191
And it makes one's ability

578
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,861
to maximize the weakness of the weak.

579
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,863
You... Get out.

580
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,158
WHOOSH

581
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,326
Whoosh.

582
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,831
This is so tasty.

583
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,958
This is why you never come home too often.

584
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,710
It makes me think such horrible food
tastes so nice.

585
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,882
Mom, why did you give birth to me?

586
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,176
-Why were you born?
-Because you gave birth to me.

587
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,011
-So you were born.
-Is that so?

588
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,848
You should've made me a better person.

589
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,350
Why didn't you better prepare yourself?

590
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,272
What a stress-relief!

591
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,690
I love home.

592
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,650
Let's drink.

593
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,193
-Let's drink.
-Okay, let's.

594
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,278
Cheers.

595
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,446
Dad, don't leave any drink in your glass.

596
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,991
I never had any, to begin with.
I can't tolerate alcohol.

597
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:02,743
Oh, right. I forgot about that.

598
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,246
I'm home.

599
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,374
Hey, my little sister.

600
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,294
My sister.

601
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,963
What is this?

602
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,173
All yours, sweetheart.

603
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,428
Are you crazy? I'm studying for
a public exam.

604
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,223
No one carries this to the academy.

605
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,766
You should do it then.

606
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,811
Who says a student can't have
a designer bag?

607
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,188
You didn't do anything wrong!

608
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,064
You didn't commit embezzlement

609
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,482
or monopolize the state affairs.

610
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,862
I got it for her.

611
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:41,282
Stop eating already.
You're eating too much.

612
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
Why?

613
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,411
Why are you telling me to stop eating?

614
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,663
-You've had enough.
-Why are you yelling at me?

615
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,040
You didn't exactly whisper to me.

616
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,464
Did you think I got angry? Silly.

617
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,134
I'm off. I'm going to go home
and eat more.

618
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,346
Bye.

619
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,392
Bye-bye.

620
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,401
Breathe out.

621
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,905
Feel your abs tense up as you do it.

622
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,907
Keep repeating.

623
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,166
Eun-jeong.
Why do we have to work out by body part?

624
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,335
I absolutely hate the idea.

625
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,089
That's why I'm trying
to get fatter by body part.

626
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,173
Look at me.

627
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,387
This will make my butt saggy.

628
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,431
I can feel that it's losing the muscles.

629
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,141
I'll have a piece of pig trotter.

630
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,394
And a sip of soju.

631
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,439
Now,

632
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,484
this will give me a saggy belly.

633
00:37:58,943 --> 00:37:59,902
Six-packs?

634
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:04,365
No, one-pack. I'll roll around like this

635
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,950
and have a piece of fried chicken.

636
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,744
Don't forget to drink soju
just because it's tiring.

637
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,748
Your life is so full of ups and downs.

638
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,013
Hwang In-guk.

639
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,056
In-guk. Wash your hands first.

640
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,099
Here.

641
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,316
What's the point of talking?

642
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,490
What's wrong with her
and what's wrong with you?

643
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,534
Never mind.

644
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,619
Life is full of ups and downs.

645
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,376
Han-ju, I got your favorite fried chicken.

646
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,753
Come here.

647
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:02,048
I've already had two fried chickens
as my breakfast.

648
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:05,176
This will help make your whole body firm.

649
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,262
Step up and breathe out.

650
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,098
Why must our bodies be firm?

651
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,976
Is that so? I'm firm enough.

652
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,979
My head is firm.

653
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,023
My elbows are firm too.

654
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,609
My knees are firm. Isn't that enough?

655
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,195
Feel that your muscles get tense
and repeat it.

656
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,072
But...

657
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,866
my heart isn't firm.

658
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,994
Is that not good?

659
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,913
Feel your muscles get tense

660
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,956
and use both your hands and legs.

661
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,425
Goodness.

662
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,388
You won't be able to sleep tonight.

663
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,058
Kids these days have it tough.

664
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,355
It's the adult's fault that kids
go through a lot.

665
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,982
But our kids

666
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,403
are not kids anymore.

667
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,381
What is it?

668
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,887
In the kitchen...

669
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,432
I saw cockroaches in the kitchen.

670
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,852
There are cockroaches in this apartment?

671
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,311
Yes. I saw them.

672
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,981
But that can't be.

673
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,942
I'll call the maintenance office
tomorrow morning.

674
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,403
Go and sleep for now.

675
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,171
I had a dream.

676
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,216
It was an ordinary world.

677
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,720
Or that's what it seemed like.

678
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:16,223
People going to work in the morning.

679
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,350
Students going to school.

680
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,227
The beginning of a busy day.

681
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,314
But it was a different world.

682
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,234
I'm sure I was in another world.

683
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,363
Although it seemed the same,

684
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,742
the sound of people breathing
and laughing,

685
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:38,746
the sunlight, breeze, air, and the sound
that touched my body.

686
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,956
Everything that my body felt

687
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,542
was different from before.

688
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,089
It was an ordinary morning.

689
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,636
And I woke up like any other day.

690
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,474
But what happened in this house
looked different.

691
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,314
They were having a barbecue.

692
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,026
Pork belly. Water celery.

693
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,112
That's right.

694
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:16,242
My friends were having a barbecue
with happy smiles.

695
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,205
And they told me to come.

696
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,502
It was a happy scene.

697
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,174
I took a part in it.

698
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,763
Everyone in the world

699
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:40,975
had barbecue in the morning
for their health.

700
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,731
And they enjoyed it.

701
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,156
At lunchtime, everyone participated
in the campaign

702
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,909
to eat more sodium and carbohydrate.

703
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:03,163
All kinds of jjigae that's known for
being high in sodium

704
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:06,875
made Korea proud along with hangul.

705
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,920
Budaejjigae was selected as

706
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,339
one of the top ten superfoods

707
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,425
and it made the world
fall in love with Korean food.

708
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,638
After this, the people
still needed more calories.

709
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:23,601
So at dinner, in order to
hit the calorie quota,

710
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,270
people gathered at bars and restaurants

711
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,439
in small groups to get food and drinks.

712
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:33,193
All the restaurants were crowded
all night long.

713
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,779
Back at home.

714
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,032
To support the late-night snack campaign,

715
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
the government sponsored
the cost of the late-night snack

716
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,411
such as pig trotter and boiled pork.

717
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:46,624
Of course, most of the citizens
diligently ordered late-night snacks.

718
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,419
Every parent in the world
taught their children

719
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,130
that to become a great person,

720
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,883
they had to eat
as much junk food as possible,

721
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,595
like pizza, hamburger, or instant noodles.

722
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:04,516
Keeping these rules without an exception.

723
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:08,479
That's what people called "morals."

724
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,065
There was no such thing as obesity

725
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,442
or any lifestyle diseases.

726
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,903
I was an ordinary person.

727
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,780
That night,

728
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,075
I had as much fried chicken, trotter,
and soju as much as I wanted.

729
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,285
That's how I was able to

730
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:26,330
stay slim and healthy.

731
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,374
-Touch, breathe out.
-And...

732
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,460
-Breathe out.
-I woke up from my dream.

733
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:34,421
What is it? Cockroaches again?

734
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,340
I've called the maintenance office,
so hide for now.

735
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,280
Yes, this is the maintenance office.

736
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,117
Hi, I called about the cockroaches
a while ago.

737
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,702
Oh, okay. We're getting ready...

738
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,954
No, it's okay now.

739
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,915
Sorry? It's okay now?

740
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,500
Yes, I was mistaken. It was...

741
00:45:12,334 --> 00:45:13,419
some rectangular object.

742
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:17,047
Sorry? What has that got to do
with a cockroach?

743
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,384
-Anyway, it's fine now. I'm sorry.
-Okay.

744
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,863
In-guk. How long have you been in there?

745
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,031
Must you go this far to be late to school?

746
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,875
When you're in an anxious
and unstable state,

747
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,710
you should make yourself

748
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:57,254
more relaxed and more anxious.

749
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:00,090
It'll make you more attentive

750
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,092
and broaden your thoughts.

751
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:05,262
It may sound pretentious,

752
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:08,348
but relaxing like this
isn't a bad thing to do.

753
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,309
Or that's what I'm going to think.

754
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,979
That this won't bring me down.

755
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,248
You're spacing out too often these days.

756
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,920
Hey, what is going on?

757
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,338
What do you mean?

758
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:42,216
-I was reading a script.
-And what about it?

759
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,093
How many words do you see here?

760
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,763
What are you saying?
Why are you counting that?

761
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:51,225
I see just two words. "Not fun."

762
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,936
It's our job to make what's "not fun"
a fun thing to watch.

763
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,312
That's nothing new.

764
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,150
Here.

765
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,320
Another script.

766
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,948
I read this when I was a judge
of a writing contest a while ago.

767
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,784
How should I explain this?
It's a little surprising.

768
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,869
-"Surprising"?
-Yes.

769
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,664
It's all over the place and raw,

770
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,123
but it's a good read altogether.

771
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,250
Did this win an award?

772
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,877
I supported it, but the elders
didn't approve.

773
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,047
Hearing that makes me interested.

774
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,466
"Things Will Be Fine
Once You Turn Thirty."

775
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:25,842
The title is...

776
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:30,013
-vague but I like it.
-Right?

777
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,807
I know this name.

778
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,850
Well, it's a common name after all.

779
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,354
But "Lim" isn't a common surname.

780
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,356
Lim Ha-ryong, Lim Chae-moo.

781
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:42,109
Lim Chang-jung, Lim Jae-beom,
Lim Jong-seok.

782
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,819
The Silence of Lim.

783
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,112
The War of Limjin.

784
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:48,282
Okay, it's common. Anyway, give it a read.

785
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,965
What do you think? Did you read it?

786
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,592
-Yes.
-What do you think?

787
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:08,635
It's surprising.

788
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,681
Shall I work on it? I think it'll be fun.

789
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,308
No, don't. It's not that good.

790
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:16,893
You think so?
I kind of want to work on it.

791
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,770
That's why you never make a hit.

792
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,189
-Is it? Should I not do it?
-Don't do it.

793
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,587
You can get lost from time to time.

794
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,173
And the shorter it lasts the better.

795
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,968
Who knows? I might get a call tomorrow.

796
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,722
"Ms. Lim, you won the writing contest.

797
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,725
It'll be a 16-episode drama."

798
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,854
Let's write. That's what a writer does.

799
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,231
Let's write.

800
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:46,733
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

801
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,686
It's a gift.

802
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:33,447
What kind of a jerk is he?
He called me out of nowhere.

803
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,708
Hello?

804
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,209
I heard you got fired.

805
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,920
Did you call me to congratulate me?

806
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,380
What do you want?

807
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,383
Didn't you enjoy the meal
at the cafeteria here?

808
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,970
It was rather fun.
There were things to look at.

809
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,264
Then come look around again.

810
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,145
What was that?

811
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,320
I heard Beom-su rejected you.

812
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,447
How did you find that out?

813
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,365
You've been telling everybody.

814
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:20,911
It really hurts.

815
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,873
Yeah, I can tell.
I'm only asking out of curiosity.

816
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,209
-You're not interested in me, are you?
-Of course not.

817
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,174
Go.

818
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,641
There's nothing fun to watch today.
How did it go?

819
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,227
I talked her out of it.

820
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,603
You see,

821
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:49,022
I don't do love.

822
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:52,150
I heard that's what schoolkids say
these days.

823
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:53,485
Why not?

824
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,488
Because it doesn't exist.

825
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,661
-And what's wrong with her?
-It means she's annoyed.

826
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,121
-But she winked.
-She says I annoy her now.

827
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,126
I should learn from her.

828
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,003
Why do you hate her though?

829
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,964
She's ugly.

830
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,176
-How exactly?
-You're way prettier.

831
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,473
No. That makes it weirder. I'm pretty.

832
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,809
-I know. I said that.
-No. Say I'm ugly.

833
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,143
Why?

834
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:29,813
You're pretty.

835
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:30,856
Jeez!

836
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,525
All right, I get it. Stop it, sir.

837
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,360
This isn't your face, so shut it already.

838
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,405
How you switch so naturally
from casual to formal is amazing.

839
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,823
It's very catchy.

840
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,078
Okay. I'll be careful.

841
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:48,623
Let's stop talking about how others look
and get to work.

842
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,834
Work on what? I got fired.

843
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,836
Do you still think
I'm an assistant writer?

844
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,588
I'm an ordinary person now.

845
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,214
I'm someone who can criticize your work

846
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:57,757
on social media as much as I want.

847
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,092
That's who I am now.

848
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,346
I'm telling you to come back to this side.

849
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,309
Things Will Be Fine Once You Turn Thirty.

850
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:10,186
I found it interesting.

851
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:12,188
My heart...

852
00:53:12,647 --> 00:53:13,690
It hopped.

853
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,235
Do you want to work on it with me?

854
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,779
At that moment,

855
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,157
I almost asked "Why?"
but I didn't and thought about it.

856
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,534
Let's not think that this is
an unexpected opportunity.

857
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:26,870
I've been preparing for this moment.

858
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:30,457
I'm getting this feeling of responsibility

859
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,667
because I am facing

860
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:36,421
the first official opportunity in my life.

861
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,715
I feel like I've become a true adult

862
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:41,092
at the age of 30.

863
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,053
Why are you being a baby?

864
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:46,473
All the things I said in my life.

865
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:50,852
Those unfiltered and embarrassing
expressions

866
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,189
came across my mind.

867
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,149
You're wrong. Get lost. Put it away.

868
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:59,736
I must give him the answer as the adult

869
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,947
the society has approved of.

870
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:05,617
The words of an adult
that is nicely refined.

871
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,162
How much will I get?

872
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,458
I know the market price,

873
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,211
but since you'll be working on it,
I got curious.

874
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,265
Is this not right?

875
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,838
-These two.
-What?

876
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,966
I like them both, and they are similar.

877
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,093
What are you on about?

878
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:08,388
They are both funny, sweet, and handsome.

879
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,808
And they look only at me. Continuously.

880
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,811
They keep looking at me.

881
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,646
I see.

882
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,649
I was so busy meeting their eyes.

883
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,776
What should I do?

884
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,653
Which one do you like better?

885
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,489
You didn't know? I guess you didn't.

886
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:28,658
They are seeing someone.

887
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,660
What about it? Don't be so lame.

888
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,872
I mean, they are seeing each other.

889
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:35,874
What are you talking about?
I can steal the guys.

890
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,001
-No. The two are dating.
-The two are what?

891
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,670
They are dating each other.

892
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:42,505
You mean the two are dating one girl?

893
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,467
The two are together.

894
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:46,926
What?

895
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,845
Everyone in this industry knows.

896
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:51,681
But then, you might not know.

897
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,433
The two are dating?

898
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,101
Yes, they've been together for a while.

899
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:34,099
Do you know what makes the city lonely?

900
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:38,812
The lights of the buildings
replace the stars.

901
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:42,190
And the people on that planet
don't know me.

902
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,692
You're a celebrity. Everyone knows you.

903
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,780
Hey, step on it.

904
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,949
Go faster. I'm sleepy.

905
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,330
I said to step on it!

906
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,791
All right. Hold tight.

907
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,337
Put your seat belt on.

908
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:33,992
I cried a lot

909
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:38,580
In the past days

910
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:43,042
I was alone and lonely

911
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:47,046
That's how I felt

912
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:52,552
Somebody said this

913
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:57,056
Life is like

914
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,603
An unending

915
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:05,732
And continuous journey

916
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:12,363
You may take a break when it's hard

917
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:16,701
Your feet are lost

918
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:20,538
They don't know where to go

919
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:25,001
-They try to understand
-They try to understand

920
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:29,631
-And put together the broken pieces
-And put together the broken pieces

921
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:33,384
Walk the road

922
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:38,973
Of days gone past

923
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:43,520
-Toward the beautiful place
-Toward the beautiful place

924
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:48,024
-The sunset has colored
-The sunset has colored

925
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,611
I don't do love.

926
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:52,820
Why not?

927
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,240
Because it doesn't exist.

928
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,324
I like you.

929
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,867
Let's make this work.

930
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,620
-What about my happiness?
-Why are you asking me

931
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,829
about your happiness?

932
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,499
Ha-yun, I like you!

933
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:05,542
Bitch.

934
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,377
You'll find a way

935
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:11,798
not to get poked or get hurt.

936
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:14,968
-I'm not annoyed. Help me up.
-Just stay there!

937
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,469
Hug me.

938
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:19,013
I'm exhausted.

939
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,559
Don't be ignorant
unless you're going to break up.

940
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,977
Don't be ignorant.

941
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,522
Is Hwan-dong
your unfulfilled love, Ms. Lim?

942
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:30,608
Mr. Son, do you like Jin-joo?

943
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,444
Filming the memories of you and Ms. Lim

944
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:35,822
would make me feel jealous, won't it?

945
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,574
Why do you keep making
your life miserable?

946
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,618
Stop staying away from your loved one.

947
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,247
Don't think about whether
your love will last a day or forever.

948
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:47,208
Even if your heart is ready
to last forever.

949
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:49,210
Humans are mortal beings.

950
00:59:50,503 --> 00:59:51,879
Stop wasting your time.

951
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,173
-May I kiss you?
-Pardon?

952
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,140
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM DO-YEON

953
01:00:10,231 --> 01:00:14,485
Even if my steps

954
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:18,072
Are slow

955
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:25,121
I'm one of the crowd

956
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:27,457
That are walking

957
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:33,129
My only name

958
01:00:33,212 --> 01:00:36,591
My heart

959
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:41,179
-Treasure it
-Treasure it

960
01:00:41,262 --> 01:00:46,434
-I want you to protect it
-I want you to protect it

961
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,900
