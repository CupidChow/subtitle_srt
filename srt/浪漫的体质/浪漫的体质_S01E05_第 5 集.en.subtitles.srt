1
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:40,999
All right then.

2
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:44,669
Let's find out more about literary trends.

3
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,839
-The trend of literature...
-It was love.

4
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,968
A literary trend
has two general definitions.

5
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,723
One is the change of thought
behind literary arts throughout history.

6
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,308
And the other

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,353
has more to do with the means
of expression in literary arts.

8
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,792
That's it for today.

9
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,044
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

10
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,266
-Let's go to eat.
-I'm on a diet.

11
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:46,940
Do you want to eat with me?

12
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,567
Pardon? I mean...

13
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,653
Me?

14
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,988
My friend who usually eats with me
didn't come today.

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,281
Let's go.

16
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:57,826
Okay.

17
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,369
What do you like?

18
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:01,996
Tteokbokki?

19
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,342
-I guess you like spicy food.
-What?

20
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,470
Well... I do.

21
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:18,888
-Wheat tteok?
-Yes.

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,557
With plenty of soup in it.

23
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,934
Right. I like to mash
the egg yolk in the soup.

24
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,561
And it should have
artificial flavors in it.

25
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,855
With some pickled radish.

26
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,905
I was going to eat alone.

27
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,699
Me too.

28
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,033
Don't you have friends?

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:40,702
I don't have a lot.

30
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,830
But in a few years,

31
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,206
I think

32
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:48,042
eating and drinking alone
could become a new trend.

33
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,378
What kind of trend is that?

34
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,672
Then you mean
there will be restaurants or bars

35
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,923
where people eat and drink alone?

36
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,717
That sounds a little strange.

37
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,762
Maybe not a trend,
but it will be something we find familiar.

38
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,599
-It sounds heartless.
-I know.

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,684
I guess you're right.

40
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,647
Thank you for asking me to eat with you.

41
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,943
I wanted to eat with you.

42
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,907
I see.

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,745
Can I ask you why?

44
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,706
-Why did you quit the club?
-What?

45
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,000
-Because I did first.
-Right.

46
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,627
Why did you change
your liberal arts class?

47
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,338
You did it to see me.

48
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:45,725
Soju?

49
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,311
That's what I've been drinking.

50
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,397
I guess you like bitter stuff.

51
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,149
Yes, I do.

52
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,276
Something bitter in broad daylight?

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,070
I didn't think
I could pluck up my courage.

54
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:03,910
Now that I did something,
it's your turn to make a move.

55
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,748
How much soju gets you tipsy?

56
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:10,458
Half a bottle?

57
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,086
Drink it a little more.

58
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,393
All right.

59
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,478
Now you can tell me what you want to say.

60
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,616
I like you.

61
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,244
DAY 1 OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP

62
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:47,620
In fact,

63
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,124
tteokbokki is more sweet than spicy.

64
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,793
And soju is not bitter but sweet.

65
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,755
But I don't think that's the reason

66
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,091
why our kiss was so sweet.

67
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,135
It was love.

68
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,308
Do you know

69
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,019
what a woman's eyes look like
when she is in love with a man?

70
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,562
What do they look like?

71
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,530
Do you know what a man's nose looks like
when he is in love with a woman?

72
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,740
What does it look like?

73
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,496
Don't do that.

74
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,541
DAY 50

75
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:36,461
Countless words that we exchanged

76
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:40,381
were just some silly words
that were randomly put together,

77
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,759
but they were
the sweetest whispers in the world.

78
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,721
FORGIVENESS COUPON

79
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,893
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

80
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,690
And we were given justification
for all our behaviors

81
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,902
that were just childish and immature.

82
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,082
-Did you enjoy your class?
-Yes.

83
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,795
I'll go throw up.

84
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,130
I'll come with you.

85
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,551
It was only the witnesses
who felt uncomfortable.

86
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,970
We were always like that.

87
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,099
And over time,
"always" became "once in a while."

88
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,100
I said sorry!

89
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,060
-Forget it.
-It happened once in a while.

90
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,103
Hey.

91
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,896
-Get off me.
-And we fought once in a while, too.

92
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,481
-Let go of me.
-I said I'm sorry.

93
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,566
I said let go. Get off me!

94
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,361
Okay.

95
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:49,450
FORGIVENESS COUPON

96
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:13,182
DAY 300

97
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,227
One day, we implicitly came to believe

98
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,980
that fights wouldn't lead to a breakup.

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,859
The belief put us at ease.

100
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:27,280
And, ironically, being at ease made us
not tolerate each other's differences

101
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,949
like we used to do in the beginning.

102
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,494
That's how our fights repeated

103
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,580
and got fierce.

104
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,790
No,

105
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,584
it became pathetic.

106
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,061
What do you want to say?
Why are you frowning again?

107
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,773
You don't know what I was about to say.
Why are you throwing tantrums?

108
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,151
I just held your hand.
I didn't throw tantrums.

109
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,819
I held your hand first.

110
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,279
You never apologize first.

111
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,782
Does it really matter who did wrong
and who apologized first?

112
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,576
Why don't you study statistics?

113
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,578
You didn't even text me
when you got home on Friday.

114
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,579
Why did you not text me?

115
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,331
Why would you bring that up?

116
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,833
I was saying you throw tantrums
and never apologize.

117
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,002
We should finish talking about your flaws

118
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,087
before moving on to talking about mine.

119
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,215
When I didn't apologize,
I was too tired to do so.

120
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,967
You were the one
who freaked out and criticized me.

121
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,053
I was like that only once.

122
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,347
I said we should finish
talking about your flaws first.

123
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,767
You drank until late at night
and didn't answer my calls

124
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,352
until the next afternoon.

125
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,895
Did you not hear me?

126
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,730
Finish talking about yourself first.

127
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,524
Why does it even matter?

128
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,150
Of course it matters.

129
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,027
Do you really have to say that
holding my hand?

130
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,153
Let go of it then.

131
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,781
Don't you dare leave. Then we're over.

132
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,790
DAY 500

133
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,267
Hey!

134
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:21,769
It's raining.

135
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:43,165
DAY 800

136
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,672
It was a wound that required a bandage

137
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,091
but we tried to seal it
with a small Band-Aid.

138
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,554
Can we stop walking?

139
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,265
We should have a walk
when there's no fine dust.

140
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,893
You could've just said so.
What are you so annoyed about?

141
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,062
I wasn't annoyed, I was just saying.

142
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,231
Then why are you frowning?

143
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:10,776
Do you think I can't tell
whether you're annoyed or not?

144
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,111
What's your problem?

145
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,572
I told you. I want to stop walking.

146
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,365
So you do have a problem.

147
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,576
You were annoyed.

148
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,620
You weren't just saying it.

149
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,789
Do you want me to admit
that I threw a tantrum?

150
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,666
Is it what you want right now?

151
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,670
You are always like that. What's
your problem? Does it run in your blood?

152
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,755
Run in my blood?

153
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,257
Are you petty
because it runs in your blood?

154
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,259
Petty?

155
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,970
Then you shouldn't see me.

156
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,222
-Did you say you want to break up with me?
-You said that.

157
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,516
No. Just say it.
You want to break up with me, right?

158
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,436
-You tell me. You want to break up.
-You say it.

159
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,480
Okay. Let's break up. Let's just do it.

160
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,274
-You want to break up with me?
-Yes. Did you not get it?

161
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,318
Don't you understand Korean?
Shall I speak in English?

162
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,819
Go ahead and say it in English.

163
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,365
Get lost!

164
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,535
What? Thank you? Hey.

165
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,914
"Thank you?" Say that again.
Are you thankful?

166
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,585
Say that again. "Thank you?"
Is that what you're supposed to say?

167
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,921
Why? I can't say that when you can?

168
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,590
That's what you said to me
last time we broke up.

169
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,062
A FEW DAYS AFTER DAY 900

170
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,313
We struggled.

171
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,524
We struggled to hold back,

172
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,653
breaking up and getting back together
over and over again for no reason.

173
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,989
And we got the hang of breaking up
with only one word.

174
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,908
DONE

175
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,284
DONE

176
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,703
DONE

177
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,831
HEY

178
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:50,584
HEY

179
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,211
WHAT

180
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,672
And we also learned to get back together

181
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,674
with only one word, too.

182
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,117
By the time we started to see

183
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:25,911
restaurants and bars
where people eat and drink alone,

184
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:30,708
we finally broke up for real.

185
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,046
Two nights ago,

186
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,675
my friend saw you...

187
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:41,969
at a motel.

188
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,183
Do you have anything to say?

189
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,856
I believed it wasn't love

190
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:57,860
when we broke up
slashing at each other's heart,

191
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,613
even when it seemed like
they wouldn't be wounded anymore.

192
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:04,867
I believed it wasn't love
after we had become numb over time.

193
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,536
But it turns out what I wanted to believe

194
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,207
was a persistent lie
that I hid deep down in my heart.

195
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,584
Love may change,

196
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,878
but the truth doesn't.

197
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,214
It was love.

198
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,301
But the reason I cried yesterday...

199
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,595
It's not because I'm not over him.

200
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,847
It's that I can't forget my heartaches.

201
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,518
It means I'm not over myself, not him.

202
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,938
I spent most of my 20s with only one man.

203
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,565
It just made me feel sad.

204
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,942
That's it.

205
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,738
Come to think of it, you spent the time
when you were prettiest on the outside

206
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,074
with Hwan-dong who was at his lowest.

207
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,535
What? Now is the time when I'm prettiest.

208
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:50,829
What makes you think that?

209
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,165
My mental attitude.

210
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,127
-She needs to be compensated.
-Compensated?

211
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,839
She felt happy anyway
during that time, didn't she?

212
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,551
I don't think it's something
that requires compensation.

213
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,804
And it's not like women are the only ones
who are prettiest in their 20s.

214
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,932
Don't you think it was the same
for Hwan-dong as well?

215
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,643
Well... I guess he'd feel that way
if he was gay.

216
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:16,313
I mean, he must be a precious son
to his family anyway.

217
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,274
You're usually on our side,

218
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,860
but you change your position
when we speak ill of a cute guy.

219
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,778
Does Mun-su know that you're like this?

220
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,989
Yes. That's why he likes me.

221
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,243
Fine. Let's say it isn't something
that requires compensation.

222
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:33,330
But I'd like to question
the barbaric perspective

223
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:36,375
of believing that the value of women

224
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,627
-depends on their appearance.
-All of a sudden?

225
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,840
Men should never be with beautiful women
if they approach them with such beliefs.

226
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,967
We, who are beautiful on the outside,

227
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,928
should teach them that. Get ready.

228
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,307
What? Get ready for what?

229
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,559
I think we are going to a club.

230
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,562
Look after In-guk for me.

231
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,480
I can't believe them.

232
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,901
Why would they go to a club
after talking about their past love?

233
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,778
It was all planned out, right?

234
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,658
Are you guys kidding me?

235
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,715
Eun-jeong.

236
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,927
Why aren't guys chatting us up?

237
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:13,889
I don't know. Are we supposed
to sign up for something?

238
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,408
-That's enough.
-Get off me.

239
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
-Let's talk outside.
-I told you to let go of me.

240
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,799
The fish bit at the bait.
My external beauty is

241
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,969
just irresistible to those ignorant fish.

242
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,762
I'm a true fisherwoman in a city.

243
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,847
What are you doing?

244
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,683
What am I supposed to say

245
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:01,687
if he asks me what I'm doing
when I'm dancing?

246
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,690
Deviation.

247
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,703
Who are you here with?

248
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:19,663
My boyfriend.

249
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,971
You're pretty. Can I join you?

250
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,932
I have a kid.

251
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,518
I see. Good for you.

252
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,831
What?

253
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,210
Why is this so good?
I thought 24-hour joints sucked.

254
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,880
I know. We just found a good restaurant.

255
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,008
It feels like we're out to eat this.

256
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,428
Shall we order some suyuk too?

257
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,972
Sure.

258
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,727
-One suyuk please.
-Okay.

259
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,148
Can I eat now?

260
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,442
-Are you done?
-Yes.

261
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,825
Raise your glasses.

262
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,536
All right. Come on.

263
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,747
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

264
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,639
This is so good.

265
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,481
Gosh, I'm so full.

266
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,651
It was really nice.

267
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,909
Have we gotten too old?

268
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
We've gotten too much food,
that's for sure.

269
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,246
Gosh, I'm full.

270
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:30,377
Well... When guys tried to talk to us

271
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,547
in the club, it was a little...

272
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
It was annoying.

273
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,887
Maybe that's because
we've reached that social age

274
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,931
where we want a relationship
only with those whom we can trust.

275
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,601
Our senses are sending us signals
as they recognize

276
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,102
our lives get closer to the end.

277
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,564
"Don't waste your time
on those whom you can't trust."

278
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,859
"That's more stamina-efficient."
Things like that.

279
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:59,448
Isn't it just a prejudice against a club?

280
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,576
There could be good people in a club.

281
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,079
We don't know how to have fun,

282
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,873
and now we're just overanalyzing.

283
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,876
If people saw us,
they'd think we're ridiculous.

284
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,173
I'm tired anyway.

285
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:17,841
I shouldn't have gone to a club.

286
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,927
I just wanted

287
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,638
to try something like
getting myself out of a rut.

288
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,181
It's like refreshing myself.

289
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,516
Just date a guy.

290
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,062
There' no love.

291
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,107
A loveless relationship.
Regular escape from a rut.

292
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,151
How meaningful is that?

293
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,989
You know what? Love is...

294
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,117
like bangs.

295
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,120
You're crazy.

296
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,635
Hey, why do you seem so uneasy?

297
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,472
I have something to worry about.

298
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,766
All of a sudden?

299
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,978
Yes. I just got one all of a sudden.

300
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,524
She does seem serious.

301
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,860
I guess it's nothing.

302
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,905
Why?

303
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,825
Did some guy hold your hand in the club?

304
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:28,745
I guess they broke up.

305
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,789
What?

306
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,749
I'm sure they did.

307
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,544
No. It's not that easy.

308
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,587
I see.

309
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,508
That day,

310
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,720
I told her we should break up.

311
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,856
I did say that.

312
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,818
Why did you try to break up with her?

313
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,948
-Because I'm petty.
-What?

314
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,330
Ha-yun was... Her name is Ha-yun.

315
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:54,748
Okay, what did Ha-yun do?

316
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,793
She tried really hard to get a job,

317
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,045
but she kept failing.

318
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,380
I see, employment.

319
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,216
Then she opened a small clothing store.

320
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,717
And it didn't go well.

321
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,513
She was very stressed out,

322
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:12,224
and started to drink more often.

323
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,060
I should've made her depend on me
when she had a hard time,

324
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,104
but I made her depend on alcohol instead.

325
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,189
Is that why you think you're petty?

326
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,945
I'm speaking ill of my girlfriend again.

327
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,446
This is petty, isn't it?

328
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,991
It's just what people do in life.

329
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,663
Let me ask you a silly question.

330
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,124
When your loved one is having a hard time,

331
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,544
and if your hug doesn't help her,

332
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,671
what else could I do?

333
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,555
Give her money.
A hug is just a consolation.

334
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,390
You have to spend money to solve problems.

335
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,643
Let's just drop it.

336
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,230
You should stop worrying about
others' problems as if they're yours.

337
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,773
Aren't you busy looking out for yourself?

338
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,692
It's not even your business.

339
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,193
Actually,

340
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,989
I saw her at the club.

341
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,116
Should I tell him that?

342
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,326
She could go to clubs.
Why are you being so petty?

343
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,369
But

344
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,329
she was kissing some guy.

345
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,709
Well... She could do that. I understand.

346
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,002
A man and a woman met a club.

347
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,462
It's not like they met
at the inter-Korean summit.

348
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,006
They couldn't just hold each other's hand

349
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,966
and hop over to see each other's friends.

350
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,551
That doesn't sound right. They could kiss.

351
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,597
When we got out
of the seolleongtang restaurant,

352
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,267
I saw her going into a hotel with the guy.

353
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,230
Sure, they could have
gone there by accident.

354
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,649
Hey, let's say

355
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,027
your boyfriend saw you
go into a hotel with a guy

356
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,196
and asked you about it.
What would you say?

357
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,574
"Oh, that? It was a mistake.
I thought it was a subway station."

358
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,327
Then what about your boyfriend?
"I see. It was a mistake.

359
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,037
You thought it was
a five-star subway station.

360
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,289
I shouldn't have worried.
I'm sorry I doubted you.

361
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,749
I love you." Would he say that?

362
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,083
Just tell him to break up with her.

363
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,461
Why do you keep talking about it
as if you're a stranger?

364
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,129
Because I am.

365
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,677
So what should I do?

366
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,972
Should I tell him or not?

367
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,683
You should tell him right away
and criticize her.

368
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,019
You have to trash talk
the guy she was with as well.

369
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:23,396
People tend to miss out on the dicks
when they're with the sluts,

370
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,357
because dicks have always been dicks.

371
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,900
There are a lot of dicks out there.

372
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,779
But when they see a slut,
they always make a big deal out of it.

373
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:34,074
And dicks always slut-shame the sluts
like the shameless dicks they are--

374
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,700
Hey, that's enough. Stop.

375
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,870
You sound like a lunatic.

376
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,541
Eun-jeong, what do you think?

377
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,918
It's killing me.

378
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,379
All right. Let's approach the matter
from the humanistic view.

379
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,757
I believe history and art are
part of the humanities.

380
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,509
For example, women were always treated

381
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:55,053
like trophies in the history of war.

382
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,513
-But paradoxically--
-Stop it.

383
00:25:58,181 --> 00:26:01,476
I'm not talking about whether dicks
and sluts are worthy of existence.

384
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,436
I think what matters is
the ratio by which they exist.

385
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,480
In order to understand that,
we should think about--

386
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:06,564
Stop it.

387
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:11,278
That's it. Just forget about it.

388
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,282
I should get going.

389
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,077
Hey, just mind your own business.

390
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,745
You have a 30kg burden on your shoulders.

391
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,289
-30kg?
-It's In-guk's weight.

392
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,581
Gosh.

393
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,084
Don't get intimidated just yet.

394
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,003
You are still twice his weight.

395
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,088
Are you crazy? I'm only 54kg.

396
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,053
See you.

397
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,349
I should start worrying about myself now.

398
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,726
Didn't you finish episode three yet?

399
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,644
-I'm done.
-Then what?

400
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,566
A writer's worries begin a new phase
after completion of a manuscript.

401
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,926
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY
EPISODE 3

402
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,351
Judging from your face,
I can tell it will take a long time.

403
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,979
All right. Go ahead and criticize it.

404
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,691
I already ate something sweet,
so I'm sure I won't pass out.

405
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,111
It's bad, but it's good.

406
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,739
What's that? Is it a new way of criticism?

407
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,575
I have a lot to say as it's bad, but it's
not like they are serious problems.

408
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:42,994
So I guess we can talk about it later.

409
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,372
Why would we talk about it later?
Did our project got postponed?

410
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,539
Yes.

411
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,501
It's not like this script won a contest.

412
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,795
We can't say anything
if the director doesn't like it.

413
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,047
-Did he reject the project?
-Yes.

414
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,219
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

415
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,182
"Intention of project?"

416
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,060
I revised your proposal a little
to make it sound cooler.

417
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,353
You should take a look at it.

418
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,189
If there's anything
you want to change, don't.

419
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,108
Mine is better.

420
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,193
I'm fine with it.

421
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,779
I guess I've gotten used
to you being annoying.

422
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,198
And I've gotten used
to you being a poor writer.

423
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,662
I wish I could knock you out like this
like they do in the movies.

424
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,955
It could've been really useful.

425
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,958
If our drama goes well,
I'll let you try it once.

426
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,084
Cool.

427
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,963
But why did you do all this?
We already had a proposal.

428
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,298
We have to do a presentation.

429
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,260
To be exact, it's more like persuasion.

430
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,637
We didn't get our drama to be aired.

431
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,889
We don't even have
a production company for this yet.

432
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,435
I have news that's fun but sad.

433
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,523
I guess I should brace myself
for that. Go ahead.

434
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,360
-Ms. Jung Hye-jeong--
-That's interesting.

435
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,447
She said she'd quit
if our drama got aired in this channel.

436
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,531
I see.

437
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,783
That's sad.

438
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:06,369
Surprisingly, we have no time
to be shocked.

439
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,663
I'm not shocked.

440
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,165
I'm just jealous.

441
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,627
-Of what?
-I mean, she's confident enough

442
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,006
to do such an immature thing
without reserve.

443
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:22,135
I want to thrive so I can do
any immature thing I want.

444
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,305
I'll change as soon as I succeed.
I'll be childish and arrogant.

445
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:28,183
Whatever you become, I guess
it will be better than what you're now.

446
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:33,354
Anyway, all you need to do is
keep your way and focus on your writing.

447
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,023
I'll do the presentation.

448
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,485
What makes you feel so confident?

449
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,321
When you see a drama,

450
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:46,534
there are executives
sitting in a long and big meeting room.

451
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,744
There's even a beam projector.

452
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,622
And the protagonist makes
an unrealistically great presentation.

453
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:53,458
The unrealistic protagonist
actually exists.

454
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,462
It's me.

455
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,548
It's surprising, isn't it?

456
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,512
It is quite surprising
how a person could brag this much.

457
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,641
There should be a documentary
about a man like this.

458
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,353
A documentary?

459
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,149
Let me make it easier to understand.
Do you know Old Partner?

460
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,194
-The one with a cow?
-Yes. It's something like that.

461
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,987
Will you film it until I die then?

462
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,405
No, it's not like that.

463
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,408
I'm joking. Is it
something like I Live Alone?

464
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,620
Well... If you live alone,
it might be part of the movie.

465
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,746
As long as you agree.

466
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,540
Then I can't bring my boyfriend home.

467
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,461
-Are you seeing someone?
-No, but I might start seeing someone.

468
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,839
Are you worried already
when you don't even have a boyfriend?

469
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:43,925
It will be fun. Can I be
promiscuous in the movie?

470
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,720
-Are you promiscuous?
-No. But I might change.

471
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,722
Are you worried already
even before you change?

472
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,100
So are you going to film me?

473
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,143
No, I'm in charge of production.

474
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:57,730
The director should be here in a minute.

475
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,858
Director Lee Eun-jeong will be in charge.

476
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,360
Lee Eun-jeong? Did you say Lee Eun-jeong?

477
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:05,071
Yes. Director Lee Eun-jeong is interested
in this project.

478
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,656
I'm not interested though.

479
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,534
You two have gotten close
during the TV show.

480
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,036
-Hello.
-Hey.

481
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,955
I enjoyed your show.
Please have a seat here.

482
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,707
Don't. We need to talk.

483
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,756
Does she want to fight it out
on the rooftop or something?

484
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,687
Don't reject it. I won't even
try to convince you.

485
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,939
You mean, there are
a lot of actresses besides me?

486
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,775
There aren't many actresses,
but I'm just not that desperate.

487
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:43,902
You don't sound desperate.

488
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,405
Right. Sometimes I beg in the middle
of a project because of what I've done.

489
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,740
And I do sound desperate.

490
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,825
But I'm not like that
before I start a project.

491
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,453
I don't want to lose from the beginning.
So I just don't do it.

492
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,788
So you're just saying
that you easily give up.

493
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,041
Sometimes I feel rich when I give up.

494
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:02,712
It's not something anyone can do.
I enjoy giving up.

495
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,591
-You do sound rich.
-Well, my thought is.

496
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,012
Fine. It's just business.
Why do you want me in your documentary?

497
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,765
-You're interesting.
-Am I interesting?

498
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:16,476
Yes. You're humane in many ways.

499
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,977
And you have cute flaws.

500
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:22,482
-Are you saying I'm stupid?
-Not entirely.

501
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,485
But you mean it in some way.

502
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,029
It's not like
I didn't feel that way at all.

503
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,741
-What's that supposed to mean?
-It means you're charming.

504
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,494
-Is that true?
-Will you do it if it is true?

505
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:38,122
I wasn't going to reject it
from the beginning. What's the title?

506
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,124
A Woman, An Actress.

507
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,961
-Can't it be I'm Lee So-min?
-No.

508
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,383
I've been exercising my hips, so they look
amazing. Will you film me in a shower?

509
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,467
No.

510
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,552
-My ex-boyfriends--
-No.

511
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,262
-Brazilian--
-No.

512
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:04,482
You can't make money like that.

513
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,818
Others are dying to film something spicy.

514
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,904
I thought you'd like something mysterious.

515
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm already not mysterious.

516
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,658
You criticize yourself too.

517
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,121
I appear in a lot of dramas and TV shows.
Once I stop doing that,

518
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,541
people just think I'm losing popularity.
It doesn't seem mysterious at all.

519
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,296
Thank you. I want to make a documentary
about your concerns like that.

520
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,468
Now that we're at it,
we should make it more lucrative.

521
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,179
This isn't just about money.

522
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,514
What is it about then?

523
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,350
It's about filming someone
and showing it to people.

524
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,227
We can think and talk about it together.

525
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,603
Why should we do that?

526
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,689
To make people's lives better.

527
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,399
Why would you try to do that?

528
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,900
There are a lot of bad people out there.

529
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,652
A lesser evil should talk more about it

530
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,155
so the next generation will be
effected by the lesser evil.

531
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,992
Then it's important to make them
watch more of it than to talk more.

532
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,329
I guess it's important.

533
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,041
But what matters is how we talk
with what purpose--

534
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:03,958
So what?

535
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,460
You want to make art, is that it?

536
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,379
But according to what you just said,
isn't art supposed to be bad?

537
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,174
It tries to hide
what people can understand or recognize.

538
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,010
It tries to be nobler
than popular communication.

539
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,846
It tries to stay in a peculiar position.
Doesn't it come down to that?

540
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,724
I think they are right,
and you are right as well, but...

541
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,352
By the way, you're one smooth talker.

542
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,979
Why are you so good without a script?

543
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,177
It's okay. Leave her be.

544
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,182
She never drools down her chin.

545
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,523
Why is she being like this to me?

546
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,359
Well... It's like a self-introduction.

547
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,320
-Self-introduction?
-She likes a walk in a park.

548
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,490
She thinks intense exercise
gives her wrinkles.

549
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:19,117
So she only likes to walk.

550
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,452
She goes to a hair salon almost every day.

551
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,581
She feels comfortable when someone
touches her hair in front of a mirror.

552
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,417
That's why she often gives
honest words in a hair salon.

553
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,753
She also likes to go to the bank.

554
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,214
She feels like
someone's taking her money out,

555
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,342
so she doesn't do online banking.
She likes to read all the policy terms.

556
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,803
She becomes level-headed
every time she goes to the bank.

557
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,096
It's awkward, isn't it?

558
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,807
And she does
all kinds of stuff in the car.

559
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,810
When she was a rookie actress,
she had to wait 24 hours in a car.

560
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:49,355
After she became popular,
she had a lot of schedules outside Seoul.

561
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:50,731
But why would she show it all to me?

562
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,568
-Because she likes it.
-Me?

563
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,320
No. That there will be
a documentary about her.

564
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:57,655
I see.

565
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,492
She's really interesting.

566
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,419
What's going on?
I called you in to help me with something,

567
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,046
but it seems like I'll be the one
helping you with your problems.

568
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,384
Well... Hypothetically speaking,

569
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,553
let's say you have a male friend.

570
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,806
I mean, he's just a friend
whom you care about.

571
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:27,518
He has a girlfriend.
And you happened to see her

572
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,021
with another guy.

573
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:32,064
They held hands and kissed each other.

574
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,320
And...

575
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:42,366
They even went to
a five-star subway station together.

576
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,330
Would you tell your male friend

577
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:50,750
about what you saw or not?
And why is that?

578
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,544
I guess the male friend is Jae-hun.

579
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,172
-Did you see that too?
-No way.

580
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,257
Ms. Lee.

581
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,885
Please don't tell him.

582
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:03,054
Please don't tell Jae-hun about it.

583
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,597
Is it your concern?

584
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,515
Yes.

585
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,727
You already said the answer
to the problem yourself.

586
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,437
What? Did I?

587
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,439
You should never tell him.

588
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,444
I see.

589
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,826
Wait. Like I just said...

590
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,787
Yes?

591
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,331
I'm the one who called you in to help me.

592
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,667
Oh, I'm sorry.

593
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,460
I'm at work right now.

594
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,546
So I'll keep this short.

595
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,925
Ms. Hwang, I want you to get promoted.

596
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,635
What?

597
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,264
Is it like a mission?

598
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,431
It's a notification.

599
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,433
I want you to be in charge

600
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,143
of production as the general manager.

601
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,021
Me in charge of production?

602
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,733
Are you talking about producing?

603
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,528
I've been only in marketing
for eight years.

604
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:04,991
To tell you a known fact,
I can't find anyone else

605
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:08,744
who is more committed and understands
the industry better than you.

606
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,579
And to tell you a hidden fact,

607
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:13,207
I failed to scout a competent producer

608
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,334
who is capable of leading a team.

609
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,671
I got it.

610
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:23,134
Hey, I'm making a big announcement.

611
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,678
I want you to make the proper reaction.

612
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,349
Hey. That's not proper at all.

613
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,476
Gosh, this is crazy.

614
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,103
My goodness.

615
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:42,653
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations!

616
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,449
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

617
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,785
-Buy us a meal.
-Treat us big.

618
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,163
-Buy us a meal.
-Go ahead.

619
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,081
-Beef barbecue!
-That sounds so nice.

620
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,709
-I know this great barbecue place.
-Where?

621
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,297
-To the general manager.
-To the general manager.

622
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,433
What is she doing?

623
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,353
Hey, stop it. That's enough.

624
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,219
Let's have lunch together at my place.

625
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,652
Here.

626
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,282
Did you not go to work?
The presentation is today.

627
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,909
I couldn't make it
as I was too busy working on it. Gosh.

628
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,453
Why are you shaking your hands?

629
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,163
I worked out for three hours.

630
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,873
You don't seem like a man who works out.

631
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,040
I do on a day like this.

632
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,420
Do you know what kind of people
we will be dealing with today?

633
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,257
Our superiors.

634
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,426
People show their true colors

635
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,386
once they go up high and have power.

636
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,139
And the true colors
that our superiors have shown

637
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,474
are known to be very nasty.

638
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,642
I guess it's like a competition
against other companies

639
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,269
where they compete who's worse.

640
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,354
If I don't want to lose against them,

641
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,398
I have to stay strong.

642
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,111
Is staying strong something
that you can achieve in just one day?

643
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:30,946
It's about my attitude.

644
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm strong.

645
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,411
It's not like I strengthened my body.
I just trained my heart

646
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,330
so I can believe in myself.

647
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,081
And I should have
a substantial meal like this.

648
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:44,084
Let's eat. I made it myself.

649
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,630
It's milky-white.

650
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,758
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy it.

651
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,260
This is nice.

652
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,806
Hello. Please come in.

653
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,267
I didn't know you were here too.

654
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,685
Yes. This is our first shooting.

655
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,231
This is the director of photography.
He'll be shooting for us.

656
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,899
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

657
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,067
Please come on in.

658
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,404
She just took a shower.
She will come out soon,

659
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,241
looking as natural as can be...

660
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,213
Well... She said she was going to.

661
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,758
She might have a different idea.

662
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,470
This might seem natural
based on a different perspective.

663
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,020
So this is my fault, right?

664
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,606
Yes.

665
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,400
I'll go get changed.

666
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,611
Thank you.

667
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:55,573
She's nice though.

668
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,700
So-min.

669
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,786
No changing into Dress Number Two
or Dress Number Three, okay?

670
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,280
Don't be nervous.

671
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:39,491
What are you talking about?
I'm not nervous.

672
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:43,829
I saw you taking a relaxing pill earlier.

673
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,541
I forgot to take my vitamins,
so I took it instead.

674
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,210
What are you talking about?
Who would do that?

675
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,462
Will you stay quiet?

676
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,714
You're the one who started talking.

677
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,401
Let me begin.

678
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:18,113
THINGS WILL BE FINE ONCE YOU TURN THIRTY

679
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,242
"Things Will Be Fine
Once You Turn Thirty."

680
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,203
I'm...

681
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:27,748
Thirty-five, but I'm not fine.

682
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,130
That was a dad joke,

683
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:38,550
which is also the male weapon...
I mean, the main weapon of this drama.

684
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,143
Now.

685
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,146
The intention of this project.

686
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,689
INTENTION OF PROJECT

687
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:57,277
You can read it.

688
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,205
Fonts...

689
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:11,166
Hamchorong Batang.

690
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,255
This is a dad joke,

691
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:20,426
which is also the maim weapon...
I mean, the main weapon of this drama.

692
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,470
Like this.

693
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,058
It's spine-chilling.

694
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,603
The unexpected clumsy charm

695
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,398
of the famous drama director
stabs me in the heart.

696
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:37,734
So the synopsis of our drama...

697
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,113
is on the screen.

698
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,449
SYNOPSIS

699
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:00,924
All right.

700
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,594
-Wait.
-Yes?

701
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,013
-I didn't finish it yet.
-Me too.

702
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,474
Okay. I'm sorry.

703
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,354
Where were you?

704
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,691
-The one right there.
-Did you read this?

705
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,526
The one before that.

706
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,363
Oh, right. That one.

707
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:28,911
I guess you have poor eyesight.

708
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:32,581
If you can't see well,
you may come forward to read it.

709
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,254
They are falling for it.

710
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,341
He's turning normal people into fools.

711
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,384
Just what level is he on?

712
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,346
He's breaking down the wall
which is impervious to reason

713
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,472
with his vibe.

714
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:52,935
The vibe of an idiot.

715
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,271
So the synopsis of our drama
is on the screen.

716
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,482
And...

717
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,613
Read it. Just go ahead and read it.

718
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,118
As you can see, this drama is

719
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:14,289
about the ordinary love life and career
of three women in their 30s.

720
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,334
I mean, the love life and career
of three ordinary women.

721
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,671
-And as a woman...
-That's right.

722
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:23,131
Hang on. Something's missing here.

723
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,218
Who are you asking right now?

724
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,136
Something's missing.

725
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,183
Oh, right. It's "social".

726
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,434
Right here,

727
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,103
there's a word missing.

728
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,607
It's supposed to be
"the social anxiety of women".

729
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:42,651
That's the phrase.

730
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:47,739
No one knew it.
Don't confess it, you idiot.

731
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:50,617
Is her drama going well?

732
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,871
I heard the presentation is today.
I'm sure it will go well.

733
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,498
The director is doing it.

734
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,834
-So the director is famous, right?
-Is he famous?

735
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,837
-He made a lot of famous dramas.
-Like what?

736
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,423
My Father-in-Law in His Puberty,
Flirtatious Husband,

737
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:05,799
and What's Wrong with Mr. Kim.

738
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,093
-Are they fun?
-I didn't watch them.

739
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,138
-Are they fun?
-I don't know any of them.

740
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,225
He's not famous.

741
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,609
It won't be easy to make a miniseries

742
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,028
with new stories for each episode.

743
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,323
As you can see from the synopsis,

744
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,284
we already have enough stories
to make 16 episodes.

745
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,245
We also have some extra stories
for replacement in case they are not fun.

746
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,040
If we get favorable reviews,
we can also consider

747
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,625
making a sequel.

748
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,586
I believe that's the biggest advantage
of this drama.

749
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,756
A drama is supposed to make viewers
curious about the next episode.

750
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,216
It's not a 20-minute-long sitcom
that airs 5 days a week.

751
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,510
The viewers should wait five days
for the next episode.

752
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,473
But this is a drama where viewers can skip
one episode without being curious.

753
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,392
Aren't you worried about that?

754
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,019
The beauty of dramas lies in the reruns.

755
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,729
They can watch reruns...

756
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,776
It's just like fishing.

757
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,153
It stimulates viewers' curiosity

758
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,447
and makes them wait for the next episode.

759
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:14,201
The goal of our drama is somewhat similar,
but a little different.

760
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:17,245
It's not just about a bait,
but about empathy and sympathy.

761
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,122
And the power of characters.

762
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,042
I think the characters have power
that's strong enough

763
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:24,294
to make viewers curious about people,
not just a situation.

764
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,088
Do you think they have the power?

765
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,674
Don't you think it's too focused on women?

766
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,386
I guess you're right.
Female characters aren't strong enough.

767
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,179
Ms. Lim,

768
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,889
are you strong?

769
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:37,724
Me?

770
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,602
Yes. You.

771
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,647
Are you talking about physical strength?

772
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,780
What does my physical strength
have to do with this meeting?

773
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,573
Making drama requires a lot of strength.

774
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,284
As far as I know, there are
a lot of female drama writers.

775
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,745
Writers are strong, that's true.

776
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:01,998
I'm not sure about physical strength,
but they sure are strong-minded.

777
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,919
I guess you're really something else, too.

778
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,680
-I see.
-Sir.

779
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,475
-Let's talk about the drama.
-I'm doing it.

780
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:25,105
What about it? It only features women.

781
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,732
There's no Prince Charming?

782
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,152
And it's not sophisticated.
Who likes unsophisticated women?

783
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,530
Are you talking
about the characters or the script?

784
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:36,032
We're the ones
who should be asking questions.

785
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,076
This isn't where you can

786
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,870
answer questions with questions.

787
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:43,123
This is why he said
writers are strong-minded.

788
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,959
You should be flexible.
I mean, you're a rookie.

789
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,420
I mean, you can't lead the whole thing
on your own.

790
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,297
Making a drama isn't that easy.

791
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,177
I'm not here to talk about how hard it is

792
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,678
to make a drama...

793
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,312
Why should a rookie be flexible?

794
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,522
Then should all veterans be stubborn?

795
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,483
Is that their secret

796
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,234
to making dramas full of clichés?

797
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,821
Why do you keep talking
about how strong women are

798
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,782
and how female writers are strong-minded?

799
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,660
Are you here as a manager
because you're not strong enough?

800
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,289
Is that why you never
carry a single cooler on a picnic

801
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,583
as you sit in the shade
munching on a piece of watermelon?

802
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,711
Are you envious because she's weak?

803
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,838
That's enough. I'm fine.

804
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:34,508
This is an important meeting.

805
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,594
Why do you keep making
such anachronistic remarks here?

806
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,180
If this is what you are up to,

807
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:43,183
I can't ask Ms. Lim Jin-joo
who's sitting right here

808
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:45,143
to work with me on this channel.

809
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,645
-I'd rather not do it.
-Stop it.

810
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:50,273
-This is just embarrassing.
-Hey. Stop it.

811
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,399
I'm Son Beom-su.

812
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:55,362
-Do you hear yourself?
-Okay. Mr. Son, that's enough.

813
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,531
Okay. I'll stop.

814
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,785
For the past five years,
I've worked hard without taking a day off

815
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,538
to make dramas with high viewing rates
for this channel.

816
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,748
And what I get back is this humiliation?

817
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,794
Fine. Let me describe her
with the words you guys can understand.

818
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,171
Did you just ask her if she's strong?

819
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,007
-She's freaking strong.
-Hey.

820
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:18,802
She downs 12 glasses
of draft beer in one sitting.

821
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:20,053
-Hey.
-She prefers soju with beer.

822
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:21,263
She starts making soju bombs.

823
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,764
Twelve glasses of beer

824
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,599
were just to warm her up.

825
00:52:24,724 --> 00:52:26,726
She eats a lot of side dishes as well.

826
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,313
It is so much
that you guys can't even digest in a day.

827
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:33,275
And you know what?
Even after drinking all that,

828
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,527
she finishes her script
before the deadline.

829
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,946
People have eyebags,
and they're usually dark.

830
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,531
But not her. Look at her.

831
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,866
Below her eyes,

832
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:42,450
she has oysters.

833
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,163
That's how hard she works.

834
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,833
Is she strong-minded? Yes, she is.

835
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,835
Whenever I criticize her script,

836
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,547
I hear voices out of nowhere,
like "You son of a bitch."

837
00:52:56,298 --> 00:52:58,174
"You stupid jerk," or something like that.

838
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,886
So I go "What was that?
Where is it coming from?"

839
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,722
But there are just the two of us there.
"What was that?"

840
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,599
-"Is it you, Dad?"
-Dad...

841
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,894
-"Is this Interstellar?"
-I watched Interstellar.

842
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,770
"What? Where is it coming from?"
So I turn to her,

843
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,648
and I find that it was
the voice inside her heart.

844
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,152
I could actually hear

845
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:19,070
what she was thinking to herself.

846
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,197
What about it?
Is there something wrong with that?

847
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,618
Why are you guys being like this?

848
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,578
Did you watch Interstellar?

849
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,996
"Dad, don't go."

850
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,088
It worked.

851
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:40,592
I did it. It really worked.

852
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,302
Beom-su!

853
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,554
Mr. Son.

854
00:53:45,263 --> 00:53:47,307
-Mr. Son!
-Beom-su!

855
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:48,850
-Beom-su.
-Mr. Son, breathe.

856
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,894
Mr. Son! Breathe.

857
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:53,021
Mr. Son. Mr. Son!

858
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,029
You said you're good at it.

859
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,074
It turns out I'm not.

860
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,201
Was it your first time?

861
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,453
It was my first time
to do it with your script.

862
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,205
I see. It's my fault.

863
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,666
Right. Your script has a lot of problems.

864
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,502
-You're bringing this up now?
-And that's what I like about it.

865
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,964
Listen. A drama is...

866
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,886
a made-up story. It's like a cool lie.

867
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:28,264
A lie that's cool? How hard is that?

868
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,308
Writers manage to do such hard work.

869
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,436
But their output ends up
suffering an indignity here.

870
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,606
They are under a lot of pressure
of ratings and competition.

871
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:40,318
They have to win in order to survive.
And it makes them

872
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,446
stick with some basic formula
from successful dramas.

873
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,491
Most dramas stick with the formula.

874
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:49,369
So I don't have to lie to them
for those dramas.

875
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,037
The script itself is a cool lie already.

876
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:52,789
But your script isn't like that.

877
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,333
It's not cool.

878
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:56,960
Continue.

879
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,797
You're not pressured to win,
and you don't stick with the formula.

880
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,800
You just spit out what you want to say.

881
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,052
For a drama that doesn't lie like this,

882
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:08,930
I have to lie to them.

883
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,765
I should spice things up.

884
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:13,351
Spice things up? Like you deceive them?

885
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,728
You know it.

886
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,939
A lie that will confuse them.

887
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,442
In order to communicate
with the public in our own way,

888
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,485
we have to deceive them first.

889
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,071
It sounds like

890
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,408
you're saying our drama will fail.

891
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,247
It won't be easy, but it'll be fun.

892
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:36,583
That's what an adventure is like.

893
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,502
Let's do this.

894
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,131
You've come up with a good excuse.

895
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:47,927
My neck hurts.

896
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:01,566
I did have a substantial meal,
but I guess the presentation wore me out.

897
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,693
Let's go eat.

898
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,906
I'm not sure if I deserve to eat.

899
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,950
It's not like you need
qualifications to eat.

900
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,412
I just had some old-fashioned thought

901
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,373
that I wouldn't if I had some conscience.

902
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,293
Then let's eat something cheap.

903
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,338
Like a rice ball
from the convenience store?

904
00:56:26,424 --> 00:56:27,842
Today, I feel like

905
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,428
I became an office worker

906
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,306
and got harshly criticized by my boss.

907
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,893
So we should go to a tent bar
and have some noodles.

908
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,939
It fits the mood quite nicely.

909
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,489
I feel better now.

910
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,866
It does make me feel good.

911
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:55,411
If we drink some soju with it,
we might feel like we won.

912
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,330
-We can do that.
-Share a bottle?

913
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,874
-No. One for each.
-Okay.

914
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,460
Excuse me. A bottle of soju, please.

915
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,795
Two bottles.

916
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:06,089
Let's order one at a time.
It gets lukewarm.

917
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,216
It's cooler if we drink
one bottle for ourselves.

918
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,927
-That's not cool at all.
-Thank you.

919
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,843
What? What did you say?

920
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,929
What? Nothing. I just laughed.

921
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,475
You laughed.

922
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,896
Did you see Ha-yun a few days ago?

923
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:04,772
Did Ms. Lee tell you that?

924
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,734
She said she saw you. Your eyes met.

925
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,486
Who said that? Ha-yun?

926
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,697
Yes. Her cousin came to Korea
from the States.

927
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,324
So she treated him to a barbecue

928
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:17,577
and brought him to a club.
She even got him a hotel room.

929
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,998
I thought you'd be

930
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:25,251
looking like this for days.

931
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:26,961
So I didn't tell you.

932
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,506
And I guess I was right.

933
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,592
I'm sorry.

934
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,137
Don't be.

935
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,640
What?

936
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,189
Thank you.

937
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,234
Thank you so much.

938
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,405
Thank you.

939
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:58,034
It feels so vain.

940
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,869
This isn't a crazy soap opera.

941
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,412
It's just a good thing.

942
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,624
Right. Han-ju has
gone through a hard time.

943
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,627
Now that I feel relieved,
I have a good appetite.

944
00:59:07,752 --> 00:59:08,586
Stop eating.

945
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,672
You'll get fat and end up
screaming at the innocent scale.

946
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:13,841
Keep eating. I locked up the scale
so it won't come outside.

947
00:59:14,008 --> 00:59:15,134
Thank you.

948
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,679
I still can't imagine

949
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,722
what I would have done
if she was really cheating.

950
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:20,890
That's enough.

951
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,810
Why would you even care
so much? That's enough.

952
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,565
Why? You don't like tteokbokki.

953
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,653
How can you not like tteokbokki?
How is it possible?

954
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:37,574
When she was a kid, she was eating
tteokbokki in front of school.

955
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,992
And a boy who liked her

956
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,327
pushed her from behind to pull a prank.

957
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:43,246
So did you get scalded or something?

958
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:44,581
Tteokbokki came out of her nose.

959
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:45,999
My gosh.

960
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:48,543
The hot and spicy sauce
and slippery rice cake

961
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,003
came out of my nostrils.

962
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,380
I still remember how it felt.

963
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,632
I wasn't human at that moment.

964
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:57,427
I started to relate to monsters
in monster movies ever since.

965
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:00,638
And I can still distinguish
Chinese chili and Korean chili by smell.

966
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,558
Why did you not tell me
about such a painful past?

967
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,726
But actually,

968
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,437
the main reason I came to hate it

969
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:09,314
is Kim Hwan-dong.

970
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,191
Hwan-dong liked to eat tteokbokki.

971
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:18,448
That day when we broke up,

972
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:23,494
someone I know told me
she saw him coming out of a motel.

973
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,330
Oh, right.

974
01:00:26,497 --> 01:00:28,416
That's what happened.

975
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,793
Two nights ago,

976
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,297
my friend saw you...

977
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,549
at a motel.

978
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:41,804
Do you have anything to say?

979
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,807
Actually, I knew it wasn't true.

980
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,395
But that wasn't important.

981
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,772
No.

982
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,442
There can't be only one reason
for a breakup.

983
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,778
It's not like I loved him
for only one reason.

984
01:00:57,195 --> 01:01:00,573
What if you loved him only for one reason?

985
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,410
It would've been for one of these reasons.

986
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:09,207
One, curiosity about something
that will disappear so soon.

987
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,252
Or two, an approach with impure intention.

988
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,297
I don't know.

989
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:19,926
Anyway, love is like
the consumables of a car.

990
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,970
If it's not used up,
the car keeps running.

991
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:24,972
If it's used up, it stops running.

992
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:39,987
Did you eat?

993
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,198
A few days ago,

994
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,493
when I didn't come home,

995
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,749
I was with a guy.

996
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,629
I guess I was drunk.

997
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,426
I saw your colleague there.

998
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,346
I thought I should tell you first.

999
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,685
Jae-hun.

1000
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,438
I'm sorry.

1001
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:17,066
I don't know why I'm being like this.

1002
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:18,985
-Get out.
-Jae-hun.

1003
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,236
Get out.

1004
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,530
You're just a piece of trash.

1005
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,577
Jae-hun, I'm sorry.

1006
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,787
I'm so sorry.

1007
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,789
I don't want to break up with you.

1008
01:02:31,873 --> 01:02:34,292
I said get out. Get out of here!

1009
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,342
Thank you.

1010
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:46,721
Thank you so much.

1011
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,020
For what?

1012
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,357
I don't know. I'm just grateful.

1013
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,568
I'm thankful to her cousin.

1014
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,280
I'm hungry. Do you want to have dinner?

1015
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:06,240
No, I have a plan.

1016
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,409
Okay. See you then.

1017
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:05,466
ONE DAY, WE CAME TO BELIEVE
THAT FIGHTS WOULDN'T LEAD TO A BREAKUP

1018
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,051
THE BELIEF PUT US AT EASE

1019
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,845
AND, IRONICALLY, BEING AT EASE MADE US

1020
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,557
NOT TOLERATE EACH OTHER'S DIFFERENCES
LIKE WE USED TO DO IN THE BEGINNING

1021
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:15,810
I'M JUST JEALOUS

1022
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:18,646
OF WHAT?

1023
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,232
SHE'S CONFIDENT ENOUGH

1024
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:23,401
TO DO SUCH AN IMMATURE THING

1025
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,735
WITHOUT RESERVE

1026
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:28,322
I WANT TO THRIVE SO I CAN DO
ANY IMMATURE THING I WANT

1027
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,367
ANYWAY, LOVE IS LIKE
THE CONSUMABLES OF A CAR

1028
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,952
IF IT'S NOT USED UP, THE CAR KEEPS RUNNING

1029
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,121
IF IT'S USED UP, IT STOPS RUNNING

1030
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,667
A grown man and a woman
alone in an empty house?

1031
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:42,086
Why are you doing this to me?
You're being too nice.

1032
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:43,963
You know we should find
a production company, right?

1033
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,381
Let's talk about it.

1034
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,801
You must be In-guk.
I've heard so much about you.

1035
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,637
Where are you going?
I just want to talk to you.

1036
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:52,972
Don't go.

1037
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,932
I'm worried nothing will happen.

1038
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:57,894
You used to treat me
politely all the time.

1039
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,147
I feel like I'll be
in a romantic relationship with you.

1040
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,940
I feel like a cool general manager.

1041
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,692
Let's go out then.

1042
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,320
Too straightforward. It's dangerous.

1043
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,572
So-min seems comfortable
when she's around you.

1044
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:11,365
She hates you, but likes you.

1045
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,701
Once you get used to liking someone,

1046
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:15,328
you tend to gaze on the person.

1047
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,580
And you'd make jokes like a kid
to laugh together.

1048
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:20,082
I've grown attached to you. That's it.

1049
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:25,963
